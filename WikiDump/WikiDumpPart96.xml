      <text xml:space="preserve">This page needs a lot of work; i have answered every syllabus statement, and am going to go over things; e.g. F.1.1 Archaea and Eukaryota should be used; The distinguishing between the 3 domains is overly complicated, wrong in certain parts. I am sorry for having replaced/altered answers, but some things were overly complicated (e.g. F.4.3) and some were very poorly explained (e.g. F.2.5). I also added syllabus notation to clarify the syllabus statements. And finally, there seems to be no differentiation between the command terms; e.g. 'outline' is supposed to be a simple statement of causes; 'distinguish' merely comparing and contrasting; 'evaluate' means state pros and cons. Several things are superfluous knowledge, and the study guide should be as brief as possible.

A proper diagram of the nitrogen cycle (F.2.2) is needed, however, I simply have no idea how to put up a proper diagram, nor is it easy to find an IB-specific diagram online.

I hope everyone likes these changes, feel free to edit my posts and let's make this option study guide a very simple and helpful tool for IB students! :)

Should we try to give a few examples of things; e.g. the pandemic question.</text>

&lt;big&gt; Hyla fermoralis&lt;/big&gt;

[[Media:[[:http://www.learnnc.org/lp/multimedia/3572
:]]


'''One of nine species of tree frogs indigenous to Florida''' (Bartlett and Bartlett)

 

=='''Classification:'''==
               '''Kingdom:''' Animalia
               '''Phylum:''' Chordata
               '''Subphylum:''' Vertebata
               '''Class:''' Amphibia
               '''Order:''' Anura (tailless)
               '''Family:''' Hylidae (16 species) 
               '''Genus:''' Hyla
               '''Species:''' femoralisa

----


='''Charateristic:'''=


'''Size:''' Typically these frogs are slender and range from 1 to 1.5 inches long (Johnson). However the female can be a little larger up to 1.75 inches (Bartlett and Bartlett)
 
'''Color:''' Varies from reddish to gray and even green they tend to have chameleon like color changes to blend in with their background (Bartlett and Bartlett)  When found on barks of trees they have a dark chocolate appearance with darker blotches that enhance the camouflage effect (Carmicheal and Williams). At rest on a leaf the tree frog appears green with a golden hue that displays the dark bands decorating their skin (Carmicheal and Williams). They can be found blending in to the trunks of trees in the everglades.

'''Markings:''' The distinctive patterns of the Pinewood tree frog include a dark lateral line on both the sides that begins in the nostril area thru the eyes curving down to tympanum all the way to the posterior(Bartlett and Bartlett). (Field Guide) The best way to distinguish this tree frog from others is to note the small yellowish spots located on the underside of the inner thigh (Bartlett and Bartlett).

'''Physical Features:''' The toes of the Pinewood tree frog are very arboreal without webbing that allows the frog to climb trees (Paulson). Resting this tree frog is generally found on vegetation near the ground however with its’ specialized toes can climb up to thirty feet within trees (Cowley) 
          The tympanum or the ear of a pinewood tree frog is an exposed large circle behind the eye (Bartlett and Bartlett). With the inner ear highly developed from its’ ancestors this species can hear the calls of their mates from relatively far distances (Carmicheal and Williams). 
          A big difference between the males and females of the pinewood frog is that males have a dark throat with rounded subgular vocal sacs that are not present in the females (Bartlett and Bartlett).
         Although all frogs do not have the ability to turn their heads they have highly developed peripheral vision (Cowley). The design of the modern amphibian head is highly developed from the ancient ancestor the labyrinthodont amphibian (Barghusen and Hopson).

'''Distinctive Call:''' Sometimes described as Morse code series of dots and dashes similar to SOS (Johnson)  &lt;USGS frog call look up &gt; The faster moving sounds of dots and dashes are the call for a mate, while a slower sounding call heard on treetops is said to be the call for rain (Bartlett and Bartlett) Tree frogs similar to other toads and frogs hold their nostrils and mouth closed and shunted air moves rapidly between lungs and vocals sacs (Carmicheal and Williams). This sac is an inflatable membrane just below the throat and acts as a resonating chamber to amplify their unique sounds (Carmicheal and Williams). 

 
'''Chemical Transport:''' The inefficiency of amphibians’ lungs requires the exchange of gases through their moist skin (Carmicheal and Williams). More gas exchange between air and the blood stream also takes place in the mouth lining and through their smooth lungs (Brow). This helps recycle air and it is easier than taking breathes (Carmicheal and Williams). A “forced pump” extremely similar to lungfish suggest, “that in the change from aquatic to aerial respiration the machinery was already available” only a few changes in the adaptation process allowed amphibians access to terrestrial life (Lawson). 
                   The pump works in four steps: 
                         1. The throat moves down and draws in air through nostrils. 
                         2. Nostrils close, as the throat moves up and force air
                            into the lungs
                         3. The throat again moves down and air moves out of lungs. 
                         4. Finally the nostrils open up the throat move up and the air
                            forced out of lung (Brow)

='''Ecology and Life History:'''=

'''Fitness:''' Ranked by the IUCN Red List Category the Pinewoods tree frog is a species of “LC” or least concern (Frost, IUCN - Conservation International, and NatureServe). They are considered stable or “within the =/- 10% fluctuation in population range” (Frost, IUCN - Conservation International, and NatureServe).

'''Reproduction:''' The process begins with the male mounting the back of the female as she lays her eggs and he pours his sperm over them for fertilization and are secured in a pond or ditch (Wallace). Batches range from 20 to 100 gelatinous covered eggs (Bartlett and Bartlett). Laid during heavy rains in spring and summer in takes the egg, seven to ten weeks in larvae stage to develop into its' adult form (Carmicheal and Williams).

'''Hybridization:'''  Occurs naturally with Pine Barren and Gray tree frogs but mating calls become very difficult to distinguish between their voices, or becomes intermediate (Bartlett and Bartlett).

'''Metamorphism:''' During the seven to ten week period that the eggs change into tadpoles they do not have eyelids, use gills to breathe, posses tails and utilize scraping parts in their mouth for their herbivorous diets(Bartlett and Bartlett) For the most part they eat organic debris, some algae and plant tissue(Frost, Amphibian species of the world. A taxonomic and geographical reference). As the tadpole becomes an adult he must first develop organs such as lungs, a respiratory system, tougher skin, and eyelids, to keep maintain moisture and protect themselves for dry life on land (Paulson). His diet also begins to adapt to life on land. As this tree frog matures into an adult they prefer a more Invertivore diets, or they eat smaller invertebrates found in trees or on the ground (Frost, Amphibian species of the world. A taxonomic and geographical reference). 

'''Phenology:'''  The pinewood tree frog hibernates during the cool dry months of winter and leads a nocturnal lifestyle (Frost, Amphibian species of the world. A taxonomic and geographical reference). They are most active during the spring thru fall season and at night possibly to protect themselves for the warm tropical sun (Frost, Amphibian species of the world. A taxonomic and geographical reference)


='''Habitats:'''=

'''Description''' - In Kentucky they can be found in pine wood trees, within cypress tree environments, and often in roadside ditches. Although this species is often found in vegetation low to the ground it can also be located up to 30 feet high in the trees listed above. This particular frog loves to hide under or in rotting logs, stumps during the colder dryer season
	Florida’s damp upland hardwoods with an over story of oaks or magnolias and understory of American Holly and hophornbean are a perfect home for this amphibian (Bartlett and Bartlett). As well as the damp upland pinewoods which has the bionetwork of an over story with long leaf pines and understory of shrubby thick sometime grasses herbaceous growth (Bartlett and Bartlett). Each biosphere would also include a system of water within it for the tree frogs’ reproductive behavior. An ephemeral pond often poorly drained low laying and usually man made that fills during rainy season as well as drains during drought is a great place to lay their fertilized eggs (Bartlett and Bartlett). Or the more permanent ponds, containing some amounts of water year round even though the levels fluctuate with rainfall totals, will also allow the eggs to mature from tadpole to frog rather safely (Bartlett and Bartlett). These types of ponds are surrounded by shrubs lining the rim as other submerged vegetation grows under their shadows (Bartlett and Bartlett). The large trees allow the tree frog to climb upward to call for rain or possible predation avoidance. While the wet parts of these damp grounds create a good place for larvae development into swimming tadpoles and eventually tree climbing frogs. 

'''Distribution:''' 80,000 to 1,000,000 square miles of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains including Virginia and Louisiana reported to be common or abundant in Florida (Frost, IUCN - Conservation International, and NatureServe).  
	Even though the actual number of adult population is unknown it may well exceed 100,000 with the global trend to be stable to slightly declining (Frost, IUCN - Conservation International, and NatureServe). 
	The migration habits are normally local and commonly between breeding pools close to their terrestrial habitats (Frost, IUCN - Conservation International, and NatureServe). The exact distance this frog will migrate for breeding is unknown but it could be much further between ponds if civilization were not as disruptive with parking lots and land barriers. Barriers prohibiting longer migrations include major highways and other urban development deterrents (Frost, IUCN - Conservation International, and NatureServe).

='''Note about Species Discoveries'''=

Molecular genetics and intensified exploration especially in tropical areas has led to a significant increase in the numbers of identifiable species in amphibians (Kohler, Vieites and Bonett). At this point species identification has grown from 4533 in 1992 to 5723 by 2003, an increase of 26.3% in 11 years (Kohler, Vieites and Bonett). Even with new discoveries the truth is amphibian populations decline at 32.5 percent rate annually and are globally threatened (Kohler, Vieites and Bonett). This rate is more rapid than birds or any other mammal to date (Michelle S. Koo). Some experts name global warming and dry climates to the decrease in frog populations, while others suggest non-native species invasions or even a simple disease infecting these organisms (Michelle S. Koo). Nevertheless the affects of losing natures amphibians and bug catchers remains to be seen.

1. 5.00g of NaOH are dissolved to make 1.00L of solution.
:a) What is the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;?  (8x10-14 mol/L)

 K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] * [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]
 [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; / [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]

The concentration of anything is the amount per unit volume:

 [NaOH] = amount / volume

The amount of anything can be found from the mass and the molar mass:

 amount = mass / mass per mole (molar mass)

We know the mass and we can find the mass per mole, so substitute amount into the above equation:

 [NaOH] = amount / volume
 [NaOH] = ( mass / molar mass ) / volume
 [NaOH] = mass / ( volume * molar mass )

Since NaOH is a strong base, [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = [NaOH].

Substitute [NaOH] for [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] in the above [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] equation:

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cardiovasular System is the human body system where the heart pumps blood through the blood vessels all throughout the body. In the heart,there are 4 chambers: Left Ventricle, Right Ventricle, Left Atrium, and the Right Atrium. The two atriums get the blood first then, it's sent down to the two ventricles to be pumped out. The heart also has 4 valves: Pulmonary Valve, Tricuspid Valve, Aortic Valve, and the Mitral Valve.

''This tutorial was created with Blender v2.49''

To move around in your scene you have to be able to pan (move your viewpoint left/right/up/down), rotate and zoom. The easiest thing is to pan; we have to talk a bit about rotating and zooming. 


{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Stopping the animations:'''

If you find the animated images on this page distracting, press '''Esc''' to stop them.}}


== Perspective vs. orthographic view ==
[[File:Orthographic camera distance focal length.gif|thumb|300px|'''Image 1:''' From perspective to orthographic view]]
A [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Perspective Views|perspective view]] is an approximate representation, on a flat surface (such as a monitor), of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are drawn:
# Smaller as their distance from the observer increases
# Foreshortened: the size of an object's dimensions along the line of sight are relatively shorter than dimensions across the line of sight. 

In [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Orthographic Projections|orthographic view]] every line remains to scale. 

It is often easier to construct an object in orthographic view. If two objects are aligned in the 3D space, they are also aligned in the view port if you are in orthographic view. Objects of same size appear with the same size. The camera on the other hand renders by default in perspective view. 
 
* You switch between these two options with ''View-&gt;Orthographic'' or ''View-&gt;Perspective'', or by pressing '''NUM5'''.
If you're having trouble distinguishing between orthographic view and perspective view, you should activate  ''View Name'' in the ''User Preferences'' window in the section ''View &amp; Controls'' (see below how to do that).

{{clr}}

== Moving your viewpoint (Pan) ==
To move your viewpoint: 
* In the 3D view use '''Shift-MMB''' to move in the direction you want to go. MMB = middle mouse button.
* In the other windows '''MMB''' alone is sufficient to pan.

You will find some shortcuts to pan in the ''View'' menu of the 3D window.

== Rotate ==
Since rotating means rotating around something, you have to be aware about the something you rotate around. By default you rotate around the center of the 3D view. 

* To free-form rotate (any way), move the mouse while holding down '''MMB'''.
* To rotate around a vertical axis (sideways), leaving objects' vertical orientation unaltered, use '''NUM4''' and '''NUM6'''.
* To rotate around a horizontal axis (upward), leaving objects' horizontal orientation unaltered, use '''NUM8''' and '''NUM2'''.
Sometimes the center of the 3D view may be at a place where you don't expect it to be, because it is invisible, so rotating seems to get weird. Here the center of the 3D window is visualized with a black dot in the following images, but there is no visible marking in the 3D window itself.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Blender3D Rotating3DWindow-good.gif|thumb|300px|none|'''Image 2a:''' Easy rotation. The center of the 3D window (black dot) is in the center of the coordinate system.''']]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[File:Blender3D Rotating3DWindow-bad.gif|thumb|300px|none|'''Image 2b:''' Not so easy rotation. The center of the 3D window (black dot) might not be where you expect it.''']]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

In '''Img.&amp;nbsp;2a''' the center of the 3D window (black dot) is also the center of the coordinate system. Rotating is probably exactly like you would expect it. In '''Img.&amp;nbsp;2b''' the starting situation is exactly the same as in '''2a''', but the center of the 3D window lies behind the center of the coordinate system. You bring it back with the use of the 3D cursor.
* Set the cursor to your point of interest, and use ''View-&gt;Align View-&gt;Center View to Cursor'' or the keyboard shortcut '''C'''.  
* If you want to rotate around an object, select this object and press &lt;b&gt;NUM.&lt;/b&gt; (the period key on the num pad).

== Zoom ==
[[File:Blender3D Zooming3D.gif|thumb|300px|'''Image 3:''' Zooming in perspective mode]]
What you have learned for rotation also applies to zooming in the 3D window. Beginners often find themselves in a confusing situation:
# When you're in perspective mode you zoom to a point, i.e. the center of the 3D window. You won't move beyond this point, no matter what you do. Zooming only gets slower and slower and slower ... So if the center of the 3D window is somewhere where you don't expect it to be, zooming seems to be broken.
# In Orthographic-Mode you zoom as if you look through a camera and use the camera zoom. You can increase the visible image, but you don't change your point of view. So you always see the surface of the object next to you, you can't zoom through it.

So the same cure works for zooming as for rotating: set the 3D cursor to your region of interest or the object you want to zoom to, and press '''C'''.


You can also use Shift-B to zoom to a region (pans and zooms).

{{clr}}

== Standard views ==
[[File:Blender3D 4Views 3DWindow-2.49.png|thumb|600px|'''Image 4:''' Setting up the screen to show the four standard views]]
The standard views are accessible with shortcuts:
* '''NUM1:''' Front view. Z-Axis pointing upwards, X-Axis to the right.
* '''NUM7:''' Top view. X-Axis to the right, Y-Axis upwards.
* '''NUM3:''' Side view (right). 
* '''NUM0:''' Camera view.

Camera view is in perspective mode if the camera is rendering perspective (default), it's orthographic if the camera is rendering orthographic. 

You reverse the standard orientations Front/Top/Right with '''Ctrl''', viewing Back/Bottom/Left.

'''Ctrl-Alt-Num0''' sets the camera to the current viewpoint. 

{{clr}}

== Changing user preferences == 
[[File:Blender3d vor View.png|framed|none|'''Image 5:''' ''View and Controls'' preferences]] 
If you are a bit more accustomed to Blender, you may want to change some of your ''User Preferences''.

* ''View Name:'' Shows the name of the used view and whether you are in perspective or orthographic mode. This is a very useful option.
* ''Zoom to Mouse Position:'' Zooms to the mouse cursor and not to the center of the 3D view.
* ''Auto Perspective:'' Changes to orthographic mode if you use one of the standard views.
* ''Around Selection:'' Rotates the view around the current selection. The problem with this option is that you often don't want to rotate around the current selection, but don't want to give up the selection.
* ''View Rotation:'' Changes what type of rotation Blender will use. Trackball will enable view 'rolling,' yet the Turn Table setting disables it, allowing for easier orientation in most cases.

I've taken the explanation of perspective views from [[w:Perspective (graphical)|Wikipedia]]. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 14:16, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

== Repetition ==
This page seems to repeat what has been said on the previous once. [[Special:Contributions/83.100.203.15|83.100.203.15]] ([[User talk:83.100.203.15|talk]]) 23:41, 25 May 2009 (UTC)
: Yeah, there is some redundancy with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/The 3D Viewport Window]], I think the section needs to be reworked in total. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:54, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

: yes [[Special:Contributions/144.223.177.6|144.223.177.6]] ([[User talk:144.223.177.6|talk]]) 01:47, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

== Rotation ==
In the right animation showing a rotation (image 2b), the black dot is at the center of the coordinate system, which is NOT the center of the rotation. (212.27.60.48)
: In Image 2b the black dot is not in the center of the coordinate system. The black dot marks the center of the 3D window. The view does not rotate around that point though, instead it rotates around an axis running through that point. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 13:14, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

== Standards ==
This page uses three different methods to refer to a key on the number keypad: &quot;Num-5&quot; (Perspective vs. orthographic view section), &quot;NUM6&quot; (Rotate section) and &quot;Num 1&quot; (Standard views section). I believe this book is trying to converge on the &quot;NUM6&quot; standard...
: What do you like best? You're right, we should standardize that. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:54, 9 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Went mad [[Accounting]] created templates, check link to booksheld where I've moved them to -- Mig77 15:48, 16 February 2006 (SAST)
==Intro to CS course==

I see from your user page that you want to take a stab at the generalized intro to CS idea you had.  I'm not totally convinced that learning it without coding is the best way to do it (unless people were expected to take that class and a languae together, sort of like a lab section?  Hmmmmmm.), but I'm willing to be proven wrong.  I'm surrently writing the Intro to C book, and plan on possibly adapting that to other languages at some point.  If there's anything in it thats useful, feel free to grab it.  I'm not very far along yet, but hope to get some good work done soon, and start doing IRC lectures by the middle of next month.  Its good to see someone else interested in adding to the school, I think I've been the only active or semi-active contributor in the past 3-4 months.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 21:35, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
*I'm typing up the outline for the course right now, I should be done within a few minutes. [[User:Xerol|Xerol]] 21:37, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
*Ok, it's there now. To address the comments:
**I've decided to create it as a book rather than a course. (See [[User:Xerol/Intro to Programming|outline here]].) So, at the discretion of the people working on individual CS courses, they can add it as suggested or required reading. I think this would work out better in the long run. Of course, I wouldn't object to a course on it, but a course would probably work better at a ''higher'' level rather than a lower one - mostly as a discussion of theory. (I remember hearing something about an upper-level &quot;Special Topics&quot; course where the class as a whole created a language which had all the basic concepts.)
**Instead of wholesale 'grabbing' of content from other books I intend to either link to the books themselves or create unique examples. The layout will probably consist of pairs of pages - one page with text, another with numbered example groups that are referred to in the text. While this isn't as easy to navigate as a single page would be, it's a bit more streamlined in that it stays focused on the purpose of the book - to introduce the concepts of programming languages and not get stuck up on specific syntax.
**I just noticed Wikiversity a few days ago, and I figured it might be a more constructive use of my time than some of my other online exploits. My primary reason for being on WikiBooks is to further develop and expand the [[Accounting]] book (what was there previously wasn't very good from a learning perspective) for use in online tutoring of the subject. I was originally planning on starting my own guide on my own website, but thought I'd check out WB first to see if there was a good common reference, because the students I tutor are using a variety of different textbooks(although mostly different editions of one textbook) and it's difficult to explain examples when everyone is looking at different things. (Maybe this was a little tangential, I'm still working on my page though.) [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 02:08, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

== OCR ==

I was going to ask if you were the same Xerol from OCR, but then I saw your signature &quot;Xerol Oplan&quot;, and now I have no doubt. How have you been? I havent talked to you in quite some time now. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:27, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
*I thought your name looked familiar. I'm doing good, the company's taking off, business as usual. My AIM hasn't changed, hit me up sometime. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 06:04, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
::I've been without AIM since school started, because i'm too cheap to get internet access at my apartment, and the school computers never seem to have AIM installed (go figure). Over break though, i'll definately try to drop you a line. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:30, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

== Big thanks for helping out ==

I want to thank you for some of the effort that you have put into Wikibooks recently, including noting vandalism and copyright violations.  This is something that really makes our job as an administrator much easier to do.  Efforts like this will only help make Wikibooks into a much better project and something that deserves attention.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:12, 23 March 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks. I really would be more active around here if I had large amounts of free time like this more often (the last few days I've been getting over a rather nasty cold, and I was ahead on my classwork so I decided to catch up on some things around here). I should have some more time to do work closer to spring break (mid-April) and then a lot more once the semester's over (late May). [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 02:47, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:12, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Orphaned Modules ==

I have not exactly understood what the orphaned pages list is. I gather that it is a list of books with nothing more than the title page - am I right? Do you intend to keep lists of orphaned pages pertaining to a certain subject on the bookshelf of the subject?

As to the page [[A New Model of the Atom]], I haven't studied it in depth, but at first glance it seems to belong to &quot;Non-standard/controversial science&quot;. If it were ever expanded into a complete book, I would add it to a section like &quot;Popular Physics&quot; or &quot;Physics for laymen&quot; (I am not aware of Wikibooks' policy in this matter)

Thanks&lt;br /&gt;[[User:SPat|&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Pat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SPat|&lt;font face=&quot;italic&quot; color=&quot;black&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:36, 16 July 2008 (UTC)

:Orphaned pages (viewable at [[Special:LonelyPages]]) are pages which have no incoming links. Therefore they're almost completely inaccessible and regardless of how complete or useful the content is are never going to see any real development or even readers.

OpenBlocks : an extendable framework for graphical block programming systems
Graphical programming systems have been built to lower the threshold to programming for beginners. However, because these systems were designed to make programming more accessible to novices, they were developed with narrower intentions for their users and applications. For example, in StarLogo TNG, a graphical block programming environment, users may create games and simulations, but they cannot use this same system to create programs that can automate their computer processes, like the text-based scripting system AppleScript. Application developers can create their own programming systems, but doing so can take a significant amount of time to design and implement. This thesis describes an extendable framework called OpenBlocks that enables application developers to build and iterate their own graphical block programming systems by specifying a single XML file. Application developers can focus more on the design of their systems instead of all the details of implementation. The design and implementation of OpenBlocks are described, along with a user study conducted to test its usability and extendability.

Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and starLOGO (see discussion). It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple, powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by end-users that runs on many platforms, and it is free and open source. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles, presentations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet. It is multilingual, runs on more than 20 platforms bit-identically, and has been successfully used in the USA, Europe, South America (Brazil, Colombia, Argentina), Asia (Japan, Korea, India, Nepal), and elsewhere.

[[image:OLPC-TurtleArt.jpg|800px|]]{{clear}}
(http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Turtle_Art)
Turtle Art is an activity with a Logo-inspired graphical &quot;turtle&quot; that draws colorful art based on Scratch-like snap-together visual programming elements. It is intended to be a stepping stone to Logo, but there are many restrictions compared to Logo. (Only numeric global variables and stack items are available, no lists or other data-structures. The conditionals and some of the functions only take constants or variables, not expressions. Limited screen real-estate makes building large programs unfeasible.) However, you can export your Turtle Art creations to Berkeley Logo. Turtle Art also has a (limited) facility for sensor input, so, for example, you can move the Turtle based upon sound volume or pitch.

At this stage of human evolution, most of the human collectives were probably centered around family groups, hose size was intrinsically dependent on the size of the resources available and the effort required to gather them. This setup was both a biologic and &quot;economic&quot; imperative. Like many other social animals today territories were defended and prime resources fought over. The need to satisfy basic imperatives forced natures logic of the survival of the fittest, at best meetings between distinct groups would entail a large risk for conflict especially if level of competition was high due to demographic explosion (more resources, more people until equilibrium is reached) or natural events that impacted resources (drought) or health (virus).

The complexity of extending a these type of core collective into a small tribe required an huge leap in culture, an increase in the capacity of planning, of valuing knowledge and work and ultimately the ability of to communicate, that had so far been probably reduced to the basic needs. The coming together of these changes was a game changing in human history collaboration was now possible to overcome problems larger than those presented by daily life.

It is hard to determine what came first wood tools or stone.

In that humans started to make a clear utilitarian distinction between objects in regards to their intrinsic qualities.

== Prophets, demagogues, beliefs and figure heads ==
Perception is everything. One can not build an opinion about something that one does not know, that of course does not prevent one from having a view about something that its known but not understood. Most of us have a very limited knowledge base, and even more limited is the knowledge base that is created in first person, so the validity of much of what we think we know and take for granted, our intellectual scaffolding is indeed very flimsy and intrinsically dependent of the quality of the source.

***

When we considerer public visibility, we can see practical examples of how as a social mass often creates wrong perceptions, even makes assumptions about some of its members that are perceived as being granted deference or special attention. In fact most of the time the reason why the person is given difference and attention may not even be connected to the established public perception. Take for instance the scientist Steven Hawkins in the general public his importance to physics is extremely exacerbated when we compare it with the view of Steven Hawkins amongst its peers physicist.

There is also a tendency for generalization, that someone that excels in a field is automatically imbued with a general field of superiority and even his behavior should be exemplar. Most of the time things could not be more removed from reality, even if some of the individuals that are propped up into such leading roles will try to do their best to maintain those perceptions. We all ultimately seek to be special, to have influence, to be relevant.

== Neanderthals ==
Until very recently the Neanderthals were seen and portrayed as brutish and more animalistic version of our species, a dead end lower branch on our genealogical tree. A derivation emerged from the requirements of facing the effects of the Ice age over Europe. This imagine has suffered a drastic shift with the discovery that this branch is not as extinguished as we thought and that their mental capabilities were not as far from ours as we believed.

The environment that shaped Neanderthals was extremely harsh. Food scarcity, extreme cold forced individuals of a hunter-gatherer culture to become hardener, bigger and stronger with a general lifespan of 30 years. The Neanderthal was a short, wide and very muscular too user. Silex blades and wood spears permitted them to be confront larger pray, even fellow apex predators, like bears, requiring them not only to be strong, capable of [[w:Bench press|bench pressing]] 136 to 182 kilograms, but also very brave. They had fire, symbolism and art and some form of basic communication the language gene (FOXP2) is indeed present. Recent finds and detailed study indicate that Neanderthals were acute innovators, stone shaping technology seems to be even superior to those of homo-sapiens and Neanderthals may even be the first species to use an industrial process to produce a pitch (synthetic glue).

Statistical comparison of Neanderthal DNA with specific ethnic modern human DNA has provided an indication that interbreeding has occurred. European and Asian DNA shows a greater similitude with the Neanderthal DNA than African DNA.

== Defining State Governance ==
Since Government does not have competitors for you as a customer, you are forced to use, and required by law, to fund it.

Government is a intrinsic part of the state. One cannot exist without the other.

Government is only a requirement because states have to compete with other states. In this reality a state that employs more than half its population becomes a failed state.

The state is the taxpayer money in action.

Government manages public money, it should aim to be cost effective and not aim to generate profit in any of its activities. If an activity is lucrative it should be privatized and taxed.

In a government system that permits private enterprises to fund and lobby its policy makers, several functions of the state should never be privatized, especially the banking, military and prison systems. This is a perfect formula to get a totalitarian government.

Sometimes Government interference into markets is a requirement to implement the will of the people. For instance in the matters of slavery, child labor, false and misleading advertising, dangerous products (including drugs), nuclear bombs, stolen property, pornography (including child pornography), buying votes, emergency services, military, gambling, prostitution, extortion, blackmail, land rights and immigration.

The top most function of a government is to define, prioritize and address problems in regards to national interests. Rarely does a government truly works in this primary function, it normally dedicates exclusive attention to minimization of systemic and chronic problems and in serving their own interests, that consist in guaranteeing reelection, if not in the next turn, the one after.

A government only fails to be reelected under two circumstances, being more incompetent that expected or being forced to take drastic measures due to successive governance avoidance to deal with known issues. It is even, well funny, that when a nation faces war even if the governances is bad it has a high chance of reelection, especially if it can promote an image of strength (even if false).          

=== State control versus private ownership ===
The principal problem with state control is government corruption.

The principal problem of private ownership is resource waste.

The principal problem of privatization is its focus being on increasing revenue.

Slavery had long been practiced in Europe and the MidleEast before the exploration of the African continent and the discovery of the new world and the European exploitation of African people. Slavery, much it seems to the surprise of many in the US, is not restricted or dependent on racial traits.

If the intention is to be selective refer to it as African Slave Trade, and keep in mind that even before Europeans made a stride in Africa, slavery was already prevalent there, human labor was and will be always a resource and a trade commodity.

== Should we trust Government ==
&lt;center&gt;{{quotation|'''&quot;Taxes are the price we pay for civilization.&quot;'''|Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.}}&lt;/center&gt;

Government is the topmost institution of any nation and a fundamental part of the state, that is to say, a state is not defined only by its government and a nation is not indistinct from the its state.

The thing about any institution that one needs to always keep in mind is that their biggest and most important asset, is trust. The trust that people place on institutions is what enables them to function and is what prevents them from being substituted. A government, like any other institution, is also dependent on this rule.  

Trust is a characteristic of social relations there may be trust between people (or animals) but trust can not mean the same when used in context of a relation with a entity that does not share a sense of self, since the implications and requirements would not be the same. Thrust is a two way relationship, you may respect an institution but you should not trust it. 

If we look around the world we can safely state that all citizens are in a submissive situation in regards to their government, whatever type of government they have. This simple fact arises for the imparity in the relation, a citizen is a person while the government is not only several persons, but a collective formed around the purpose of guaranteeing the implementation of policies and laws, most of the governmental structures tend to form a hierarchy.

Most forms of governments is, in non-dictatorial regimes, is done by what is normally defined as public servants. This definition covers all functionaries of the state that are not directly dependent or elections for their functions and remain after shifts in the policy establishing organs. What is also known is that most positions of leadership regarding these public functionaries tends to be with increasingly frequency appointed by those in power, making it clear that today most public servants are not really oriented to serve the public's interest but to satisfy their hierarchic superiors. This is the other side of the reality is that one primary function of governments has clearly become that of looking after itself before looking after its citizens.

Due to our level of interconnection of knowledge, news and economic resources any significant event that seems random or unpredictable is no longer incidental but circumstantial and so predictable to a certain degree, if not outrightly planed to occur by some players on the power networks.  

=== Inalienable rights ===

==== Animal rights ====

==== Human rights ====
There are certain rights that all humans possess simply by being human...

===== Incumbent rights =====
There are certain rights that only a society can grant to its citizens and vice versa. These rights go beyond the inalienable rights, and are granted and recognized collectively as an obligation so that the society can function, these are especially important in relations between distinct societies.

=== Moving the goal posts ===
One of the powers a government has is the capability to produce and alter legislation, and establish policies.

As an examples, one of the claimed reasons that the USA and some other Western nations (not all), have difficulties dealing with most of the middle-east nations is the lack of democracy and the track record of respect for human rights. It then becomes paradoxical that they supported and still support much of those nations when it is on their economical interests. Even when there is a general election Palestine, they failed to support the recently elected government. So what is the standard ? We will how well that goes in Tunisia...

This type of hypocrisy gets even more blatant if we compare responses to situations like Libya or Syria and then compare it to Yemen, there the government is still supported by the same powers while killing unarmed protesters. 

In fact the only guide we are left are not the arguments against Islamism, lack of democratic representation or failure to protect human rights, but simply that those that do not advance those powers interest in the region will be enemies and will offer temporary protection to collaborators. This is a fact when we look at [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]], [[w:Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]] this is made even more clear on how the situation in Egypt developed in regards to the passing of power from [[w:Hosni Mubarak|Hosni Mubarak]] to the Military junta. Again we will still see how it goes...

==== Legal systems ====

=== Technically challenged ===
One of the major problems with most governmental bodies is that the representatives that get elected by popular vote are increasingly being selected not by their personal qualifications, past work or experience but by how good they can address and motivate the public, looks and apparency today have a higher degree of importance in governmental election than brains.

This of course does not need to be grave problem depending on how one's government is structured especially the final steps of the policy decision process, if a government permits, informs and lessens to the public opinion it could even be more representative, technology is probably moving to enable such types of governments. On the other side if the government leadership is seen as something as a figure head, a father/mother figure and the public treated like children, the lack of ability of those elected to exercise rational thinking and understand the complex world we life today will further move us into bad policies and instability, this can even be aggravated if they become exclusively dependent in non-elected bureaucrats for directions. Bureaucrats tend to be appointed and rarely because of qualifications but by the ability to fallow party lines, they also create a level of protection to the government leadership, since if the situation permits they will serve as a scapegoat to diffuse the situation.

=== Secrecy is a state cancer === 
Secrecy in the working of a state may be a necessity, but mostly only in matters of national security, because of global competition between nations. Like any decease or pathogen that attempts to compromise a system, secrecy may be kept in check by the existing checks if a government is healthy, but as soon as the working of the system starts to rely on secrecy for its survival the system can be determined to have entered into critical failure.

George W. Bush (and administration) lied to Congress and the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. On July 15 The House forwarded the resolution to the Judiciary Committee with a 238 to 180 vote.  That &quot;Bush&quot; lied about weapons of mass destruction and Iraq’s threat to the US is now beyond doubt. Former US federal prosecutor Elizabeth De La Vega documents the lies most thoroughly in her book U.S. Vs Bush, and numerous other researchers have verified Bush’s untrue statements.

A secret Justice Department memorandum from 2010, Obama administration, provided the justification for the operation involving the CIA, and military assets under CIA control for the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen in Yemen, despite an executive order banning assassinations, a federal law against murder, protections in the Bill of Rights and various strictures of the international laws of war.

Intellectual property has increasingly been raised in importance as a national and economical interest to be defended.

Most non profit oriented public interests and especially creative works under the public domain, rarely get any state defense, something that is the obligation of the government.

Today the patent system, especially when applied to software is a house of cards supported by the convenience of the major patent fillers. Note that a patent filler is not the same as an innovator or creator. This equates to a monopolistic tendency toward the creative market (to profit by generating new ideas), where all those patent fillers attempt to extend their patent portfolios and cross-license them in ways that protects their mutual interest and at the same time excludes any other player to enter in concurrence. It has come to a point that those involved have an hard time in initiating litigations because no one 
knows anymore what patents may be violated or survive in court, and so the arms race continues to extend the arsenal.

A system that was created to foster and protect innovators and at the same time document for the public their intellectual property creations has been subverted into something that prevents the participation of newcomers and ultimately permits price fixing.

One thing is generally agreed most &quot;easy&quot; inventions have already taken place, we have long ago passed from simple solutions to compounded or merged creations often appearing in the cusp on the discovery of new technologies that do in fact depend heavily in previous works. But relying in the existence of prior art discovery, that not only depends on the existing failing system of patent attribution and skewed legal system. It is difficult and becoming increasingly hard for any new innovator to use prior art to defend their freedom to create. An assessment from USA in 2012 estimates that the costs of hiring a patent consultant able to find the previous art and the attorneys willing to devote months if not years to the legal battle would cost between at its lowest assessment between  $500,000 to $1,000,000. This cost and the time it takes puts initiating such attempt outside of what is sustainable even to any small business, and creation becomes therefore a quick path for bankruptcy.

=== Innovation ===
Innovation does not happen in a vacuum.

&quot;The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests.&quot; - George Lucas in 1998 speech before Congress.

&quot;People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians,...&quot; - George Lucas in 1998 speech before Congress.

&quot;Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.&quot;  - George Lucas in 1998 speech before Congress.

Recent moves by the the US culminating in the [[w:Leahy-Smith America Invents Act|Leahy-Smith America Invents Act]], recently passed by an almost unprecedented super-majority, demonstrates that US legislators and political appointees are shifting away from protecting the rights from inventors towards the right of property of filers. This distinction is important because not all inventors can afford to fill a patent and so it favors larger firms with well-established internal patenting procedures. This erodes the capacity to invent of the common citizen.

The only true benefit of patents is that they document the specifics of innovations, and that aspect does not actually require any grant of exclusivity.

patents
*encourage innovation
It is a very strange belief that a bureaucracy will enforce the exclusive profit of singular entities within a society of billions of creative individuals.
*protect innovators - Any new product or innovation will have an army of lawyers descend to destroy it. Leading to patent portfolios of a handful of the biggest corporations. What about innovations that are developed independently but simultaneously? 

Examples of concurrent independent development abound. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all newyorker.com]: Calculus - Newton and Leibniz. Evolution - Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace. Oxygen - Carl Wilhelm and Joseph Priestley. Colour photos - Charles Cros and Louis du Hauron. Logarithms - John Napier, Henry Briggs, Joost Burgi. Sunspots - Fabricius, Galileo, Harriott, Scheiner. Piston engine plane - the Wright brothers and Santos Dumont. And so and so on.

Cross licensing escalates the problem by permitting the aggregation of interests in blocks, and so patents will only &quot;serve&quot; and &quot;protect&quot; closely connected groups- Where conflicting groups will be left with not choice to seek patent equilibrium to keep peace.

There is a clear distinction to be made about the moral implications in regards to the effective control citizens over their governments. In a totalitarian regime the blame should fall only on those that were responsible or aware of the actions, but at least in a democracy all citizens should have their share of the blame, since it was their obligation to question and establish controls that would prevent the facts.

== The UFO phenomena ==
{{Quotation|Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; truth isn't.|Mark Twain}}

=== Defining UFO ===
A UFO, meaning unidentified flying object, is just as it is labeled, any object that fails to get identified by an observer can properly be given this label. 

The label of UFO also does not restrict the object to a factual flying object, it only requires the appearance of movement or even hovering capacity. The definition is of course very broad, for instance there are reports of UFOs exiting or entering water and even outside of Earth's atmosphere.

Unidentified objects are the default state of every observed phenomena. As we take notice of things around us we automatically utilize our knowledge base and experience to provide an identity, a function, an explanation and assessment, for what we observe. Really abnormal, or rare, phenomena stands outside of this  methodology that our brain uses as a way to permit us to deal with the perceived reality we must function in. These types of phenomena will require verification of records, since rarity of the events will puts them outside of one or more lifetimes of the observer, preventing him to provide a valid identification or even to rely in others around him for it. New phenomenas on the other hand, will not be present on record, they will be truly new experiences, and so require the creation of valid documentation, as a way to share and validate what was observed and hopefully repetition, so science can provide an explanation to it. In this case providing only a untestable hypothesis will not suffice to declare the phenomena as identified, but can serve as a tentative response to inquiring minds and open the path for the application of the scientific method.

Other factors of providing valid identifications, is the effect of imagination and culture. These human capabilities will at times provide a framework to create a reasonable explanation to what is observed, at least one that satisfies the observer, but in fact may not reflect reality. This increases the problem on relying on others for a report of the observation as it increases error. This is especially true when dealing with unexplained and unexpected events, as this will be a point of collision, between the factual observer and someone that is only getting the report in second hand. The other side of the problem is that some observations of unexplained events can also be dismissed as explained even more so if the observer is unable to mentally deal with it or primed to label it in another way.

==== Do UFOs exist ? ====
Yes they do, always have and probably will always exists, there is no expectation that we will ever be able to explain all the phenomena that can happen in nature, even if we reduce the range to those that occur in the atmosphere that mimic flight, every new explained phenomena will undoubtedly open up the possibility for even more discoveries.

As man first looked into the vast skies all things seemed strange and fascinating, the moon and the starts could only be speculated about, even the other planets on our solar system have been first tentatively labeled as something else, even stars and over the ages a myriad of hypothesis where put forward to explain those direct observations.

The pertinence about UFOs todays is special in two fronts, first we can now fly and with flight we must be concerned with collisions and other atmospheric phenomena that can be dangerous to that activity. The second one is security, since the sky was until very recently the uppermost higher ground it permitted observation and even attacks on national interests, especially during the cold war, and with the development and testing of new spy and stealth technologies.

=== How far back in time do UFOs reports go? ===
The supernova [[w:SN 185|SN 185]] was observed in 185 CE, near the direction of [[w:Alpha Centauri|Alpha Centauri]], between the constellations [[w:Circinus|Circinus]] and [[w:Centaurus|Centaurus]], by Chinese astronomers, as reported in the ''[[w:Book of Later Han|Book of Later Han]]'', and was visible for eight months.

=== Attempts to study the phenomena ===
[[w:Project Blue Book]]

Until something is understood no valid response can be conceived.


'''Still, no real scientific scrutiny ?'''

Most Governments engage in misinformation and deception programs around UFO sightings, and the hierarchy gives clear directives for military personal to suppress information, even to government authorities. There is somewhat of a opening in South America, France, Belgium and United Kingdom in regards to access to civilian authorities and military reports.

==== Ufology ====
Ufology is an activity, a field of study, specifically of UFOs, not a science. In that pursuit of understanding UFOs many sciences are useful to Ufology, like Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, History, Mathematics or Psychology.

{{TODO|[[w:Ufology]]}}

===== There is no such thing as a professional Ufologist... =====

===== History =====
The observation and questioning about the nature of UFOs has certainly been persistent across human history. Most object in the skies have had at one time or another caused awe and even fear. Fear and curiosity are probably the most powerful motivators to the advancement of mankind.

To conquer fear we needed to understand (or at least justify) the nature of what we observed and with that create a feeling of control and predictability, allowing us to function amidst the unknown.

All unknown phenomena at first started to be categorized as mystical and secret, and ultimately adopted as the cornerstone or religions across the word. Only with the advent of philosophy and then astronomy, was it possible to provide some understanding about the planets and the working of our solar system, and even to create notions about the self and the meaning of life, mathematics on the other hand helped to provide a fixed and understandable model to reality, not only augmenting certainty but even to extrapolate the unobservable.

Only in recent times and with the decline of religion in the West did the more technological advancements permit to formulate the question about life elsewhere, something that strangely older and less technological advanced cultures did take for granted. With improved telescopes it was possible to observe even stranger phenomena, the observation of the channels in mars was probably the topmost promoter in the west that life could exist beyond earth this soon fallowed by the discovery of the radio, lead to the now anecdotic notion that Martians were attempting to communicate with us and so the speculation became common and with it not only rich fields for science but for literature and even new religions.

What was earlier seen as supernatural phenomena, the field of religions and Gods was now open to the recently acquired freedom to reason and express divergent views and even publish them, leading to the rise of science.

Today it is not uncommon to speculate that some UFOs have extraterrestrial origin, not because of the nature of the phenomena but because we already much of what normally occurs, somethings that would before been simply explained as a signal of Gods, angels and daemons require not an explanation based on faith but in science.

=== Reports ===
The increasing problem of the Media ridiculing any reported observation, especially if linked to aliens or extraterrestrials, generates a powerful motivation for self censure and ultimately suffering, not only for the witnesses themselves, but to the advance of science and general understanding of phenomena.

Even if we disregard that it would be on the government interest, from security to national interest perspective to obscure or suppress any information leaking to the public. The problem is that this hard censorship, that to be fair has been decreasing in recent years with more and more nations at least appearing to be more proactive on the subject, admitting not interest (UK,USA) or extreme interest (Brazil, France) in the phenomena, the trend still forces a soft censorship on society in general. Most people discussing the subject have an hard time being taken seriously. 

{{TODO|Mention the Phoenix lights the not so funny news conference and the regret and pressure put on the state government figure.}}

Most mass sightings, in regards to witnesses and objects seen, seemingly occur in waves.

When a population is kept in general state of ignorance, their judgment can more easily be controlled or even discarded as irrelevant without any internal opposition.

Any information is only valid if it is based in facts and any views expressed can be sourced, useful information is one that is relevant to the consumer, and not artificially artificially made relevant, to be transparent it must presents multiple view points and enables the viewer to make it own mind about those reelvant subjects.

{{TODO|Perception plus Reputation plus Recognition by Similitude equals Inference}}

=== Propaganda ===
One thing that anyone will understand as a given fact is that any war will be preceded and accompanied by a propaganda campaign, it is also expectable and an almost inevitability, that this campaigns will be even more utilized and effective, toward nations hose political systems depend on popular support.

{{quotation|'''&quot;...among the calamities of war may be jointly numbered the diminution of the love of truth, by the falsehoods which interest dictates and credulity encourages.&quot;'''|Samuel Johnson|The Idler, 11/11/1758}}

Propaganda by itself may not constitute a lie, but undoubtedly will only serve to promote the view or interests of the propagandist. 

An example of propaganda is the use of mass media to spread misinformation. This is done by governments and interest groups to promote their views to the public. In this instance simple disinformation becomes propaganda because it is backed up and promoted by the institutional powers as reality.

{{TODO|See [[Communication Theory/Propaganda and the Public]]}}

=== Disinformation ===
Disinformation can serve to propagate lies, misdirect, confuse or weaken opposing views. Consider the damage one can create to the discussion of a topic if one can direct the opposition toward topics that are easily refuted or make the portraying the opposing side stupid by defending those issues.

{{quotation|'''&quot;The daily press and the telegraph which in a moment spreads inventions over the whole world, fabricate more myths ... in a day than could have formerly been done in a century&quot;'''|Karl Marx|1871}}

Disinformation is closely related to the motivation why people lie and what is defined as the truth, most of the time the truth is not a static objective notion, and this makes it easier to shift viewpoints about what the reality really is.  As any illusionist knows the best way to hide something in plain sight is to distract the audience with something else.

There is an important distinction to keep in mind, lies came in a different shapes. From the simple omission of the truth (that often is not even recognized as a lie, as the intention to deceive can not be ascertained) to the direct contradiction of the truth. It can serve as protection, deterrent and even be half-truth or inexact truth (without getting deeply in what the truth is). What defines a lie as negative is that if it consist in suppressing information that others require to perform an informed decision, to be free to make their own choices.

In a perfect world there would not be any reason to lie and have secrets, but in a world that is imperfect and becoming increasingly transparent there are specific areas of information that do need protection. From personal information to information that simply could be used against you. One could say that there is no moral justification for a lie except as a way to diplomatically deny access to information that others have no reason to have. This same rational is not valid for secrets, since secrecy is the intentional suppression of information that others need, here the the moral balance is harder to ascertain and depends exclusively on the reason for secrecy being of self preservation. Secrets came from shame and fear, and often lead to escalation of distrust and greater entanglement. All dirty deeds prefer the darkness.         

Today disinformation is all around us, directed by those that control the media channels in order to advance their goals and reduce visibility of subjects that they would prefers not being public knowledge. Well made disinformation dissemination will avoid being too obvious (unless that also serves a purpose). One easy way to detect disinformation is to find reputable source for the information, and corroborating reports. This of course in turn leads to perpetrator of the deception to intentional shift of the efforts of disinformation from the real data to the data sources, in an attempt to discredit them. 

&lt;center&gt;{{quotation|'''&quot;We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false&quot;'''|William Casey - CIA Director during the Reagan's administration.}}&lt;/center&gt;

Recent events in Libya in 2011 for instance when relating the ware-abouts of Kadhafi suns or even statements statements regarding the progress of the rebels that can serve as a clear example how the progress, strengths and feats was being amplified, at the same time wile governments negated that on TV international forces where on the ground helping the rebels.

Another interesting case is the USA and UK media pressure and negativism regarding the euro currency. It is clearly unbalanced if you consider the origin and its interests and those countries national situations and the original sinners in this economic chaos. It would be expected that if someone should panicking it would be China since it has brought much of the euro debt and would suffer locally if the euro collapsed, to some degree China is strengthening its internal consumption, even creating internal imbalances. We could even argue that it would be in the national interests of the USA-UK coalition to have a fragile China and increase its dependency on them for exports. The paradox here is that the USA is also dependent on a strong Europe for trade (http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0003.html) and military support (NATO).

==== Censorship ====
Censorship is not only focused in hiding information from the targeted public, but can also consist creating artificial difficulties in accessing it. It is basically a suppression of information technique, that is also part of a process of disinformation, with a secondary result that it not only negates access to some information but promotes the value of the remaining information, solely by the fact that it is more accessible.

{{NOTE|It is also interesting to note that censorship not only generates technological issues by itself, even promoting failure and insecurity, but it also will produce general difficulties when interacting with technology that has not been created with censorship capabilities.}}

'''The Internet'''

The creation of the Internet has brought forth evidential prof of the efforts governments and commercial interests are willing to exert in the control of information. Control over access, movement and even creation of information in a distributed medium is something new and still evolving.

From simpler indexer, search engines have evolved beyond general information gatherers and portals into complex information channels, they now can monitor personal behaviors, location and interests, this shift for a personalized interaction arouse for the need to generate revenue, not by monetizing access but by the creation of indirect revenue streams. It started by simply permitting sites to get higher relevance to the addition of adds and now users have become also a commodity, where the data points they generate when interacting with the service is a valuable resource that others are willing to pay to have access.

Most government agencies that deal with security and crime have to provide evidences that they are effective as a justification to continue to exist, to validate their spendings and to obtain more funding. It becomes then a priority to guarantee results (especially directed to the metrics used in performance evaluation), maintain a sense of urgency and increase the importance to their field of action. This will most often lead to quantity, but not quality and also to the direct or indirect generation of a symbiotic interdependent relation between the agencies and the target of their action.

=== The equation ===
To some equations are like uncompromisable hieroglyphs, but at the core they are in fact non-abstractive works, that attempt to explain the universe we live in. There are in fact some equations that are more important than others, masterpieces that hold some of the foundations of our understanding of reality.

An equation is a mathematical statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, that is the right side of the equality must be the same as the left side of it. This not only requires that we understand and know the value of both sides but that these values must match.

There are many approaches to categorize the beauty of equations, the concept of beauty as always is on the eye of the beholder, in mathematical terms it is both of the beholder understanding or knowledge and the need to employ that same knowledge. So the mathematical beauty of equations can be a function of its usefulness, simplicity or even complexity, in this later cases much like a painting, we can marvel not only on what is represented but on the work done by its creator (in mathematical terms its discoverer).

'''Origins'''
{{TODO|Cover [[wikipedia:M-theory]]}}

=== Cultural background ===
There is an intrinsic need in human society to explain all the phenomenons we live surrounded by, that explanation needs to be only as good as we need need it to be, as technology and cultures evolve so does the need for depth and logic on what we cannot readily explain.

Folk tales and legends have been in several occasions proven to describe not only real events but to offer plausible explanations for the events to those lived near the time they occurred, this tales, that have been passed from generation to generations have been an immense repository of knowledge before the written word and after in a time were alphabetization was very low, and the practice is still relevant to some cultures from all around the world.

For a government to retain their authority and comply to their obligations to the citizen and to the preservation of the state, any acknowledgment of a power, especially of a technological nature, that is superior to them and outside of their control is an anathema.

==== United States of America ====
The Brookings Institution report from December 14, 1960, funded by the USA Federal Government states &quot;Earth's Civilization Might Topple if Faced by a Race of Superior Beings&quot;.

A federal law passed by congress in 1969 makes it illegal for any American to make contact with any extraterritorial, and defines the whoever willfully violates it should be fined by $5,000 or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both (1211.108 Violation).

Kramer, Ph.D. and Charles W. Bahme. J.D, published in 1992, Chapter 13 is dedicated to teaching techniques to communicate with aliens and deal with a crashed extraterrestrial craft.

=== Science ===

==== Scientific verification ====
To be possible to verify the existence of extra terrestrial life, there must be something that can be repeatedly observed by scientific methods and in a scientific setting. We can not forget that scientist are ultimately humans, prone to error and other human fragilities, repetition of the experience and equality in the findings is what validates a scientific discovery. Even more that an acceptance by its pears, reporting the exact findings on a correctly performed scientific investigation is how ultimately human knowledge evolves, even in fields that do not rely primarily in the scientific method. Those who succeed in adding new findings to the human knowledge are diffidently immortalized.

==== Abductions ====
There is also the issue that [[w:Hypnosis|hypnosis]] is used to recovered &quot;lost&quot; memories, the problem with using hypnosis in this tasks is that the operator (the hypnotist) can easily, even unwilling, direct the subject to create false memories or interpretation, under hypnosis memory is extremely fluid and missing details are often recreated by imagination, but nevertheless the sheer number of subjects with similar reports would still constitute a good indication of a repeated phenomenon. Purportedly abducteess, report that most abductions start in childhood and continue for many many years, even across generations.

Most people have had at least one experience of night-terrors, these are often presented as an explanation for the reports of the phenomenon or an entry point to the later recovering of &quot;lost&quot; memories, this can be a possible explanation to some cases, for instance per-technological societies labeled these cases incubus, sucubos and other types of mystical and fantastic creatures, it could be that today easy of access to information helps the subjects to report so cases, dialogs and settings that are extremely similar with each-other. But then we are faced with the case of reported medical anomalies and implants on these same subjects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">HTTP::Engine is made by Kazuhiro Osawa (yappo). It is an generalized interface for application developers that makes it easy to deploy under different kinds of server configurations, including CGI, FastCGI, mod_perl and standalone pure-Perl HTTP Server. It is not, however, a full-stack web application framework, but it'll be easy to write a framework based on it.

== One application core with multiple interfaces ==

For example, this is a little application just outputs &quot;Hello World&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;
# MyApp.pm
package MyApp;
use strict;
use warnings;

use HTTP::Engine::Response;

sub run {
  my ($class, $request) = @_;
  my $response = HTTP::Engine::Response-&gt;new;

  $response-&gt;body(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
  $response-&gt;status(200);

  return $response;
}

1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;run&lt;/tt&gt; method here takes an instance of &lt;tt&gt;HTTP::Engine::Request&lt;/tt&gt; as its input, and returns an &lt;tt&gt;HTTP::Engine::Response&lt;/tt&gt; object as its output. This sub-routine is the first-handler from HTTP server. In a more complex application, it usually just dispatches the real work to some other sub-routine based on the URI or parameters.

To deploy it as a CGI script, you then write an &quot;hello.cgi&quot; like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
use MyApp;
use HTTP::Engine;

HTTP::Engine-&gt;new(
    interface =&gt; {
        module =&gt; 'CGI',
        request_handler =&gt; sub {
            MyApp-&gt;run(@_);
        }
    }
)-&gt;run;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If someday, you need to deploy this application under mod_perl environment, you can just write a MyApp::ModPerl handler class with code like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
package MyApp::ModPerl;
use Any::Moose;
extends 'HTTP::Engine::Interface::ModPerl';

use MyApp;
use HTTP::Engine;

sub create_engine {
    my($class, $r, $context_key) = @_;

    HTTP::Engine-&gt;new(
        interface =&gt; {
            module =&gt; &quot;ModPerl&quot;,
            request_handler =&gt; sub {
                MyApp-&gt;run(@_);
            }
        }
    );
}

__PACKAGE__-&gt;meta-&gt;make_immutable;
no Any::Moose;
1;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Your core application code does not need to be modified, so long as you only use &lt;tt&gt;HTTP::Engine::*&lt;/tt&gt; classes to construct your response.

== Testing ==

You might question that why bother having an abstraction layer instead of just choose stick to a good deploy environment. One good answer is that might not be easy to test the app without this abstraction layer.

If your deployment configuration of choice is like mod_perl, then your test programs would need to start up an apache httpd with mod_perl.so loaded, and then try to hit it with maybe Test::WWW::Mechanize. That would work, too, but it's too troublesome.

HTTP::Engine comes with a specialized Test interface that makes this very easy. To test if our Hello world application works, you write a test program like this:


&lt;pre&gt;
# test.pl
use strict;
use warnings;

use Test::More tests =&gt; 1;

use MyApp;
use HTTP::Engine;
use HTTP::Request;
use HTTP::Response;

my $engine = HTTP::Engine-&gt;new(
    interface =&gt; {
        module =&gt; 'Test',
        request_handler =&gt; sub {
            return MyApp-&gt;run(@_);
        }
    }
);

my $response = $engine-&gt;run(
    HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; 'http://localhost/'),
    env =&gt; \%ENV,
    connection_info =&gt; {
        request_uri =&gt; &quot;/&quot;
    }
);

is($response-&gt;content, &quot;Hello World&quot;, &quot;The application does output Hello World!&quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you compared the construction statement of &lt;tt&gt;$engine&lt;/tt&gt; object, you will see the only difference is the &quot;module&quot; value. This &quot;Test&quot; module makes the &lt;tt&gt;$engine&lt;/tt&gt; object a totally mocked-up environment that basically just prepares every environment variables needed, and just execute your application code.

This makes it very lightweight and easy to run and write the test program. You can then write functional tests just like that way you write unit tests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gravitational potential is the gravitational potential energy given to objects per unit mass:

&lt;math&gt;V_{grav} = \frac{E_{grav}}{m} = \frac{-\frac{GMm}{r}}{m} = \frac{-GM}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

For short changes in distance ''&amp;Delta;h'' (''&amp;Delta;h'' &amp;lt;&amp;lt; ''r''), gravitational potential energy is given by:

&lt;math&gt;E_{grav} \approx mg\Delta h&lt;/math&gt;,

where 

&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{GM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So, for short changes of distance, gravitational potential is equal to ''g&amp;Delta;h''. Gravitational potential is measured in Jkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Equipotentials==
On a field diagram, lines can be drawn which, like contours on a map, show all the points which have the same gravitational potential. These lines are known as equipotentials. Equipotentials are always perpendicular to field lines, and get closer together as the field strength increases, and the density of field lines increases. Over short distances, equipotentials are evenly spaced.

==Summary of Gravity==
You should now know (if you did the gravity section in the right order) about four attributes of gravitational fields: force, field strength, potential energy and potential. These can be summarised by the following table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|align = &quot;center&quot;| '''Force'''

&lt;math&gt;F_{grav} = \frac{GMm}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|align = &quot;center&quot;| → ''integrate'' →

''with respect to r''
|align = &quot;center&quot;| '''Potential Energy'''

&lt;math&gt;E_{grav} = \frac{-GMm}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|align = &quot;center&quot; colspan = &quot;3&quot;| ↓ ''per. unit mass'' ↓
|-
|align = &quot;center&quot;| '''Field Strength'''

&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{GM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|align = &quot;center&quot;| → ''integrate'' → 

''with respect to r''
|align = &quot;center&quot;| '''Potential'''

&lt;math&gt;V_{grav} = \frac{-GM}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Questions==

G = 6.67 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

g = 9.81 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

1. What is the gravitational potential at the Earth's surface? (mass of Earth = 5.97 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg,radius of Earth = 6371 km)

2. Taking the Earth's surface as V&lt;sub&gt;grav&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, what is the gravitational potential 2m above the ground?

3. A 0.2kg firework reaches a gravitational potential relative to the ground of 500Jkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. If the firework is 30% efficient, how much energy was expended to get there?

4. Express gravitational potential in terms of gravitational force.

5. Draw the equipotentials and field lines surrounding the Earth.

g = 9.81 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''1. What is the gravitational potential at the Earth's surface? (mass of Earth = 5.97 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg,radius of Earth = 6371 km)'''

&lt;math&gt;V_{grav} = \frac{-GM}{r} = \frac{-6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.97 \times 10^{24}{ MJkg}^{-1}}{6371000} = 62.5\mbox{ MJkg}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. Taking the Earth's surface as V&lt;sub&gt;grav&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, what is the gravitational potential 2m above the ground?'''

&lt;math&gt;V_{grav} \approx g\Delta h = 9.81 \times 2 = 19.62\mbox{ Jkg}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. A 0.2kg firework reaches a gravitational potential relative to the ground of 500Jkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. If the firework is 30% efficient, how much energy was expended to get there?'''

&lt;math&gt;V_{grav} = \frac{E_{grav}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E_{grav} = mV_{grav} = 0.2 \times 500 = 100\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;

However, this is only 30% of the energy expended, so:

&lt;math&gt;E_{expended} = \frac{100}{0.3} \approx 333\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Express gravitational potential in terms of gravitational force.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Constitution of Japan}}
Japan is a Constitutional Monarchy.

==Preamble==

:We, the Japanese people, acting through our duly elected representatives in the National Diet, determined that '''we shall secure for ourselves and our posterity the fruits of peaceful cooperation with all nations and the blessings of liberty throughout this land''', and resolved that '''never again shall we be visited with the horrors of war through the action of government''', do proclaim that '''sovereign power resides with the people''' and do firmly establish this Constitution. Government is a sacred trust of the people, the authority for which is derived from the people, the powers of which are exercised by the representatives of the people, and the benefits of which are enjoyed by the people. This is a universal principle of mankind upon which this Constitution is founded. We reject and revoke all constitutions, laws ordinances, and rescripts in conflict herewith.

:We, the Japanese people, desire peace for all time and are deeply conscious of the high ideals controlling human relationship and we have determined to preserve our security and existence, trusting in the justice and faith of the peace-loving peoples of the world. We desire to occupy an honored place in an international society striving for the preservation of peace, and the banishment of tyranny and slavery, oppression and intolerance for all time from the earth. We recognize that all peoples of the world have the right to live in peace, free from fear and want.

:We believe that no nation is responsible to itself alone, but that laws of political morality are universal; and that obedience to such laws is incumbent upon all nations who would sustain their own sovereignty and justify their sovereign relationship with other nations.

:We, the Japanese people, pledge our national honor to accomplish these high ideals and purposes with all our resources. 

===Enumerated principles===

Japanese constitutional scholars generally recognize three core principles in the current constitution, which are declared in the first sentence of its preamble:

# '''Popular sovereignty''' - the notion that the people have the ultimate power to determine national policy (''sovereign power resides with the people'');
# '''Respect for fundamental human rights''' (''we shall secure for ourselves and our posterity the fruits of peaceful cooperation with all nations and the blessings of liberty throughout this land''); and
# '''Pacifism''' (''never again shall we be visited with the horrors of war through the action of government'') - primarily embodied in Article 9, which declares that &quot;the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation.&quot;

===Sovereignty===

The Preamble also sets forth two of the three pillars of Japanese sovereignty: '''popular sovereignty''' as described above, and '''independence from other nations''' (''laws of political morality are universal; [and] obedience to such laws is incumbent upon all nations who would sustain their own sovereignty and justify their sovereign relationship with other nations'').

The third key pillar of Japanese sovereignty, self-governance, is not enumerated in the Preamble. It appears in Article 41 of the Constitution (''The Diet shall be the highest organ of the state power, and shall be the sole law-making organ of the State''), and is further supported historically by two statements of the Allied powers which occupied Japan following World War II:

:The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine. (''Potsdam Declaration, 1945, Article 8'')

:The Allied Powers recognize the full sovereignty of the Japanese people over Japan and its territorial waters. (''Treaty of Peace with Japan, 1951, Article 1(b)'')

===Legal status===

The Preamble is universally viewed as having the force of law; however, it is generally viewed (although still disputed) that the Preamble cannot be the legal basis of an actual claim against the government.

==Human rights==
{{wikipedia|Human rights in Japan}}
The Constitution makes many provisions for the protection of human rights against interference from the state. Note that protection of rights between private actors is covered by the Civil Code and other statutes, and is not covered by the Constitution.

===Fundamental rights===

&quot;Fundamental rights&quot; are declared to be inviolate in two articles of the constitution:

:'''Article 11:''' The people shall not be prevented from enjoying any of the fundamental human rights. These fundamental human rights guaranteed to the people by this Constitution shall be conferred upon the people of this and future generations as eternal and inviolate rights.

:'''Article 97:''' The fundamental human rights by this Constitution guaranteed to the people of Japan are fruits of the age-old struggle of man to be free; they have survived the many exacting tests for durability and are conferred upon this and future generations in trust, to be held for all time inviolate.

The term &quot;the people&quot; in such passages is rendered in Japanese as 国民 (''kokumin'') or 日本国民 (''nippon kokumin''), often translated as &quot;nationals&quot; or &quot;nationals of Japan&quot; respectively. The Constitution defines this term as follows:

:'''Article 10:''' The conditions necessary for being a Japanese national shall be determined by law.

====The Emperor====

The Emperor is defined in Article 1 as &quot;the symbol of the State and the unity of the people, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power.&quot; Although the Emperor has fundamental human rights as a national of Japan, his rights are limited to the minimal extent necessary to ensure fulfillment of his functions under the Constitution and the law. The Emperor therefore has government-imposed restrictions on his ability to marry, own property, study and speak, above and beyond the restrictions permissible for ordinary citizens.

====Corporations====

Corporate bodies are also afforded fundamental human rights to the extent possible given their status as non-natural persons. Certain rights not afforded to corporations include social welfare rights, physical rights and the right to vote.

Corporations may also have their fundamental rights restricted in order to protect the fundamental rights of natural persons. The Supreme Court reached this decision in a 1996 ruling involving political donations by an association of tax attorneys. The Court ruled that because membership in the association was mandatory for all licensed tax attorneys, the association would violate its members' rights by levying membership dues to engage in political advocacy.

====Aliens====

Although the plain language of the Constitution restricts fundamental rights to &quot;nationals,&quot; the Supreme Court has held that aliens should enjoy all fundamental rights ''other than'' those which, by their very nature, should be restricted to the enjoyment of Japanese nationals. Among the latter rights are:

* The right to enter or re-enter Japan
* The right to engage in political advocacy
* The right to vote

While these rights are, in the Supreme Court's view, not guaranteed for aliens under the Constitution, the Diet is also not precluded from conferring (or repealing) any of these rights by statute. For instance, aliens are allowed to submit opinions in administrative reviews (Administrative Procedure Act, article 39).

===Restrictions on rights===

The Constitution contains two separate but inter-related restrictions on the exercise of human rights, providing that they must remain aligned with &quot;public welfare.&quot;

:'''Article 12:''' The freedoms and rights guaranteed to the people by this Constitution shall be maintained by the constant endeavor of the people, '''who shall refrain from any abuse of these freedoms and rights and shall always be responsible for utilizing them for the public welfare'''.

:'''Article 13:''' All of the people shall be respected as individuals. Their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness shall, '''to the extent that it does not interfere with the public welfare''', be the supreme consideration in legislation and in other governmental affairs.

====Prisoners' rights====

Two key cases have described the limitations of Article 13 in the context of prisons.

The first concerned the &quot;right to smoke,&quot; which the Supreme Court deemed a protected right under Article 13, but one that is not protected in any particular place or at any particular time. (Grand Bench, Sep 16 1970)

The second concerned the right to read newspapers. The Supreme Court deemed that this right may only be restricted when there is an appropriate risk of harm to the order of the facility, and only to the extent necessary and reasonable for preventing such harm. (Grand Bench, Jun 22 1983)

====Image rights====

It is a violation of Article 13 for a public official to photograph a person without their consent and without a valid reason. Photographing a person for the purpose of preserving evidence immediately following commission of a crime is protected so long as the photography does not exceed ordinarily permitted scope (Grand Bench, Dec 24 1969). Automatic speed-control photography on highways is also permitted in this context (Supreme Court, Feb 14 1986).

====Criminal records====

Publicizing criminal records has been the subject of two Supreme Court cases which held the practice unconstitutional.

====Medical decisions====

In a case where an individual refused a blood transfusion for religious reasons but was given a transfusion anyway, the decision to refuse the transfusion was upheld as a fundamental human right which must be observed under Article 13 (Supreme Court, Feb 29 2000).

====Personal information====

Article 13 also protects privacy rights regarding personal information. In a case where students attending a lecture were required to provide names, addresses and telephone numbers, and this information was disclosed to police without students' consent, the act was held unconstitutional as a violation of privacy rights (Supreme Court, Sep 12 2003).

===Equality===

:'''Article 14:''' All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin.&lt;br /&gt;2) Peers and peerage shall not be recognized.&lt;br /&gt;3) No privilege shall accompany any award of honor, decoration or any distinction, nor shall any such award be valid beyond the lifetime of the individual who now holds or hereafter may receive it.

====Family law====

Article 14 has been raised in two attempts to overturn purportedly discriminatory provisions in the Civil Code.

The first attempt concerned Article 900.4, which gave legitimate children a stronger preference in intestacy than illegitimate children. The Supreme Court held that there was a &quot;reasonable basis&quot; for this provision based on encouraging marriage and protecting the rights of illegitimate children, and upheld the provision as constitutional (Grand Bench, July 5 1995).

The second attempt concerned Article 733, which allows men to remarry immediately following the end of their marriage but imposes a waiting period on women in the same position. For similar reasons, the Supreme Court upheld this rule, citing the reasonable basis of avoiding paternity disputes and questions over father-child relations (Dec 5 1995).

Article 14 was eventually successfully used to overturn a provision in the Nationality Act concerning the illegitimate children of Japanese fathers. The Supreme Court held that the provision had a reasonable purpose, but that the provision exceeded a reasonable scope in light of that purpose, and therefore would lead to unreasonable discrimination (Grand Bench, Jun 4 2008).

====Local government====

Article 14 has also been used to challenge local legislation on grounds of regional discrimination. Because allowing local legislation implies acceptance of discrepancies in regional law, these discrepancies do not constitute violations of the general equality guarantee in Article 14 (Grand Bench, Oct 15 1958).

====Tax law====

Article 14 has also been used to challenge unequal treatment of income tax classifications (the so-called &quot;Salaryman Tax Case&quot;). In this case, the Supreme Court held that so long as such classifications are for a proper reason and are not clearly completely unreasonable to accomplish that reason, there is no violation of Article 14 (Grand Bench, March 27 1985).

====Private transactions====

The Civil Code contains a similar provision, Article 90, which prohibits discriminatory practices among private parties.

===Rights of thought===

====&quot;Thought and conscience&quot;====

:'''Article 19''': Freedom of thought and conscience shall not be violated.

The Supreme Court has not clearly defined the meaning of Article 19, but has issued several key precedents under this Article:

*'''Constitutionality of apology advertisements'''. When a court orders the newspaper publication of an apology advertisement, this does not violate the freedom of thought and conscience so long as it is expressing the simple apology of the defendant to the victims (Grand Bench, Jul 4 1956).
*'''Constitutionality of voter review of Supreme Court justices''' (Grand Bench, Feb 20 1952).
*'''Constitutionality of private employment decisions based on employee beliefs'''. Article 19 only binds the government and does not directly bind private parties in private transactions. Employers are also recognized to have the freedom to contract based on beliefs of their counterparty (Grand Bench, Dec 12 1971).

====Religion====

:'''Article 20''': Freedom of religion is guaranteed to all. No religious organization shall receive any privileges from the State, nor exercise any political authority.&lt;br /&gt;2) No person shall be compelled to take part in any religious acts, celebration, rite or practice.&lt;br /&gt;3) The State and its organs shall refrain from religious education or any other religious activity.

Key precedents under this Article include:

*'''Constitutionality of forced dissolution of a religious organization''' (Aum Shinrikyo case): In this case, a court was allowed to force the dissolution of a religious organization responsible for a 1995 chemical attack on the Tokyo subway. The Supreme Court upheld this verdict as it was &quot;necessary and unavoidable,&quot; even though it would harm the freedom of religion of Aum followers (Supreme Court, Jan 30 1996).
*'''Constitutionality of government-sponsored Shinto festivals'''. In its first major analysis of Article 20.3 (Grand Bench, Jul 13 1977), the Supreme Court adopted a multi-prong test which examines the following factors:
*#Location of the act
*#Whether an ordinary person would view the act as religious
*#Whether the motives and purpose of the act were religious
*#Effects of the act on ordinary people
*'''Unconstitutionality of government donations to shrines''', reached following the above analysis (Grand Bench, Apr 2 1997).

===Rights of expression===

:'''Article 21''': Freedom of assembly and association as well as speech, press and all other forms of expression are guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;2) No censorship shall be maintained, nor shall the secrecy of any means of communication be violated.

====Citizen-related precedents====
*Constitutionality of bill posting restrictions in public areas
*Constitutionality of note-taking restrictions in court
*Constitutionality of restricting political acts by public servants
*Constitutionality of restricting political acts by judges
*Constitutionality of restricting door-to-door political advocacy
*Constitutionality of Education Ministry review of textbooks

====Media-related precedents====
*Constitutionality of censorship to protect criminal defendants
*Constitutionality of press restrictions surrounding criminal trials
*No constitutional right to equal time
*'''Constitutionality of censoring pornography''': This is technically not construed as &quot;censorship&quot; under the Constitution because &quot;censorship&quot; refers only to the administrative restraint of expressions of thought.
*'''Limited constitutionality of court-ordered restraints on publication''': Although this is also not &quot;censorship&quot; because of its judicial source, it is unconstitutional in limited cases where opinions related to matters of public administration are being restrained. In the latter case, private reputational rights are superseded by public rights to information. ''However'', even court-ordered restraints on publication of such information can be constitutional if the information is clearly false, is clearly not being published for the public good, and would cause grave and irreparable harm to the subject if published (Grand Bench, Jun 11 1986).

===Economic rights===
====Location, occupation and movement====
:Article 22: Every person shall have freedom to choose and change his residence and to choose his occupation to the extent that it does not interfere with the public welfare.&lt;br /&gt;2) Freedom of all persons to move to a foreign country and to divest themselves of their nationality shall be inviolate.

Key precedents under this article include:

*Constitutionality of restricting public bathhouse locations
*Unconstitutionality of restricting drugstore locations
*Constitutionality of licensing retail market locations
*Constitutionality of restrictions on foreign travel

====Property====
:Article 29: The right to own or to hold property is inviolable.&lt;br /&gt;2) Property rights shall be defined by law, in conformity with the public welfare.&lt;br /&gt;3) Private property may be taken for public use upon just compensation therefor.

===Physical rights===

:Article 18: No person shall be held in bondage of any kind. Involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crime, is prohibited.

:Article 31: No person shall be deprived of life or liberty, nor shall any other criminal penalty be imposed, except according to procedure established by law.

:Article 33: No person shall be apprehended except upon warrant issued by a competent judicial officer which specifies the offense with which the person is charged, unless he is apprehended, the offense being committed.

:Article 34: No person shall be arrested or detained without being at once infomed of the charges against him or without the immediate privilege of counsel; nor shall he be detained without adequate cause; and upon demand of any person such cause must be immediately shown in open court in his presence and the presence of his counsel.

:Article 35: The right of all persons to be secure in their homes, papers and effects against entries, searches and seizures shall not be impaired except upon warrant issued for adequate cause and particularly describing the place to be searched and things to be seized, or except as provided by Article 33.&lt;br /&gt;2) Each search or seizure shall be made upon separate warrant issued by a competent judicial officer.

:Article 36: The infliction of torture by any public officer and cruel punishments are absolutely forbidden.

:Article 37: In all criminal cases the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal.&lt;br /&gt;2) He shall be permitted full opportunity to examine all witnesses, and he shall have the right of compulsory process for obtaining witnesses on his behalf at public expense.&lt;br /&gt;3) At all times the accused shall have the assistance of competent counsel who shall, if the accused is unable to secure the same by his own efforts, be assigned to his use by the State.

:Article 38: No person shall be compelled to testify against himself.&lt;br /&gt;2) Confession made under compulsion, torture or threat, or after prolonged arrest or detention shall not be admitted in evidence.&lt;br /&gt;3) No person shall be convicted or punished in cases where the only proof against him is his own confession.

:Article 39: No person shall be held criminally liable for an act which was lawful at the time it was committed, or of which he had been acquitted, nor shall he be placed in double jeopardy.

===Rights to petition===

:Article 16: Every person shall have the right of peaceful petition for the redress of damage, for the removal of public officials, for the enactment, repeal or amendment of laws, ordinances or regulations and for other matters; nor shall any person be in any way discriminated against for sponsoring such a petition.

:Article 17: Every person may sue for redress as provided by law from the State or a public entity, in case he has suffered damage through illegal act of any public official.

:Article 32: No person shall be denied the right of access to the courts.

:Article 40: Any person may, in case he is acquitted after he has been arrested or detained, sue the State for redress as provided for by law.

===Social welfare rights===

:Article 25: All people shall have the right to maintain the minimum standards of wholesome and cultured living.&lt;br /&gt;2) In all spheres of life, the State shall use its endeavors for the promotion and extension of social welfare and security, and of public health.

:Article 26: All people shall have the right to receive an equal education correspondent to their ability, as provided for by law.&lt;br /&gt;2) All people shall be obligated to have all boys and girls under their protection receive ordinary education as provided for by law. Such compulsory education shall be free.

:Article 27: All people shall have the right and the obligation to work.&lt;br /&gt;2) Standards for wages, hours, rest and other working conditions shall be fixed by law.&lt;br /&gt;3) Children shall not be exploited.

:Article 28: The right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed.

==Amendments==

:Article 96: Amendments to this Constitution shall be initiated by the Diet, through a concurring vote of two-thirds or more of all the members of each House and shall thereupon be submitted to the people for ratification, which shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast thereon, at a special referendum or at such election as the Diet shall specify.&lt;br /&gt;2) Amendments when so ratified shall immediately be promulgated by the Emperor in the name of the people, as an integral part of this Constitution.

==Ingredients==

* Rice
* Oil
* Red chillies
* Bengal gram
* Black gram
* Mustard seed
* Groundnuts
* Curry leaves
* Turmeric
* Tamarind or lemon juice
* Salt
* Jaggery

==Procedure==

* Cook the rice according to the instructions on the packet
* Heat the required quantity of oil to which add red chillies, Bengal gram, black gram, mustard seeds, groundnuts and don't forget curry leaves
* Add turmeric powder may be a little more will give you good color to the food
* After the added content is heated properly Add tamarind and/or lemon juice
* let the soup of tamrind boil till you get more viscous liquid
* Add salt to your taste.
* Also add little bit of jaggery. 
* Once the paste is ready spread the rice in a wide plate or steel basin the cooked rice shall be cooled and separated to grain level now you can mix your viscous liquid and mix properly.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: an uniform → a uniform using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Electrons have a finite charge, which is approximately 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C. This was first proven by Robert Millikan in 1909. Millikan sprayed drops of oil which were then charged (ionised) either by friction as they were sprayed, or with x-rays. They were then allowed to fall into a uniform electric field.

[[Image:Simplified_scheme_of_Millikan’s_oil-drop_experiment.png|right]]
Once in the uniform electric field, the strength of the field was adjusted in order to keep an oil drop stationary. This was done by hand, looking through a microscope. In a stationary position, the gravitational force and the electric force were balanced - there was no net force on the oil drop. So, at this point:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{qV}{d} = mg&lt;/math&gt;

The electric field strength was adjusted by changing the voltage between the two plates. The voltage at which the drops were stationary was measured. The charge on each drop was then calculated. Millikan found that these charges were all multiples of 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C, thus showing that the charge of each drop was made up of smaller charges with a charge of 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C.

==Questions==

h = 6.63 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; Js

c = 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

g = 9.81 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

1. Rearrange the formula above in terms of q.

2. The mass of an oil drop cannot be measured easily. Express the mass of an oil drop in terms of its radius r and its density &amp;rho;, and, by substitution, find a more useful formula for q.

3. An oil droplet of density 885kgm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; and radius 1&amp;mu;m is held stationary in between two plates which are 10cm apart. At what potential differences between the plates is this possible?

4. If the X-rays used to ionise the oil are of wavelength 1nm, how much energy do they give to the electrons? Why does this mean that the oil drops are ionised?

5. In reality, the oil drops are moving when they enter the uniform electric field. How can this be compensated for?

      <text xml:space="preserve">h = 6.63 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; Js

c = 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

g = 9.81 ms&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''1. Rearrange the formula above in terms of q.'''

&lt;math&gt;\frac{qV}{d} = mg&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;qV = mgd&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{mgd}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. The mass of an oil drop cannot be measured easily. Express the mass of an oil drop in terms of its radius r and its density &amp;rho;, and, by substitution, find a more useful formula for q.'''

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{m}{\mbox{Volume}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;m = \mbox{Volume} \times \rho&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that the oil drop is spherical:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Volume} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{4}{3}\rho \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q = \frac{4\pi \rho gdr^3}{3V}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. An oil droplet of density 885kgm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; and radius 1&amp;mu;m is held stationary in between two plates which are 10cm apart. At what potential differences between the plates is this possible?'''

q must be a multiple of e, the charge on an electron:

&lt;math&gt;q = ne&lt;/math&gt;, where n is an integer.

&lt;math&gt;ne = \frac{4\pi \rho gdr^3}{3V}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4\pi \rho gdr^3}{3ne} = \frac{4\pi \times 885 \times 9.81 \times 0.1 \times (10^{-6})^3}{3 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times n} = \frac{25.7}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, to find some actual values, take n = 1,2,3 ... , so V = 25.7V, 12.8V, 8.6V ...

'''4. If the X-rays used to ionise the oil are of wavelength 1nm, how much energy do they give to the electrons? Why does this mean that the oil drops are ionised?'''

&lt;math&gt;c = f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{c}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{10^{-9}} = 1.989 \times 10^{-16}\mbox{ J} = 1.24\mbox{ keV}&lt;/math&gt;

This provides the energy required for an electron to escape from its energy level, becoming unbound.

'''5. In reality, the oil drops are moving when they enter the uniform electric field. How can this be compensated for?'''

Either:

* Use a slightly stronger potential difference to slow the oil drop down, and then reduce the potential difference to keep the oil drop stationary.

* Measure the voltage required to keep the oil drop moving at a constant (terminal) velocity, using more sophisticated equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It takes energy to heat things up, since heat is work. If we heat a more massive thing up, it takes more work, because we have to give more particles, on average, an energy kT. Some substances require more work to heat up than others. This property is known as specific heat capacity. This gives us the formula:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = mc\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;,

where &amp;Delta;E is the work put in to heating something up (in J), m is the mass of the thing we are heating up (in kg), c is the specific heat capacity (in Jkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and &amp;Delta;&amp;theta; is the difference in temperature due to the work done on the substance (in degrees Celsius or Kelvin).

It should be noted that the specific heat capacity changes slightly with temperature, and more than slightly when the material changes state. A table of the specific heat capacities of various substances is given below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;

==Questions==

1. How much work would it take to heat 100kg of liquid water from 20°C to 36.8°C?

2. How much work would it take to heat a well-insulated room from 15°C to 21°C, if the room is a cube with side length 10m, and the density of the air is 1.2kgm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;?

3. A 10kg block of iron at 80°C is placed in the room above once it has reached 21°C. If the iron cools by 40°C, what is the new temperature of the room?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. How much work would it take to heat 100kg of liquid water from 20°C to 36.8°C?'''

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = mc \Delta \theta = 100 \times 4180 \times 16.8 = 7.022\mbox{ MJ}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. How much work would it take to heat a well-insulated room from 15°C to 21°C, if the room is a cube with side length 10m, and the density of the air is 1.2kgm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;?'''

&lt;math&gt;V = 10^3 = 1000\mbox{ m}^3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{m}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;m = V\rho = 1000 \times 1.2 = 1200\mbox{ kg}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = mc \Delta \theta = 1200 \times 1010 \times 6 = 7.272\mbox{ MJ}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. A 10kg block of iron at 80°C is placed in the room above once it has reached 21°C. If the iron cools by 40°C, what is the new temperature of the room?'''

Energy must be conserved, so:

&lt;math&gt;10 \times 450 \times 40 = 1200 \times 1010 \times \Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta = \frac{180000}{1212000} = 0.149&lt;/math&gt;°C

So, the new temperature of the room is 21.149°C.

&lt;code&gt;\edef &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; {&amp;lt;replacement-text&amp;gt;}&lt;/code&gt;

==Description==
&lt;code&gt;\edef&lt;/code&gt; is similar to [[TeX/def|\def]] in that it allows you to define new macros or replace an existing macro.  The significant defining difference between &lt;code&gt;\edef&lt;/code&gt; and [[TeX/def|\def]] is that &lt;code&gt;\edef&lt;/code&gt; expands macros at definition time, rather than saving them for later.  This difference allows &lt;code&gt;\edef&lt;/code&gt; to be used to append new information to a macro, for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\edef\@test{A}
\edef\@test{\@test B}
\edef\@test{\@test C}

\@test
&lt;/source&gt;
results in the output &quot;ABC&quot;.  Attempting to do this example with [[TeX/def|\def]] instead will result in the error &quot;TeX capacity exceeded, sorry&quot;.  This behavior can be useful in loops that compile a string of information, but do not end up outputting the information directly.

{{Recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]

This is a good snack to serve as an apetizer. You may use a lot of variations on this recipe. To make these, you will need:

*a deep [[Cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]]
*a [[Cookbook:spatula|spatula]]
*a plate
*at least 1 paper towel

==Ingredients==

*1 cup [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|Canola Oil]] or [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|Vegetable Oil]]
*1/4 tsp. [[Cookbook:Seasoned Salt|Seasoned Salt]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic Salt]], or [[Cookbook:Italian Seasoning|Italian Seasoning]]
*2+ Handfuls of Pretzels

==Procedure==

Fill a deep saucepan partially full of canola oil. Heat up the oil. Cover a paper towel with seasoning. The paper towel will help absorb moisture. Then set paper towel on a plate. After this, use a spatula to drop pretzels into oil. ''Only leave them in for 2-3 seconds.'' When taken out, lay all pretzels out on bed of seasoning to dry. The oil may be used for multiple batches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Limiting scope==
I would like to limit the scope of this category to books discussing open source, such as the &quot;FOSS ...&quot; books, [[Open Culture]], and [[FLOSS Concept Booklet]].  Otherwise it becomes very large due to the great number of programs that are open source.  I believe most people care about what an application does, not its licensing.  Thus I altered the description of the category and filed it under [[:Category:Computer software]] and not [[:Category:Computer software by type]]. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:54, 9 May 2009 (UTC)

: I believe people care about both. I think this category should be for software that is open source and Category:Open_source should be for books that are about the concepts of open source in general. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:17, 10 May 2009 (UTC)

:: I don't mind having two categories if you feel people might search for software on the basis of them being open source. I fear such a category might become large, but if there's a distinction between open source philosophy and software with two different categories, I have no objections.-- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:39, 10 May 2009 (UTC)

::: If the category becomes too large in the future, this category can always be further divided like &quot;Open source graphic software&quot;, &quot;Open source music software&quot;, etc. Right now I don't think there are enough books to worry about dividing this category further. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:18, 10 May 2009 (UTC)

== And what about Free Software? ==

As was [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html explained] by the FSF (and as could be seen by comparing the lists of [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html free software] and [http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical open source] licenses – check the OpenWatcom one, for instance), the notions of [[w:Free software|Free software]] and [[w:Open-source software|Open-source software]] are a bit different.

However, as these sets of software vastly overlap, I do not think it would be a good idea to create one category for each of them.  However, it may make sense to rename ''this'' category using an all-encompassing term, such as, for instance, [[w:Free and open-source software|Free and open-source software.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">	
== Introduction ==

The Cottonmouth snake (Agkistrodon piscivorus ) is found near bodies of water all over the Southeastern United States. It is best known for the white lining of its mouth, which it exposes when threatened. They are the world’s only semi-aquatic vipers with the capacity to deliver a painful, if not fatal, bite (5). There are three subspecies of A. piscivorus; A. p. pscivorus, A. p. leucostoma, and A. p. conanti (1). Of these three subspecies, A. p. conanti is dominant in Florida. 



== Physical Characteristics ==
Cottonmouth snakes are usually 30 to 48 inches in length, but can reach lengths of up to 74 inches (3). Its body is a heavy, thick build and thins quickly at the tail. Color patterns range from black or gray to tan and yellowish. A series of dark cross bands run the length of the snake and can be either brown or black, but are typically reserved for the juveniles of the species. The pattern fades with age, leaving adult cottonmouth snakes with a uniform brown, gray or black coloring. The underbelly is usually pale or white (1). 
The snakes are a member of the vipiridae family, possessing hollow fangs to inject venom deep into its prey. It belongs to the subclass crotalinae, or pit-viper (1). Pit vipers have developed special organs found in pits, hence the name, located right behind the nostrils. These pits, covered with a temperature sensitive membrant, allow the cottonmouth to sense warm blooded animals. It is an adaptation which proves especially useful at night, when most cottonmouths prefer to hunt. Some cottonmouths may also use this adaptation to find cool places to escape inhospitable temperatures (6).

== Habitat ==
The geographic range of A. piscivorus differs among the subspecies of the snakes. A. p. piscivorus is dominant along the Atlantic coast, as far north as Southern Virginia. The smaller subspecies, A. p. leucostoma is found as far west as Texas and Oaklahoma and as far north as Southern Illinois. A. p. conanti, the Florida Cottonmouth dominates all of Florida (1).
The cottonmouth snake is most commonly found around swamps, lakes, slow moving streams, marshes and even drainage ditches. They are most active at night when they hunt, but will spend the early part of the day lying on a tree branch, basking in the sun. They are known to gather around dying water holes in order to feast on the trapped fish and frogs (1). 
The snakes are very strong swimmers, spending most of their time in the water. They have been known to enter the sea and successfully colonize offshore islands.  They occur in particularly large numbers on some of the islands on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Their success has much to do with their opportunistic feeding. 



== Feeding ==
The snake’s diet mainly consists of small mammals, birds, fish, frogs and tadpoles. Fish are caught by cornering them underwater. Contrary to popular belief, the cottonmouth snake has the ability to bite and deliver its venom underwater, making it a very effective hunter (1). 
Even though it has the ability to catch its own prey, the main reason the snake has become so successful is due to their opportunistic feeding habits, especially when colonizing offshore islands in the gulf. The snake will scavenge for food, seeking out carrion that washes up onto the shore, or detritus that falls from the nests of birds. Cottonmouth populations are reflected by bird populations of offshore islands, with the higher concentration of snakes existing where there is a higher concentration of birds   (bioone).
When attacking, the snake utilizes a hemotoxin which affects the blood and its ability to clot (6). The broken down blood cells travel to the heart and coagulate in the pulmonary artery. The pain is intense, and as blood cells begin to break down there is an immediate swelling and discoloration. Severe hemorrhage occurs at any point in contact with the venom (2). 
The venom is produced in glands near the back of the mouth, at the junction of the upper and lower jaws. As the snake strikes, the muscles around the venom glands contract and force the toxin out through the hollow teeth and into the prey. Whereas in normal conditions the venom supply of the cottonmouth is never fully depleted; full venom replacement can take up to three weeks (2). 



== Behavior ==
The snake has been given a bad reputation over the years as a very aggressive snake that will attack anything nearby. When tested to measure the different responses of the cottonmouth to encounters with humans, 23 of 45 (51%) tried to escape while 28 of 36 (78%) resorted to threat displays and other defensive tactics. It was only when they were picked up with a mechanical hand were they likely to bite (4). 
The characteristic threat display that has earned the cottonmouth its name includes throwing its head back with its jaws open to show the white lining of the mouth. The tail vibrates, much like other vipers like rattlesnakes, and the head and body are curled into an S-shape, appearing as though the snake is waiting to strike. The snake is most likely to stand its ground and resort to these most common threat displays which has often been mistaken for aggressive behavior (1). 
The cottonmouth can be active during the day or the night. Usually during the day, they are stretched out or coiled up in the shade. On cooler days they have been known to sun themselves on rocks, tree branches or logs lying close to shore. They are most active at night.
Northern species of A. piscivorus have been known to become inactive during the winter, however they are typically the last species to seek shelter. They do not enter full hibernation, though, as they are known to be very active upon discovery and will immediately try to burrow deeper or escape to nearby water. Shelter for the cottonmouth during these inactive periods usually consists of rotting trees, crayfish burrows or the burrows of other mammals – muskrat, beaver, etc. (4). 



== Reproduction and Growth ==
The cottonmouth snake is ovoviviparous, meaning they develop in eggs protected inside the mothers body until they hatch, or are about to hatch. This type of reproduction is found in many aquatic life forms. Nourishment is provided by the egg yolk instead of the mother; however the mother’s body does provide gas exchange (8).   In the case of the cottonmouth, the eggs hatch inside the mother and the young, typically 15 per litter, are birthed alive. There is typically one litter birthed every other year. 
Breeding occurs during the warmer months, and most births occur after a three month gestation period. However, differences in the physiology of the individual female snake cause the actual gestation period to vary from season to season (9). 
Cottonmouths are not known to give parental care after birth, however there have been cases reported of defensive behavior of a mother for her litter. One report details a female positioned at the mouth of a burrow surrounded by her young. When one of the young was moved a distance away from the mother, she became agitated and faced the intruder. Once the offspring was returned, she remained at the mouth of the burrow, ready to strike (1). 



== Natural Predators ==
The cottonmouth snake is preyed upon by larger organisms, including large birds, and other reptiles like the snapping turtle and American alligator. There have also been widespread reports of cannibalism by other cottonmouths (1).
Humans are also a threat to the cottonmouth. Seeing as it gained a reputation as a very aggressive snake, many people take it upon themselves to kill the cottonmouth, and even other snakes that resemble cottonmouths. The cottonmouth is listed as Least Concern (3). 


== Cladogram == 








Snakes in the genus Agkistrodon are closely related to those in the genus of Crotalus and Sistrurus. Agkistrodon and Sistrurus have nine large head plates, whereas Crotalus as well as all other vipers have a head covered in smaller scales. Both Crotalus and sistrurus have rattles on the end of their tails. Crotalus is best known as the rattlesnake. Sistrurus lives farther north in Canada and has a much smaller rattle (9)(10). 
What separates Agkistrodon is their adaptation to water. Neither Crotalus or Sistrurus have adapted to life in lakes or streams. In fact, Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnakes are known to inhabit dry, arid areas of the U.S.

When you press the preview button, you will get a preview of whatever you have got selected.  If you just want to see how one question will appear when published, click on that question in the left hand pane (1) and then click on the preview button (2).


[[File:QW3 Preview.jpg|center]]



Question Writer caches older previews of questions and quizzes separately - updating a preview of a question will not update the
preview of the whole quiz.

To preview the whole quiz, select the quiz by clicking on the green '''Quiz''' icon in the top left,(3) and then click preview.

Another point to note is that running the preview is not the same as publishing the quiz.  The preview will show you how the quiz will look when it is published, but in order for the quiz to be read and used by other people you will need to [[../../Save and Publish/Publish your Quiz|Publish your Quiz]].

==Use and Options==

===Use===
This template is intended to be a component for combination with '''Dropimage''' to make a new  drop-box template called '''DropLimit'''with an ''open-width'' limit.   The intention is to make the template have independently set ''initial'' and ''open'' widths in which blocks of unfomatted text can wrap.   Usually the ''open-width'' would be set by some box structure or ''pre'' tag set included in the contents; when there is no such content an ''open-width'' limit is needed to avoid wrapping within the too-narrow ''initial-width''.  

===Options===
;wlimit: the open limit width of the table, used to set the wrapping width of '''DropLimit'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prolog's default search algorithm is [[:w:Depth-first search|depth-first search]] (DFS), which is sometimes not convenient: DFS doesn't always find the solution for all problems, and when it does, it might not find the ''optimal'' solution.

Let's say we want to find the shortest path through a directed graph with nodes represented by symbols and arc by the predicate &lt;code&gt;arc/2&lt;/code&gt;. Then we can easily implement [[:w:Iterative deepening depth-first search|iterative deepening search]] to find the shortest path:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
path(X, Z, Path) :-
    length(Path, _),
    path_r(X, Z, Path).

path_r(Z, Z, []).
path_r(X, Z, [X|Path]) :-
    arc(X, Y),
    path(Y, Z, Path).
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;path/3&lt;/code&gt; backtracks over paths, ordered by length, if at least one path exists. Let's try it out:

&lt;source lang=&quot;prolog&quot;&gt;
?- path(a, g, P).
P = [a] ;
P = [a, b, f] ;
P = [a, c, d, f] ;
P = [a, b, c, d, f]
&lt;/source&gt;

How this works: when &lt;code&gt;length/2&lt;/code&gt; is called with a variable first argument, it generates a list of the desired length containing fresh variables. When, in addition, the second argument is a variable, it backtracks over all possible lengths starting at zero and stepping by one. The helper predicate &lt;code&gt;path_r&lt;/code&gt; is called each time with a fixed path length.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One demarcates questions in Klingon either by using the suffix ''' 'a' ''' or any of various &quot;question words&quot; (analagous to ''who'', ''when'', ''where'', etc.).

==Vocabulary==

'''Da'''- prefix: Subject ''you'' object ''it'', ''he'', or ''she''

'''qIp''': hit (v.)

'''ghoS''': approach (v.)

'''mang''': soldier (n.)

=='a'==

One uses this Type 9 verb suffix to ask about whether the subject of the sentence does the action to which ''' 'a' ''' is appended.

Example:

'''Dalegh'a' '''

''Do you see it?''

==Question words==

*'''chay'''
:''how''

*'''ghorgh'''
:''when''

*'''nuq'''
:''what''

*'''nuqDaq'''
:''where''

*'''qatlh'''
:''why''

*''' 'ar'''
:''how many'', ''how much''

*''' 'Iv'''
:''who''

The question words for ''what'', and ''who'' are used as either the subject or object in the sentence.  For example, ''' 'Iv qIp'''  means &quot;''It hits who?''&quot;   Convsersely, '''qIp 'Iv''' would mean &quot;''Who hits it?''&quot;.  

''' 'ar''' follows the noun that it refers too.  For example: ''' ghoS mang 'ar ''' means &quot;''How many soldiers approach?''&quot;

Other question words come at the start of the sentence.

Description:
The project will examine how young people interact the in Trafford Center nearby 
Manchester. On the basis of the specific history and social context of
the center we will thereby try to get a socio-spatial understanding of
the codexes and rules that is connected to the Trafford Center. With an
ethnographical view we will try to get an understanding of how the young
people interact and shape their own space within the center.

Problem statement:

How do young people shape their own space within the Trafford Center?

* How do they interact?
* Which cultures is represented?
* How often do these young people come here? From Where? And Why?

      <comment>moved [[XQuery/XSD to XML Sample]] to [[XQuery/XML Schema to Instance]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You would like to generate a sample XML instance from an XML Schema file (XSD). This is very useful for example if you would like to dynamically generate blank XForms instances for creating new documents from a schema.


== Method ==

[Note: See also the article [[XQuery/XQuery and XML Schema]] which has the same objective. If the author would like to contact me, I'm trying to get this code working to compare with the code I developed. 
[[User:ChrisWallace|ChrisWallace]] ([[User talk:ChrisWallace|talk]]) 15:09, 13 May 2009 (UTC)ChrisWallace]

Create an xquery function that reads in a URI to an XML Schema file (.xsd), along with a set of display parameters, and generates a sample XML instance. These parameters are:

#'''$schemaURI''' = the location of the .xsd file (e.g. db/cms/schemas/MySchema.xsd)
#'''$rootElementName''' = the root element for the sample XML file you wish to generate (i.e. doesn't have to be the root of the whole schema)
#'''$maxOccurances''' = for elements with a maxOccurs attribute greater than one, how many times should the element be repeated in the sample instance?
#'''$optionalElements''' = Should optional elements (i.e. minOccurs=&quot;0&quot;) be included? 'true' or 'false'
#'''$optionalAttributes''' = Should optional attributes (i.e. use=&quot;optional&quot;) be included? 'true' or 'false'
#'''$choiceStrategy''' = Where there is a choice between elements or groups of elements, should the sample include a random selection from the choices, or simply use the first choice? 'random' or 'first'

Call the function with the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
(:     Query which calls the function     :)

import module namespace content =&quot;/db/cms/modules/content&quot; at &quot;/db/cms/modules/content.xqm&quot;;

return
content:xsd-to-instance('/db/cms/content_types/schemas/Genericode.xsd','CodeList','1','true','true','random')
&lt;/source&gt;

== Notes ==
The function currently cannot dynamically set the namespaces in the sample instance. Any assistance in getting this to work would be much appreciated.  

The function requires that the xsd file use the xs namespace prefix (i.e. xs:element).  Attempts to use a wildcard prefix in the xpath statements did not work for some reason (i.e. $xsdFile/*:schema/*:element). An alternative approach is to determine the prefix, assign it to a variable and then concatenate it to all the xpath statements (e.g. $xsdFile/concat($prefix,':schema/',$prefix,'element') but that makes for some pretty ugly code. Another alternative is to use another function to reset whatever the xsd file prefix is to xs. This does work fine but adds a bit more code. Any more efficient alternative suggestions would be welcome.

The function uses two internal queries assigned to variables, $subElementsQuery and $attributesQuery, and then called using util:eval. This enables the recursive collection sub-elements and attributes without having to call an external function. These two queries could just has easily been declared as external functions.

== XSD to Instance Function ==


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
(:     Content Module     :)

module namespace content =&quot;/db/cms/modules/content&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare namespace util=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/util&quot;;

(: Function :)
declare function content:xsd-to-instance($schemaURI,$rootElementName,$maxOccurances,$optionalElements,$optionalAttributes,$choiceStrategy)

==Purpose==

[[File:Na 09 image.jpg|thumb|right]]
This guidebook is intended to help anyone who is entertaining the idea of applying, applying, has applied, participating, or has participated in the Language and Culture Assistant program in Spain. Currently much of the information will be geared towards those assistants from North America, but because this is a [[w:wiki|Wiki]], it is our hope that it will grow to serve those assistants from everywhere and become more informative over time and even multi-lingual.

This guidebook will not only help to prepare you for your eight month Spanish experience but will also give suggestions about traveling on a budget while in Europe, give advice and resources about teach and also learning one of the fifteen spoken or signed languages in Spain.

==Contribution and Updating==

In order for this to become the best resource to all future, present, and past Language and Culture Assistants, we will need you to contribute your wealth and knowledge from your personal experiences with the program.  The best way to contribute is to register a screen name on the [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] network ([http://www.wikibooks.com Wikibooks], [http://www.wikiversity.com Wikiversity], [http://www.wikipedia.com Wikipedia]) and to start [[w:Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|editing pages]]; correcting errors and updating information when needed to stay up-to-date.

==Program Overview &lt;ref&gt;All this information can be found by going to: [http://www.educacion.es/exterior/usa/en/programs/us_assistants/default.shtml# http://www.educacion.es/exterior/usa/en/programs/us_assistants/default.shtml#]&lt;/ref&gt;==

The Language and Culture Assistants Program gives the opportunity to anyone of American, Australian, Austrian, Belgian, British, Canadian, Chinese, Dutch, German, Italian, Irish, Luxembourgian, New Zealnd, or Portuguese nationality, to go to Spain for eight months and teach their own native language.

The Assistants will have the opportunity to learn about the Spanish language and culture and use their experience upon their return to their home country, thus developing cultural understanding between the citizens of Spain and the home countries.

The program provides Spanish students and teachers of English an opportunity to broaden and increase their knowledge of the English language and other cultures through interaction with native speakers.

The Autonomous Regions will assign all candidates, individually, to their city and elementary or secondary school.  One may not choose their city. The MEPSYD and some of the Regional Education Authorities will organize orientation seminars at the beginning of the school year.

===Qualified Candidates===

====North American Candidates====

In order to qualify to be a candidate to be awarded a grant to teach in Spain for eight months, North American candidates must hold a U.S. or Canadian passport. They must be either a junior or senior in a university undergraduate program or have already graduated with a B.A. or B.S. (it is not specified in what the degree has to be, though one in Spanish, linguistics, or a foreign language is maybe preferred). Apart from being a North American citizen and having pursued a university degree, candidates must be in good physical and mental health and have a functional level of Spanish. A functional level of Spanish is not really specified by the Ministry of Education but has been said by assistants that some people arrive in Spain with a very basic level of Spanish.

===Duties===


Grantees will work as English language assistant teachers, under the supervision and guidance of a classroom teacher in K-12 schools and Escuelas Oficiales de Idiomas (state-run language schools) throughout Spain. Grantees will teach 12-16 periods per week. Most assistants will work no more than 12 hours and will have up to three hours of prep time a week for their classes. The assistant and the classroom teacher (or the school representatives) may agree upon other activities and responsibilities in which they should be involved, including attending faculty meetings, making class presentations and participating in extra-curricular activities such as workshops, field trips, student exchanges, music and theater performances, or sports events.

===Conditions of the Grant===

If you are indeed awarded a grant to teach in Spain, you must accept the region that was given to you. If you would like to change regions you will have to wait the following year and apply again.  The grant is an eight month contract with the Ministry of Education which generally runs  from the beginning of October until the end of May. This past year, assistants working in the region of Madrid reported having a 9-month contract, from the beginning of October 2010 to the end of June 2011. 

Each assistant is paid at least €700.00 a month. No taxes are due because it is technically considered a grant for continuing education instead of income.  Assistants will hold a student visa.   Assistants in Madrid and Barcelona generally earn more (up to 1000 euros per month) to compensate for the higher costs of living in these areas, but they will likely be required to work more hours per week (16 instead of 12).

In most cases you must find your own housing, transportation to, from, and within Spain. You are completely independent while in Spain but generally will be provided a contact at your school who can answer questions regarding housing, transportation and any other issues that come up. 

You will be able to take advantage of the public health care system in Spain and you will be given medical insurance by the government to cover you while you are living in Spain for the eight months. There are teacher orientations for all assistants at the beginning of the year, generally at the end of September or beginning of October. Depending on where you are located in Spain, your orientation may be located in Madrid or in your own region (i.e. Andalucía), or in some cases your own province (i.e. Ciudad Real, which is located in the region of Castilla la Mancha). To receive the grant you must apply for a student visa at your nearest consulate before coming to Spain. (Information on the consulates can be found in the &quot;preparation&quot; chapter).

===Things to Think About===

Before you apply you may want to think about some things, especially if you have never lived abroad!

1. Do you really want to do this?  There are people who apply for this program and end up changing their mind either before they get to Spain or well after they are already in Spain.  Many people apply for this position and would love to have a guaranteed spot. Do not apply for the grant if you aren't going to use it!

2. Can you really stay away from all of your friends and family for eight months without seeing them? Some people don't realize how much their friends and family really mean to them until they go away.  Don't let the thought of this scare you from doing the program, if anything, it can only make your bonds with those you love stronger!

3. Are you ready to be an ambassador for your country?  No matter where you are in the world, people are watching you and judging you and your country by your actions. Americans are some of the most scrutinized people in the world. Are you prepared to share your background and ideas with others to help promote cultural understanding?

4. Are you financially capable and prepared for this program? This program puts a big strain on people financially as they have to get a flight to Spain and then upon arrival they must pay up to three months rent sometimes, as well as buy necessities that they will need for the year.  One could spend close to $3,000.00/$4.000.00 in the first month (including plane tickets, etc.). Make sure you are prepared for unexpected expenses as you may not receive that first pay check until the end of November or even December!

5. Are you able to live on a tight budget?  Even in regions where the cost of living is relatively low, such as the south of Spain, 700 euros per month is still not much.  While it is possible to live on this much, you will have to closely monitor your expenditures, and may have to find alternate ways to supplement your income.  Keep in mind that in many areas of Spain, it is possible to rent a room in a shared apartment for just 100-200 euros per month, and the cost of food and drinks is also likely lower than what you are used to, depending on where you are from in the US.  However, prices for things like clothes and other shopping is comparable or higher than in the US, so you will not be able to go on many shopping sprees with your stipend.  It is possible to cover basic housing, food and other living expenses, but not necessarily comfortable, to live on such a small stipend, and you definitely won't be able to live a lavish lifestyle.

Nuclear fusion is the joining together of atomic nuclei to form a larger nucleus, and possibly some other products, including energy. It occurs naturally in stars, where hydrogen is fused together into larger isotopes of hydrogen and then into helium, releasing energy along the way.

==Forces==
Nuclei repel each other due to the electromagnetic force, since they have the same charge. However at a range of between 1 and 3 femtometers the strong force causes nucleons to be attracted to one another, with the magnitude of this force being far greater than that of electromagnetic repulsion. Therefore in order for two nuclei to fuse, they must be sufficiently close enough together that the attractive force between the baryons due to the strong nuclear force is greater than the repulsive force due to the electromagnetic force. If this is the case, then the two nuclei will become a new, larger, nucleus.

==Uses==
Nuclear fusion was used by humans for the first time in the hydrogen bomb, whereby a nuclear fission reaction would occur, releasing enough thermal energy so that nuclear fusion could occur, which would release free neutrons allowing the nuclear fission reaction to be more efficient, with more of the unstable isotope undergoing fission as well as a modest amount of energy being released during the fusion process. At the time of writing (2009), commercially viable fusion power has not yet been achieved. However, research is under way, specifically at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, to bring a fusion reaction under control so that it can be used to generate electricity. This would have the advantage of minimal nuclear waste, since the main product would be non-radioactive helium, with some tritium, which has a relatively short 12-year half-life.

==Binding Energy==
The fusion of nuclei smaller than Iron-56 releases energy. This is because, if we were to take all the baryons of both the nuclei apart, and then stick them all back together as one, we would do less work than would be required to stick them together as the two separate nuclei. The difference in binding energy is the energy which is released by a fusion reaction. This energy might be given to the 'real' particles which are given off, or to a 'virtual' particle such as a photon.

==Questions==

c = 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

1. In the Sun, two tritium nuclei (&lt;math&gt;_1^3H&lt;/math&gt;) are fused to produce helium-4 (&lt;math&gt;_2^4He&lt;/math&gt;). What else is produced, apart from energy?

2. In larger stars, carbon-12 (&lt;math&gt;_6^{12}C&lt;/math&gt;) is fused with protium (&lt;math&gt;_1^1H&lt;/math&gt;). What single nucleus does this produce?

3. In this reaction, 1.95MeV of energy is released. What difference in binding energy does this correspond to?

4. If all this energy was emitted as a photon, what would its frequency be?

5. In order to contain a fusion reaction, electromagnetism may be used. What other force could be used? Why is this not being used for fusion reactors on Earth?

&lt;math&gt;_6^{12}C\; +\; _1^1H \to \;_7^{13}N&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. In this reaction, 1.95MeV of energy is released. What difference in binding energy, in J, does this correspond to?'''

1.95MeV = 1.95 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; x 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; J = 3.12 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt; J

'''4. If all this energy was emitted as a photon, what would its frequency be?'''

&lt;math&gt;E = hf&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{3.12 \times 10^6}{6.63 \times 10^{-34}} = 4.71 \times 10^{20}\mbox{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a within the wavelength spectrum of a gamma-ray, so we can assume all energy is released as a gamma-ray photon.

'''5. In order to contain a fusion reaction, electromagnetism may be used. What other force could be used? Why is this not being used for fusion reactors on Earth?'''

Gravity, as in stars. However, the amount of mass required to do this is far larger than the Earth, so we cannot do this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Common Lisp is a specification which has many implementations.  Each of these implementations has met the CL specification in different ways.  This means that, almost certainly, the way that a Lisp implementation performs certain tasks (start up, shutdown, debugging, delivery, scripting, etc.) will be different.  In addition, it is common for certain implementations to have special features that have not been adopted by the entire CL community but are very useful in their own right.  This chapter will provide a short/selective sampling of using popular Common Lisp implementations and common usage.

== Application Delivery ==

The open source community is very active in the Common Lisp world (as it is in “hacker” languages).  As such, the most common way to distribute Common Lisp software is via source archives.  Often these source archives use the ASDF package manager.  This has a small drawback that the user has to be proficient enough to install a Lisp implementation and build the package.  In addition, some people wish to close source their program.  For these purposes there are other methods of distributing programs.

=== Dumping a Lisp Image ===

One way to deliver a Lisp application is to provide a dump of the Lisp image.  This has traditionally been the route to provide a “finished” program to users.  This is basically the same as providing an executable of your program.  Often, all you will see is a opaque, monolithic file that contains your program (and almost ubiquitously the entire Lisp system).  While this allows developers to hide the application source to the user, it also solves the problem of the user having to find and install a lisp implementation.  Since the application is just an executable, all the user needs to do is run that program.  Lisp images are not portable, however, and would need to be built for every system type you want to support.

==== SBCL ====
To produce a Lisp image in SBCL use SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE.
&lt;source lang='lisp'&gt;
;; Make a Lisp image.  Execute with sbcl --core lisp-image.core
(save-lisp-and-die #p&quot;lisp-image.core&quot;)
;; Make an executable Lisp image.  Execute with ./lisp-image
(save-lisp-and-die #p&quot;lisp-image&quot; :executable t)
&lt;/source&gt;
There are many other options you may use when building your image.  See the user manual to see what they do.


to load Lisp image when Lisp starts use runtime option :

 --core corefilename

so in console :

 /usr/local/bin/sbcl --core lisp-image.core

==== CLISP ====

To save image in CLISP use :&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socher.org/index.php/Main/DumpImageFromClisp  Dump Image From Clisp by Richard Socher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/impnotes/image.html Saving an Image at CLISP version 2.48 doc]&lt;/ref&gt;

 (saveinitmem &quot;/home/you/yourLispDir/lispImage.mem&quot;)

Afterwards if you want to use it load it like this ( in console ) :

 clisp -M lispImage.mem 

=== Portable byte code ===

Some Lisps, such as CLISP, produce portable byte code.  This means that you can build your program on one system and send it to a user who can then run it on their CLISP implementation.  This solves the problem of hiding source from the user.  Of course the user still needs to install CLISP, but it is luckily one of the easiest to install.

== Scripting ==

One often desires to write Common Lisp “scripts” in much in the spirit of Perl, Python, and Bash.  For such an application you often have to worry about certain factors that Common Lisp users often don't worry about such as:

*Start up time needs to be very fast.  Often scripts are run on small inputs for simple problems so starting the Lisp image must be fast or it will become the bottleneck.
*Memory usage needs to be very low.  Often users will run tens to hundreds of scripts at a time.

Both of these factors are commonly ignored when producing a Lisp system.  After all, Lisp systems are typically long running (so start up speed is of little importance) and form their own computing environment (so only one instance need be running at a time, making memory use of little importance).  There are, however, several implementations that can act as scripting platforms.  When properly configured, SBCL, CCL, and CLISP all have relatively fast start up times.  CLISP and ECL run with fairly small memory footprints.

=== Calling a Common Lisp Server ===

This is a question that comes up now and then on certain newsgroups: “How can I circumvent my Lisp's excessive start up time and/or memory usage by calling a Lisp server instead of a starting a new process.”  Often the user is not utilizing the Lisp implementations features fully, which leads them to this solution.  Usually, creating a Common Lisp server is not really necessary because the techniques demonstrated in the Scripting or Dumping a Lisp Image sections are enough to fix these problems.  There are however, times when this may actually benefit you.  A Common Lisp system is a very big thing; just loading such a large thing can prove to be a bottleneck for some applications.

== Embedding Common Lisp in Another Language ==

=== Calling Lisp from C ===

ECL is a full, stand alone CL implementation with the added feature that it is embeddable in any project that can make C function calls.  Originally conceived as a way to get some Lisp in C applications without a huge footprint, it has quickly grown to a full implementation in its own right.

== Calling on an Underlying VM ==

There are very few Common Lisps that run on top of a virtual machine.  Those that do have the ability to use libraries from other languages that also use that VM.  ABCL is a Common Lisp that runs on the Java VM.  ABCL has the ability to access any part of Java, which means that there are a plethora of popular libraries out there for you to use.

=== Using Java in ABCL ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thanks for your interest in our new book!  This book is the newest iteration of a project that began way back in the Fall of 2006.  Students enrolled in a course called Introduction to the Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education wrote, read, studied and were tested on their very own textbook--[[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education|Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]].  

Beginning in the Spring of 2008, students began writing a similar text called [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]].  Modifications were made, and features were added to increase the iteractivity between students. Now, times have changed at [http://www.odu.edu Old Dominion University].  Introduction to the Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education and Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment(the courses), no longer exist.  They have been replaced with Foundations and Assessment of Education--hence, the name of our new book.

Like the first two iterations, this new book will be written, read and studied by Undergraduate college students enrolled in their first education course.  If you're familiar with the original Wikibook, some of the content in this book may look familiar.  Just the same, we hope you enjoy the new content and the creative ways in which that content is presented.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Just as our lives have changed over the years, education has as well.  In the beginning, all children were educated together in little one room school houses.  Eventually that was changed to two separating our children based on the grade level that we perceived them to be at. Children were once even separated based on the color of their skin.  Today we have moved past all of that and the latest trend in education is moving our children into learning based on 21st century skills instead of 20th century skills. Since the year 2000 there have been numerous changes that have been implemented towards making these improvements in our education system possible, including the No Child Left Behind Law and improvements in technology education for students and teachers as well.  
&lt;p&gt;The question now arises as to whether our children will be able to stand up and succeed in this new and ever changing world.  I feel that given many of the recent changes that have happened that they will not only succeed, but they will excel and at the same time teach the teachers a few things along the way.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#FF00008B&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/Font&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The days where if you had a P.C. you were considered cool are gone.  Today it is becoming more and more commonplace to use technology to teach our students. However, one of the most difficult tasks for most teachers, is how can you teach with technology if they themselves do not know how to use the applications.  The answer is simple, teach the teachers through workshops or by sending them back to school.  Once the teachers have been properlly instructed on how to use technology in the classroom, the real teaching can begin. There is still one question that persists, how can technology best be used in the classroom?  In today's day and age there are numerous applications that can be used including but not limited to, the internet, united streaming, PowerPoint, Webquests, etc. All of these applications if used correctly can make learning come alive for the student, making it cool to stay awake rather to sleep in class during the lesson.  However, there is one problem that seems to be becoming more and more prevalent in our school systems today and that is a lack of funding. According to board members attending the National School Boards Association, &quot;shortfalls in state budgets, coupled with pessimistic predictions about local revenues, are forcing them to look for ways to trim next school year’s budgets and educational technology programs could be among the casualties. In fact leaner school budgets could slam ed-tech programs nationwide.  Nevada is one of the many states that will likely see cuts in ed-tech funding.&quot;(Nagel, 2007) Basically many teachers are forced to fend for themselves when it comes to integrating technology into the classroom.  Will this ever change?  I am sure that  it will, but as with everything, you sometimes have to give up something in order to get something else, which means that our elected officials will have to decide what is more imporatant our students being prepared for work in the 21st century or only having the basic skills that are required of them by state and national standards, only time will tell what will happen.

“Technology in education or instruction is more than the technical application of tools, machines, computers, products and communication systems (such as multimedia, computerized instruction, games, simulations or interactive video).” (Wikibooks, 2007)  

“It also encompasses the &quot;application of the principles of science in order to solve learning problems...&quot;  (Seels, 1994 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#FF00008B&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;No Child Left Behindy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/Font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;2&quot;&gt;In 2001, President George W. Bush passed the No Child Left Behind Law.  According to the United States Department of Education website the NCLB &quot;is built on four principles: accountability for results, more choices for parents, greater local control and flexibility, and an emphasis on doing what works based on scientific research.&quot;(U. S. Department of Education-No Child Left Behind, 2008) For many new teachers in Virginia the most frustrating thing that has been created as a result of the NCLB is the Standards Of Learning, or the SOL's. One of the reasons that many new teachers feel frustrated by the SOL's is that there is more pressure to teach to the test.  However, after reading the four pillars a little bit closer a greater understanding of the good that can come from the NCLB should be realized.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stronger Accountability for Results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Under No Child Left Behind, states are working to close the achievement gap and make sure all students, including those who are disadvantaged, achieve academic proficiency. Annual state and school district report cards inform parents and communities about state and school progress. Schools that do not make progress must provide supplemental services, such as free tutoring or after-school assistance; take corrective actions; and, if still not making adequate yearly progress after five years, make dramatic changes to the way the school is run.&quot; (...)

&lt;u&gt;More Freedom for States and Communities&lt;u&gt;
&quot;Under No Child Left Behind, states and school districts have unprecedented flexibility in how they use federal education funds. For example, it is possible for most school districts to transfer up to 50 percent of the federal formula grant funds they receive under the Improving Teacher Quality State Grants, Educational Technology, Innovative Programs, and Safe and Drug-Free Schools programs to any one of these programs, or to their Title I program, without separate approval. This allows districts to use funds for their particular needs, such as hiring new teachers, increasing teacher pay, and improving teacher training and professional development.&quot; (...)

&lt;u&gt;Proven Education Methods&lt;/u&gt;

&quot;No Child Left Behind puts emphasis on determining which educational programs and practices have been proven effective through rigorous scientific research. Federal funding is targeted to support these programs and teaching methods that work to improve student learning and achievement. In reading, for example, No Child Left Behind supports scientifically based instruction programs in the early grades under the Reading First program and in preschool under the Early Reading First program.&quot;  (...)

&lt;u&gt;More Choices for Parents&lt;/u&gt;

&quot;Parents of children in low-performing schools have new options under No Child Left Behind. In schools that do not meet state standards for at least two consecutive years, parents may transfer their children to a better-performing public school, including a public charter school, within their district. The district must provide transportation, using Title I funds if necessary. Students from low-income families in schools that fail to meet state standards for at least three years are eligible to receive supplemental educational services, including tutoring, after-school services, and summer school. Also, students who attend a persistently dangerous school or are the victim of a violent crime while in their school have the option to attend a safe school within their district.&quot;(U. S. Department of Education-No Child Left Behind, 2008)

It is a fact that many people find change hard to deal with, but in the long run changing the way we educate our children can only lead to great things.  


&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#FF00008B&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Voucher Debate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/Font&gt;

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; SIZE=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Currently one of the most contreversial topics within the field of education is the discussion over whether or not school vouchers should be used.  Most who are againist the idea of school vouchers claim that it is unconstitutional.  They claim that parents will turn around and use the money given to them to help fund a religious education for their children.  This idea sounds sort of ridiculous because as most people know there should be a separation of church and state. On the other side of the issue are those who feel school vouchers will be extremely beneficial to those presently in the school system, and future members of the school system as well.  The advocates for school vouchers say that the funds will be in the hands of the parents and that they can do with the money as they please.  This in turn takes the state completely out of the picture hence there is no more concern that the notion of separation of church and state will get messed with in any way shape or form.  Since this is such a controversial topic, discussion about it will probably be ongoing, but who knows a compromise might be in plans for the future in that respect only time will tell.(Ediger, 2004).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;big&gt;Poverty: Leaving Students Behind &lt;/big&gt;==

''
'''By Lauren Roth'''''

== Learning Targets ==
Students should be able to:

a) Explain the ways in which poverty goes beyond financial issues.

b) Identify the effects of poverty.

c) Describe strategies to reduce the effects of poverty in the classroom.

== Introduction ==

''' Each individual has resources that greatly influence achievement; money is only one.
 
''' Poverty is the extent to which an individual is without these resources. 

-- Ruby Payne (1996)''' ''' &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The scenario of a child bringing an apple to his favorite teacher is an iconic symbol of education. But in many schools today, that scene is more likely to be reversed. Many teachers bring snacks, school supplies and even clothing to their classrooms to help the students who don't have everything they need at home.

As teachers, we want to provide the same high-quality education to all their students. But each child comes to the classroom with a different background. That requires teachers and schools to be prepared to teach all kinds of students.

Students in poverty often lack the same health care and early childhood experiences of their wealthier peers. They are exposed to more violence and have fewer material resources, such as books and computers (Gerstl-Pepin, 2006).

The U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services defines poverty for a family of four as an annual income of $21,200 or below. For a family of two, an income of $14,000 is considered poverty level (Federal Register, 2008).

To think about how much this is, a full-time worker earning $6.00 an hour and working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year would earn $12,480. 

Families are considered low-income at up to twice the poverty level, the amount considered necessary to cover basic needs. Nationwide, 38 percent of children live in low-income families (Gerstl-Pepin, 2006).

== Why It Matters ==

Because poverty is not just a financial issue, it reaches into children's lives in many ways. These differences mean that poor children can come to class hungry, distracted or unprepared. They may not have enough food, lack necessary glasses or have unfinished homework because they didn't have a quiet place to complete it.

According to the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics (2007), poverty affects the overall well-being of children, from health to behavior, to social environment and education.

Lower-class children have more hearing problems, more distracting toothaches, higher exposure to IQ-damaging lead paint and are more likely to have vitamin deficiencies associated with lower test scores and cognitive problems (Rothstein, 2004).

Every child is different, of course. But on average, children born into poverty are less prepared for school.

The differences start early. For example, children who have been regularly read to are at an advantage when they begin school. However, parents with lower incomes read to their young children less often.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FCDFFF;

How many students in each school and division in Virginia qualify for free and reduced lunches because of low incomes? To explore and compare, click here: [http://www.doe.virginia.gov/ss_services/nutrition/resources/statistics.shtml Free and Reduced Price Lunch Program Eligibility Reports by School Year]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

In 2005, 50 percent of children in families with incomes below the poverty level read to their three- to five-year-olds daily. Among children in families with incomes from 100 to 199 percent of the poverty level, 60 percent were read to every day. And in families with incomes double the poverty level or above, 65 percent were read to daily (Federal Interagency Forum, 2007).

Teachers need to be aware of the difficulties their students face so they can do everything in their power to help them learn.

It's not just a matter of what's right, but what is legally required. The federal No Child Left Behind act measures the performance of all children. But it also specifically holds schools accountable for the test scores of smaller groups called subgroups. Economically disadvantaged students are one of those subgroups. Special education students, English-language learners and minority groups including African-Americans and Hispanics are some of the others. If only the low-income students in a school performed poorly on a state test, the school could be labeled as failing.

According to Anyon and Greene (2007), the law does this because of the implicit assumption that academic achievement is the route out of poverty.

== What Schools Can Do ==

Poverty comes from outside the schoolhouse, but there are a number of different approaches schools and teachers can take to lessen its impact in the classroom.

Richard Rothstein says that while schools cannot completely overcome the influence of social class, excellent schools can offset these differences. High-quality summer and afterschool programs and early childhood education are school-related offerings that can narrow the achievement gap (Rothstein 2004).

Individual teachers and schools can make a large difference as well.

Students from low-income backgrounds who feel unconnected to school are more likely to drop out (Board on Children, Youth and Families, 2003). Therefore, it is essential to help students feel engaged with their schools, especially at the high school level. That is because most dropouts leave school during their high school years.
 
The most important way to make students want to come to school is through engaging teaching.
Research shows that teaching literature through disconnected sections of a textbook is not the most effective or engaging technique. Instead, students should be able to debate important ideas, work in small groups and perform reading and writing tasks connected to the real world (Board on Children, 2003).

For example, in one of the classrooms I observed, sixth-graders learned about persuasive writing by developing their own commercials for products they created. The students worked in small groups and were very excited about the assignment.

Gerstl-Pepin (2006) documented a school that nearly doubled the reading scores of students after a major reform effort. All the students in the school qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. At that school, teachers worked to create a caring community. Students who acted out were kept in the classroom to learn instead of being kicked out. They did this by educating students about expected classroom behavior alongside reading and writing (Gerstl-Pepin, 2006).

While parental involvement is an essential part of student success, parents in low-income families don't always have time or transportation to directly visit their children's schools  (Gerstl-Pepin). Some educators who understand this try to reach out to families in other ways.

In Virginia Beach, Larry Ames, the principal of Seatack Elementary, personally visits parents at their homes to talk to them about the importance of education.

Noguera (2003) says the most successful schools not only support good teaching and learning, they work to address problems that face their students outside school. &quot;Such schools find ways to provide coats to children in the winter and additional food to children who don't eat regularly at home,&quot; (Noguera, 2003). They hire capable and dedicated staff, offer a coherent vision and have high expectations for their students.

== Conclusion ==

While poverty can mean a lack of money, it also affects a child's life in many ways. Teachers and schools should understand why some children don't come to school ready to learn every day.

The performance differences between students living in poverty and their peers can be narrowed by techniques including engaging teaching and outreach into the community.
 
Believing in students is the key, according to Pedro Noguera.

&quot;The possibility for better education exists because children are fundamentally educable and capable of learning at high levels,&quot; (Noguera 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Why Do Teachers Teach?'''&lt;/big&gt;


By Alyschia Conn

&lt;big&gt;'''Table Of Contents'''&lt;/big&gt;

----

=='''Why Teach?'''==

Why do teachers teach?  It is a rather simple question, however the question, what is a teacher, must be addressed first.  Merriam-Websterâs definition of a teacher is âone whose occupation is to instruct&quot; (Merriam-Webster, 2008, para. 1).  That is a rather one dimensional definition of a teacher, as teachers these days, offer so much more to the class than just the information.  They offer themselves.  A collective definition of a teacher, is someone who âyearns to help children learn, watch them grow, and make a meaningful difference in the worldâ (Teacher Support Network, 2007, para. 2).  This definition must be the main reason as to why individuals pursue teaching as a career.  Generally the pay is low to fair, but the overall rewards are much greater, for as a teacher one can touch the hearts of the young and open their minds in order to tap their thirst for knowledge.

=='''The Long Road'''==

Becoming a teacher is a lengthy process obtained by numerous routes, such as night school or attending a four year college.  Regardless of the process it is important to obtain at least a Bachelors degree in the desired teaching area, as well as a teacher certification which should include clinical experience (Lewis, L., Parsad, B., Carey, N., Bartfai, N., Farris, E. &amp; Smerdon, B., 1999, para. 3).  The average starting salaries were about $31,704 in the year 2003-04, whereas the average teaching salary was about $46,597 for the year 2004-2005 (Pearson Education Inc, table).  Compare this to the average cost of living in the United States today which is continually rising (Boskey, para. 3). 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
[http://www.nea.org/student-program/about/state.html Teacher's Salaries Across the US]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Teaching is not a pocket cushining job, but one with long hours and a flat rate of pay. The income of course, depends on where the teacher is instructing.  Private schools generally pay their teachers less for they do not need to have proper credentials, whereas schools located in urban areas pay more for those with proper credentials (Vedder, 2003, Public vs. Private, para. 1).  Despite the lower pay for private school teachers, it is the students, the teacher's indivdiual commitment to faith, and the freedom provided by not being governmentally run that attracts teachers (Vedder, 2003, Public vs. Private).  Considering the figures above, it is clear that teaching is not a lucrative profession.  It is the perogative of these individuals to choose a career in teaching, and often they have a strong motive behind their decision.  Perhaps teachers teach for personal gain, or they have the desire to spread knowledge, or to watch children reach their full potential beneath their instruction.  Regardless of the reason, the reward must be substantial to compensate for the lack of monetary reward. 

=='''Passion'''==

There are multiple factors in deciding to become a teacher.  For one, it is a healthy alternative to other professions as the TDAâs research has found that about twice as many teachers truly enjoy their work, as opposed to those who have careers in marketing, IT and accounting (TDA, In Summary, para. 1).  Although work is not truly, work, if it is enjoyed.  For example, Beth Ashfield, a math teacher, spoke of her job with passion âI love my subject, but I know itâs not socially acceptable to say thatâ¦ in school, I can be as enthusiastic as I want to be.  Iâm able to convey that enthusiasm to the students, to allow them to become confident and creative in their approach to the subjectâ (TDA, Beth Ashfield, Maths teacher, para. 1).  Becoming a teacher was important for her, due to her great love of a particular subject, and the desire to share it with others in hopes that they might discover the same for themselves.  As a teacher one is always learning, whether it is of oneâs content material, or something new from a pupil.  Being a teacher requires an open mind, for the teacher is always the student.  A teacher guides his or her charges on a path to self discovery where they learn about the world, and ultimately, themselves.


=='''Love'''==
Beyond passion, another reason that teachers teach is simply for the love of teaching. As stated by (Liston &amp; Garrison, 2003) Love is a âcreative, critical, and disruptive force in teaching and learning.â A teacher who loves his or her job will be a better teacher and have a greater impact on the students he or she influences.  Classroom efforts to manage, instruct, and direct groups of twenty to thirty students frequently requires a feelings for others and an intuition that connects teacher to student and to subject matter. (Liston &amp; Garrison, 2003) For the new teacher that multiple tasks entailed in this activity can be overwhelming. (Liston &amp; Garrison, 2003) For the experienced teacher they can seem almost unconscious. (Liston &amp; Garrison, 2003) This connection between students and teachers can sometimes be a form of love and concern for the well being of other human beings.  A teacher must have a strong desire to see the well being of young students is advanced and know that at the end of the day they have played a small part in the bettering of these students.  Most teachers truly have passion for what they do, but they also have a love for it as well.



=='''The Challenge'''==
 
There are points when teaching becomes a challenge, but it is those that thrive on the challenge of reaching kids who are truly the most effective.  Though they may seem under appreciated, the individuals who instruct in our countryâs challenge-schools, or schools located in poor urban areas, are very important.  Laura Hendrickson conducted a study that looked into high-challenge urban schools, and how good teachers affect the students education.  It was obvious that with three years of quality teaching the students performed almost nearly as well as those who were not situated in a high challenge school.  Often teachers leave such places due to their struggles with reaching the children in those areas however, those that stayed had the following reasons; &quot;relationships with students, rewards, instructional focus, collegiality, feeling needed and a desire to help others, challenges and parents&quot; (Morris, 2007, Abstract para. 4).  The teachers took their responsibility to not merely be educators, but also to provide different avenues of understanding so that all students could âmaster basic learning objectivesâ (Cotton, 2001, para. 3).  These objectives were acquired through the encouragement and support of the teachers who established the connection between the studentâs effort and his or her outcome, as opposed to luck or good fortune.  The effort of these teachers was remarkable as they faced the challenges of the studentâs unstable and sometimes uneducated backgrounds and found ways to reach the children by being flexible with their teaching style and creative with rewards (Cotton, 2001, para. 5).

=='''Creativity Is Key'''==

Beth Anders, once a physical education teacher, now heads the coaching faculty of the field hockey team at Old Dominion University.  Her view on teaching was similar to that of Beth Ashfield, for she loves to teach and develop people.  &quot;Life is learning and to be part of people developing and acquiring knowledge.  Every person is unique and the challenge is to find fun ways to guide individuals to learn and understand what they are interested in learning&quot; (B. Anders, personal communication, February 2, 2008).  There are many ways to be creative in the classroom, whether it is using projects, videos, and presentations, but what if the creativity stemmed from the teacher?

Being creative is important in teaching, for the students are the audience.  No one knows this better than entertainers, who are creative and use their ingenuity to bring to life rather dull aspects of education.  This in and of itself is talent, and there are those who devote themselves to that.  Paul Keogh, a Modern Languages teacher had always aspired to be an entertainer, however, he chose teaching as his profession instead.  He does not regret this choice for, heâs always got someone to perform for.  He equated teaching to entertainment, but more importantly he remarks, âI love to see them growing personally, socially and academicallyâ (TDA, Paul Keogh, Modern Languages teacher, para. 3).  This statement itself encompasses the point of education, for there cannot be growth without learning, and learning stems from observing from someone of an educated status higher than oneâs-self.

=='''The Rewards'''==

The rewards received by being a teacher are different than those received by someone like a salesman for example.  If a salesman is doing well, he makes his quota, and he then earns his monetary bonus. It is possible that he receives a plaque to hang behind his desk stating that he was the number one salesman for this period in time.  Teacherâs rewards are not so tangible, but rather, âthey are rewarded more by witnessing their students succeed and follow their dreams than by any plaque â (Daily Egyptian, 2005, para. 7).  A group of school teachers who had participated in a study that looked into why teachers taught in high challenge schools, jointly agreed that what their students achieve under their instruction was reward enough for all the time that they devote to their students.  &quot;Student achievement was another reward the teachers discussed as a reason for staying.  When their students were successful, the teachers felt incredibly rewarded.&quot; (Morris, 2007, pg 58).  The reward teachers receive is a feeling, and feelings are more special and memorable than gold and silver plaques hung stoicly on a wall proclamming and individuals success.  For teaching, it is not about what the teachers can achieve, but what they can get their students to aceive, and through their students, reflects a teacher's greatest achievement.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
To address the opening question, why do teachers teach?  The answer is simple, âthey teach for the love of children and to contribute to the well-being of all of usâ (Teachers are Important, 1998, para. 4). It is something inside them.  It is a drive, a force, a passion, a talent that they wish to dispel upon his or her students in order to watch them succeed.  Choosing to be at teacher is not for the money, as a teacher's monetary compensation is hardly adequate given all that they give to their students.  Becoming a teacher is almost like heading a calling.  It is not for the light at heart, but rather, for those who love children and people, who have a passion for education, and who love to share in that passion.  Teachers yearn to see the burning desire to learn, and love to see the excitement of discovery, and that, is why teachers teach.

&lt;big&gt;'''Why Do Teachers Teach?'''&lt;/big&gt;



By:  MChat004



&lt;big&gt;'''Table Of Contents'''&lt;/big&gt;

----




=='''Targets'''==
After reading this article the reader will have an understanding of reasons people choose teaching for their profession.

They will know the challenges and rewards of teaching.

The reader will also know what the future looks like for teachers.




=='''What Does It Take To Be a Teacher?'''==
Teachers teach for many different reasons but mainly for how rewarding it is to see students succeed.  The Marriam-Webster Online Dictionary says the definition of a teacher is âone whose occupation is to instructâ  (Teacher Mariam-Webster 2009).  There are many different kinds of teachers and to provide instruction is definitely not the only requirement.   Teachers need to be prepared with lesson plans ahead of time.  They need to explain information in the easiest way for students to understand it.  They need to be creative and interesting to keep students attention by adding visual aids and interaction activities to help students get a better grasp of the information.  A teacherâs job extends further than just the classroom.  When not preparing for lessons they grade papers, make tests, try to communicate with parents to keep every child prepared, and try their best to make learning enjoyable  (Teacher Bureau 2008).  Teaching requires much more than just the average six hour day in the classroom.  Linda Christensen states in her article Teacher Quality, âI wanted teachers to see themselves as curriculum producers, as creative intellectuals rather than technicians serving out daily portions of someone elseâs packaged or downloaded materialsâ  (Christensen 2005).  In the world of a teacher a lot of preparing and behind the scenes work goes into every regular day on the job.  It is impossible to plan on showing up and &quot;just winging&quot; it as class goes on.  Preparation is a must!

=='''What are the requirements for teaching?'''==
To be a teacher you are required to pass certain tests, earn at least a bachelors degree, and receive a teaching certificate.  Besides having all of the educational requirements, it takes a special type of person to be a teacher.   Teachers are required to have a lot of patience and to be happy people to make students feel more encouraged to go to school and to make students feel more comfortable. Teachers need to be creative to keep students focused and to make learning fun.  They should also be good leaders to obtain trust from their class (Teacher Bureau 2008).  Teachers need to know how to make learning fun but also keep control of the class at the same time.

=='''What does the future look like for teachers?'''==
The U.S. Department of Labor predicts that in the next ten years job opportunities for teachers will vary from good to excellent  (Teacher Bureau 2008).   Teaching is a very dependable job because where ever life takes you, teachers will be needed.  They are needed everywhere in multiple different subjects and grade levels.  The U.S. Department of Labor also stated in there online article about teachers, âThere were 4 million jobs for teachers in 2006â  (Teacher Bureau 2008).  Teaching is a very rewarding job but is also often considered a very underpaid job.  The U.S. Department of Labor also showed that teacherâs salaries vary from $28,590 to $76,100 annually  (Teacher Bureau 2008).  There is a great difference between the salary range just all depending on what kind of teacher, teacher degree and educational experience, and location of the school district.  

=='''The Challenges of Teaching'''==
Teaching involves many different challenges.  Students come to school on many different learning levels.  Some students are gifted and accelerate more quickly than others, and teachers need to work very hard to keep these students from being bored and to keep them interestesd in the learning.  Other students are a bit slower at keeping up and teachers need to work hard to keep them up to pace and motivated to eliminate giving up.  Teachers need to provide lessons on a level for the whole class to be able to participate.  Most material needs to be taught several times because of all of the different ways children learn.  When teaching you have to present the material in many different styles and need to be sure that each students understands and can apply the information that they have been taught.  Teachers need to teach material so students can not only see it, but hear it.  Beth Lewis states in her article on Elementary Education on About.com that, âThe word âteacherâ just does not cover it.  Weâre also nurses, psychologists, recess monitors, social workers, parental counselors, secretaries, copy machine mechanics, and almost literally parents, in some instances, to our studentsâ  (Lewis 1999).  Teachers also do not have the flexibility of being able to call in sick or to take unexpected days off.  Lesson plans take hours to put together and without advanced notice it is hard for teachers to prepare productive lesson plans for a substitute.   Some school districts also provide their teachers with very limited resources.  Technology is becoming a very important aid in the classroom.  It is proven to promote interaction and focus in the classroom, but unfortunately not all schools have to budget to provide a lot of this equipment.

=='''The Rewards of Teaching'''==
Educators are driven to provide the best education for their students (Kaufman).  Kaufman also states in her article, âIn an interview of elementary school teachers, âmeaningful workâ ranked as the primary draw of a teaching careerâ  (Kaufman).  Many teachers teach because of the reward of seeing students succeed.  There job actually has meaning.  They are actually making a difference by preparing our youth.  Teaching is also very different than the average office job, every day is a new day and you never know what to expect.  Teaching is by far not a boring job and is guaranteed to keep you on your toes.  Another reward of being a teacher is being able to have your summers off.  Most jobs do not allow much vacation time in the summer.  As a teacher you can take vacations and trips, catch up on housework, or just enjoy the time to relax and recuperate.  

=='''In Conclusion'''==
In conclusion teaching can be very rewarding but also very challenging at the same time.  Teachers never know what to expect on a day to day basis in the classroom.  Teaching takes a lot of patience but after all the struggles nothing is greater than to see your students succeed in the end.  Many teachers also choose to be teachers because of the fact that they feel needed.  There is meaning behind their job.  Teachers make a difference by preparing the youth for the future.

== Learning Targets ==


â¢ Reader should be able to identify key factors that influence a teacherâs decision to stop teaching.

â¢ Reader should be able to identify the effects of low teacher retention.

â¢ Reader should be able to identify ways by which states and schools can boost teacher retention.




== Introduction ==


Why do teachers leave the profession? Teacher attrition has been on the rise for the past two decades and it is no surprise that it has become a major concern. (Brooks-Young, 2007). Every year, approximately one-third of the nationâs teaching force turns over and the retention rate of new teachers after five years is only sixty-one percent. (Kersaint, 2007). Researchers believe that teacher shortages are caused not by lack of interest in teaching, but by too many teachers leaving the profession. (Williby, 2004). What must be addressed are the factors affecting teachersâ decisions to leave, the effects on the students and schools of low teacher retention, and the possible solutions to increase teacher retention. 




== Factors Influencing Teacher Turnover ==

According to Smithers and Robinson, there are five main reasons for teachers leaving the profession: workload, new challenges, school situations, salary, and personal circumstances. Among those five main reasons, workload was the most important factor in affecting teacher turnover, while salary was the least important. (Smithers &amp; Robinson, 2003). 

'''Workload'''

Being a teacher is not an easy job. Teachers must teach their students, as well as complete paperwork, lesson plans, assessments, etc., and at times this can be overbearing. There is an increase on assessment and accountability of teachers, which means there is an emphasis on testing, evaluation, and passing state standards. Teachers are required to teach to state standards and for their students to pass standardized tests, adding another requirement to be placed upon teachers. Also, many times, teachers are expected to sponsor a club or activity on top of everything else they must do. This means spending more time at school working. Meeting these requirements and juggling these tasks can be hard and frustrating, especially for new teachers with little experience.

'''New Challenges'''

New Challenges often cause new, inexperienced teachers to leave the profession. For the most part, their first few years in the classroom are spent trying to get organized, get a grasp on the pace of teaching the material, and learning how to effectively manage a classroom. Disruptive or troublesome students can make a teacherâs job that much more difficult by having to deal with the students and in some cases having to take disciplinary actions

'''School Situation'''

School situation encompasses many different things. It can be how the school is run, who runs the school, what type of programs are available to teachers, geographical setting of the school, and much more. Geography can play a major role in affecting a teacherâs decision on whether to leave the profession. In rural settings, the main reasons for teachers leaving was due to cultural differences, the geography (i.e. being too far away from a city or town), and professional isolation. (Williby, 2004). For urban settings, the reasons for leaving were an emphasis to oversee extracurricular activities and whether they were teaching at an at-risk school. How the school is run is also another factor causing teachers to leave. A lack of administrative support is damaging to a teachers self-esteem, poor facilities cause teachers to become frustrated, and insufficient mentoring leaves the teacher with nowhere to look for advice, and ultimately cause teachers to leave.

'''Personal Circumstances'''

Since teaching requires a lot of time and effort, sometimes personal circumstances can affect a teacherâs decision on whether or not to leave. The most common personal circumstance that causes teachers to leave is family. This encompasses everything from pregnancy, spending more time with family, and taking care of family. For women who get pregnant while teaching, they may find it more cost effective to leave and become a stay-at-home mother (Kersaint, 2007). For other teachers, quality time with their family and taking care of their family is very important and the workload of being a teacher doesnât allow them much time to do this. Age is also another personal circumstance that causes teachers to leave. Typically, it is younger teachers or older teachers approaching retirement that usually leave the teaching profession. For older teachers, there is a direct correlation with early retirement and pension-plans. (Ingersoll, 2001). This means that it is more likely for an older teacher to retire if they have a pension plan.


== Effects of Teacher Turnover ==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
The cost of teacher turnover is over $7 billion dollars a year. (NCTAF, 2007). 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The effects of teacher turnover is astounding, not only for the school systems, but for the students as well. Teacher turnover can have a negative effect on student learning. Schools usually hire last-minute teachers who are under-qualified and inexperienced. (Kersaint, 2007). According to the National Commission on Teaching and Americaâs Future, inexperienced teachers are noticeably less effective than senior teachers. These new, inexperienced, and under-qualified teachers passing in and out of the school systems can have an emotional and physiological effect on students and student learning.


For the school systems, teacher turnover is a fiasco. It drains resources, diminishes teacher quality, undermines the ability to close the gap of student achievement, and is financially burdening. (NCTAF, 2007). Resources are drained due to the need of experienced teachers to train and mentor new teachers. Financially, schools are suffering from teacher turnover because of the cost of recruiting, hiring, advertising, and providing incentives. (Harris &amp; Adams, 2007). Ultimately, the effects of teacher turnover on the school systems directly impacts the students; the financial cost of teacher turnover takes money away from other projects that could be beneficial to the students, the quality of teachers hired directly impacts student learning and student achievement, and the school community and effectiveness can be destroyed.  



== Boosting Teacher Retention ==
So now the question is, what can be done to boost teacher retention? Teachers leave the profession for several reasons from lack of administrative support to poor facilities to low pay. There are several steps schools can take to boost teacher retention. 

To retain teachers that are inexperienced, schools can implement a well-organized induction program. This type of program would include mentoring and peer review evaluations. This allows teachers an outlet for help and instruction, as well as advice on how to improve performance. These types of programs also prepare teachers on what to expect and how to effectively do their job. Studies show that teachers who receive intensive mentoring are less likely to leave than those who receive little to no mentoring. (Williby, 2004). 

Other ways to boost teacher retention include new administrative and organizational strategies. Since workload is the major reason for teachers leaving the profession, strategies such as job sharing or part-time work may be more appealing to some teachers, or time to get work done during the school day through extended planning time, etc.

Hiring incentives are also another way to boost teacher retention. Although salary is not the biggest force driving teachers away from the profession, incentives would give them more of a reason to stay. These incentives inlcude: hiring bonuses, health insurance, pension plans, and higher salaries.



== Conclusion ==
All-in-all teacher turnover is a growing problem and must be solved. The reasons for why teachers leave the profession vary from teacher to teacher, but there is no doubt that something must be done to boost teacher retention. Teacher turnover effects student learning, student achievement, and the school systems. The cost is astounding, and new programs and strategies must be developed so teacher retention does not become an even bigger problem than it already is.

&lt;big&gt;'''Why Do Teachers Leave the Profession?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Tonya Pervall-Harvey





'''Learning Targets'''


ï· List at least five reasons cited by new and veteran teachers for leaving the teaching profession.

ï· Explain the costs to students and school systems that occur as a result of  educators either transferring to a new school/school system, quiting, or retiring.  

ï· Review strategies that school systems can utilize to keep teachers in the classroom.





'''Introduction'''


According to the US Department of Educationâs National Center for Education Statistics seventeen percent (621,000) of Americaâs elementary and secondary school teachers either transferred to another school, retired, or voluntarily quit (U.S. Department of Education 2008).  Recent examination of the effects of this exodus of Americaâs teachers has uncovered unwanted costs to students, school systems, and the nation.  Currently, programs to retain teachers vary from state to state and there is ongoing debate about which programs are most effective at maintaining a high quality teacher workforce in America.  


As you read this article you will be presented with reasons why teachers leave the profession, learn about the unwanted costs related to their exodus, and be introduced to a program that one school system successfully implemented to help them retain their current teacher workforce.




'''Why Are They Leaving''' 


About 3.2 million people teach in U.S. public schools, but, according to projections by economist William Hussar at the National Center for Education Statistics, the nation will need to recruit an additional 2.8 million over the next eight years owing to the baby-boomer retirement, growing student enrollment, and staff turnover-which is especially rapid among new teachers  (Wallis 2008).  Both new teachers and veteran teachers have stated personal issues, workplace characteristics, student population, available resources within a school, and low salaries as reasons for leaving the profession.  





'''Personal Issues'''


Personal issues were cited by over eight percent of the teachers who left teaching at the end of the 2003-2004 school year.  These teachers stated they either decided to stay home to raise a family, to take care of an aging family member, take a job in another field, go back to school to further their education, start their own business, or become a member of a religious community.  Veteran teachers who retired early stated that the personal and monetary rewards of early retirement were greater than the salary compensation they would have received if they were to remain in the workforce.





'''Workplace Characteristics'''


Workplace characteristics were stated by less than one percent of the teaching workforce as a reason why they exited at the end of the 2003-2004 school year.  Characteristics such as location, support networks, and mentoring opportunities were all listed as reasons for abandoning the teaching profession. 


It has been documented that teachers working in high-poverty locations have a higher turnover rate than those working in low-poverty locations do (U.S. Department of Education 2008).  Many expressed difficulties working in high poverty areas due to inadequate instructional resources, constant disruptive behavior from students, lack of parental involvement, and lack of administrative support.   All of these conditions made it difficult for them to teach.


Each year new teachers enter the teaching field expecting to reap great emotional rewards.  They are excited about teaching and are eager to contribute to a childâs academic, social, and emotional development.  Those who cited lack of support networks and mentoring opportunities found that they were in environments that they were not properly trained to handle.    The schools in which they were employed did not have very strong social networks in which the teachers collaborated to create lessons, discuss classroom difficulties, and brainstormed solutions to overcome these difficulties.  


In other cases, novice teachers were assigned mentors but the teacher-mentor relationship was ineffective.   The more experienced mentor in most cases failed to pass on the valuable lessons they had learned through their years of teaching such as, effective classroom management strategies, theories of various ways children learn,  and effective teaching strategies based on the needs of each learner.

border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''Social Problems Among Student Populations of  Low Social Economic Status'''

ï· Indifference to homework and school work

ï· Disruptive behavior

ï· low academic levels

ï· lack of motivation

ï· lack of parental involvement due to the parents past negative experiences with the educational system and limited education

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




'''Student Populations'''

Student populations that include those living in high poverty areas, homes of low social economic status, minority racial composition, and low academic achievement levels experience high levels of teacher attrition.  As stated above in the workplace section, working in schools with the types of student populations listed above can be very challenging. Some teachers enter the classroom unaware of the social dynamics that influence students and parents perception of the educational system due to lack of experience with these populations. They find themselves in school environments that are bombarded with various social problems in which they havenât been properly trained to deal with.  As a result of the challenges faced to educate children who come from homes of low social economic status and  minority groups, an unprepared teacher may become frustrated and leave the profession.





'''Available Resources'''

Lack of teaching resources such as technology, up-date-textbooks, and support staff  teacherâs aides make it harder for teachers to do their jobs.  In this age of accountability, teachers are expected to produce evidence of high levels of academic achievement and at times are barely given the resources needed to reach this goal.  Some opt to give up their jobs as a result of the lack of resources to attain these mandated levels of success.

'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;








'''Low Salary'''


Low salary has been a factor that teachers consider when making the choice to leave the education field of employment.  Some teachers have expressed concerns about having to take part time jobs to help cover the costs of financial obligations.  Others have expressed a desire to simply make more money.  For both groups, it was more beneficial to gain employment in another sector that offers higher compensation than to remain in a field that can be emotionally, physically, and financially draining.




'''Unwanted Costs''' 


As teachers leave the profession each year, school systems have to pay to recruit, hire, and train new teachers to replace them.  This continuous process drains funding and leaves school systems with inexperienced teachers.  This trend is occurring at higher rates in high poverty schools. Teacher attrition comes with the unwanted costs of:


ï· recruiting, hiring, and training a new workforce

ï· lower numbers of experienced teachers in the classroom

ï· decreased academic achievement as a result of diminished numbers of experienced teachers  

The unwanted costs of teacher attrition can be decreased with the implementation of programs that have documented success.    





'''Documented Success'''


Clark County School District in Las Vegas, Nevada 
(National Committee on Teaching and Americas Future 2007)

Clark County had twelve schools in the 2002-2003 school year with extremely high teacher attrition rates.  On average teachers worked in those schools for 1.9 years.  The average teacher experience in one of the schools was 1.3 years.   In 2004 this district started a pilot program to address the need to build and retain a high quality teacher workforce.  The strategies this school system implemented included:  
ï· giving the principal access to teacher applications two months earlier than everyone else and having them hand pick the applicants who would fit into the social culture of their school

ï· holding a urban studies program in the summer to acclimate the new teachers to working in an urban environment

ï· providing full time mentors for the new teachers

ï· increasing the salaries of these new teacher by one step on the teacher pay scale

Three years later, the retention rate in these twelve schools was between eighty-five and ninety-five percent.

'''&lt;big&gt;''By Jessica M. Vasiliou''&lt;/big&gt;'''

Table of Contents
==Introduction==

Teaching as a profession has become a huge concern in our society.  I would think all parents would want their children to be taught by a professional.  However, teaching as a profession is the question that remains to be answered clearly.  The academic society needs to spell out a sense of professionalism in order to ease this concern.  âUnlike other professions where you make âmachinesâ work, this profession allows one to deal with the most complex phenomena on earth.  Ranging from most studious to most mischievous students, the teachers need to maintain a balanced attitude and approach in transforming them to mature individualsâ (Kishore, 2000, paragraph 4).  Professionalization of the teaching workforce is a major concern that needs to be addressed because it is a field of significant knowledge. The process of teaching can influence the lives of many students.

==The Definition of Profession==

Eliot Freidson, author of &lt;u&gt;Professional Powers&lt;/u&gt; (1986), cautions, âa word with so many connotations and denotations cannot be employed 
in precise discourse without definitionâ (Freidson, 1986, p. 35).  In trying to break down the debate about teaching as a profession, we must first look at the concept of âprofession.â  Originating from the Latin, ''professio'', profession originally meant &quot;the declaration of belief in or acceptance of religion or a faith&quot; usually related to religious beliefs (Dictionary.com).  However, by the sixteenth century, this rather narrow meaning expanded to include âbody of persons engaged in some occupationâ (Dictionary.com).  The meaning of profession seems to be very unclear which is why people still cannot determine if teaching can be known as  a profession.

The noun profession, referring to an occupation, also dates back to at least the sixteenth century, and is equally vague.  Profession as a noun is defined as âa vocation requiring knowledge of some department of learning or scienceâ (Dictionary.com).  It is compared to a âlearned professionâ such as that of medicine and law (Freidson, 1986). âInherent within this context is the elite and prestigious connotation many hold of âthe professionsâ to this dayâ (Freidson, 1986, p. 3). As Freidson said, âthe original professionals addressed each other and members of the ruling elite who shared some of their knowledge and belief in its virtues.  They did not address the common people or the common, specialized trades.  So it is our timeâ (Freidson, 1986, p. 3).  

If we as teachers are going to be âprofessionalsâ in our occupation, we need to realize that professionalism is for the most part a state of mind.  Preparation is vital in the teaching world in order to provide every student with a proper education.  Hence, one who calls themselves a professional teacher would want to conduct their classroom with character and dignity.  A professional teacher would take the time to produce an intellectual exchange within their classroom.  Professionals in education would want students to learn from the methods, ideas and lessons presented in their classroom.

===A Professional Teacher===

     &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
âI believe I am a professional because I am a master at what I do, I love what I do and I make a living at what I do.  I engage in this activity known as teaching so much that it is what I live for. Therefore, I believe that I am a professional&quot; (Brown,2008, January 28).  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

It is not easy to find someone who is opposed to the concept of teacher professionalism. Juliane Brown, a teacher in Lancaster, Pennsylvania said, âI believe I am a professional because I am a master at what I do, I love what I do and I make a living at what I do.  I engage in this activity known as teaching so much that it is what I live for. Therefore, I believe that I am a professional.â   Teachers are no longer being seen as people who simply transport packages of knowledge.  Rather, teachers are evolving in a way that they are seen as information-holders and knowledge-makers, possessing much skill, which newcomers to the world of teaching must strive to obtain through experience, study, thought and reflection. Professionalism of teachers will insure our students with the finest education yet.

===Teaching-Not a True Profession?===

Some people have concluded that teachers need more training.  For example, a Bolton-born education expert claims, âTeaching should not be considered as a profession because not enough training is given to those who go into itâ (Bolton-born education expert, Teaching not true profession, 2005, paragraph 1). Possibly to get to the point of teaching being a true profession more in depth education may be needed. Many think that teaching cannot compare to that of a career in medicine and law in terms of professionalism because it âhas a shorter qualification routeâ (Phil Revell, Teaching not true profession, 2005, paragraph 2). Perhaps in the future more years of education will be needed to become a teacher.

===Professional Versus Non-professional===

A professional could be said to be a person who has an extremely developed talent or skill (Buijs, 2005).  All professionals whether it be a professional dancer or doctor receive pay for what they are doing. On the other hand, a non-professional or amateur may not receive pay (Buijs, 2005).  A more significant contrast is that âbeing a professional conveys the connotation, not only of a high level, but of a consistent level, of performance.  Professional athletes or professional entertainers, for instance, can be counted on to perform in diverse, and sometimes adverse, circumstances; they can, and often do, perform regardless of personal mood, motivation, or even injury.  Neither the expectations nor the level of performance of a professional is demanded of an amateurâ (Buijs, 2005, p. 331). What is trying to be explained here is the fact that there is a certain standard of performance for professionals that should be met, but does not have to be met by that of an amateur or a non-professional.

==What is the American Government Doing?==

The American government is very involved in improving the education systems (Denlinger, 2002). However,  the government may not be concerned with the right issues when it comes to teacher professionalism. âInstead of looking at the real problem-poor working conditions and low salaries- the government is arguing that we need to become tougher on our teachers, demand more in terms of work, and do more testing to see if teachers are doing their jobsâ (Denlinger, 2002, p. 116). Low wages is the true dilemma in this field, which our leaders are refusing to admit (Denlinger, 2002).  âBush has proved this by his approach to another, similar problem:  low morale in the armed forces.  To cure that problem, has he argued that we need to demand more of our soldiers?  Noâ¦ Instead, Bush has decided that we need to increase the salaries of our armed forcesâ (Denlinger, 2002, p. 116).  Denlinger went on to say, âHis business logic is self-evident; the only way to draw the best talent is to pay the best wages.  Itâs not that the talent isnât there to staff our armed forces-theyâve just chosen to go where the pay and appreciation matches the jobâs demandsâ (Denlinger, 2002, p. 116).  This is happening with our college graduates who are graduating with a teaching degree. These graduates choose to enter a higher-paying job and a career that they will have competitive wages, are appreciated and gain rewards. If the salaries became more competitive in education perhaps there would not be such a scarcity of teachers and âthe quality of education would improve markedlyâ (Denlinger, 2002, p. 117).

==Conclusion==

In the world of education, teachers are a guiding light to students.  I think teachers are miracle workers when it comes to trying to get every student to pass a test.  Do doctors get all their patients to pass their tests in terms of being healthy and physically fit?  If they did, I would consider doctors miracle workers as well.  Teachers are also knowledge workers, transporting much knowledge while shaping the minds of our youth and thus have a responsibility and image to uphold.  In todayâs work force, there are many options available and college graduates are choosing careers simply because of the pay rather than choosing something that they love to do.  Whether looked at as a profession or not, teachers should be respected for what they are doing just as doctors and lawyers are.  In order to maintain some structure of professionalism in the educational environment, education systems need to take steps to make sure they handle this task efficiently.

According to Valeri R. Helterbran, EdD, an associate professor in the Department of Professional Studies in Education at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Indiana, &quot;identifying and engaging in professional strategies to develop oneâs own level of professionalism is important to the overall understanding of this topic and may be the lynchpin that makes the difference in determining whether or not a teacher is a professional.  Teachers must decide who they are and how they want to be perceived in the classroom.  Becoming increasingly professional implies a commitment to change, to strengthen, and to grow as a person and as an educator.  It is equally apparent that it is imperative for teachers, individually and collectively, to consider what they can do to ensure that they are practicing the art and craft of teaching in a manner that is of service to childrenâs achievement and society.  A more thorough understanding of the attributes of professionalism can serve as an introduction for preservice teachers and a reminder to both novice and seasoned teachers to ensure that they conduct themselves as professionally as possible.  Professionals take ownership of their job responsibilities, assignments, and personal conduct.  Being a professional is a matter of personally emulating and modeling the qualities we demand of our students and colleagues as scholars, contributors, and owners of personal destiny.  (Valeri R. Helterbran, Professionalism: Teachers Taking the Rein, 2008, p. 126)&quot;

'''Learning Objectives'''

- Students Should Be Able To Determine What Makes A Professional

- Students Should Be Able To Clearly Understand Why There Is A Debate About The Professional Status Of Teachers

- Students Should Be Able To Decide For Themselves If A Teacher Should Be Considered A Professional



== Introduction ==

Though at first it may seem surprising, the debate of whether or not teaching should be given the status of professional career exists. Through this article, we will explore what qualities constitute being a professional. Why wouldnât someone who has dedicated his life to instructing students be given the status of professional? Hasnât he received years of training prior to obtaining a college degree and qualification for this occupation? However, historically, teacher education has been criticized for a lack of âintellectual contentâ and âinferior intelligence of teachers,â thus negating (or seriously diminishing) any claims to being a profession (Soder, pg. 71.).  Teachers naturally disagree with this argument, setting forth their own reasons why they deserve the title.
[[Category:Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]]



== What Is A &quot;Professional&quot;? ==

Clearly from the fact that this debate exists, different definitions of professionalism exist and vary between individuals. For instance, a âbusiness professionalâ is one who holds a position ordered by things such as ethics, standards of behavior, and performance, as required of everyone within the workforce(Saringer,2009). The explanation found in the dictionary defines âprofessionalâ as âfollowing an occupation as a means of livelihood or for gain: a professional builder (professional).â Yet it also describes it as âa person who belongs to one of the professions, esp. one of the learned professions (professional).â Thus it appears that a professional occupation could be within a select category of occupations, or basically any job that can supports one's livelihood (Kelley, pg.2).



==Why Might A Teacher Not Be Considered A Professional?==

Critics argue that, &quot;a reasonably stable body of knowledge based on high-quality,&quot; almost universally accepted research within workers in the field &quot;systematically imparted by its training institutions&quot; are not criterion teachers can declare. Rather, they claim that it is fundamentally based on teachers personal philosophies zealously put into practice, &quot;and not on anything (one) could call science&quot; (Edge). Also, in comparison to other professions, such as engineering, the medical profession, etc., which are continuously developing based on new discoveries and studies, teacher development has remained relatively stagnant. Standards must move with time, and not remain stationary. Generations develop and change. We are not who our grandparents were. This fact alone should constitute changing teaching conditions(Sachs, 2003).
Professionalism advocates who maintain that teaching fails to meet the professional standard also state that, &quot;Because of its historically weak knowledge base and highly uneven preparation programs, critics often compare the teaching occupation to journalism, where some practitioners are highly trained and others just learn on the job&quot; (Edge). However, theoretically, if this statement is true, even if educators don't start out as professionals, they should eventually become such as they gain experienced.



== Does The Criteria For Being A Teacher Fit The Description?==

In Moss Glenn Schwabâs book '''''Portrait of a Professional''''', the guidelines with which the professionalism of an occupation can be gauged are as follows:

âThere is an accepted body of specialized knowledge necessary for good professional practice&quot;, and &quot;Expert knowledge and professional skill require extensive specialized training (Moss, pg. 30).â Considering that teachers have had at least four years of schooling and training before receiving their certification, it seems reasonable to contend that it meets this first requirement. Specifically, a future educator must, at the minimum, acquire a bachelor's degree or certification in the field of education, as well as in their concentrated subject (Oak, 2008). This is consistent with the requirements for many professions such as counselors, engineers, business managers, and architects(New York). A differing characteristic though is that with teaching, the certification requirements may vary from state to state, meaning other criterion in addition to a certification are necessary. Highly developed supplementary training is a common condition(Oak, 2008).

&quot;Admission to professional training is selective and based on academic aptitude and appropriate personal qualities(Moss, pg.30)&quot; Basic teaching requirements include necessary relational skills to engage students as well as the academic qualifications(Oak, 2008).



== Conclusion==

Surely teacher development could stand to advance, thus ensuring the cementation of the title of professional. Considering that standard teaching requirements meet the standard professional requirements, teaching should obviously be considered a profession. Learning never ends, and educators of all people should understand this and never be satisfied with mediocre standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Teacher Training: Ideal vs. Reality''' ==

By Adrienne Scott 

=='''Introduction'''==

Teachers have the rare opportunity to mold a personâs life forever. Itâs no wonder that with such a tremendous responsibility comes conflict. People are beginning to question if what teacher candidates are learning is effectively preparing them for their career. The question presentation by this issue is clear, âdo the ideal training teachers receive match with the reality they will face?â The answer however, is not as clear. Critics believe that institutions fall short when it comes to equipping teachers, not taking into account certain factors. Some of these factors are gender, technology availability, classroom experience, diversity, and social issues. On the other side are those who support institutions and their teaching programs. These supporters believe that teaching programs are sufficient and to make the programs any more specific would be detrimental to future teachers. There is no clear right or wrong answer on this issue. This chapter will serve as a source of information on the topic at hand. The goal of this chapter is to educate you on the topic so you will be able to make a more informed decision concerning teacher training, the ideal vs. the reality.

=='''Go Teacher U.!'''==

Teacher candidates often receive the best building blocks from their institutions. These blocks are styles, methods, and techniques, which give teacher candidates a foundation to build on. Many people criticize institutions for how they choose to prepare future teachers. The critics believe that an unreachable image of what teaching will be like is painted. In reality, institutions equip future teachers with all the tools they will need to become an effective teacher. For example, a course on integrating technology into the classroom might not be practical for teachers who will teach in inner-city schools, low budget school districts, or in communities suffering from digital divide. However, institutions realize that technology is becoming more accessible and that teachers need to learn how to be flexible and adapt to whatever school district they are in. It is the job of the institution to educate teacher candidates on the basics of teaching. Those candidates will then be able to take their problem-solving and application skills, which they also learn in college, and tweak the basics to appropriate their school.

Institutions educate future teachers on how to be effective in their classroom. The bottom line is that there is no way institutions can prepare teacher candidates for everything that might happen throughout their teaching career. The U.S. Department of Education conducted a study of teachersâ reflections of their educational institutions. They found that most teachers believed âthere were issues for which no college or university could have prepared themâ (U.S. Department, 2008). Lisa Shipley, a seventh and eight grade teach in Missouri, believes that her university prepared her the best it could for the expected, but the unexpected is another story (U.S. Department, 2008). Shipley states âcollege did not prepare me for the student whose mother was murdered by a jealous boyfriend; for the student who witnessed a drive-by shooting; for the student who was removed from her home because of an abusive father. These realities do not exist in textbooks, yet they are, sadly, all too often the realities that peopleâwith real lives and real problemsâbring into my classroomâ (U.S. Department, 2008). Teacher preparation programs prepare future teachers in an effective manner, it is unfair for third parties to criticize this preparation because there is no way which teacher candidates can be completely prepared for the emotional stress their new job will bring.

Even after participating in teacher preparation programs, individuals really must complete on the job training in order to become more prepared and effective teachers.  One semester of student teaching generally does not adequately condition a future teacher in that it is impossible for them to encounter every possible conflict, just as Lisa Shipley had lamented (U.S. Department, 2008).  It takes a fair bit of on-the-job training or roughly two years to become competent at classroom management, and around six to seven years to become an effective teacher (Wallis, 2008).  This is where the harsh reality of the real world comes into play as many teachers struggle in their early years and consequently throw in the towel.  âBetween a quarter and a third of new teachers quit within their first three years on the job,â and this is due to how under-prepared the teachers are and what little support they receive from their respective schools (Wallis, 2008).

=='''Welcome To The Real World'''==

In college, students are taught that boys and girls should be treated the same at all times however, in the classroom it is important for the teacher to make the distinction between the two groups. This distinction should not be made to favor one group over the other but to target each group with the specific teaching styles that will best reach them. David Kommer, middle levels specialist at Ashland University, does not agree with what teacher candidates learn in college. Kommer believes that it is essential for teachers to be aware of differences in gender so that they are able to be âpurposeful in the treatment of each, and so they are able to send the healthiest messagesâ (Kommer, 2006). In fact, Kommer doesnât even believe that boys and girls should be treated the same, âOur goal is not to try to make boys and girls the same; we tried that several decades ago. We might have more success if we teach boys and girls to respond to each other as peopleâ (Kommer, 2006). 

Most colleges now require teacher candidates to take a course in technology integration. This course is wonderful; it enlightens future teachers on how technology is necessary and shows them how to use it to enhance the curriculum. The only problem with this class is that it makes the assumption that all schools will have up-to-date computer labs with various software and technology in every classroom. The reality is that many teachers will graduate college and begin their teaching career in an inner-city school, a school that doesnât have the resources to provide students with constant access to technology, or in a community suffering from digital divide. Digital divide is âthe gap between those who benefit from digital technology and those who do notâ (Smith, 2008). Digital divide may not seem that important but in reality it has a huge impact on the poverty problem around the world. âAccess to digital technology greatly enhances the effectiveness and affordability of efforts to improve the water supply, improve rural health and education, generate jobs and address any of the other interrelated problems of povertyâ (Smith, 2008). It is important for future teachers to be educated on digital divide and ways to close the gap.

âEveryone should be treated equalâ, this is a quote that many people pride themselves on, however, in education this declaration of equality could end up harming studentâs education. Teachers against prejudice (TAP), is an organization devoted to erasing prejudice in school systems. TAP believes that future teachers need to be trained âto create a level-playing field respecting the inherent right of all to self-identify rather than be labeledâ (Teachers, 2008). In the classroom, not every student is equal. Not every student learns the same way or has the same experiences, and teachers who treat them as though they do explicitly hinder their learning experience. Dr. Aretha Faye Marbley, an associate professor at Texas Tech University, believes that âthe future welfare and the national security of our country depends not only on how well we educate our children, but also on how well we prepare teachers for working with racially and culturally diverse learnersâ (Marbley, 2007). 

Institutions are not properly preparing teacher candidates for their future profession if they are not altering course content to match the present workforce. When teachers first enter a classroom they need to have knowledge about some of the social problems effecting children today.  &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;35%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;

[http://www.flickr.com/photos/annblairsphotos/234284199/ Today's Social Issues]This picture shows two high school students. One is drinking a beer and the other is pregnant. This picture is a snapshot of two major issues that teenagers are dealing with today, alcohol and sex. Effective educators need to be able to address these topics with sensitivity in a way that will reach their students. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; Future teachers should have even more knowledge about the social problems affecting the specific age group they plan to teach. Melissa Luroe, a seventh and eighth grade teacher in Maryland, feels as though her institution failed to prepare her for the social issues her middle-school students were dealing with. Luroe confesses, âMy children are dealing with issues I never imagined when I was a 13-year-old. AIDS, abuse, neglect, drugs, and sex are `buzz words' I overhear in the hallways, classrooms, lunchroom, and libraryâ (U.S. Department, 2008). Luroeâs college did not prepare her for handling these issues, but that will not keep her from tackling the problems, âas a teacher, mentor and friend, I have to deal with these issues every dayâ (U.S. Department, 2008).

=='''Bridging The Gap'''==

As you may recognize from the information provided on this topic, there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to figuring out if teaching training is ideal. However, choosing a stand on the issue is just the first step. Whether you support, oppose, or are just undecided on your view of teacher preparation programs, you must realize that many programs are not being finely altered. What this boils down to is that regardless of what teacher candidates believe, they must find a way to bridge the gap between the ideal and reality. 

Teacher candidates can help their ideal education become more like their future reality by taking initiative. One way for them to bridge the gap is to make the most of the experiences they do have. For future teachers this mean devoting time to studying and researching their subject and grade level and then putting those efforts into application during observation and practicum. This also means that teachers should be experimenting with different techniques and methods of dealing with children during their field experiences. Another way for future teachers to take initiative is by seeking outside opportunities to work with children and gain classroom experience. For some this may mean getting a job substituting in public schools or working at a day care center while for others, it may mean getting a summer job as a camp counselor. Taking responsibility is another way teacher candidates can help bridge the gap. Future teachers should know about the social issues their students are facing. Some way to do this are by attending PTA meetings, attending school board meetings, communicating with experienced teachers and community outreach programs, or simply by watching the local news.

My opinion of whether or not institutions are properly preparing future teachers falls somewhere between the two extremes. I believe that many colleges and universities are doing a good job by equipping teachers with basics that they will be able to mold and apply to many situations. However, it would be beneficial if these programs could focus more on realities teachers will face and classroom management. Good teaching can only go so far if the teacher canât reach the children, whether its gender, technology, diversity or social issues getting in the way. That said, educators need to stop blaming their teacher preparation programs for not being ready for the work force and except some of the blame themselves. Our generation differs greatly from that of our parents, so imagine how out of touch we will be with our students if an extra effort isnât extended. I believe that this extra effort is essential in a classroom to achieve effective learning.

== &lt;font color=&quot;33CC00&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Teacher Training: the Ideal vs. the Reality&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ==

Dominique Boals


== Learning Targets ==
Readers should understand the challenges that new teachers face and know how to get past them.

== Introduction ==
Every year students enter the teaching profession with a picture in their heads of a perfect classroom filled with perfect, well-behaved students. Many new teachers don't realize the difficulty that their new career comes with. Students are taught the essentials of teaching, but many don't know what they will face when they start in their new classrooms. Some people have argued that teachers aren't being prepared for things like inclusion students, social issues, or many other issues that they may face. 



== Ideal? ==
Nationally, twenty-two percent of teachers leave the profession during their first three years. One major reason for this is that they just weren't prepared for the obstacles ahead of them. Fifty-four percent of people who expressed interest in going into the teaching profession said that they would be more interested if they knew their students would be &quot;well behaved and eager to learn.&quot; It would be nice if you could just request certain qualities in a class and have your wishes granted. Children are unique, each one is going to have a different personality with different learning capabilities. Even if a class is absolutely perfect one year, a whole new batch comes in the next year (Depaul).

These are children, not little robots that need to be taught, they face many problems that effect their learning. Some children may have learning disorders, problems at home, or just be hyperactive children. Many classrooms also have inclusion students who require special attention. Universities teach students how to be teachers, however, some things cannot be taught. New teachers face many obstacles in their first few years that they may not have been introduced to in their training. The truth is, each individual teacher will face circumstances that you can't just be taught to deal with in a university. Could universities prepare their students for obstacles such as these? 

&quot;'I don't feel that my university could have better prepared me for the classroom. I learned many methods and theories of teaching, but have found that true teaching knowledge comes from experience. I am certain that I will continue to learn as long as I'm in the teaching profession. As we know, each day is filled with new opportunities.'âMelissa G. Lambert, 2nd grade, Oklahoma.&quot;

&quot;'No amount of lectures, books or student teaching could have prepared me for the enormity of teaching. However, the more experiences with children a program provides, the better. I think my college program could have placed more emphasis on children and the absolute necessity of commitment to them. Subject matter and instructional methods are very important to quality teaching, but without a strong commitment to children success is unlikely.'âMark White, 5th grade, Nebraska&quot;(What to Expect, 1998).

== Always be Prepared ==
How can new teachers survive their first few years? Schooling will teach you how to teach, but how can you be a good teacher? One way to stay afloat is to develop a support system. New teachers should get to know co-workers and get advice from veteran teachers. Veteran teachers know how to manage a classroom and they can help immensely. Another way to make sure you're prepared is to spend as much time in classrooms or around children as possible. Substitute teaching and working in daycare centers are just a couple of examples of ways to get acquainted with the teaching field. New teachers should try to be as prepared as possible, to avoid being surprised. However, surprises are pretty much inevitable when dealing with children (Depaul). It will take a while for any new teacher to get the hang of this career, it will take at least two years to master classroom management and six to seven years to be a proficient teacher. This isn't something learned overnight, it requires experience (Wallace, 2008).

- The reader will learn about the tests that one is required to take prior to becoming a teacher

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#3399FF&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;'''==

&lt;font color=&quot;6A287E&quot;&gt;&quot;Those who can't do, teach, and those who can't teach...teach gym&quot; (IMDb.com, Inc., 2008).  All silliness aside, in the movie &quot;The School of Rock&quot; the career of a teacher, in so many words, chose the main character.  Through various realistic, and unrealistic events, he learned to love the profession. However, he lacked the credentials and certification that teachers need to teach. 

All right, so life isn't exactly like the movies, but this particular movie does show an important point.  There are certain steps that a person has to take before he or she can be a licensed teacher.

In today's career driven society, there are always steps that you have to take to get where you want to go.  Becoming a teacher falls in line with this mentality. The first step to becoming a teacher is taking the plunge and deciding that you want to be in the field of education.  After this decision, you want to find a university offering a program that will earn you a degree and licensure to teach.  While taking various classes, you'll be required to take numerous exams to assess your competency on knowledge regarding your future as an educator.  After taking classes and teaching tests, you can receive your degree(s) and find a school to start your career as an educator.&lt;/font&gt;

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#3399FF&quot;&gt;What Makes a Good Teacher?&lt;/font&gt;'''==

&lt;font color=&quot;6A287E&quot;&gt;There are many qualities and characteristics that make up a good teacher.  Engaging, caring and innovative are some things that may come to mind. According to Dr. Richard M. Reis, a professor and executive director at Stanford University, the top priority of teachers should be that they want to be good teachers.  In his article he states that as teachers &quot;we respect students who really try, even if they do not succeed in everything they do, so they will respect us, even if we are not as good as we want to be&quot; (Reis, 2007).  Your future students will know that you want to be a good teacher if you yourself strive to become one.  To supplement this point, &quot;among 150 teachers in the first three years of their careers aged under 26 reveals that 85 per cent of this 'Generation Y' probably or definitely want to be working in a school in 20 years, with only two per cent definitely not&quot; (National College for School Leadership).  With this being said, teachers with enthusiasm are working in the education field today. 

In addition, Reis adds that teachers should be good listeners as well (Reis, 2007).  With the varying ages, gender and personalities of your future students, it will benefit you and the students you teach to listen to what works for them, and what to never try again.

There are many opinions on what goes into a good teacher, but only you can implement the characteristics in your own teaching career.&lt;/font&gt;

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#3399FF&quot;&gt;Getting Your Degree&lt;/font&gt;'''== 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;65%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFFFF;
border: solid 10px #0033FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0033FF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;According to The Apple, teachers in the United States with a Master's degree can get paid any where from $2,000 to almost $10,000 more than what they would be getting paid with only a Bachelor's - The Apple.&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;6A287E&quot;&gt;There are many programs that you can pursue on your way to get your degree.  First you would choose your specific grade level, then you would go onto to taking your various classes.  For example, at Old Dominion University, there are a few different educational tracks that you can pursue including: Pre-K - 3, Pre-K - 6, K - 12, K - 12 with a emphasis on Special Education, and Secondary Education which includes 6 - 12 (Darden College of Education 2008).

After picking a program, you will be required to take different courses such as History and Math, depending on your focus.  For example, if you were pursing a Bachelor of Science Degree in Interdisciplinary Studies Teacher Prep. with a Concentration on Pre-K - 3 Early Childhood Emphasis, you would be taking various general education courses, major content courses and some classes focusing on professional aspects of being a teacher (Old Dominion University Catalog, 2006-2008).  Within the profession education courses, you may be required to observe in the classroom among other things.  For example, during my observation period, I saw how a first grade classroom was taught and managed.  It was a rewarded experience that I'm glad is required for teachers in the state of Virginia.  I learned a lot and got to interact with the children as well.  Observing is just half the battle though.  After some professional education courses, you will still have other classes to pass.

Once you've graduated with your Bachelor's Degree, you may want to move on to take your Master's Degree.  You may be thinking that an extra year of school isn't going to matter.  There are two sides to this argument. According to Linda Gorman, a writer for the National Bureau of Economic Research, &quot; Teachers who entered teaching with a master's degree, or who earned it within five years of beginning to teach, were as effective as teachers without a master's degree&quot; (Gorman).  You may be one of the people who has what it takes to make it as a teacher with four years of college and an undergraduate degree.  Contrary to this opinion, according to The Apple, teachers in the United States with a Master's degree can get paid any where from $2,000 to almost $10,000 more than what they would be getting paid with only a Bachelor's (The Apple, 2008).&lt;/font&gt;

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#3399FF&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/font&gt;'''==

&lt;font color=&quot;6A287E&quot;&gt;There are many tests that are required for future educators to take.  Two of the most known ones in Virginia, that have many future teachers writhing in fear, are the Praxis 1 and 2.  According to the Educational Testing Service, better known as ETS, the Praxis is a test consisting of &quot;rigorous and validated assessments that provides accurate, reliable information for use by state education agencies in making licensing decisions&quot; (ETS, 2008).  Within these tests, you will be assessed on basic mathematics, reading and writing skills in the Praxis 1, along with a specialized test that is more focused on the path of education that you chose to go for in the Praxis 2 (ETS, 2008).  Preparing for the Praxis tests can be very intimidating, but your university may provide help with prepping for the tests.  Along with this, you can also purchase a study guide for the Praxis tests online or your local bookstore.  I found that practicing with old praxis tests was very useful for helping me pass my Praxis tests.

After achieving a passing score on the Praxis 1 and 2 tests, you have a couple more tests to pass.  The Virgina Communication and Literacy Assessment (VCLA) and the Virginia Reading Assessment (VRA) are two tests that assess your knowledge communicating and literary abilities and how well you can teach reading skills (2008â2009 VCLA and VRA Registration Bulletin, 2008).  These tests are required to be taken by future elementary education and special education students that want to teach in Virginia (2008â2009 VCLA and VRA Registration Bulletin, 2008).

Once you achieve passing scores on the tests listed above, you're ready to apply for a teaching license.  Applying for licensure is different for every state. For example, in the state of Virginia, &quot;An individual seeking licensure must establish a file in the Department of Education by submitting a complete application packet, which includes official student transcripts &quot; (Virginia Department of Education, 2007). For a general list of what to do to apply for your teaching license, you may want to visit a general website such as Ehow.com (Reynolds, 1999 - 2008) or ask your university for information.&lt;/font&gt;

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#3399FF&quot;&gt;Venturing Into The Real World of Education&lt;/font&gt;'''==

&lt;font color=&quot;6A287E&quot;&gt;Now that you're licensed to teach, you can now start looking into finding a career.  According to the Department of Labor, &quot;Job opportunities for teachers over the next 10 years will vary from good to excellent, depending on the locality, grade level, and subject taught&quot; (U.S. Department of Labor, 2007).  The reason for the good outlook on jobs is that many teachers may be retiring.  

Along with finding a job as a teacher, you may want to further your career to become an administrator to a school, or even a superintendent to a school district.  For these job opportunities to work out, you would have to go back to school again.  Along with this, you may want to try for your PhD in education.

You may also want to teach classes at a local recreation center, or do volunteer work helping a teacher a school around your neighborhood.  Although it may not be a paying job, I believe that every one still has time to learn something no matter what stage they are at in their lives.  Along with this, you can gain experience, and give a local teacher a helping hand.

Another career move could be possibly teaching overseas.  There are many teaching abroad programs and you could even become a teacher through the Department of Defense or the Department of State (U.S. Department of State, 2008). &quot;During 1995-96, 190 schools received grant assistance and technical support from A/OPR/OS. Because they are private institutions, these schools hire their own staffs&quot; (U.S. Department of State, 2008) and many of these schools are over seas.  Personally, I plan on trying this program sometime in my near future career as an educator.&lt;/font&gt;

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#3399FF&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;'''==

&lt;font color=&quot;6A287E&quot;&gt;Although there is a long process in becoming a teacher, I believe that the product from your hard work will be more than rewarding.  Through the classes, the credentials, and the tests, you get a license to teach students in a chosen state, or even all around the world if that is where life takes you.

Much like Jack Black's Character in &quot;The School of Rock&quot;, if the career of teaching does choose you, or you choose it, what is most important in my eyes is the students that you will be teaching.  Whether you become an elementary school teacher, or a gym teacher, the steps all boil down to the deciding that education is in your intended career.&lt;/font&gt;

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;3399FF&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/font&gt;'''==

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;33CC00&quot;&gt;A Teacher Checklist'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;33CC00&quot;&gt;By Megan Whitford&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


'''&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC00&quot;&gt;Learning Objectives&lt;/font&gt;'''

The reader will be able to: 

&lt;font color=&quot;33CC00&quot;&gt;-describe common characteristics that teachers should possess

- understand and describe what tests are necessary for licensure   

- describe an alternative for going back to school&lt;/font&gt;


=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC00&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;'''==
The teaching profession is not for everybody.  How do you know?  Characteristics and expectations can be found in any career, but education is the foundation for every childâs life.  Once you know that teaching is for you, one of the hardest parts is dedicating yourself to an accredited institution for at least four years.  It may be hard, but the end result should be worth it.  Becoming a teacher requires at least a bachelorâs degree in an education related field and especially now, a masterâs degree is often preferred upon receiving a license to teach.  While completing the bachelorâs a number of tests are necessary.  Also, the state of Virginia offers an alternative for people deciding later on in life that teaching is the place to be.

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC00&quot;&gt;Characteristics&lt;/font&gt;'''==
As our society increases so does the demand for new teachers.  As described by veteran teachers, âteaching is difficult, wonderful, exhausting, fun, stressful, enlightening-and rewarding beyond compareâ (AFT).  If this sounds like too much then considering another career option might be wise.    

Not only is the demand for new teachers high so is the demand of your time.  A teacher needs to have certain characteristics that will aid them in the classroom.  The saying Patience is a virtue can be understood when dealing with any age child.  Not every child or adult you teach is at the same pace as others requiring more energy from you.  If a teacher is not patient how can they expect a child to exhibit the same behavior?  It is the responsibility of the teacher to have obedience in the class therefore some form of leadership needs to accompany the teaching style.  Children will respond better if a teacher shows passion for the material and for them.  Candidates need to have a passion for wanting to guide others in their educational endeavors as well as learning from them.   

Having a sense of humor can go a long way when dealing directly with children. According to McDermott and Rothenberg students enjoy teachers with a sense of humor and found those teachers made learning fun (McDermott 2000).  It is hard to pay attention in class when the teacher drones on in a monotone voice and can not take a joke or laugh at a mistake.  A good teacher can laugh with the class from time to time and even show that by laughing at a mortifying situation, a new way to handle a problem has occurred.  Being prepared and having a positive attitude positively affects the students.  These and many more are great characteristics for a teacher to display because students are able to take them seriously and in a positive manner.

''(Peace Corps)''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC00&quot;&gt;First Things First&lt;/font&gt;'''==
After deciding that you want to teach, the first thing to do is find an institution that has an approved teacher preparation program.  There are 38 colleges and universities that offer a variety of education curriculums in Virginia (Teacher Education).  Education Worldâs website http://www.education-world.com/jobs/state_certification.shtml is a wonderful resource to use in order to find a state University or College where you live. Once the institution is chosen the next choice is the degree you would like to pursue.  At Old Dominion University there are many degrees in which you can major in, such as:

-	Interdisciplinary Studies Teacher Preparation Pk-3, Special Education k-12, or Pk-6

-	K-12 Subject areas (Art, Music, Health and Physical Education)

-	Secondary Education 

For Old Dominion and other universities there are admission requirements and application procedures that take place.  By maintaining a grade point average of at least 2.75 and a passing Praxis I score of 532 a student is admitted into the particular academic department they choose (Darden College 2008).  At ODU the College of Education has degree programs at the undergraduate level that lead to a fifth year masters.  Student teaching is also a step to completing the bachelors.  Not all education majors or minors, depending on the curriculum, are required to do a 30 hour observation either.

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC00&quot;&gt;Next Things Next&lt;/font&gt;'''==
In order to finish with at least a bachelor's, you have to take specific tests that count towards your licensure.  The Educational Testing Service website is a great resource for future teachers.  It gives descriptions of the Praxis 1 and 2(subject test) and is the site you register to take those two tests.  The VCLA and VRA registration website is a good resource for the other initial licensure tests. 

-'''Praxis 1'''- As stated by the Educational Testing Service, &quot;The Praxis I Pre-Professional Skills Tests (PPSTÂ®) measure basic skills in reading, writing and mathematics and include multiple-choice questions and an essay question on the Writing test. The tests are designed to evaluate whether you have the academic skills needed to prepare for a career in education&quot; (ETS 2008). 

-'''Praxis 2'''-  &quot;Praxis II Subject Assessments measure knowledge of specific subjects that Kâ12 educators will teach, as well as general and subject-specific teaching skills and knowledge&quot; as stated by the Educational Testing Service (ETS 2008)  

-'''Virginia Communication and Literacy assessment'''-  Unless someone is exempt from this assessment it is required for initial licensure.  A composite score of 470 is considered passing.  According to the registration website,  &quot;the VCLA measures the communication and literacy skills necessary to teach and communicate effectively with parents and others in the education community. The VCLA consists of two subtestsâa reading subtest and a writing subtest&quot; (VCLA n.d).

-'''Virginia Reading Assessment'''- According to the VCLA and VRA registration website &quot;the content of the VRA is organized into objectives, which are aligned with the SOL and reading competencies contained in the Regulations Governing the Review and Approval of Education Programs in Virginia and the Virginia Licensure Regulations for School Personnel and consistent with the recommendations of the Committee to Enhance the Kâ12 Teaching Experience in Virginia, the Advisory Board on Teacher Education and Licensure (ABTEL), and the Panel for Reviewing Reading Assessment for Initial Licensure&quot; (VCLA n.d)

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC00&quot;&gt;An Alternative&lt;/font&gt;'''==
What happens when you decide that the career you are in is not what you want to be doing?  
If you are certain that teaching is for you and have already been to school for something else, it is never too late to switch paths to become an educator.  The Virginia Department of Education offers a career switcher program that allows people outside the teaching profession the opportunity to develop into a qualified educator.  That individual has to have a bachelorâs degree from an accredited school along with at least five years of work experience, and passing teacher examination scores, for example the Praxis II and Virginia Communication and Literacy Assessment (Virginia Career).  The career switcher program is offered by four Universities including Old Dominion University.  It is a great program to get into if continuing an education.  &quot;In just two years the Career Switcher Program has graduated more than 1000 highly qualified and motivated teachers for Virginia classrooms. Students are benefiting from the knowledge and life experience these teachers bring to the classroom.&quot; commented Jo Lynne DeMary Superintendent of Public Instruction (Career 2007). 


=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC00&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;'''==
The teaching profession can be a rewarding and extremely challenging field to enter.  There are multiple characteristics that all teachers should possess in order to engage and enhance a childs learning.  Requirements for acceptance into an education program include passing the Praxis I and maintaining a GPA.  Not only are the classes rigorous, so are the tests required for initial licensure.  The steps to licensure involve a lot of work, but in the end when you have a bachelor's or a master's degree and are doing something you love the sacrifice and commitment should be well worth the time and money.          

=='''&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC00&quot;&gt;Multiple Choice Questions&lt;/font&gt;'''==
1.	Which of the following would not be an Old Dominion University Interdisciplinary Studies Teacher Preparation major?

a.	K-12 Subject Areas

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Are the Best Teachers Highly Qualified?'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''by Kelley Atkins'''



== Introduction ==

What is teaching exactly? Some argue that it is a learned profession, others say it requires many years of training. I believe it is a combination of both. âTeaching is, or ought to be, a difficult and complex endeavor. When one considers what is expected of a teacher in terms of end results- the preservation and improvement of our culture and civilization- teaching is perhaps the most important job in a democratic society.â (Troen and Boles, 34 and 35)


== Personally Qualified ==

Teachers are a special kind of human beings. They are willingly entering a career with minimum room for promotion, hardly any recognition from society, a dastardly amount of pay, and in many cases, unfavorable working conditions. It takes a special person to become a teacher, especially to become a good teacher. Anyone can become a teacher, hence the phrase, âThose who canât do, teach.â  In order to become an influential teacher you not only have to be highly qualified, you have to be highly dedicated. In the book âExtraordinary Teachers, The Essence of Excellent Teaching,â Fred Stephenson outlines the qualities of an extraordinary teacher:

1.	Extraordinary teachers have a great passion for their work.

2.	Extraordinary teachers know what to teach, how to teach, and how to improve.

3.	Extraordinary teachers excel at creating exciting classroom environments.

4.	Extraordinary teachers connect exceptionally well with students.

5.	Extraordinary teachers challenge students to reach their full potential.

6.	Extraordinary teachers get extraordinary results.

Stephenson, Introduction page xix.

Standards, degrees, laws, or any other structural requirement is not stated on this inspiring list. The essence of teaching is wanting your students to excel, genuinely caring about their success, and having the will to improve your own methods. It is a sad misconception that anyone can teach, and that it takes minimal skill and talent. To be a highly qualified teacher, one must be a dedicated, hard-working person, who is drawn to teaching through a sense of high purpose and social conscience. âThey genuinely like children and want to help them achieve success.â (page 32 Troen and Boles) Aside from these personal characteristics, a highly qualified teacher should also be competent. This is the side of teaching that requires passing exams, mastering material, and holding up to government standards.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;In my opinion, mastery of the subject matter and staying current, having a teaching plan, and being organized, and developing one's communication skills are the responsibility of ''every'' teacher. These are components of effective teaching that teachers owe their students.

''Keith J. Karnok'', &quot;Thoughts on College Teaching&quot; 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Standards ==

If our teachers are to become more highly qualified in an academic sense, we should make it a priority to make the standards and/or qualifications as well as their implementation more clear and concise. In a study performed to uncover the âimplementation of the highly qualified teacher provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act,â the following was found:

â¢While the majority of teachers were aware of the state requirements for highly qualified teachers, nearly half of the teachers said they had not received official notification of their status.

â¢Special education teachers were almost four times as likely to report that they were not considered highly qualified (15 percent) than were general education teachers (4 percent).

â¢Nearly all teachers reported taking part in content-focused professional development related to teaching reading or mathematics, but only 20 percent of elementary teachers participated in more than 24 hours of professional development on reading strategies, and only 8 percent participated in extended training in teaching mathematics.

â¢About half of high school mathematics teachers (49 percent) said they received no professional development focused on the study of mathematics content.

â¢States have been working to update their data systems, but most reported difficulty tracking some data elements and in collecting and maintaining data on teacher qualifications.

â¢A minority of districts provided targeted support for teachers who were not considered highly qualified. About one-third of districts reported providing increased amounts of professional development to teachers who were not highly qualified with little variation by poverty or minority level or district size.

â¢Almost two-thirds (63 percent) of Title I instructional paraprofessionals were identified as qualified; 28 percent did not know their status. Paraprofessionals in medium- and high-poverty schools were notably less likely to have completed two years of college or an associate degree (one of the three NCLB requirements) than were paraprofessionals in low-poverty schools.

The No Child Left Behind Act has a meaningful and potentially influential purpose, but it has not been implemented to its full degree. If teachers were actually held to the standards it provides, school systems today would be a completely different level of achievement. Some of standards set by the NCLBA are listed below: 

â¢	Elementary teachers must pass a state test demonstrating their subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading/language arts, writing, mathematics and other areas of basic elementary school curricula. 

â¢	Middle and high school teachers must demonstrate a high level of competency in each academic subject area they teach. Such demonstration can occur either through passage of a rigorous state academic subject test or successful completion of an undergraduate major, a graduate degree, coursework equivalent to an undergraduate major, or an advanced certification or credentialing. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt; 
&quot;Good teaching requires a lifelong commitment to learning.&quot;

''by Fred Stephenson'', &quot;Extraordinary Teachers, The Essence of Learning&quot;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


The NCLBA defines âa highly qualified teacher as one who has (1) fulfilled the state's certification and licensing requirements, (2) obtained at least a bachelorâs degree, and (3) demonstrated subject matter expertise.â Meeting these standards is very important in the process of becoming a highly qualified teacher. In order to relay information to his/her students, a teacher must be confident in their own mastering of that information. âResearch shows that teacher subject-matter knowledge is greatly associated with student learning.â (wikiweb3) When a teacher is confident in their knowledge, it makes portraying that information easier and more effective. Requiring that teacher candidates pass certain tests and attain certain degrees gives further insurance of their competientcy.

== Conclusion ==

To become a highly qualified teacher is no easy task, in any sense of the term. Not only do you have to meet government standards, which are evaluated and altered very frequently, you also have to meet your own standards. Starting with personal characteristics that include compassion, dedication, and patience is ideal. Combing these attributions with standards provideded by a higher power only completes the model. Highly qualified teachers are indeed the best teachers, they are the only teachers. If a teacher is not highly qualified, I do not believe they are a teacher at all. An un-qualified teacher is merely someone looking to pay the bills, not change lives.

by Robert Carey



'''Learning Targets:'''

Students should be able to:

1. Describe the standards of a highly qualified teacher, in the eyes of the US Department of Education

2. Identify examples of recent changes in No Child Left Behind (NCLB), to the defenition of a highly qualified teacher 

3. Explain reasons why teachers in specific communities have more flexible licensing guidelines

4. Describe the standards that NCLB opponents believe make a highly qualified teacher

                                               -William Foster (Davis)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




One of the most argued over subjects in education today is, what constitutes a highly qualified teacher?  Is it that they know everything there is to know about their subject matter?  Is it that they can manage their classroom in an effective way?  Or, is it that they have a good mix of both?  These questions are central in the argument over what makes a &quot;Highly Qualified&quot; teacher.  

The opinion of the US Government is integral in the licensing/certifying of teachers.  It may not be a perfect opinion, however, it is the basis under how teachers are rated.  The US Department of Education believes that a highly qualified teacher must have three things.  They must have a bachelors degree, full state certification or licensure, and they must prove that they know each subject they teach (NCLB, 2004).  The Federal Government, State Governments, and School District all hope that teachers possess all of these qualities.  However, it is rare that school districts can fill all of their vacancies with what the government considers highly qualified teachers, especially in rural and urban settings.  Does this mean that the teachers that fill these vacancies are not good teachers or don't deserve the job?  States often find it necessary to relax their guidelines because they are desperate for teachers.  For instance, in Wisconsin, teachers must complete a Bachelors degree that includes a major in the subject that will be taught, plus education coursework, an 18 week student teaching internship, and if they are requested to teach in another field they will be expected to have a minor in that field.  However, Louisiana requires no degree in the specific course that the teacher will be teaching and no education coursework.  A six week student teaching internship is required (Darling-Hammond, 94).  State governments are in a tough predicament as they attempt to follow federal guidelines and insure that students have the guidance of the most qualified teachers.  

If a teacher does not have a bachelors degree, full state licensure, and know their subject matter, does this mean they are not qualified?  This is the question that government opponents have been asking ever since NCLB was passed.  Opponents of NCLB believe that classroom management, teacher-student relationship, and how effectively they can teach the subject matter are the most important factors in a highly qualified teacher.  This is shown as private schools and independent schools do not require even a bachelors degree to teach.  Barnett Berry, in his article ''What it Means to Be a Highly Qualified Teacher'', states that &quot;These are teachers who know not only their subject matter, but also how to organize and teach their lessons in ways that assure diverse students can learn those subjects.  These are teachers who can help each student reach higher academic standards, even when those students learn in different ways or have a learning disability or may not speak english as their first language...Highly qualified teachers don't just teach well-designed, standards-based lessons: They know how and why their students learn&quot; (Berry,2002).  Berry, along with many others, believes that there is more to a teacher than just an education.  Others, such as Carol Mullen and Jose Farinas, who wrote an article for ''Teacher Education and Practice'', entitled ''What Constitutes a Highly Qualified Teacher?, a Review of Teacher Education Standards and Trends'' believe that there are many other skills that teachers need and if they don't have them, they are at risk of failure.  They refer to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards 1987 report on what was wrong with education.  They found five ideas that would make a teacher qualified for the position.  A commitment to students and their learning, knowledge of subjects and effective pedagogy, responsibility for managing student learning, systematic thinking about practice, and affiliation with learning communities (Mullens/Farinas, 2003).  The majority of these are not mentioned in the NCLB guidelines, and many people, including teachers believe that they are necessary to be an effective teacher.  

Opponents of NCLB won a small battle in 2004, when the Department of Education changed some standards and became more flexible on the pursuance of becoming highly qualified. Rural districts have trouble filling teacher vacancies, and oftentimes, teachers are forced to teach more than one subject.  The Department of Education changed the guidelines to give teachers three years to become highly qualified (by their standards) in the other subjects.  Flexibility has also been given to Science teachers, who school districts are desperate for. They now must demonstrate a that they are highly qualified in either &quot;broad field science or individual fields of science&quot; (NCLB, 2004).  Certain teachers now have more freedom to pursue their qualifications in a timely manner, which was desperately needed by many.

As an educator, the term &quot;Highly Qualified&quot; is one that gets a reaction from many in the teaching field, and many outside of the teaching field.  There are numerous ways to translate exactly what it means to be highly qualified.  One side believes that you must be as educated as possible and if you are'nt, you better get educated quick.  This is the same side that believes that test scores determine how successful a teacher is.  In Florida, former Governor Jeb Bush instituted a merit-pay program which rewarded teachers for good test scores, believing that a students success is based on how effective his/her teacher is (Wallis, 2008).  Another side believes that the classroom dedication that a teacher has is the most important thing, and the rest will fall into place.  Either way you look at it, the one thing that everyone has in common, is that the students are the most important factor in any discussion.  Whats best for the student is whats best.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Advantages and Disadvantages of non-traditional educators &lt;li&gt; Creative Methods and Techniques &lt;li&gt; Value of Feedback.&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#663300&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
There are many new approaches to recruiting educators in high need subject areas including alternative and expedited routes to teacher licensure and career switching programs in order to gain the expertise of educators with previous professional work experiences.  Many people who are considering a career change look to teaching as a way to incorporate and apply their existing knowledge in a content area.  Many elementary, middle, and high schools are actively accepting applications for teachers in what the Virginia Department of Education calls the âcritical shortage areas such as mathematics, foreign languages, sciences, and technology educationâ (Education).

However, there is yet another educational career opportunity that is emerging and gaining respect and popularity in the classroom by the students ''and'' teachers!


&lt;font color=&quot;#663300&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
== &lt;big&gt;What is a ''non-traditional'' educational career?&lt;/big&gt; ==

Classroom based teachers are taking their students outside of their classroom and visiting science, nature, and history centers seeking more effective learning (Price).  These centers employ educational coordinators who deliver information to students through unique and creative methods.  These non-traditional educators, sometimes called âfield teachersâ (Payne), bring a unique edge to the educational experience for students and teachers alike.  

Non-traditional educators integrate different learning methods to meet the needs of different types of learners in a real world setting.   

They incorporate new knowledge with social interaction by prepare exciting lessons and creative activities for the students such as inside of the classroom or outside during a field trip.  

Non-traditional educators work with school teachers to meet the needs of the students and lesson plans as well as work with a school systemâs high expectations that the experience will be worthwhile (Payne).  


&lt;font color=&quot;#663300&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
== &lt;big&gt;Are they effective?&lt;/big&gt; ==

Non-traditional educators who present information to students through field trips, guest lectures, and other types of class demonstrations are gaining recognition for their effective teaching styles.


&lt;big&gt;''Advantages''&lt;/big&gt;

Non-traditional educators have some advantage over the traditional classroom teachers and lesson plans.   âTeachers teach daily.  If there is an important message, a different instructor can be a breath of fresh air to the students.  If an important message is taught incorrectly, you are sending the wrong message, and in my case, it could be deadly.â(Packett, 2009)

Non-traditional educators are an expert within the subject matter being taught.  They generally present the same information to audiences on a regular basis.  Packett discussed his advantage of his work history and experience that provided his concentrated knowledge base.  It allowed him to &quot;hone in on it and perfect it.â

Although field educators have advantages over a classroom based teacher, a cooperative relationship can be established.  Pre-visit and post-visit classroom based lessons can emphasize the learning experience.  Also, guest speakers and field educators can give validity to the classroom teacher by repeating terms and lessons that have been introduced in the classroom (Payne).

âwe offer things that support and complementâ what can be taught in the classroom.  


&lt;big&gt;''Disadvantages''&lt;/big&gt;

Non-traditional educators have a limited time to learn the types of students that are present in a classroom or in a class group.  This can present as a disadvantage for an instructor.  Also acting as a disadvantage is the limited amount of time to present subject material given the distance for travel or time restraints that surround the field trip or classroom period.  


&lt;big&gt;''Student Benefits''&lt;/big&gt;

Non-traditional educators recognize that students learn in different ways and there is a responsibility to teachers to present new knowledge in a way for all types of learners to benefit.  Some students need to have a reason for learning, some are able to learn new facts without needing a personal connection, while some students benefit most from exploring and learning firsthand (Payne).  Non-traditional educators take these differences into consideration and use various teaching techniques to connect to as many individual students in a classroom.  


''Connection to their world''

Students benefit from out-of-the-classroom opportunities that non-traditional educators present for many reasons.  The presentations allow students the chance to connect with a new environment outside of the classroom.  Also, students are eager to learn if the lessons of the classroom can be applied to their real world (Payne).  Teagle further explains, âwe are also teaching students the value of working in the field.  History is not just in books, but in the artifacts.â


''Alternative to Lectures''

Some non-traditional educators use constructivist principles and social interactions using small groups as an alternative to lecture methods (Payne).  Payne explains, âTelling is not teachingâ.  


''Small, interactive groups''

He explained that during field trips, smaller groups led by parent chaperones and teachers allow for easier orchestration of rotating stations, maximizing the amount learning for students and exposure to new material.  âWhen Iâm in the classroom, I tend to have larger groups.  When groups get large, retention goes down.â


''A unique perspective''

When students and teachers take field trips and visit farms, museums, and other places, visitors &quot;get the sights and smells and all of the studentâs senses are filled&quot; (Packett, 2009).  Teagle adds, âwe offer a different perspective of the 1700âs and a unique setting to the students.  We are teaching kids how to make research and learning a continuous process.  We are unearthing new information every day, just as weâve shown them in the artifacts digging stationâ(Teagle, 2009).




&lt;font color=&quot;#663300&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
== &lt;big&gt;Who are they?&lt;/big&gt; ==

Non-traditional educators come from a variety of backgrounds to teach a variety of specialty subjects.  
They are safety educators, museum interpreters and curators, history and environmental site educators, and trainers for advanced educational workshops.  


Andrew Packett, Public Relations Coordinator for [http://www.nnec.com/ Northern Neck Electric Cooperative], has 20 years of experience as a non-traditional educator.  Formerly a 
[http://www.dare.com DARE Drug Abuse Resistance Education]officer for drug prevention, he currently teaches electrical safety to elementary school children.  Packett says âWho better to go into the classroom to teach electrical safety, but me.  It should be an expert in the field.â


After spending several years as an interpreter for [http://www.shirleyplantation.com/ Shirley Plantation], Virginiaâs historic first plantation, Robert Teagle is the Education Director and Curator for [www.christchurch1735.org/ Historic Christ Church].  His years of experience in interpretation and personal interest in Virginia history offer visitors a unique perspective.  


Some historical and environmental site educators use their settings' existing resources as a tool for teaching.  The Chesapeake Bay Foundationâs [http://www.cbf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=edu_sfe_resid_pi Port Isobel Island Study Center] and [http://www.cbf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=edu_sfe_resid_fox/ Fox Island Study Center] offer the perfect setting for their Field Educators to carry out [http://www.cbf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=lrn_sub_teachers/ Chesapeake Classrooms] courses.  


An interesting alternative is the National Park Serviceâs [http://www.nps.gov/learn/trt/ Teacher to Ranger to Teacher program] that draws from all perspectives as a traditional classroom instructor, a Ranger student, and a field instructor
(Interpretation and Education).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#663300&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;Advice from the experts&lt;/big&gt; ==

&lt;big&gt;''Persue it!''&lt;/big&gt;

Robert Teagle encourages all educators who are considering a non-traditional career to &quot;Persue it!&quot;  He has created an impressive workshop for elementary age school children, complete with take home art work and post-visit history fairs where children can win exciting prizes.  


&lt;big&gt;''Be Enthusiastic!''&lt;/big&gt;

Andrew Packett encourages non-traditional educators to incorporate excitement into their presentations. âI come into the classroom very enthusiastic!  The level of enthusiasm you must maintain, to capture studentsâ attention and keep it, can be exhausting!â


&lt;big&gt;''Learn the Terms!''&lt;/big&gt;

Packett also recommends familiarizing yourself with the public school system.  Field educators should target the curriculum.  &quot;You must address the Virginia SOLâs or you may not get into the classroom.&quot;  Also, if classroom experience is limited, a field educator &quot;must enter the classroom and observe the grade levels that you will be presenting information to.  You need to understand the terminology and acronyms in current public school systems!&quot;


&lt;big&gt;''Make it fun!''&lt;/big&gt;

Teagle and Packett both agree that field experiences and guest speakers into the classroom must include an element of entertainment.  Make it fun!  Use active learning and hands-on stations.


&lt;big&gt;''Value of Feedback''&lt;/big&gt;

Lastly, field educators place high value on post-visit feedback from classrooms and teachers.  Questionnaires can be completed by the students and teachers as well as informal types of feedback such as thank you letters from the schools.  Assessments that occur during the educational sessions are also of value.  Teagle says &quot;kids provide the best critiques&quot;.  When performing activities with the children, he critiques his own lesson plans and learns best by doing activities with the children.  He concludes that he uses this valuable feedback to help shape the content of future school groups.

=='''LEARNING TARGETS'''==

The reader will be able to identify  the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning.

The reader will be able identify the issues that are considered both advantages and disadvantages by both sides for almost identical reasons.
----

=='''INTRODUCTION'''==
Distance learning was once considered a nontraditional teaching career, however in the last half decade it is becoming more and more common. Not only colleges , but high schools , and even grade schools are participating in distance learning programs.   Distance learning is defined by the NEA as &quot;A courses with more than half of the instructions taking place when students and faculty are in different locations&quot;( Abacus Associates 2000, page 5 ).Distance learning includes online courses as well as televised and hybrid courses that consist of either or both  online or televised with classroom participation.  It is a relatively recent innovation given impetus by advances in communications and computer technology in the last decade. There is some dispute by educators whether distance learning is a blessing or a curse. I hope to present a brief overview of both sides. You will see as the facts are presented that both sides often see the same category as either a curse or  a blessing for almost identical reasons.


=='''THE DISSENTERS VIEW'''==
Most faculty who have been involved in distance learning are concerned that they are working longer hours with no added compensation. They are also concerned about the loss of their intellectual property. I spoke to an instructor in a Western Virginia community college who ask not to be named who said that their dean told them after they developed their online class that anyone could take over and teach it. They voiced a fear that once the work was completed the college would get adjunct faculty to take over for much less compensation. This person says they have spent 8 to 12 hours a day one day a week on their day off for months  without compensation developing an online class in the hopes that once it is up and running they will see some compensation, both fiscal and emotional when their students excel.  ( Anonymous January 2009)   

Faculty members also are concerned about the anonymity and impersonality of online classes. Some faculty miss the social structure and the face to face communication. They complain that a discussion  that could take place in a class room in a matter of half an hour can take over a week online and by then who can remember what was said?( Susan Sharp April 2005 p. 2 ) Susan Sharp a professor of English at a Northern Virginia community college for over 20 years,  complained in her article in the Washington Post &quot; Why online teaching turned me off&quot; that &quot; student discussion and interaction was limited by the very fact that all communication was through emails and discussion boards. Which interrupted the flow of ideas&quot;( Sharp 2005p. 5 ).Some instructors feel that personal feedback is vital in forming an appropriate response to individual student needs. &quot; it is very hard to have the personal touch when you never meet your students  and are unable to put a face to a name&quot;( Sharp 2005 p.3).

&quot;It is so exhausting as well as frustrating, trying to answer 40 to 60 emails a day in addition to all the other duties of an instructor&quot;(Anonymous). In online writing students are protected by anonymity and students who don't ordinarily have much to say often speak up &quot;A computer screen is not as intimidating as a classroom of peers. However, with the disappearance of intimidation the fear of hurting others vanishes as well&quot;.( Sharp 2005 p.3 )The main complaint that almost every teacher voicing disfavor able opinion of distance teaching is they can't look their students in the eye while they teach . And without that kind of feedback they don't feel they can meet a students needs. &quot; How can you tell id they are getting it if you cant see their faces?(Anonymous 2009).

=='''THE ADVOCATES VIEW'''==
Although most faculty involve in distance learning share the same concern over loss of intellectual property and inadequate compensation for their work they also feel it is more than made up for by having the opportunity to offer high quality education to so many students who would not other wise have the opportunity of attend college(Abacus associates 2000). However, college is not the only venue for distance learning.Schools k-12 across the country are establishing video by satellite and online distance learning courses in everything from kindergarten phonics to complete high school curriculums. See sidebar for links about k-12 online curriculum.( Los Angles center for Distance and online learning, 2009).&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF66FF;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
The University of Missouri even offers a complete online high school curriculum to students who can't get the courses they want at the traditional schools they attend(University of Missouri Online, 2009). The majority advocated appear to  believe  what educator and author,Professor Mark Kassop wrote in his  article for the Technology Source Archives at the university of North Carolina: that there are  &quot;Ten Ways Online Education Matches , or Surpasses  Face to Face Education&quot; . Briefly they are &quot;'''&quot;1. Student centered learning:'''Students are empowered to learn on their own and even to teach one another.'''2.Writing intensity:''' Due to the writing intensity often required by many online courses the quality of many students writing improves over the duration of the course. '''3.Highly interactive discussions:'''Class room discussions are often limited to the same extroverted students offering spontaneous and often un-researched responses. In online classes students who have never spoken up offer their ideas and responses, because of the anonymity of the forum. Students also have the opportunity to research and contemplate the questions and compose appropriate answers.'''4. Geared to life long learning:''' Distance learning teaches students to find and learn information on their own. The on line environment fosters self-motivated education. Online resources establish a framework that gives precedence to the autonomy of the learner. '''5.Enriched course material:'''  Well constructed online distance learning courses can offer  students in all curriculums access to world class resources 24 hours a day 7 days a week.''' 6.On-demand interaction and support services:''' Help is only a click away in an online course. Instructors can offer many types of interactive learning aids on their course sites as well as immediate feedback on tests  etc. Also contact with the instructor and classmates  through e-mail can occur any time.  '''7. Immediate feedback:'''Online students generally have greater access to instructors. And can and do email countless questions to their professors and frequently engage in dialogue that would be hard to duplicate in a face to face world. Assignments can be returned to students more promptly and usually with more grading feedback than in a traditional setting.'''8.Flexibility:''' Students with adult responsibilities are often unable to commit to traditional courses because of scheduling conflicts. Online learning gives these nontraditional students opportunities to pursue course work at any time that fits into their schedules '''.9 an intimate community of learners:'''Many instructors say that they have developed close relationships with their students online. And it is not uncommon for participants in an online course to develop a sense of community.  The anonymity of online courses allows students to open up more that in a classroom  environment.10.'''Faculty development and rejuvenation:'''On line teaching is frequently much more work, however many express how satisfying and energizing the creative processes of achieving the same instructional goals in an entirely new format are&quot;( kassop May/June 2003).

These ten reasons why this particular professor believes distance learning matches or surpasses traditional classroom education encapsulates the majority view of favorable opinions concerning the distance learning mode of teaching.

=='''AUTHOR'S VIEW'''==
Although there was much more material available on the advocates side of the issue I have found that educators who dislike distance  leaning  return to the traditional classroom rather quickly. And therefore there is less information on their views.  And those who do like the medium tend to grow with it. Both sides are concerned with compensation for the extra hours of labor that distance learning requires of instructors, and the compensation for or loss of their laboriously created intellectual property. In my opinion in the future educator's contracts will out of necessity include negotiations for intellectual property and time spent developing distance and online courses. Distance learning clearly is the wave of the future. And while it is still considered a nontraditional teaching method I feel sure it will be considered the norm in the very near future. Teaching has always been what I call an ice burg occupation, 9/10 of the effort is under the surface in preparation for the classroom. Teachers have always worked many more hours  than their pay stubs show. And it looks like the trend will continue indefinitely. As an education major and novice distance learning student I share the concerns of both sides of the issues of uncompensated work and loss of intellectual property. However distance learning is the future of education and I think we had all better prepare to join the team

=='''CONCLUSION'''==
In conclusion distance learning is becoming one of the more important modes of education. It enables students who otherwise would not be able to take courses to continue their educations while meeting career and family obligations. It solves the problem of lack of classroom space. Although some faculty and students find that their teaching and learning styles don't fit the new trend  that the majority involved find it exciting and challenging. As technology advances I see a not so distant future where all traditional classes will be distance learning. And nontraditional classes will be held in classrooms of brick and mortar.

'''by Dionne Nichols'''

&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;

What makes a teacher?  Teaching is like a salad.  Think about it.  If you were to attend a party for any given holiday, the number of and variations to each salad recipe that might be present for consumption could outnumber those present at the party.  There are so many different ways to teach, varying circumstances to take into account, and philosophies to apply to each classroom.  And what better way to have a positive impact on the world than to offer knowledge for consumption?  The term âteacherâ can be applied to anyone who imparts knowledge of any topic, but it is generally more focused on those who are hired to do so (teach, n.d., n.p.).  In imparting knowledge to our students, it is inevitable that we must take into account our own personal philosophies, or pedagogies, and determine not only how we decide what our philosophies are, but also how those impact our consumers.
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #6CC417;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
  ''An analogy is one of a teacher's most useful tools. It helps the instructor relate a difficult concept to something the students will already have the infrastructure for, thus enabling the students to cement the ideas in their mind.'' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;big&gt;'''Lessons in Pedagogy'''&lt;/big&gt;

Early teacher education classes frequently separated the concept of philosophy into separate schools (Roberson, 2000, p. 8).  âPhilosophy has been taught in the theoretical realm rather than the practical sense,â meaning that the ideas were placed before the teachers without the scaffolding to create a bridge into the classroom (Roberson, 2000, p. 7).  The teachers, as students, were given a body of thought and expected to translate that into lessons for their own students.  Once you have the idea, how do you apply it to teaching?  

What, exactly, are education philosophies?  According to Thelma Roberson (2000), most prospective teachers confuse their beliefs with the ideas of teaching (p. 6).  Education philosophies, then, are not what you want to do in class to aid learning, but why you do them and how they work.  For example, Robersonâs students state they âwant to use cooperative learning techniquesâ in their classroom.  The question posed is, why?  â[I]s cooperative learning a true philosophy or is it something you do in the classroom because of your belief about the way children learn?â (Roberson, 2000, p. 6).  Philosophies need to translate ideas into action â if you want to use certain techniques, then you need to understand how they are effective in the classroom to create that portion of your education philosophy.  It helps to have an overview of the various schools out there.

Philosophies of Education have traveled down a tree of branches.  The first four support branches of philosophy are the Idealist school, the Realist school, the Pragmatist school, and the Existential schools of thought (Ornstein, 2003, p.99).  It might help to look at the tree and its individual branches rather than read about them...&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idealism - focuses on a subject-matter curriculum emphasizing the great ideas of the culture.  You must ponder ideas to make them whole (Ornstein, 2003, p.99). &lt;li&gt;Realism - A subject-matter curriculum stressing objective knowledge and values.  Reality is objective, meaning everyone should obtain the same results regardless of what he does or how he consider concepts (Ornstein, 2003, p.101)&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perennialism - Focuses on human concerns that have caused concern for centuries, revealed through 'great works' (Ornstein, 2003, p.110)&lt;li&gt;Essentialism - Rooted partially in Idealism, as well - Emphasizes skills and subjects that demonstrate the cultural heritage and contribute to society (Ornstein, 2003, p.110)&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pragmatism - Instruction is organized around problem-solving following the steps of the scientific method - emphasizes the need to act on concepts by testing them (Ornstein, 2003, p.104).&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Progressivism - Instruction features problem solving and group activities - The instructor acts as a facilitator as opposed to a leader (Ornstein, 2003, p.110)&lt;li&gt;Social Reconstructionism - Instruction that focuses on significant social and economic problems in an effort to solve them (Ornstein, 2003, pg.110)&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Existentialism - Classroom dialogue stimulates awareness - each person creates an awareness gleaned from discussion and encourages deep personal reflection on his or her convictions (Ornstein, 2003, p.108).&lt;/ul&gt;

'''Perennialism

Perennialists are instructors who feel that the knowledge that has been passed through the ages should be continued as the basis of the curriculum, like the classic works of Plato and Einstein. Perennialists base their teachings on reason, logic, and analytical thought. Only information that stood the test of time is relevant. They do not illicit student input. The classes most likely to be considered under this approach would be history, science, math, and religion classes (Educational Philosophies in the Classroom, pg.1).

'''Positivism

The instructors whose teaching philosophies are based on documented facts and tangible truths are normally those who would be in the math and science departments. These teachers do not feel that religion and the supernatural should be a part of the thinking process. The idea of uncertainty and the unknown is considered illogical (Educational Philosophies in the Classroom, pg.1).

'''Behaviorism

Behaviorists believe in rewards and punishments as an approach to controlling the teaching environment due to their belief in the intrinsic nature of humans to react to internal or external stimuli. This teacher-centered system ultimately allows the students to be controlled by the educator, who makes the environment pleasant or unpleasant depending on the students' behavior (Foundations of Education, pg.1).'''

'''Essentialism

Essentialists believe that there is a universal pool of knowledge needed by all students. The fundamentals of teaching are the basis of the curriculum: math, science, history, foreign language, and English. Vocational classes are not seen as a necessary part of educational training. Classrooms are formal, teacher-centered, and students are passive learners. Evaluations are predominately through testing, and there are few, if any, projects or portfolios. These instructors easily accept the No Child Left-Behind Act because test scores are the main form of evaluation (Foundations of Education, pg. 1).'''

'''Progressivism

This is a student-centered form of instruction where students follow the scientific method of questioning and searching for the answer. Evaluations include projects and portfolios. Current events are used to keep students interested in the required subject matter. Students are active learners as opposed to passive learners. The teacher is a facilitator rather than the center of the educational process. Student input is encouraged, and students are asked to find their interpretation of the answer (Educational Philosophies in the classroom, pg.1).'''

'''Reconstructionism

This student-centered philosophy strives to instill a desire to make the world a better place. It places a focus on controversial world issues and uses current events as a springboard for the thinking process. These students are taught the importance of working together to bring about change. These teachers incorporate what is happening in the world with what they are learning in the classroom (Educational Philosophies in the Classroom, pg.1).'''

'''Constructivism

Active participation is the key to this teaching style. Students are free to explore their own ideas and share concepts with one another in nontraditional ways. âHands on activity [â¦] is the most effective way of learning and is considered true learningâ (Educational Philosophies in the Classroom, pg.1).'''

'''Humanism/ Existentialism

Also a student-centered philosophy, this educational method is based on the idea that the students should be presented with choices about the learning process. The student is engaged in all aspects of learning and works together with the teacher and her peers to develop a curriculum and evaluation system that allows for individual interests and abilities (Educational philosophies in the Classroom, pg.1).'''

Your philosophy of education is what you believe about education and the way children learn.â  - Roberson pg 4 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


In addition, the âconstructivistâ school of philosophy, rooted in the Pragmatic pedagogy and branched off from the 'Social Reconstructivist' school, has gained much popularity.  Around the turn of the century (early 1990s), many teachers felt the rote memorization and mindless routine that was common then was ineffective, and began to look for alternate ways to reach their students (Ornstein, 2003, p.111).  Through the constructivist approach, &quot;students âconstructâ knowledge through an interaction between what they already think and know and with new ideas and experiencesâ (Roberson, 2000, p. 8).  This is an active learning process that leads to deeper understanding of the concepts presented in class, and is based on the abilities and readiness of the children rather than set curriculum guidelines (Ornstein, 2003, p.112).  Constructivism &quot;emphasizes socially interactive and process-oriented 'hands on' learning in which students work collaboratively to expand and revise their knowledge base&quot; (Ornstein, 2003, p.112).  Essentially, knowledge which is shaped by experience is reconstructed, or altered, to assist the student in understanding new concepts (Ornstein, 2003, p.112).  You, as the teacher, help the students build the scaffolding they need to maintain the information even after the test is taken and graded. 


&lt;big&gt;'''Four Philosophies in Assessment'''&lt;/big&gt;	

Once you know how you want to lead your classroom, it is important to consider how to assess your students' progress.  And when we think of school, we automatically consider the threesome subjects, Reading, Writing, and âRithmatic.  In all aspects of learning, however, the ability to communicate comes to the forefront.  Communication is used in class discussion as well as unit test short answers.  Writing is present in almost all subjects in some form, and writing translates to communication.  Richard Fulkerson (2000), in his article âFour Philosophies of Composition,â questions whether âa [â¦] set of four philosophies of composition might exist, each one stressing a different element in the communicative transactionâ (p. 3).  Fulkersonâs schools of communicative philosophy fall into the following categories:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Expressionism:''' a way of writing that demonstrates the studentsâ thoughts and can be lead by ânon-directive teachers, some of whom insist that one neither can nor should evaluate writingâ or more hands-on teachers who âdesign classroom activities to maximize student self-discoveryâ (p. 5).  This school of thought emphasizes the student. &lt;li&gt;'''Rhetorical:''' this school states that good writing is adapted to achieve a specific reaction from the audience (p. 6).  This is focused on the connection between goal and process in completing assignments, and it emphasizes the audience. &lt;li&gt;'''Mimesis:''' states that âa clear connection exists between good writing and good thinkingâ and focuses on logic and reason as exemplified in the completion of assignments (p. 5).  This school emphasizes a well-rounded student in that, research, prior knowledge, and the ability to recognize both sides of an argument are necessary for success (p. 6). &lt;li&gt;'''Formalism:''' this school focuses primarily on the form of the assignment â it disregards content to the extent that poor grammar can distract the audience from absorbing the content, and therefore, the work is judged âprimarily by whether it shows certain internal [mistakes]â (p. 4).&lt;/ul&gt;

While most teachers fall primarily into one school of composition pedagogy, Fulkerson (2000) points out that it is necessary to hold on to them all when he states âthey are not mutually exclusiveâ (p. 6).  The trick is to learn when each is applicable and to what extent it should be employed.  


&lt;big&gt;'''Hooked on Phonics?'''&lt;/big&gt;

So, you know how you want to lead your class, and you have an idea as to which kind of 'grader' you are.  What next?  Another area where teachers have struggled is simply in helping their students learn to or improve their reading.  How do we teach reading?  The two battling schools of thought are between those who support Whole Language, and those who support Phonics.  âThe disputes have been dubbed the Reading Wars, and the participants call them âviciousââ (Collins, 1997, n.p.).  Several states have even intervened and enacted laws mandating one or the other.

But what are they?  Just as their names state, the difference is in how the words are read.  Phonics was taught primarily in the 1970s (Collins, 1997, n.p.) and study the individual components of each word, called âphonemes,â which are the âsmallest meaningful sounds in a languageâ (Collins, 1997, n.p.).  âCat, for example, has three: âkuh-aa-tuhâ (Collins, 1997, n.p.). A reader needs to understand how the words are broken up and that each letter has its own sound in order to read (Collins, 1997, n.p.).  Phonic teaching focuses on code learning.  Once the students understand the âcode,â and how the words phonemes are put together, they are supposed to be able to understand the entire word.

Whole language advocates disagree with the process of breaking each word down.  They feel readers cannot focus on every letter in a word, or every word in a text (Collins, 1997, n.p.) and made their opinions known during the 1980s (Collins, 1997, n.p.).  If they did, âand if they tried to translate what they saw into sounds, reading would be much too cumbersomeâ (Collins, 1997, n.p.).  Instead, whole language teachers instruct their students in âskipping strategiesâ â ways of guessing which word comes next to fill in any blanks (Collins, 1997, n.p.). Overall, reading is considered an organic process by which the students learn phonics âonly when a question about phonics comes up in the course of readingâ (Collins, 1997, n.p.).  Whole language focuses on the meaning behind the words.


&lt;big&gt;'''Which is better?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Just as in many other walks of life, statistics and studies show that one philosophy of teaching will prevail over another.  The National Assessment of Educational Progress, as stated in J. Collinâs article (1997), claims that âfrom 1971 to 1980 there was a steady improvement in the reading comprehension of nine-year-olds.  However, during the 1980sâ¦the scores did not improve and rather declinedâ (n.p.).  

The 1990s brought the topic full circle.  It was then that Marilyn Adams, a cognitive psychologist, wrote a book describing the best methods to teach learning.  âPrograms that combined systematic phonics instruction with meaning emphasis seemed to work best of allâ (Collins, 1997, n.p.).  The key to reading is that words need to be recognized so the brain can interpret the meaning behind it (Collins, 1997, n.p.).  Thus, putting the two methods together was necessary for correct comprehension of the concepts presented.


&lt;big&gt;'''What else do I need to know?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Weâve discussed the accepted definition of pedagogy, varying schools of thought for assessment, and the difference between reading philosophies.  Your salad components are increasing by number exponentially.  But what toppings to you add to your thought salad?  What else do you need to consider when you are setting up your classroom, your teaching styles, and your lessons?

Teaching is the hardest job you can have.  You are in a position to touch hundreds of lives over the course of a career, and yet, how do you succeed?  The fact remains that âwhen a teacher and his/her students face each other in the classroom they must truly work with each otherâ (Cadenas, 1999, n.p.).  How else can you ensure that the students are learning what you are teaching?

[You] may spend as much as 60 hours a week creating lesson plans, teaching, advising students, grading, supervising extracurricular activities and meeting with colleagues and parentsâ Valerie Marchant â ''Time'' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The first thing to keep in mind is your own knowledge basis.  Cadenas (1999) recommends that you ârenew and refresh your knowledge of the subject matterâ (n.p.) to stay on top of changes and help you incorporate them in to your lessons.  Our world changes so rapidly that to stay on top of technology, your field of expertise, or even other areas that can be integrated into your subject matter, it is necessary to take a class or attend a seminar every once in a while (Cadenas, 1999, n.p.).

Next, âprepare interesting, colorful, captivating lesson plans and deliver then with gustoâ (Cadenas, 1999, n.p.).  An entertaining teacher will help cement information into a studentâs memory with much more ease than one who is monotone or inactive (Cadenas, 1999, n.p.).  The more entertaining you are, the deeper a connection you will make with your students, as well.

In addition to the captivating lesson, make sure âit [is] a number one priority to ensure that your student can follow the lessonâ (Cadenas, 1999, n.p.).  This will assist all your students in grasping the information you are placing before them in class, and will help you reach students of all learning styles (Cadenas, 1999, n.p.).  You donât want to end up teaching only to the auditory learners and leaving the visual learners to fend for themselves!

Last, âhelp your students to put their learning to use immediatelyâ (Cadenas, 1999, n.p.).  Show them how the lessons you are teaching are applicable to them so they feel like school is worth an investment of time and energy (Cadenas, 1999, n.p.).  If nothing else, have them help each other out in class to reinforce the lesson!  


&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;

You are ready to graze at a Fourth of July picnic.  You walk over to the table, and you see an array of salads ready for you to dive in to them.  How do you pick which ones you want to sample now or save for later?  How do you narrow the choices down? 

Educational philosophies are as abundant as salads at any holiday spread.  And even though the difference between one potato salad and the one next to it is an addition of mustard, the two are by no means exactly alike.  Your classes will be just as diverse.  You will have students from all economic classes, with differing levels of English language ability, and all bringing various and beautiful experiences to your class.  How do you reach each individual?

Knowing who you are as a teacher before you enter the classroom will help significantly.  Teaching is so much more than just the content.  Teaching is a learning curve on philosophy that will never be finished.  Just as your classroom will change every year, continue to alter your philosophies.  See what works for you and your students on a collaborative level.'''In the words of J. W. Apps, âa working philosophy is never completely developed the ultimate working philosophy never reached. Weâre always moving toward, hopefully, a more complete, and thus more useful, working philosophy.â (The Educational Philosophies of Training and Development Professors, Leaders, and Practitioners, pg. 1)'''

Type Responses Here

I have had experience wit ADHD.  It was not a peasant one.  I ran a daycare and one of the children was ADHD. Two others were later diagnosed but I was no longer running a daycare then. This little girl could be the sweetest thing sometimes but was very destructive, sneaky, and manipulative most of the time.  She was on medication and when it was working she would just stare ad it was difficult to get her attention. When it didn't work or had worn off she would break things on purpose. She once carved her name into my dining room table with a barrett. She was very time consuming and my other children missed activities because of her.  I would like to believe that she was a rare case and she did have other personal things going on but she did help be build patience. Lots and lots of patience. As much as I don't agree with the amount of children on medication, I don't think much teaching would get done otherwise.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:16, 8 August 2009 (UTC) 

My brother and I were in the same grade from middle school - high school and he was most certainly ADHD, but back then they just called the kids &quot;hyperactive&quot; and there wasn't much they did to help them as far as medication or being sensitive to their needs.  He always got in trouble in school and struggled.  I wonder how he would be different now if he was able to get help with his problem then.  He definitely needs that positive encouragement (even still).  He has had some problems as an adult, but I think once he focuses and trys to concentrate on one thing at a time he does ok.[[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:00, 3 August 2009 (UTC) 

I have not been able to conduct my observation yet, but I have had a little experience with ADHD in my family.  One of my nephews, who is 16, was diagnosed with this disorder fairly young.  We noticed the hyperactivity, impulsivity, and the inattention very soon.  His entire grade school career he struggled.  We felt he was not treated &quot;right&quot; or not helped the way he should have been.  We felt that he was singled out and given a hard time.  

I can imagine, now that I am becoming a teacher, how hard this could be in a normal classroom setting for a teacher to manage.  I think all teachers should have more training or be taught more effective strategies on how to handle students with ADHD.  I believe good parental involvement and the schools willingness to help the student can go hand in hand for the students success.  Teachers really need to understand this disorder and the best ways to handle students that have it.  
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 04:23, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


ADHD affects about 5% of boys and 2% of girls in the US. Children with ADHD have low attention spans and are hyperactive and impulsive. I have not yet conducted an observation in schools, however, I knew of a few students with ADHD growing up in schools who I did not believe were treated fairly. I do not think many teachers were correctly trained on ADHD and did not know the proper approach to take with these students. Many teachers became frustrated and singled out the students with ADHD and as punishment, did not allow them to participate in certain classroom activities. Time was not given to the unique needs of the individual, and emphasis was placed on the fact that he was unlike most other &quot;normal&quot; students. This contributed to the student's low self esteem levels. 

From the readings and lectures, I have seen how teachers can make a huge difference in how a child feels about themselves. Teachers can help children with ADHD become very successful in school by helping the child believe they are able to succeed. Teachers should be caring and should often point out the child's successes and not emphasize their failures. ADHD students make small academic milestones, and teachers need to show students they are extremely proud of these milestones. Some general strategies that teachers can use that I did NOT witness during my school career is seating ADHD students in the front of the class, walking by their desks often, and having an aid keep them on task. I feel that these &quot;best practices&quot; just described are much more effective than the strategies I witnessed during my school years. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 22:34, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

During my observations, I encountered many issues that concerned ADHD. The teacher that I observed had one class that was all &quot;special needs&quot; students. They were all 6th graders and, with the exception of one or two students who had behavior problems, all were ADHD. The instruction given to the teacher was that these students were incapable of handling anything comparable to the curriculum of her other classes. Basically, the only thing that she was able to assign these students were elementary level activities such as coloring. One thing that I found interesting is, some of the students' parents had signed medical forms that told the school that, since the student in question had ADHD, he or she could not be failed in any class they took, no matter how badly they performed. I found this terribly unfair. Especially since hardly any of these 6th graders had any real issues; the were all just a little hyper (nothing that a long P.E. class can't take care of). The teacher that I observed was very frustrated with this class and the guidelines set for her teaching, especially since she knew these students and knew that they were capable of much more than they were given.
I think special treatment for students with ADHD is often unfairly given. For example, I knew a girl in high school who received a sizable scholarship from the Univ of Alabama, because she got a doctor to write a letter saying that she was ADHD, when actually, she wasn't. Unless a student really struggles, special treatment should not be given; especially treatment that allows them to pass every class, or allows 6th graders to color everyday.

Having no observation period to drawn on I can only provide a somewhat coherent anecdote.  My best friend in Elementary school had ADHD. Or at least, he was diagnosed as such and given medication to fight the condition, which in the end, means that he might as well have had it. We met on the school bus and became fast friends over hurried and often impossibly loud conversations about the latest “X-files” episodes. Scott was impatient, impulsive, spastic, and full of energy. In other words he was much like every boy at that age is. Later we became even closer in “speech” which mostly consisted of writing pages and pages of journals for a helpful, yet vaguely patronizing woman, whose name escapes me. I am dyslexic, Scott was “ADHD”, as such I watched him change over the years with each new prescription and whether or not he felt like taking it. (At one point it was suggested that I too was “ADHD”, and when a social worker came to our home to broach the subject my mother used some very inappropriate language to respond)  Over the nine years we were friends Scott would be changed in turns with every new med. He was by turns absent from himself, manic, and would always forget to eat unless reminded to do so. Scott was my best friend, and I can’t say for sure how much of the kid I met on the bus who wanted to talk for hours about the leech man episode on X-files still existed after the pills and years. I often think about the shot gun style diagnosing of ADHD that seems prevalent even today and wonder how things might’ve been different. What if Scott’s mother refused to put him on medication too? What if I had to take pills to change my personality day after day? How would I be different? [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 14:54, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

The last few years I have had a student with a severe case of ADHD.  The literature and educational training that I have been in contact with encourages teachers in these situations to work creating a teamwork approach with special education and/or inclusion teachers, if the child is a special education student.  This is exactly what I strove to do.  I also worked closely with the parents of the child and tried to get their active involvement.  I gained as much information as I could from the parents about their child's condition.  I found out about his medication and how he usually uses the medication.  It seemed as though a lot of factors went into helping the child with ADHD reach his potential.  The strategy for helping this student ended up being a strategy with multiple components:  frequent special education collaboration with teacher, frequent collaboration and communications with parents, conversations with student, sitting student in front of the class, and giving extra time and help during classwork.

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

1. The student should be able to identify the different philosophies of education

2. The student should be able to apply the different philosophies of education to application questions


----

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

There are many different philosophies of education that exist today. These philosophies are perennialism, progressivism, reconstructionism, positivism, constructivism, behaviorism, humanism, and essentialism (Ganly, 2007). Behind the scenes every school system works off a philosophy of education. It is very likely that in every classroom more than one philosophy is used (Maya). Some of these philosophies are student-centered while others are teacher-centered (Ganly, 2007). Each of these philosophies varies greatly from each other. Today, schools mostly use a combination of each to provide students with a greater range of learning opportunities.


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Perennialism'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Perennialism is a teacher-centered philosophy that views principles of existence as constant or unchanging (Ganly, 2007). Perennialism is based on the view that reality comes from fundamental fixed truths-especially related to God. It believes that people find truth through reasoning and revelation and that goodness is found in rational thinking. Schools that teach reason and Godâs will are schools that use the perennialism form of educational philosophy (Kurtus, 2001).


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Progressivism'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Progressivism is a student-centered philosophy that believes that ideas should be tested by experimentation and learning comes from finding answers from questions (Ganly, 2007). This philosophy is the first that takes the three learning types into consideration. Those three types are auditory, visual, and kinesthetic learners. This approach uses thought provoking games, books, field trips, and experimentation. The progressivism philosophy is not centered around the main goal of educating students for adulthood but to enrich the educational growth process (Maya).


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Reconstructionism'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Reconstructionism is also a student-centered philosophy that promotes world social progress. It focuses on world events, controversial issues, and the vision on a new better world (Ganly, 2007). Reconstructionist educators focus on a curriculum that highlights social reform as the aim of education. They also believe that systems must be changed to overcome oppression and improve human conditions (Cohen, 1999). 


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Positivism'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Positivism is a teacher-centered philosophy that rejects intuition, matters of mind, essences, and inner cause. It relies on laws of matter and motion as valid and bases truth on provable fact (Ganly, 2007). The Positivists conceived of primordial matter as a unique reality having the power of evolving from the lower to the higher forms, mechanically and by means of immanent energy (The Radical Academy, 2003).


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Constructivism'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Constructivism is a student-centered philosophy that emphasizes hands on learning and students actively participating in lessons. This philosophy believes that students should be able to discover lessons on their own because using hands on learning is one of the most effective forms of learning (Ganly, 2007). 


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Behaviorism'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Behaviorism is another teacher-centered philosophy that focuses on human behavior as a reaction to outside stimuli and believes that the changing environment can change a studentâs misbehavior (Ganly, 2007). John Watson, the known founder of behaviorism, believed that any human being could be reprogrammed to acquire any skill (Maya).


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Humanism'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Humanism is yet another student-centered philosophy that focuses on enhancing ones innate goodness, rejects the ideas of group oriented education, and upholds the idea of enhancing individual development. It also believes that all students should be involved with their education on all levels, and students should be able to make choices about what they will be learning (Ganly, 2007). 


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Essentialism'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Essentialism is the last teacher-centered philosophy in this article. It believes that there is a common set of skills and knowledge. It focuses on respect for developing sound habits of the mind and training in fundamentals (Ganly, 2007). Educators of this philosophy teach the basic skills of math, science, history, foreign language, and literature. Since it is a teacher-centered philosophy, they are responsible for installing moral values that will help each student become an ideal citizen. The students are taught all factual information and no vocational skills (Maya). 


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL NARROW&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

The above philosophies: perennialism, progressivism, reconstructionism, positivism, constructivism, behaviorism, humanism, and essentialism are few of the many that exist in many school systems today. Some are used independently while others are used in combination. Each educator may have their own philosophy which they incorporate either teacher-centered philosophies or student-centered philosophies. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;
border: solid 1px #CC33CC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 30px; line-height: 20px; color: rgb(178, 34, 34); font-family: impact;&quot;&gt;âYour enthusiasm for the subject cannot be ignored. And, like wonderful perfume,&lt;br&gt;&lt;font style=&quot;font-size: 20px; color: rgb(255, 127, 80); font-family: arial;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;will permeate the one who gives it as much as it will the ones who receive it.â&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=4&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;330033&quot;&gt;-H.G. Cadenas&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
''' 



These philosophies vary greatly from each other but they are all used in the good intentions of teaching students. No matter what philosophy is used, being an educator is a great accomplishment and can definitely be understood by H.G. Candenas when he stated that âYour enthusiasm for the subject cannot be ignored. And, like wonderful perfume, will permeate the one who gives it as much as it will the ones who receive it.â

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;The Importance of Education Philosophy&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;center&gt;by Ben Lee&lt;/center&gt;


'''&lt;u&gt;Learning Target&lt;/u&gt;'''
&lt;p&gt;Students will be able to distinguish the difference between Essentialism, Perennialism, Progressivism,and Existentialism, as well as understand the basic concepts behind each educational theory.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;font color= blue&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educational theories have been used by teachers throughout time.  These theories are derived from a combination of similar philosophical theories, but developed for in the classroom.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;font color= blue&gt;'''Essentialism'''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     The following is a definition of Essentialism found online: &quot;a doctrine that certain traditional concepts, ideals, and skills are essential to society and should be taught methodically to all students, regardless of individual ability, need, etc.&quot;(Essentialism, N.D.)  In other words this theory focuses on the basics; teaching the most crucial parts of the subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Apps &quot;Toward a Working Philosophy of Adult Education&quot; essentialism is said to have developed from both idealism and realism.  The idealism part containing subjects such as history, foreign language, and classics; the realism part containing subjects like math and science.(Apps, J. 1973)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;font color= blue&gt;'''Perennialism'''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was early in the twenty first century when perennialism began to form, rooted in ancient teachings such as those of Plato and Aristotle.(History of Education Journal 1951)  An online encyclopedia conveys some very key points of Perennialism:  &quot;Perennialists believe that one should teach the things that one deems to be of everlasting importance to all people everywhere. They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques.&quot;(Perennialism, n.d.)  So in an ever changing world where each day scientific findings disprove one another and new, more efficient formulas for math emerge, it is the main beliefs or philosophies of these subjects that need to be taught in order for the students to fully grasp the concepts. &lt;/p&gt;  
    &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: yellow;
border: solid 2px #151B8D; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;
One of my professors at Hampden-Sydney College, Dr. Robbins, practiced perennialism.  She was a great instructor and I always found the class to be interesting, making it easy  for me to attend.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The focus of learning in Perennialism lies in activities designed to discipline the mind.  Subject matter of a disciplinary and spiritual nature such as the content of mathematics, language, logic, great books, doctrines must me studied whether used as such or not.&quot;(Johnson J. 1969)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;font color= blue&gt;'''Progressivism'''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progressive education is &quot;A set of reformist educational philosophies and methods that emphasize individual instruction, informality in the classroom, and the use of group discussions and laboratories as instructional techniques.&quot;(Progressive Education, n.d.)  This theory uses personal experiences as a means of education.(Apps, J. 1973)  There is no absolute knowledge, like we have discussed in class, things are constantly changing just as the definition of learning.  Take our ECI 301 class as an example, we are putting progressivism into action; when we write these wikibook articles and share personal experiences we are using this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;font color= blue&gt;'''Existentialism'''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Existentialism is a philosophy concerned with finding self and the meaning of life through free will, choice, and personal responsibility. The belief is that people are searching to find out who and what they are throughout life as they make choices based on their experiences, beliefs, and outlook. And personal choices become unique without the necessity of an objective form of truth. An existentialist believes that a person should be forced to choose and be responsible without the help of laws, ethnic rules, or traditions.&quot; (Existentialism: A Philosophy, n.d.)  In relation to education, self-fulfillment should be the students inspiration to do well and in turn the teacher's job to help them develop such a mentality.(Apps, J. 1973)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To begin, it rules out three conventional notions:  that education is primarily an agency of society, set up to perpetuate a cultural heritage; that it is a pipeline of perennial truths; and that it is a means for adjusting to the young to life in a democratic community.  In place of these, let education exist for the individual.  Let it teach him to live as his own nature bids him, spontaneously and authentically.&quot; (Kneller, G. 1961)  What Kneller is saying here is that education should not be looked at as a task, but instead as an opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;font color= blue&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to have a theory when it comes to education because it will help to develop lesson plans and provide a basis for one's rubric; in turn the students will know how they are going to be assessed.  Each one of the foretold theories has its strengths and possible weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;''DO I REALLY WANT TO TEACH'''''?'''&lt;/sup&gt; by Carrie Thigpen&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;




== Introduction- ==



One of the ways The American Heritage Dictionary defines &quot;philosophy&quot; is &quot;the investigation of the nature, causes, or principles of reality, knowledge, or values, based on logical reasoning rather than  empirical methods&quot; (American Heritage, 2001). When we consider this definition, we must all certainly agree that it is important that we have a genuine philosopny of education, that is, an in-depth reason for choosing this profession and maintaining effective ways to keep up with it, and that it is not our intention to teach &quot;just because.&quot;

Teaching affects all aspects of our very existence and involves all influences, in school and out, that causes change in the behavior of our students. This includes both character and intellectual changes that occur throughout life. We as teachers must realize then, that the influence we have on our students may very well begin in the school, but surely does not, should not, and must not end there.



== Staying Ahead Of The Game- ==


The unbelievable growth of our society from a preindustrial nation to a highly technological one - in barely over 200 years - has been a major issue in the progressive and orderly development of our teaching procedures. Because our nation is continuously growing and changing, it is necessary to understand that we must constantly renew the many different methods of education found in our school systems (Kozol, 1981). After all, schools are one of the most important educational systems that affect the children of our future world. On the national level then, it is clearly understood that we as teachers must stay current in meeting our educational requirements so that we will be the most effective teachers as we can possibly be.

But what can we do on a more personal level - as personal as within the four walls of our classroom - to stay ahead of the game? The list of suggestions (both written and verbal) is probably endless, but more than likely should include these:
             
*1. Any problems we encounter as teachers are primarily problems of attitudes - our attitudes, not just the kids'.
*2. There is much that individual teachers can do, but so much more can happen if we work together.
*3. Parent / teacher collaboration helps resolve many obstacles.
*4. We must include our students in recognizing, analyzing, and challenging obstacles (Hirsch, 1996).

This certainly does not mean that society does not play a large role in attributing to a teacher's success, but these suggestions are for the teachers who believe that they can make a true difference in the education of their students and are willing to exhaust every effort within the four walls of their classroom to do so.

== Maintaining Effective Ways- ==


It is highly important that when we take the development of teaching approches into account, we know that it is an &quot;ecology of achievement.&quot; This phrase refers to the proper balance in the merging of environments of teachers and school systems. The nature of this balance, or ecology, is best treated in the framework of major functions of teachers and education as a whole: what is to be taught, how it is to be taught, to whom it should be taught, when it should be taught, and where it should be taught. Although these factors are of equal importance, they still must be handled separatly to a considerable degree (Slater, 2008).

First and foremost, we as teachers must realize that education revolves around various types of relationships. 
We must know and respect our students and help them know and respect each other as fellow learners. We must remember to focus on our student's in-school and out-of-school learning. When this is done, not only are we recognizing our student's academic accomplishments, but we are also acknowledging their sense of ownership and resourcefulness. We must also build a sense of &quot;community&quot; within the class. This in turn will greatly assist in setting boundaries of mutual respect for each other.

Last, but certainly not least, we must not be fearful to continuously stay in touch with parents about our students' academic and social progress. When educationg children, far too often the trust of the parents is placed too low on our list of priorities. In return, most parents feel that once they have taken care of the child's physical needs in the morning and take them to school, it is solely up to the teachers from that point on. After all, &quot;that's what they get paid for!&quot; is the claim of most parents. Contrary to popular belief, it is not merely our job, but also our moral responsibility as teachers to let parents know that the best interest for the child's education is supposed to be equally shared between the teacher ''and'' the parents. Any teacher, particularly in elementary school, who believes that he or she can provide an adequate education within the classroom with only sporadic contacts with parents are very unprepared for the task at hand. Such teachers compel their students to view the world of school and the world of home as unconnected realities,driving a wedge between the child's loyalties to family and the desire to succeed in school(Rice, 2004).

== Summary- ==


So is it really important to have a philosophy of education? What about the original question, &quot;Do I really want to teach?&quot; Although the main two goals of a teacher is to &quot;stay ahead of the game&quot; by &quot;maintaining effective ways&quot; to teach, we must consider that there are other underlying issues that may eventually change our tactics used to achieve these goals.
 
There are many teachers with many philosophies of education. Many have remained true to theirs, as many have not. Should we attempt then, to define a good teacher - perhaps one who did remain true to his or her original philosophy of education? Let's see... From my observations of several different teachers, I have discovered the following: A good teacher has never met a stranger. You seldom need an appointment to visit; they are always happy to have you drop by. They are closely tuned in to their student's personal as well as their physical needs. They know the true value of &quot;hooking&quot; a student, making the subject real, and giving the student a reason to learn. A child rarely has to ask them, &quot;why do we have to learn this?&quot; because nearly everything they learn relates to a real job at hand. These teachers are those with a mission, of which each child is a part. These are the teachers that we should all strive to become.

==Introduction==
This article will explain the importance and purpose of education. Furthermore, this article will explain the importance of teachers learning and teaching new technologies to students. The video link below contains vital information for future students and teachers alike.

[http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=6f2c2eba77f39993d118&amp;page=1&amp;viewtype=&amp;category= &quot;Did You Know&quot;]

==Learning Target==
By the end of this article you should be able to define and or explain: 
*the purpose of education,
*the importance of education, 
*and the importance of teachers learning and teaching new technologies to students.

==Purpose of Education==

One can think a long time on what it means to educate. For myself, I tried to remember what my teachers taught me. The definition of education is &quot;to develop the knowledge, skill, or character ofâ¦&quot;(2002). From this information we can agree that the purpose of education is to develop or teach knowledge, skill, and character to someone else. The better question is how does one develop and teach these qualities to a student?

==The Importance of Education==

John Dewey, the father of education, wrote, &quot;Collateral learning may be more important than the actual lesson being learned&quot;(1963, p. 48). According to Dewey, the importance of education it is to facilitate and collaborate with students to create a stronger learning experience for all (Dewey, 1963). Collaboration with students, parents, and faculty, will create a stronger learning atmosphere that will teach the students knowledge, skill, and character. With that in mind, which type of classroom will facilitate the importance of education in the best way possible, a student-centered classroom or a teacher-centered classroom? 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: silver;border: black; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt; John Dewey said, âCollateral learningâ¦may be and often is more important than the actual lesson being learnedâ(1963, p. 48).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


A student-centered classroom is the type of classroom where students learn from each other and make sense of their own experiences and information collaboratively(Tapscott, 1999). A student-centered classroom can accommodate collateral and communal learning. This type of classroom is not the only type of classroom that will teach knowledge, skill, and character to students. 
A teacher-centered classroom is the type of classroom where the students sit and listen to the teacher(Tapscott, 1999). With that said, a teacher-centered classroom will teach, but it may not engage all of the students in the class like a student-centered classroom is capable of. A student-centered classroom teaches students at their own pace, in a unique way for each student. A student-centered classroom is more likely to educate all students, including the students who are distanced from other students due to the Digital Divide (Tapscott, 1999). 


The Digital Divide is the division that happens amongst all humans. This divide occurs because some people can afford to have a technology and learn basic technological skills, while others do not have access to technology or technological skills. The people most likely affected by the Digital Divide are the people low-income (2000). In a study done by Don Tapscott, a noted author of education, he found that the most effective way to teach students in the Digital Divide was through student-centered learning (Tapscott, 1999).


Therefore, the importance of education is to teach all students; collateral and communal learning works best for educating all students in a student-centered classroom. Communal learning reaches students in the Digital Divide while other learning avenues do not (Tapscott, 1999). With communal learning, all students can develop the skills of knowledge, skill, and character at their own pace. That is the  importance of education, to teach all of these skills in the best way possible to all students. In the end, the importance of education is to teach all students and learn full-circle in the classroom, which is one of the main purposes of education, to teach and learn and be taught again.

==The Importance of Teachers Learning and Teaching New Technology==

Now we know that purpose of teaching is to teach knowledge, skill, and character in the best way possible, and the importance of education is to teach those skills to all students. What is the importance of teachers learning and teaching new technologies?  Scott Meech, a teacher and noted author of educational journals said, &quot;Even if we donât prefer to use a new technology, we need to know the students will use themâ(Meech, 2007). With that said teachers need to remember that even if a student knows how to use tools of technology that it does not mean that the student knows how to utilize the tool for educationâs sake.
 
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: silver;border: black; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;âBy 2010 new information is predicted to double every 3 days and it is now said that a supercomputerâs compatibilities now exceed that of the human brainâ (Fisch and McLeod, 2006).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

As teachers, we need to know that the way of the world is pushing toward new, better technologies. Therefore, we are preparing students for jobs, majors, and technologies that do not even exist yet, for problems we do not even know are problems yet (Fisch and McLeod, 2006). This means it is our responsibility as teachers to teach students information while integrating technology as much as we can, this way our students will be prepared for whatever the world throws at them. With that said, the importance of teachers learning and teaching new technology is so students can learn information through the newest, most up-to-date technology possible. Then, students can go out into the real world with the information necessary to succeed along with the skills to use the newest technology known to man.

==Why I think teachers should teach== 

I think teachers should teach because there is a lot of information available at our student's fingertips, but I do not think students care to learn about any of the information available to them. With that said, I think it is our job as teachers to teach students all the knowledge we know; hopefully, we will inspire students to learn on their own and teach others. As teachers we help mold our future leaders so, it is up to us to guide our future leaders into the 22nd century. I believe teachers should teach to help our youth learn all the knowledge of today to help create a better future for tomorrow.

==Conclusion==
The purpose of education is to cultivate and hone students' skill and knowledge to a higher place than it was before they stepped into the classroom. It is important to do so because all students should have an opportunity to learn and teach others what they have learned on a daily basis. This process of learning should be done in the best way possible. Currently, the best way possible is through collateral, student-centered, technology-integrated classrooms. If this task takes place in every classroom, then all of the students will certainly have a brighter future for tomorrow.

I agree that the digital divide is a big problem in low income families and that's too bad because it shouldn't. I feel like we are all human beings and we all deserve the same opportunities as the next person. And because this problem does exist the best thing you can do as a teacher is make the environment student centered because you never know how far some else has come or what's going on in their home. But all of that should not take away from the students education or potential to excel.

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;What is the Purpose of Education?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;'''

*Readers should be able to state the purpose of education.
*Readers should determine the intent and actions brought about with the '''No Child Left Behind Act'''

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;'''

&quot;What is the purpose of education,&quot; asked Mrs. Smith to her 5th grade students as she walks around the classroom waiting for hands to go up. Johnny says, &quot;So I can have a career instead of a job. I want to have money in my pocket, a house, and a great truck when I get older.&quot; Susan states, &quot;No, Johnny. We have to get an education so we can learn how to live in today's society.&quot; The true purpose of education should be to educate the whole child, so as not to just have academic success but to have success in all aspects of their lives.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0033FF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;âThe aim of education should be to teach us rather how to think, than what to thinkârather to improve our minds, so as to enable us to think for ourselves, than to load the
memory with the thoughts of other men.â ~Bill Beattie (Yero, 2002)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;The Purpose of Education&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;'''
Ask yourself, what is the purpose of education? No matter who you ask, everyone's answer will be different. If you ask a student, there answer will be unlike their parents whose answer will be different from a teacher's viewpoint. Education is the whole learning process of not only acquiring knowledge but, to a deeper level, for a person to discover more about himself as well as the world which he is living in (Lim, 2005). Students are taught the basics in Math, Science, Reading, and English in order to survive in today's society. Therefore, how students use the education given is the true purpose of education. Some teachers believe that the transmission of knowledge is the primary purpose of education although the transfer of knowledge from school to the real world is something that happens naturally as a consequence of possessing that knowledge (Yero, 2002). Students take what they learn from school and apply this knowledge to their everyday lives. The learning process never ends and students will continue to use the knowledge from school to become better citizens in the world today. 


'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;No Child Left Behind&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;'''
The No Child Left Behind (NCLB)Act was signed by President Bush in 2002 to improve and reform education in public schools. According to the U.S. Department of Education, No Child Left Behind act is based on stronger accountability for results, more freedom for states and communities, proven education methods, and more choices for parents (U.S. Department of Education, 2004). The intent of the No Child Left Behind Act was to make sure all students were learning at the same level and become proficient in academics. Each state was required to have learning standards of where a child should be and what they should learn by the end of a school year. The NCLB act had every state test students' abilities every year for each child in grades 3-8 in Reading and Math. &quot;Results from these tests will be made available in annual report cards so parents can measure school performance and statewide progress, evaluate the quality of their child's school, the qualifications of teachers, and their child's progress in key subjects.&quot; states the Fact Sheet: No Child Left Behind Act (The White House, 2002). 
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;border: solid 7px #151DEC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Click link to view the four pillars of the NCLB Act.http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/4pillars.html''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Others argue that the NCLB Act was a great idea but need corrections. FairTest, the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, states, &quot;The law's emphasis needs to shift from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to holding states and localities accountable for making the systemic changes that improve student achievement&quot; (FairTest, 2004). Those against the NCLB Act argue that the academic gap have yet to be achieved. Low-income students and minorities students are still struggling to pass the test or become equal with their fellow peers who have a higher income.  




'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;History of Education&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;'''
In the colonial days, the history of education started with parents teaching their children to read and write. In 1635, the first Latin Grammar School (Boston Latin School) is established and it is designed for sons of certain social classes who are destined for leadership positions in church, state, or the courts (Sass, 2008). &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #3BB9FF;border: solid 3px #151B8D; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL&quot;&gt; &quot;In the one-room schoolhouse sat students of all ages and abilities. The sole teacher was usually an unmarried woman; sometimes the students were older than the teacher. Using only the most basic resources â slate, chalk, and a few books â teaching and learning consisted mainly of literacy, penmanship, arithmetic, and âgood manners.â Recitation, drilling, and oral quizzes at the end of the day were the norm in classrooms across America,&quot; states PBS.org (School: The Story of American Public Education, 2001).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; Education's main focus at this time was to teach children about religion. Girls were taught how to run a household while the boys were taught all about plantation life....At this time only white males and females were allowed to be educated. As the years progressed, in the 19th century, the one-room school houses were built to educate all children with the help of public funds. Looking back at how education started to how well it has transgressed, education has come a long way from only a certain wealthy class educating their children to free education to all no matter race, creed, religion, gender, or color.

   









'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Future of Education&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;'''
Every learner must master communication, collaboration, and creative problem solving as well as the equally important skills of knowing how to use numbers and data in real-world tasks, the ability to locate and process information relevant to the task at hand, technological fluency, and, most of all, the skills and attitudes needed to be a lifelong learner (Thornburg, 1997). The intent behind the creation of the NCLB Act was good but the actions behind the intent weakened the overall goal. The goal was to not leave any child behind but the goal changed to who can pass standardized tests. If corrections are made, the younger generation will benefit and have more opportunities for technological advancement and academics.      





'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;'''
Schools that ignore the trends shaping tomorrow will cease to be relevant in the lives of their students, and will quickly disappear. We must transform all formal institutions of learning, from pre-K through college, to insure that we are preparing students for their future, not for our past (Thornburg, 1997). I continue to watch my children grow up and I wonder are we doing everything in our power to help them become the leaders of tomorrow. Teachers were respected by all and they were the reason I chose to become a teacher. Teachers help shape the world of tomorrow by educating their students to think for themselves and never stop learning no matter where you are in life. The purpose of education to me is not to just teach kids the basic academics but to teach them how to become leaders of tomorrow by taking what they have learned and applying it to their everyday lives.

== &lt;big&gt;Overview of Plato&lt;/big&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Considered by historians to be one of the most influential minds of Western thought, Plato described the Socratic method of instruction and further developed this dialectic method in his later years.  (Smith, 1997).  The Socratic method is basically a learning method using a question and answer dialogue between the teacher and student.  The idea is that the ensuing debate exposes flaws in reasoning and brings forth a better understanding of the issue.  Plato improved on the Socratic method in his later years and developed a philosophy of education as outlined in ''The Republic'' that became the hallmark of a European liberal arts education.

&lt;BR&gt;

427 to 347 BC. Plato was born in Athens in 427BC. When his father died, his mother married, Pyrilampes, a friend of Pericles.  Plato began to pursue a political career, but became disillusioned with the politics of the time.  Evidently, he was good at athletics, poetry and drama.  In 409 BC he met Socrates, and according to Plato, he was one of Socrates more outstanding students. Socrates did not follow the then current trend of the Sophist method of teaching which used rhetoric or persuasion to dictate learning to their students. The Sophists asked high fees for their teaching while Socrates charged nothing. Plato, while mistrustful of the Sophists did share their interest in investigating values rather than physical science. In 399 Socrates was brought to trial for corrupting the minds of youth because of his skepticism regarding religious deities. He was convicted and sentenced to death. Socrates committed suicide rather than face execution.  Plato wrote about the trial and Socrates decision not to try to escape from prison.  After this Plato traveled extensively studying religion, geometry and astronomy.  In 387 BC he returned to Athens and founded a university that included philosophy, physical science, astronomy and mathematics. Plato also developed a philosophy of education for prospective rulers requiring them to be philosophers first and rulers second as detailed in ''The Republic'' He is thought to have died at the age of 80 in 347 BC. (GradeSaver).

&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
The Socratic method is a dialectic method of teaching, named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, in which the teacher uses questions to get the student to think about what he/she already knows and to realize what they do not know.  This question and answer session stimulates the brain, engages the learner, and can bring new ideas to life.  As one educator stated, âThink of it as the relentless pursuit of truth through unceasing questions. To engage in dialectic method, establish your goal to clearly understand truth and get on with it.â (Kern, 2008).



Today, law schools are trying to find better ways to teach their students the important concepts they will need in the future.  The Socratic Method is one of the ways a lot of teachers have found to be most useful.  Since the Socratic Method is the basis for which courts handle cases, it seems only fitting to have the students at a law school learn that way.  In a court room a series of questions are asked to get the judge and/or jury to see the truth of the situation at hand.  The teacher likes using the Socratic Method in their classes because they believe it helps the students get into the mind set of being a lawyer, plus they believe it helps the students learn and retain the information better.  &quot;One of the principle benefits that the Socratic Method confers is to allow large bodies of students to engage in &quot;active learning.&quot; &quot;Students learn better when they are actively involved in the learning process&quot; rather than passively taking notes and the teacher dispenses information.&quot; (Jackson, 2007).








&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#6C2DC7&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;Dialectic Method Example&lt;/big&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
The benefits of this method are that the student becomes engaged in the learning process and contributes in developing the answers (led by the teacher).  This is in contrast to didactic learning in which the teacher tells the student what they need to know.

Begin with a question that has several possible answers or is ambiguous so that you can begin asking the question in different ways until the students reason out the answer you wish them to learn.  Then encourage them to ask themselves other responses.  

For example:  High School class discussion after reading the Noahâs Ark story from the Old Testament:

'''Teacher:'''  What is a covenant?

'''Possible answer:'''  An agreement.

'''Teacher:'''   I agree to meet you for lunch, is that a covenant?

Go to this link for a specific [http://www.garlikov.com/Soc_Meth.html example] that was used in a 3rd grade elementary math class. 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''Possible answer:'''  Sort of.

'''Teacher:'''  What was the covenant God made to Noah?

'''Possible answer:'''  God promised never to destroy the world by a flood.

'''Teacher:'''  Does a covenant imply something more than an agreement?  

'''Possible answer:'''  A promise

'''Teacher:'''  Yes, a covenant is an agreement with a promise.  I make an agreement to meet you for lunch and I promise to be there no matter what.

Notice in this example the student has come up with the answer.  If the teacher had simply told the student the definition of a covenant, chances are the student would simply not care to remember the meaning.  In this example, the student is more likely to remember the meaning since he/she was involved in finding the answer.

== &lt;big&gt;Thoughts on '''''The Republic'''''&lt;/big&gt; ==


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Plato believed that a teacher must care deeply for the student and have a good understanding of the subject being taught.  In ''The Republic'' Plato outlines a lifelong learning process for rulers that begins with learning to read, write and do mathematics at age six.  As the child grows music and sports are added.  At age 18 military services are added.  At age 30 the ruler should study philosophy and politics.  It is not until age 50 that the ruler should rule.  This lifelong liberal arts education would ensure that the ruler had experience and wisdom in order to make just decisions.  ''The Republic'' is mostly about defining justice and the different types of justice.  Only a philosopher-King can dispense the appropriate justice.  This method of instruction became useful during the Middle Ages in the royal classes, and can be seen in the British royal family today.  The British males are required to do military service, attend university, and work in civil service for many years before they take over the role of King.  An interesting note is that the current Queen of England, Elizabeth, was reluctant to hand over the reins to Phillip until after he had a wife and family, and has not yet retired. (Jowett)

== &lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt; ==

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Both the Didactic and Dialectic methods are necessary for teaching.  There are many times when telling the student what he/she needs to know is the only way to impart information.  However, the dialectic method is essential for engaging students in interactive learning, in giving them some ownership of discovery in the learning process.  The dialectic method can provide an opportunity for debate of issues, exploration of ideas and use of higher thinking skills.  Since the object of learning is to be able to discern and make decisions based on knowledge, the dialectic method is critical for growth of knowledge.

''by Maggie M. McClure''

----



== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt; ==

In our society, we focus on education as the key to the future.  As future educators, it is our duty to first look back upon the foundations of education and those philosophies.  The philosophers of the past are so numerous that this can be a daunting adventure.  However, in this article I've aligned the most discussed and perhaps most famous of all philosophers concerning education.


== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/font&gt; ==

â¢Readers should be able to describe philosophies of Socrates and Plato.

â¢Readers should be able to define Socratic Method.

â¢Readers should be able to describe Sophists and identify their methods.

â¢Readers should be able to identify applications of Socrates in the classroom.
	


== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Socrates(469-399 B.C.E)&lt;/font&gt; ==
There is very little known about Socratesâ life considering that he never wrote any works.  What we know of Socrates come from those who chose to write about him.  The most reliable of these are from his pupil, Plato (Socrates, 2009).

Socrates lived in Athens, Greece.  He was married and had three sons, whom he abandoned.  He served in the Athenian Army for three campaigns (Socrates, 2009). 

Socrates was charged with &quot;corrupting the minds of the youth&quot; and indifference to the gods (Socrates, 2009).  He was put to trial and when convicted he was asked what his punishment should be.  His suggestion was &quot;a wage paid by the government and free dinners for the rest of his life instead, to finance the time he spends as Athens' benefactor&quot; (Socrates, 2009). Below is a painting by Jacques-Louis David of Socrates's Death.


[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|600px ]]




=== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Philosophy&lt;/font&gt; ===
Socrates refused to be acknowledged as a teacher and received no payment for his services as opposed to the Sophists whom were popular at this time.  He often uses an example by comparing his position to that of a midwife or matchmaker. Socrates believed in the teacher-student relationship and there had to be a mutual respect and connection (Mintz, 2007).  For this reason he sent many students to other instructors instead of teaching them himself. 
  
Socrates believed that knowledge was not eternally given, as Plato did, but was found through the journey of learning (Kiss, 2006).  He compares finding knowledge to finding maturity from conception to birth (Kiss, 2006).  Once a person has found knowledge he has, in a sense, been born to a mature man.

He was one of the first to offer a learner-centered education theory.  He often said that you must âknow thyselfâ (Henson, 2003).  His belief that learning was personal led him to a learner-centered environment which you will see from his Socratic Method (Henson, 2003).  Learner-centered was an abstract idea compared with the Sophists who saw education mainly as a profession of persuasion (Sophists, 2006). Socrates believed that knowledge could make people and the world improve.

''&quot;Wisdom Begins in Wonder&quot;'' 

&lt;u&gt;Socrates&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


=== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Socratic Method&lt;/font&gt; ===
The Socratic Method is arguably Socratesâ most significant contribution.  This method is a form of dialectic inquiry in which âthe questioner explores the implications of others' positions, to stimulate rational thinking and illuminate ideasâ (Socratic Method, 2009).  The dialogue is the main focus when the Socratic Method is in play (Kubli, 2005). The basic format of this method is through question and answer.  Instead of merely giving students answers and definitions, this method allows the students to use critical thinking and come up with their own answers.  This facilitates their memory of the subject matter and gives them a chance to inject their own opinions as well as become involved in the learning process.

The Socratic Method is used most commonly in court situations and is therefore taught to law students.  Itâs also popular and effective in other classroom situations and has been recommended and used by educators ever since its development.

==== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/font&gt; ====
According to Fritz Kubli, there is an accepted practice of teachers that students need only to memorize and learn as they are told (Kubli, 2005).  He says, âStudents expect insights and not just mechanical memorization from their educationâ and that âfrustration and resignation may result if they realize what a school normally expects of them. . .â (Kubli, 2005).  Of course, Kubliâs view of a school is one what only requires regurgitation of facts that have been infused into the student.  We have to acknowledge that itâs his opinion that the education system is like that today.

Kubli believes that the Socratic Method is a valuable tool, but it can become quite empty if put to the wrong use.  Heâs quoted Bahktinâs view that the Socratic Method can âdegenerate into a senseless interplay between questions and ready-made answersâ (Kubli, 2005).  His advice is to âtread new paths in approaching . . . studentsâ (Kubli, 2005).  Students will welcome attempts by the teacher to engage them in meaningful discussion.

==== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Tips&lt;/font&gt; ====
Michael Gose discusses the Socratic Method in regard to undergraduate seminars.  He found that comprehension is a requirement for the Method to work because, âinterpretive questions do not work if the text is misunderstood (Gose, 2009).  He gives the following tips for keeping the dialogue in the interrogative case and increasing comprehension:

â¢âAsking students to find and read passages with which they had trouble.â


â¢âAsking students to find and read passages that they have neglected but that will help them sort out an issue.â


â¢&quot;Asking students to read a passage aloud (while interrupting periodically for a summary of what has been read).â


â¢âAsking students to clarify a key term (usually with a few page references to study that term in context).â


â¢âAsking students to walk through the basic organization or logic of the text on a step by step basis.â


â¢âAsking students who have come to an early grasp of the material to summarize key points or understandings.â


â¢âAsking students to explain two passages that might seem in contradiction to one another.â


â¢âAsking students for their best question about the text.â


â¢âAsking students for their best remaining question about the text.â

(Gose, 2009)

== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Plato(428-378 B.C.E.)&lt;/font&gt; ==
Plato was born to an aristocratic family in Athens, Greece.  His first aspirations were for politics and carrying on the family heritage.  He soon became disheartened with politics and found himself a student of Socrates.  As opposed to the Sophists at the time, Socrates did not charge for his services or use rhetoric in his education methods.  Plato witnessed Socratesâ trial and execution and to this day is the most reliable source of Socratesâ life and beliefs.  In 387 B.C.E., Plato established the Academy, which was the first university and source of higher education in Europe (Plato, 2009).  

=== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Philosophy&lt;/font&gt; ===

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;45%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
''&quot;Education and admonition commence in the first years of childhood, and last to the very end of life.&quot;''

&lt;u&gt;Plato&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Plato disagreed with some aspects of Socratesâ philosophies.  Plato believed that knowledge could not be produced through learning (Kiss, 2006).  His belief was that it could only be cultivated where it already existed.  This could have a lot to do with his aristocratic heritage.  Plato seems to agree with a Sophist standpoint that knowledge is given passively. However, Plato was a strong advocate, developer and administrator of dialectic methods, such as the Socratic Method.



== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Sophists&lt;/font&gt; ==

In the 5th century there was such a growing demand for teachers that a class of teaching professionals known as the Sophists emerged.  Instead of being congregated in a school, this professional class was scattered across Europe (Sophists, 2006).  They were the first teachers in Greece to ever charge fees for their services (Sophists, 2006).  Wise men had never thought to charge fees for sharing their knowledge.  These men, such as Socrates, saw their knowledge as a benefit for the world.  

Sophists were more politically charged and used persuasion and rhetoric in their instruction.  They didnât place any high priority on finding the truth, for their belief was that they could persuade anyone to believe what they wanted them to (Sophists, 2006).  
Another main focus of their professions was rivalry among them and with non-sophist teachers (Sophists, 2006).  Socrates was opposed to the Sophists and resented to be insinuated as one of them.  

During Platoâs time the Sophists began to decline and by Aristotleâs time the name âsophistâ had a contemptuous meaning (Sophists, 2006).

== &lt;font color=&quot;FFBDBD&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/font&gt; ==

Today we find that most of our classrooms have become like the Sophists.  Students are expected to memorize and take the teacherâs word as law.  The government has become dictator of what we teach and do not teach.  With standard focused teaching and the constant plague of high-stakes tests, our students see their education as a bore and repression.


There is some hope.  If we, as future educators, take applications of Socrates and Plato into our classrooms, get students interested in their education, and make the learning about the student and not just the material then the future could be brighter than today.
Letâs bring the focus back to a learner-centered environment.

=== What is Constructivism? ===


	The root word of &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Constructivism''&lt;/font&gt; is âconstruct.â Basically, Constructivism is the theory that knowledge must be constructed by a person, not just transmitted to the person. People construct knowledge by taking new information and integrating it with their own pre-existing knowledge (Cooper, 2007; Woolfolk, 2007). When trying to learn the applications of Constructivism, it is good to know the theory first.


=== Jean Piagetâs Theory of Constructivism ===


	Jean Piaget was one of the major constructivists in past history. His theory looks at how people construct knowledge cognitively. In Piagetâs theory, everybody has &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''schemes''&lt;/font&gt;. People organize and structure knowledge and information. This organization, or structure, of knowledge and information is known as a scheme. For example, âfoodâ can have a scheme. It can be organized into different food groups such as the following: bread/ pastas, fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy, and sweets (Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007). 


	According to Piagetâs theory, one way people construct knowledge is through &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''assimilation''&lt;/font&gt;. People assimilate when they incorporate new knowledge and information into pre-existing schemes. Here is an example. A child sees a car and learns that it can be called a vehicle. Then the child sees a motorcycle and learns that it can be called a vehicle as well. Then the child sees a truck and calls it a vehicle. Basically, the child developed a scheme for âvehiclesâ and incorporated trucks into that scheme (Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007).


	Another way people construct knowledge, according to Piagetâs theory, is through &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''accommodation''&lt;/font&gt;. People accommodate when they modify or change their pre-existing schemes. Here is an example. A child sees a dog (a furry four-legged animal) and learns that it can be called a pet. Then the child sees a cat (a furry four-legged animal) and learns that it can be called a pet as well. Then the child sees a raccoon (also a furry four-legged animal) and calls it a pet. Afterwards, the child learns from his or her parents that a raccoon is not a pet. At first, the child develops a scheme for âpetâ which includes all furry four-legged animals. Then the child learns that not all furry four-legged animals are pets. Because of this, the child  needs to accommodate his or her scheme for âpet.â  According to Piaget, people learn through a balance of assimilation and accommodation (Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007).


=== Lev Vygotskyâs Theory of Constructivism ===


	Lev Vygotsky was another major constructivist in past history. While Jean Piagetâs theory is a cognitive perspective, Vygotskyâs theory is a sociocultural perspective. His theory looks at how people construct knowledge by collaborating with others. In Vygotskyâs theory, people learn and construct knowledge within the &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''Zone of Proximal Development''&lt;/font&gt;. People have an independent level of performance where they can do things independently. Likewise, people have an instructional level of performance where they can do things above the independent level with the help and guidance of others. The range, or zone, between these two levels is the Zone of Proximal Development (Cooper, 2007; Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007; Woolfolk, 2007). 


	In the Zone of Proximal Development, assistance needs to be given by another person. This assistance, help, or guidance is known as &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;''scaffolding''&lt;/font&gt;. Because the zone has a range, assistance needs to be given, but not too much. If not enough assistance is given, a person may not be able to learn the task. On the other hand, if too much assistance is given, the person may not be able to fully construct the new acquired information into knowledge. For example, a child needs help doing math homework. With no help, the child may not be able to do it. With too much help, the homework is done for the child, so the child may not fully understand the math homework anyway (Cooper, 2007; Kail &amp; Cavanaugh, 2007; Woolfolk, 2007).

=== Constructivism in the Classroom ===


	In the classroom, the teacher can use Constructivism to help teach the students. The teacher can base the instruction on the cognitive strategies, experiences, and culture of the students. The teacher can make the instruction interesting by correlating it with real life applications, especially applications within the studentsâ own communities. Students can work and collaborate together during particular activities. The teacher can provide feedback for the students so they know what they can do independently and know what they need help with. New concepts can be related to the studentsâ prior knowledge. The teacher can also explain how new concepts can be used in different contexts and subjects. All these ideas are based on Constructivism(Sherman &amp; Kurshan, 2005).


	Research shows that constructivistic teaching can be effective. According to research conducted by Jong Suk Kim at Chungnum National University in Korea, constructivistic teaching is more effective than traditional teaching when looking at the studentsâ academic achievement. The research also shows that students have some preference for constructivistic teaching (Kim, 2005). Again, when the theory of Constructivism is actually applied in the classroom, it can be effective for teaching students.  


=== Response from the Author ===


	According to the research, incorporating constructivistic teaching into the classroom is a good idea. Allowing students to work together can be beneficial; however, there may be a problem with time management if the classroom management is not under control. Correlating new concepts to real life applications is a great way to further develop studentsâ schemes. Again, the problem with doing this may be time management. With all the material that needs to be covered throughout the school year due to standardized testing, it is possible that real life applications can become âirrelevantâ because they wonât be on the standardized tests. 


	Based on Constructivism, it can be argued that rote memorization is not real learning. Rote memorization requires no assimilation or accommodation. It is like putting information on a solitary island all by itself. Once the information has served its temporary purpose, it will just float away. By assimilating new information into pre-existing schemes, this problem can be avoided.


	The last point is that it is not the sole responsibility of the teachers to educate the students. According to Constructivism, students have some responsibilities when learning. A student may be quick to blame the teacher for not understanding the material, but it could be the case that the student it not doing everything he or she could be doing. Because knowledge is constructed, not transmitted, students need to make an effort to assimilate, accommodate, and make sense of information. They also need to make an effort to collaborate with others, especially if they are having a hard time understanding the information.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Teacher-Centered vs. Student-Centered Philosophies&lt;/big&gt;''' &lt;/big&gt; 
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''By: Hope Gibbs'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;



== Learning Targets ==


Readers will be able to understand the differences of teacher-centered philosophies and student-centered philosophies.


== Introduction ==


In todayâs school, there are essentially two types of teaching philosophies.  Both types will be different in their teaching styles; however, both want the best for their students.  So what kind of teachers am I talking about?  I am talking about teacher-centered and student centered teachers.  Their philosophies are different.  What type are you?  Your ideas and attitudes about education will help shape what kind of teacher you want to be.

== Students vs. Teachers ==


Even though both teacher-centered and student-centered teachers what to help the students learn, they are like night and day in their approaches.  Teacher-centered philosophies focus around essentialism and perennialism.  Some of the most popular student-centered philosophies include progressivism, social reconstructionism, and existentialism.  According to Mary P. Driscoll, âteacher-centered and student-centered views put primacy on the learning of the student, and all other aspects of the learning environment and instruction are planned from that initial standpointâ (1999).  


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #5CB3FF;
border: solid 10px #5CB3FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Check out this website. Here is a great article from Teacher Vision that helps explain the differences between student and teacher-centered approaches. '''http://www.teachervision.fen.com/teaching-methods-and-management/curriculum-planning/4786.html'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




== What are Teacher-Centered Philosophies? ==


Teacher-centered philosophies are the ones you are probably most familiar with.  These philosophies focus on what the teacher wants his or her students to learn.  There are a lot of factors that determine what kind of teaching philosophies to use.  Shawn A. Faulkner and Christopher M. Cook state that âthe state tests seem to drive the curriculum and warrant more teacher-focused instructional methodsâlecture, worksheets, and whole-class discussionâ (2006). We remember this from our own experiences in school.  Do you remember when you were in class and the teacher was in front and she lectured to you?  Everyone student remembers taking notes off of the blackboard.  These are just two examples of teacher-centered practices.  Kathy Brown clarifies that âthe teacher-centered approach is associated chiefly with the transmission of knowledgeâ (2003).  Getting the knowledge out and to the student is the main focus.  The students are accountable for what they have learned and the teachers are also.  Teachers are in control and they plan out activities and learning strategies according to specific times during the lesson (Teacher Vision). Teacher-centered philosophies that are mostly used in teaching include essentialism and perennialism.  Let us briefly look at these two philosophies.  


'''&lt;big&gt;1. Essentialism in the Classroom&lt;/big&gt;''' 


In the excerpt of the book Teachers, Schools, and Society:  A Brief Introduction to Education, authors David Miller Sadker, Ph.D and Karen R. Zittleman, Ph.D state how âEssentialism strives to teach students the accumulated knowledge of our civilization through core courses in the traditional academic disciplinesâ (2007).  What this means is that our society has certain viewpoints and practices that schools must pass down to students in a more authoritarian way.  According to William Gaudelli, who is an assistant professor of social studies education at the University of Central Florida, âessentialists concern themselves with teaching students how to survive, succeed in their lives, and not be a burden to othersâ (Gaudelli, 2002).  Essentialist teachers believe that what they teach will help their students in real-life situations as they grow older (Gaudelli, 2002).  In the classroom, you will most likely see traditional subjects such as math, English, science, and history as the foundations of learning.  âEssentialist teachers rely on achievement tests scores to evaluate progress and teachers expect that students will leave school not only with basic skills, but also disciplined, practical minds that are capable of applying lessons taught in school in the real worldâ (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).  In essence, teachers want their students to be able to use what they have learned in school and use it appropriately in the real world.


'''&lt;big&gt;2. Perennialism in the Classroom&lt;/big&gt;'''


Perennialism and essentialism may sounds somewhat alike, but perennialists are in fact different in their approaches.  âPerennialists recommend that students learn directly from the âGreat Booksââworks by historyâs finest thinkers and writers, books meaningful today as when they where first writtenâ (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).   âPerennialist generally prefer a past orientation, because it tends to be based on historical truth, rather than conjecture about the present and guessing about the futureâ (Gaudelli, 2002).  This means that perennialists believe that a student can be influence by such heroes in our past like Washington and Lincoln.  In a perennialist classroom, the teacher will focus on the importance of reading and will often use the underlying reading lessons to make a moral point (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).  These teachers want to teach their students how to be excellent leaders in society just like history portrays.


== What are Student-Centered Philosophies? ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;âwhat a child can do today with assistance, she will be able to do by herself tomorrow.â -Lev Vygotsky.&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Student-centered learning is just what is says.  It is basically learning by doing.  Teachers believe that education should be child-centered.  According to Julie K. Brown, she basically says that âstudent-centered instruction is when the planning, teaching, and assessment revolve around the needs and abilities of the studentsâ (2008).  This is quite the opposite from what you have just read. âRegardless of variations in developmental levels, all children are exposed to the same content in the same time period and the teacherâs role is to facilitate growth by utilizing the interests and unique needs of students as a guide for meaningful instructionâ (Teacher Vision).  According to Becky A. Smerdon and David T. Burkam, âstudents develop analytic skills that can be applied to other problems and situations, rather than accept their teachersâ explanationâ (1999).  This technique gives the students the chance to use their abilities and experiences to solve problems and find new ways of learning.  One example of this would be if a math teacher lets his or her students work in groups to solve different problems or let students create their own test.  With student centered learning, students and teachers are committed to working together and finding the best achievable way of learning.  


'''&lt;big&gt;1. Progressivism in the Classroom&lt;/big&gt;'''


âProgressivisms build the curriculum around the experiences, interests, and abilities of students, and encourage students to work together cooperativelyâ (Sadker and Zittleman).  The progressivist teacher would use games like Monopoly or Jeopardy to illustrate important points.  Unlike Perennialists, Progressivists do not believe in teaching âGreat Books,â but use âcomputer simulations, field trips, and interactive websites on the Internet to offer realistic learning challenges for students, and build on studentsâ multiple intelligencesâ (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).  Many props are used to expand the studentsâ abilities and to make them think a little differently.  Instead of just lecturing to students, teachers try to find more interesting ways to communicate important learning techniques and this âaffords students opportunities  to explore ideas and construct knowledge based on their own observations and experiencesâ (Smerdon and Burkam, 1999).  Teachers ultimately serve as their studentsâ guide and they want their students to use problem-solving strategies they have learned in class to help manage the challenges of life.  


'''&lt;big&gt;2. Social Reconstructivism in the Classroom&lt;/big&gt;'''


âSocial Reconstructionism encourages schools, teachers, and students to focus their studies and energies on alleviating pervasive inequities, and as the name implies, reconstruct into a new and more just social orderâ (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).  Social reform is the key to this type of philosophy and social challenges and problems help guide teachers with their message.  A social reconstructionist teacher wants to not only inform their students, but rouse emotions and point out the inequalities that surround them and the world (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).  The teacher engages the students to discuss and address problems such as poverty, homelessness, violence and many more issues that create disparity.  The teacherâs role is to explore social problems, suggest alternate perspectives, and assist studentsâ examinations of these problems (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).    For examples in the classroom, âone group of students might analyze news coverage of racial and ethic groups of a community or students might arrest and trial records in order to determine the role race plays in differential application of the lawâ (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).  The main focus of this philosophy is to help students find ways to improve society.  The teacher wants the student to value society and realize that there is unfairness in the world and it is important to be aware and act as advocates for those who are being judged. 


'''&lt;big&gt;3. Existentialism  in the Classroom&lt;/big&gt;'''


Existentialism is another student-centered philosophy.  âExistentialism places the highest degree of importance on student perceptions, decisions, and actionsâ  and individuals are responsible for determining for themselves what is true or false, right or wrong, beautiful or ugly (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).  To sum it up, students make choices and then take the time to evaluate those choices.  âThe teacherâs role is to help students define their own essence by exposing them to various paths they may take in life and by creating an environment in which they can freely choose their wayâ (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).  This philosophy means that students think for themselves and are aware of responsibilities assigned to them.  Existentialism philosophies say no to tradition and focuses on the studentsâ unique talents.  The teacher views each student as an individual and students learn how to achieve their full potential by trying new concepts.  


== Conclusion ==


There are many philosophies that come along with teacher and student-centered teaching.  Which one is the best?  It depends on the content being taught.  Research indicates that teachersâ personal and professional characteristics are related to how they teach (Smerdon and Berkam, 1999).  The way a teacher feels comfortable with the subject matter may influence him or her on how the subject will be taught.  The most important goal is to teach the students and help them prepare for life after school.  Both teacher-centered and student-centered philosophies can achieve that for the student.

=&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000066&quot; face=&quot;ESTRANGELO EDESSA&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt; LEARNING OBJECTIVES&lt;/b&gt; =
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000066&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;After completing this lesson the learner should: 
&lt;font color=&quot;#669999&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the basic differences between teacher-centered and studen-centered education&lt;li&gt;Be able to describe characteristics of each teaching method as they relate to the teacher, the student, the nature of knowledge, and the classroom environment&lt;li&gt;Have an understanding of the support for each philosophy&lt;li&gt;Have an understanding of the drawbacks for each philosophy&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
As prospective educators, itâs important to understand how you and your future classroom will incorporate the crowd of theories and ideas that currently influence education and learning.  Itâs very easy to get lost in the swirl of educational theories and âismsâ that crop up in discussions of educational practices. 
Despite the rich variety of ideas about learning, most teaching approaches fall into one court or the other â teacher centered, or student centered.  These two very different views can themselves be further subdivided in to wildly different ideas about the role of the teacher, the potential of the child, and the nature of knowledge.  Rather than getting bogged down in semantics that not necessarily helpful, what will be discussed here is the underlying philosophies of these two views, and how they impact the teacher, the student, and the classroom environment.



=&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000066&quot; face=&quot;ESTRANGELO EDESSA&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt; TEACHER-CENTERED PHILOSOPHIES&lt;/b&gt; =
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Teacher centered philosophies represent a more traditional approach to knowledge and learning.   The philosophical underpinnings of this school of thought are best illustrated by the following logic: âEducation implies teaching, teaching implies knowledge, knowledge is truth, truth is the same everywhere, therefore, education everywhere should be the sameâ (Jacobson 1999)
&lt;ul&gt;
==&lt;b&gt;Core Ideas&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
With origins in Renaissance philosophies, traditional views primarily seek to wrap the student around a fixed bundle knowledge.  Knowledge, within this framework,  is the set of skills and information considered necessary to meet the expectations of âreal worldâ environments.  (Darling  2003)

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Holt (1969) offers and excellent encapsulation of the tradition perspective of the nature of knowledge:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;70%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color:transparent; #CCFFFF;

border: solid 2px #99CCCC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

                  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;âOf the vast body of human knowledge, there are certain bits and pieces that can be called essential, that everyone should know. The extent to which a person can be considered educated, qualified to live intelligently in todayâs world and be a useful member of society, depends on the amount of this essential knowledge that he carries about with him.  It is the duty of schools, therefore, to get as much of this essential knowledge as possible into the minds of childrenâ (as cited in Blake et al., 2003) 

 

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;The Classroom Environment&lt;/b&gt;==

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;âInstruction takes place in a somewhat passive environment in which the student spends the majority of in-class time at a desk; the only sensory interface with the subject matter is auditory, and perhaps marginally tactile in the case of note taking.  Lectures and readings are used in information delivery, making the students predominantly recipients of information.  Rote memorization and repetitive practice are used for reinforcement, and subjects are highly compartmentalized with little crossover from subject to subject or even beyond the classroom.   The information to be learned takes priority over the learner. (Diseth 2003). 

==&lt;b&gt;The Role of the Teacher&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
The teacherâs role is that of information distributor and performance evaluator.  They will use drills, memorization, and lectures to disperse information to the students. Instruction is almost strictly a monolog, with the student body addressed as a collective unit during instruction. The teacher relates the set goals that each student must attain to be considered adequate.  The teacher possess all of the knowledge that the student must learn, and is responsible for maintaining a well ordered and structured environment; as a result, the teacher has absolute authority when instructing and assessing (Smith 2003). 

==&lt;b&gt;Assessment&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Assessment consists largely of testing and assignments which rely on correctly recalling and reproducing the expected information.  Exams are often in a form-like format that features short answer, multiple-choice, or essay questions that require students recall course material and coordinate answers with questions. Successful learning consists of the studentâs accurate recollection of the information that is required, and is normally given a grade that represents a raw measure of the ratio of correct to incorrect responses.

==&lt;b&gt;The Debate&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
A key defense of this method relies on the field of developmental psychology.   The human mindâs ability to accept and retain new information is at its peak during childhood, while reasoning and problem-solving skills are at their lifetime low.  This means that while young children have a vast potential to memorize information, their abilities to extrapolate any further meaning from that information is very limited.  (Feldman 2006) Information is being presented in a way that is compatible with their development.   Furthermore, it is argued that younger students in particular lack self-discipline and the reasoning skills to self-direct, and so require a rigid and absolute framework is a must in order to facilitate learning at all.  (Mayer 2004) 

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
One of the many critiques of this approach hinges on the same developmental realities: children have difficulty understanding the importance of the body of information they are expected to learn my heart, and so become frustrated, bored with, or even hostile toward the process.  (Darling 2003)  They are simply exposed to information and then held accountable for it with no valuable context as to why.  John Dewey, influential philosopher and educational reformer, compared a student in such a learning environment to a spectator, simply collecting information for later use rather using it to learn to produce and manipulate knowledge themselves. (as cited in Husen and Postlethwaite 1985)

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Assessment methods are also seen as problematic, as they focus almost exclusively on reproducing the information previously received; not only does this require no original thought (critical thinking) it can result in a failure to learn on a deeper, more permanent level, and establish within the learner a fear of failure and a need to conform to expectations as predominant motivators for learning.  (Diseth 2007)  

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
The variance in cognitive and rational development from child to child also raises issues and gives rise to the argument that children who develop more quickly will be held back by the fixed pace of learning, and that children who lag developmentally will fall through the cracks of a rigid system, and eventually be identified as unmotivated or unteachable by evaluation methods designed to measure all students against and arbitrary fixed standard.   (Meyer 2004) &lt;/ul&gt;


=&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000066&quot; face=&quot;ESTRANGELO EDESSA&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt; STUDENT-CENTERED PHILOSOPHIES&lt;/b&gt; =

&lt;ul&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;Core Ideas&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Ideologies that stem from the concept of student oriented education are many and varied.  Despite a myriad of distinct schools that fit in the category there are a few overarching themes that define each as student-centered, and are largely an amalgam of ideas originally put forth by John Locke and Jean-Jacque Rouseau:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Structured learning environments impose arbitrary limits on a studentâs natural intellectual ability &lt;li&gt;Sensory input is essential to for cognitive development&lt;li&gt;The value of the learner is greater than that of the learning itself. &lt;li&gt;Truly functional knowledge can be integrated into applications beyond the subject itself, and permits the learner to apply subject material to new situations and synthesize new ideas.&lt;li&gt;Universal standards of learning imposed on every student stifles the individual and promotes conformity &lt;li&gt;Students are social and cultural being, therefore utilizing socio-cultural element is crucial to worthwhile  learning. &lt;/ul&gt; (Bertrand 1995; Jacobson 1999)

==&lt;b&gt;Definition of Knowledge&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Without a heavy curriculum focus, knowledge becomes a framework of information and ideas that is organic and dynamic. Students should gain not only information about a subject, but the ability to cross-apply those ideas into other area both academic and otherwise. (Bertrand 1995) Learning how to learn is an important element of knowledge itself.  Information in and of itself is not considered knowledge â education of this type seeks to develop wisdom in the student as well.  Teaching the student how to effectively gain and use knowledge holds value equal to the knowledge itself.

==&lt;b&gt;The Classroom&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Course subject matter is actively explored by the learner for use as a tool for further learning and achievement and done in a way that is best suited to each individual student.  Activities involve group discussion, dialog with the instructor, field trips, and hand-on projects that require critical thinking and creativity in addition to familiarity with the subject matter.  The class room should afford opportunities to use what they have gained in the classroom to synthesize original ideas. 

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Socialization is also an important classroom element â because of the emphasis on individuality, as well as application skills, it follows that a group of students will have access to broader collective viewpoint than a solitary student.  (Jacobsen 2007)

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
In some cases, a discovery learning approach may be used, in which students are given problems to solve or projects to complete, but little specific instruction.  They are free to discover, by their own methods and ideas, how to solve the problem.  The teacher only involvement is to affirm correct solutions, and encourage the student to try again for incorrect solutions. (Mayer 2004) The theory is that this facilitates a deeper level of learning, and gives the student a practical knowledge in addition to acquiring new information.

==&lt;b&gt;The Teacher's Role&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
The teacherâs role in a child centered classroom environment is often described as that of a guide, providing direction and leadership and organizing activities and projects designed to immerse the student in the course material. They are responsible for creating an environment that provides opporotunity for discovery and interaction.


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
There is also a sharp focus on supporting the success and psycho-emotional well being of their students. Teachers must be attuned to each student and their strengths and abilities, and have access to a broad set of skills and strategies in order to provide appropriate guidance to each student as an individual, rather than simply master classroom management  and information delivery skills to be applied to the class as a whole.

==&lt;b&gt;Assesment&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Assessment in a student centered environment should be âproof of learning, rather that forcing the student to prove what they have learned (Bertrand 1995).â  Assessment methods should measure progress without placing emphasis on a pass/fail scenario, which can produce a sense of rejection or failure leading to discouragement (Bertrand 1995)

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
As opposed to a curriculum focused method of reproducing the course content, they will be given assignments that require them to âcomprehend, synthesize, apply, and evaluate the course contentâ (LaLopa 2005);  It is not unusual for the student to play a role in their own assessment; peer reviewing and grading is often utilized, and students are frequently given the opportunity to assess their instructor and their classroom, as well as help to determine how they  themselves should be evaluated. 

==&lt;b&gt;The Debate&lt;/b&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
A collection of studies compiled by Diseth (2007) indicates the extent of studentâs direct involvement in their education experience is directly proportional to their level of interest and commitment, which is in turn directly proportional to their overall performance. 

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
One of the counter arguments against the student-focused classroon is the danger of  ââ¦methods that promote hands-on activity or group discussions [becoming] ends in themselvesâ (Meyer 2004); the concern is that the exploratory nature of progressive learning too easily loses its focus and entertains rather that educates, leaving children innappropriately prepared. 

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
There is also concern that learning based on student exploration wastes times with trial-and-error activities that do not produce sufficient benefits.   Studies reported by Mayer (2004) suggests that discovery learners actually scored lower on math and language evaluations that their traditional classroom counterparts. &lt;/ul&gt;

Discovering what philosophy (or philosophies) will govern your future classroom is an important journey for any prospective educator.  Too often, it is one that is oversimplified to âWhat kind of teacher are youâ questionnaires and dizzying breakdowns of the varieties of âismsâ for you to shop from.   But the true starting point for establishing and earnest philosophy of education lies in discerning which of these schools of thought â student-centered or teacher-centered â best represents your philosophical outlook in general, and your attitudes and ideals toward yourself as an instructor, the purpose and goal of the classroom, and the growth and success of your future students.

== Educational Milestones of the 17th and 18th Centuries ==
'''

''by Kim Rodriguez''


Education in the 17th and 18th centuries was influenced primarily by theologians, philosophers, and government which included the pedagogies of Sir Francis Bacon of England, Wolfgang Ratke of Germany, René Descartes of France, Jean-Jacques Rousseau of Switzerland, John Comenius (a.k.a. Komensky) of Moravia, and John Locke of England.  There were other groups of teachers that impacted education reform during this period such as the Jesuits, the Oratorians, and the Puritan reformers; however, discussion for this text will be focused on the &lt;u&gt;individuals&lt;/u&gt; who have made an impact on education during this Age of Enlightenment.  Ideologies and methodologies were set forth and established as a result of these influences, many of which are in practice today.  For example, Comenius's ideas for separating students into three levels of schooling based on age is popularly structured in today's school systems.  We have elementary, middle, and high school, as well as higher learning in colleges.  The milestones that were made have changed the way education is perceived and the way in which teaching is conducted with great thought aimed towards what is best for the student to become a contributing member of society.
&lt;u&gt;                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;/u&gt;

====Sir Francis Bacon (1561â1626)====

'''''Knowledge is power.âNam et ipsa scientia potestas est''''' - ''&lt;small&gt;Sir Francis Bacon&lt;/small&gt;''

Bacon observed that the educators of his time were close-minded and ineffective because they presented themselves as orators of empty rhetoric rather than teachers of factual scientific information based on proven theory.  His approach to teaching included a method he called empiricism, &quot;the doctrine that knowledge derives from experience&quot; (Merriam-Webster). Bacon argued that pupils need to be prepared for life through proper schooling so that they would be better able to function within, and contribute to, their society.  He believed that the science of life and the use of inductive reasoning would best prepare a person for nearly all aspects of living.  One form of inductive reasoning and the empirical method that we use today is the Scientific Method, based largely on Bacon's philosophies of observing, studying, and analyzing factual data rather than relying on the ideas and guesswork of our own or others. The Scientific Method was originally named for him and is sometimes referred to as the Baconian Method (EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica).
  
====Rene Descartes (1596-1650)====

'''''I think- therefore, I am (''cogito ergo sum'')''''' - ''&lt;small&gt;Rene Descartes&lt;/small&gt;''

Descartes had a different approach in mind for teaching and learning than Sir Francis Bacon's empiricist ideas.  Unlike the analytically structured approach, he believed that the basis for learning originates from human reasoning which must be the foundation for all critical thinking and analytical practices. Arguably, one of his greatest achievements is his work, ''La gÃ©omÃ©trie''.  Descartes ''La gÃ©omÃ©trie'' explains how to apply algebraic computations to geometry, also known as Cartesian geometry today (O'Connor, Robertson).  His work focuses on these major points:

    ''' 1.  First step towards a theory of invariants
     '''2.  Algebra makes it possible to recognize problems in geometry'''
     '''3.  Algebra imports into geometry the principles of division and hierarchy method'''
     '''4.  Geometrical solvability is not possible without algebra'''
                                                                        (O'Connor, Robertson)
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''Interesting note:'''  Descartes awakened at 11:00 each morning for most of his life due to an undetermined illness; however, during his stay with Queen Christina of Sweden he was requested to draw tangents each morning at 5:00.  After a few months in this environment, cold and early morning awakenings, he died of pneumonia (O'Connor, Robertson).
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

René Descartes also the invented the way we plot points on a graph.  This method is called the Cartesian Coordinate System, which is used the same way all over the world for purposes of mapping and graphing by plotting points (plot points horizontally first, vertically second). Although Descartes might be best known as a great philosopher, his most notable achievements are in the field of mathematics and much of his math theory (as shown in the table above) is in use today.

====John Comenius (Jan Komensky) (1592-1670)====

'''''...the whole of the human race may become educated, men of all ages, all conditions, both sexes and all nations.''''' - ''&lt;small&gt;Comenius&lt;/small&gt;''

The above quote comes from Comenius's work ''Pampaedia'', in which he emphasized the belief that everyone should be educated to fulfill their lives, an ideal he called ''Pansophism'' meaning universal wisdom. Comenius, once a bishop of the Moravian Church, developed this philosophy shortly after escaping &quot;religious persecution by taking refuge in Poland, Hungary, Sweden, and The Netherlands&quot; (Gutek). Comenius was a leading philosopher of education during this period.  He proposed the segregation of schools according to age and grade levels. At seven to 12, pupils would enter a &quot;vernacular school&quot; (Gutek) where there would be six different classes, one for each age.  During this time the pupil would learn &quot;religion, ethics, diction, reading, writing, math, music, economy, civics, history, geography, and handicraft&quot; (EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica).  In these lower levels, the pupil would hone his/her imaginative and memorization skills.  At 13-18, pupils would learn Latin, i.e. grammar.  Courses involving language arts and the sciences would be further studied.  At 19-24, the pupil would continue on to higher education at a university which Comenius believed each province should establish.  In 1657, Comenius's methods were incorporated into The Great Didactic which emphasizes two schools of thought:  the Arts and the Sciences.  Additional publications by Comenius were ''The Gate of Tongues Unlocked'' (1631), which was used to teach pupils Latin from their native language; also ''Orbis Sensualium Pictus'' (1658), which was a picture book for young readers.  Comenius believed that children learned best through sensory perceptions and pictures that identified with labeled objects.  Today, classes that are grouped by age, two primary schools of thought (arts and sciences), and the use of illustrated children's books to promote literacy is a nearly universal ideal.

====John Locke (1632-1704)====

'''''Let us then suppose the Mind to be, as we say, white Paper, void of all Characters, without any Ideas; How comes it to be furnished...? To this I answer, in one word, From Experience: In that, all our Knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives it self'''.'' - ''&lt;small&gt;John Locke&lt;/small&gt;''

The above quote comes from Locke's ''An Essay of Understanding''.  His main idea was that humans are born with minds that are &quot;blank slates - ''tabula rasa'', and empty of ideas&quot; (Gutek).  Locke believed that the human mind should entertain initial thoughts that should progress and yield to complicated thoughts and ideas.  Locke believed that a person must experience what he/she learns from life situations.  His writings were very important during the Age of Enlightenment because his thoughts focused not only on education during that era, but also government.  State education was a major concern for philosophers during that period and Locke's influence in politics may have helped pave the way for his philosophies to take root in government planning for education.


====Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)====

'''''I hate books; they only teach us to talk about things we know nothing about'''.'' - ''&lt;small&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau&lt;/small&gt;''

Rousseau helped bring about an educational revolution in France with his work &quot;Emile&quot;.  In this book Rousseau talks about how children should be allowed to be outside in the sunlight playing; this is where they learn the best.  He also states that children have stages of development as they grow and education should coincide with them.  Before age 12 a child is limited in the complex thought so they should be taught simply.  Between ages 12 and 16 reason starts to develop and by age 16 children become young adults; young adults should be taught a trade such as masonry or carpentry.  A child that grows up in this fashion will have the best possibility to develop to his full potential.  Rousseau also says that education begins at home and parents should not preach but lead by example.  For the most part Rousseau believes that children should make their own decisions and their educators should be there for support.       




==Educating the Masses during the Age of Enlightenment==

During this era, philosophers and educators believed that deductive and inductive reasoning was paramount in the teacher and learning process. Though most of the 17th and 18th century pedagogies originate in Europe, these ideas made a great impact on influential Americans such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, who both saw the importance of scientific, critical, and exploratory thought, as well as &quot;a civic education&quot; (Gutek).  So given all of these ideologies, many of which are closely aligned to one another in some way, how did some leaders of nations comply?  Below are some examples of attempts that were made at that time.

'''In Prussia:'''  Mandatory schooling for all children ages 5-14 was implemented under the regime of Frederick the Great of Prussia.  His minister was Freiherr von Zedlitz who &quot;supported the founding of new schools and the centralization of school administration under an Oberschulkollegium, or national board of education (1787)&quot; (EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica).

'''In Russia:'''  Catherine II of Russia attempted to nationalize education.  She issued an education act in 1786 which called for two years of study in district schools followed by five years of study in provincial schools.  Religious instruction was absent from these schools.  Unfortunately, only half of the towns had the schools (approximately 250 towns).  Alexander I implemented a system of education that was free and controlled by the state, which led all the way through the university level.  However, years later these reforms came under re-consideration by conservatives.  

'''In America:'''  Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, well-known Francophiles and ambassadors to France, embraced and incorporated the new ideas which were implemented in the European countries as much as possible and helped influence a strong foundation for education in America. Compulsory education became paramount in early America.  Although most school instruction was initially deeply based on religious modules from Puritanical influences, the later political separation of church and state ('''''First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States - Article [1]''''' - [http://www.house.gov/house/Constitution/Amend.html]) removed religious instruction from state supported schools.

border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Thomas Jefferson declared that John Locke, Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton were the &quot;three greatest men the world had ever produced&quot; (Peterson, 1236). &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;









'''''Note:'''''
''We take for granted that compulsory schooling in our world today is the norm; however, evidence indicates that nearly 50% of all children in the world (ages 6-18) do not attend school (Gutek).  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) strives to help all children in the world to attend school and eradicate illiteracy.  While much success has been achieved by such organizations, there is still much to be done.''

----

=='''Education Today: Lets See How Far We've Come'''==

The first concept of a teacher instructing a body of students and spreading the &quot;love of learning&quot; or ''philosophy'' was introduced by the great thinkers of Ancient Greece and Rome who taught and explored subject areas ranging from art, nature and science to &quot;rhetoric&quot; the ability to sway audiences much like today's modern public speaking classes. (Spielvogel, 2009) From then on, as this early idea of learning through instruction spread, ''pedagogy'' or the study of learning became one of the most speculated on and debated subject areas among mankind and remains to be so today.

For the purpose of this text, we will examine some of the ideas and philosophies that were developed by the great thinkers of the 17th and 18th centuries in particular, that continue to be practiced by the instructors of today.

=='''Famous Philosophers of Education in the 17th and 18th Centuries'''==

Like their predecessors in Ancient Greece and Rome, the learned men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries liked to assess the world around them, questioning their existence, methodologies and practices (Spielvogel, 2009) . At times, these men debated their ideas with their colleagues and other times they wrote pieces based on their findings that occasionally would gain popularity and would eventually make these men famous. Some of the more famous of these men included ''Sir Francis Bacon'', ''Rene Descartes'', a man named ''John Locke'' and the American founding fathers ''Benjamin Franklin'' and ''Thomas Jefferson''.

The first name mentioned, '''''Sir Francis Bacon''''', belongs to the man who was long known as the father of modern science and was the founder of the still widely used today ''Scientific Method'' (Review:scientific, 1975). Born in 1561, Bacon theorized that scientific experimentation should be experienced first hand, and that any such experimentation should be done for a practical purpose, or end in sight (Review:scientific, 1975). Students today still actively participate in experiments in the classroom and in labs in schools worldwide.  They also still use Bacon's ''Scientific Method'' to record their observations and findings during these firsthand experiences with science.

Another great mind of that era was '''''René Descartes'''''(1596-1650), is best known for creating a systematic form of what is known as analytic geometry, sometimes now referred to as Cartesian geometry (Descartes, Rene, 2009). He also invented the way that equations are plotted on graphs, and made considerable contributions to algebra and its use of lower case letters in variable equations (Descartes,Rene, 2009). The mathematician's theory on learning and philosophy drifted considerably from the romantic notions of limitless possibilities and causes of things in nature and of man into a more logical way of looking at the world around him (Descartes, Rene, 2009).  He is famously quoted as saying &quot;I think; therefore I am,&quot; meaning that because he was of sound mind and the thought had occurred to him that he must, therefore exist. In short Descartes thought it was a waste of time to dwell on that which could not be proven by fact (Descartes, Rene, 2009).

In 1632, another scientific theorist, and close friend and colleague of famous physicist Sir Isaac Newton, '''''John Locke''''' was born (Axtell, 1965).  John Locke is ironically most famous for an essay written to a student of his that is speculated to have been a collaborative effort between himself and Mr. Newton (Axtell, 1965).  The genius of what was written was the reason for why it was written in the first place (Axtell, 1965).  Locke wanted to write an essay on the current scientific findings of the day in such a way as to be easily understood and learned by the student (Axtell, 1965).  He wanted the this essay to be an aid of understanding scientific method and research rather than a study of the broad spectrum of scientific phenomena (Axtell, 1965).  His desire for easily understood material for his pupil, lends itself to one of the commonly sought after goals in the world of teaching today for learning to be student centered rather than authoritarian and teacher based (Axtell, 1965).

Perhaps a man after Locke's own heart, '''''Benjamin Franklin''''' lived between the years 1706 and 1790 (Korty, 1965).  Among several of his more famous quotes, Franklin once said on writing that it should better it's reader in some sense either intellectually or morally and above all things, a good piece of writing should be, &quot;smooth, clear and short (Korty, 1965).&quot;  He was also a big proponent of student based learning and believed that pupils retained knowledge best when they were involved in the lesson in some way (Korty, 1965).  His desire for widespread education of the masses also led him to become the developer of the first library (Korty, 1965).  The Library Company of Philadelphia began in 1731, and was the first institution of its kind that lent books, which were very expensive at the time, to the public in exchange for promissory notes as collateral (Korty, 1965).  Arguably, the library could be considered one of the most provincial additions to the educational system in history (Korty, 1965).

'''''Thomas Jefferson''''' (1743-1826) who, like Benjamin Franklin, is also one of the great founding fathers of the great nation, the United States of America, shared and expounded upon many of the aforementioned pioneers in education's beliefs and ideologies greatly (Honeywell,Jefferson,1969).  A core belief he held in common with Franklin was his great desire for a citizen base in America that was well educated (a philosophy that also began in the republic of Ancient Greece)(Spielvogel, 2009).  Jefferson, one might speculate, was probably thrilled by Francklin's library because it was his belief that &quot;no person of legal age [at the time it was 15] should enjoy the privileges of citizenry unless they were able to read in some language (Honeywell, Jefferson, 1969).&quot; The father of the University of Virginia, contributed greatly to our modern educational system through the idea of creating districts for schools and making them accessible for free by the nation's children (Honeywell, Jefferson, 1969).  At the time, this free education would last for the first three years of one's schooling, after that Jefferson, established that &quot;poor but promising students&quot; could compete for free tuition (Honeywell, Jefferson, 1969).  Thus Jefferson, really created the idea of scholarship that continues to give less affluent students today an opportunity to afford an education that they might not otherwise be able to through the merits of their academic performance.

=='''17th and 18th Century Influences on Modern Early Education'''==

While the philosophers of Ancient Greece shared with those of the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the vision of a well educated and able bodied citizenry, it wasn't until the latter period that early education had really become a major focus area and source of debate.

'''''Johann Pestalozzi''''' (1746-1827), the developer of the idea of ''intellectual property'', or the idea that ones the products of ones thoughts, words, and actions belong to their originator, was arguably one of the most influential persons in the history of early childhood education (Classics of science, 1929).  He was responsible for the spread of ideas like teacher education and lesson plans (Pestalozzi,Johann, 2005).  Pestalozzi believed that education began in the home and that child play had the ability to be incredibly influential in ones learning (Classics of science, 1929). He encouraged learning from objects and believed that teaching could occur in almost any situations or occurrence in ones early experiences (Classics of science, 1929). In a letter to a friend, Pestalozzi wrote, &quot;...Let the child not only be acted upon, but let him be an agent in intellectual education (Classics of science, 1929).&quot;[[File:A_summer_day_in_december_039.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Jacob age 3 and Amaya age 7 are the age groups that were taught in the first kindergarten.  They are engaged in the type of free play that would have been encouraged by Pestalozzi and Froebel (Taken from the Wiki Community Portal, 2009) ]]

Ten years after the death of Johann Pestalozzi, '''''Frederick Froebel''''' established the first Kindergarten in Blackenburg, Germany in 1837 (Kindergarten, 2005).  This school taught children age three to age seven by game play, story reading and singing songs (Kindergarten, 2005). It served as a transition from the home to the school environment, Froebel believed like, Pestalozzi that a great deal could be learned from play and encouraged the children to interact and take part in games freely (Kindergarten, 2005).  

The first person credited with creating the first illustrated children's text is '''''Jan Komensky''''', also known as '''''Comenius''''', a name affectionatley given to him by his colleagues (Comenius, John Amos, 2009).  Comenius ''also'' believed that learning should not focus on words but on the ''things'' or objects around the student (Review:[untitled], 1970).  Another major contribution made not just to early education but to learning as a whole was the learning of languages through &quot;parallel passages&quot;, that is taking a sentence from ones native language and corresponding it with the same sentence of the targeted language (Review:[untitled], 1970).  

Finally, eighteenth century education philosopher Jean Jacques was born in 1712 and lived until 1778 (Rousseau, 2009).  His major contribution to early education in particular was the idea of psychologically based childcare (Rousseau, 2009).  His theory that expression rather than the repression of children's thoughts produced more liberal thinking and &quot;well-balanced&quot; children, an idea that was adopted both by Froebel and Pestolozzi (Rousseau, 2009). 

=='''Summary'''==
[[File:301_wiki_picture.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Students actively participating in a modern day elementary school classroom (Taken from the Wiki Community Portal).]]
Although many important contributions were made during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries such as the library, and the establishment of the kindergarten, a unifying theme and theory of education was notably unique to the philosophers of this period.  Although the Greeks and Romans both undoubtedly influenced this era with the idea of ''pedagogy'' or the study of learning, '''''Locke''''','''''Bacon''''','''''Froebel''''','''''Pestalozzi''''','''''Komensky''''', and '''''Rousseau''''', all shared the revelation that education should be experienced first hand.  Every time a student dissects a frog and records their observations about it, or a child observes the similarity between a bouncing ball and an orange, they do so via the influence of these men.  When teachers are trained to put the student at the center of the lesson rather than simply regurgitate the thoughts and writings of others that have gone before them, they do so because of these men.

As future educators it is your job to take these philosophies and put them to practice.  Make them valid in your classroom and with the technologies available to you.  Make the student your priority, and remember another famous statement by Benjamin Franklin:

&quot;Tell me and I forget.
Teach me and I remember.
Involve me and I learn.&quot;

Go now and become a philosopher of education in your era, and perhaps the students of tomorrow will be writing contributions to pedagogy in the Wiki texts of the future!

=='''INTRODUCTION'''==

The 19th century encompassed many changes in America.  One change in particular that influenced our education system was the beginning of the public school system.  This movement made education available to the masses.  Reformers and education innovators of the time worked tirelessly to make education public instead of private, free, and state maintained.  In this article we will review the era of educational history known as the &quot;common school movement, or the &quot;common school period&quot;.  We will also discuss two of the major educational innovators that were integral in developing the first public schools, or common schools and their curriculum.
----

=='''THE COMMON SCHOOL PERIOD'''==

The years 1830 until 1872 are known as the &quot;common school movement&quot;, or the &quot;common school period&quot;.  During this period in history, great changes were made in public schooling in nearly every state of the union.  The goals of the common school movement were to provide a free education for white children, train and educate teachers, and to establish state control over public schools (Church, 1976).  Prior to common schools, the closest thing to public schools, were the schools that existed in some of the northern British colonies.  They often only lasted for 10 -12 weeks per year, favored boys, and were not free.  As a result, education was greatly influenced by race, gender and a familyâs wealth (Stone, 2001). 
There were many arguments in defense of the common school.  As the immigrant population grew in the northern states during this period, the common school was used to âAmericanizeâ all foreigners (Payne).  Yet another argument for common schools were from advocates like Horace Mann.  Mann believed that a common education for all meant that society in general would be more productive and prosperous.  He once wrote that education âcan raise more abundant harvests, and multiply the conveniences of domestic life;...it can build, transport, manufacture, mine, navigate, fortify;...a single new idea is often worth more to an individual than a hundred workmenâ (Church, 1976, p.66).
A typical day in a common school would begin around 8:45 a.m. and last until 4 p.m.  Usually breaks were taken for recess and for lunch.  The children learned from textbooks such as ''McGuffey Readers'' and Websterâs, ''American Spelling Book''.  A teacher might receive $25 a month as salary and would stay with families in the surrounding areas (Huntington, 2005).

&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

----

=='''HORACE MANN'''==

Horace Mann was born in Franklin, Massachusetts in 1796.  His education began in a one-room schoolhouse and continued until he reached Brown University.  He later studied law and found himself in the political arena.  He was soon appointed to the newly formed Massachusetts State Board of Education in the position of Secretary.  He served as Secretary from 1837 until 1848 (Sass, 2008).  Mann became known as the âFather of the Common Schoolâ (Stone, 2001). He believed that education was a universal right for all.  Everyone should have the opportunity to attend school no matter what their social class or income may be.  Mann also advocated for a longer school year and the funding of schools to be the responsibility of the state instead of the individual.  He helped establish laws for compulsory attendance and these laws were in every state by 1918 (Payne).  Mann also advocated for a more trained and professional teacher.  Training institutions called normal schools were established for teachers.  The first public normal school was opened in 1839 (Church, 1976).  Mann knew that the key to elevating the standard of learning was to elevate the standards in which the teachers were trained.  He sought to make teaching a profession (Stone, 2001).

=='''PROFESSOR WILLIAM HOLMES MCGUFFEY'''==

One of the key problems for educational reformers during the 19th century, was the creation of a curriculum.  A small publishing company called Truman and Smith played a vital role in the first textbooks for American children.  Truman and Smith wanted to sell textbooks, but first they had to find someone to write these books.  Their search ended with William McGuffey (Payne, The McGuffey Readers).  McGuffey had already published his first reader in 1841 that introduced children to his ethical code.  The book contained fifty-five lessons and the child modeled in this book was prompt, good, kind, honest and truthful (Payne, The McGuffey Readers).  The child depicted in the McGuffey Readers was a white, Protestant.  The second reader appeared almost simultaneously with the first.  It had eighty-five lessons, sixteen pictures, and one hundred sixty pages.  There were lessons on a multitude of topics.  Children learned about history, biology, and even lessons on table manners (Payne, The McGuffey Readers).  The secular tone of the McGuffey Reader was unlike any of the other Puritan texts from that era (Sass, 2008). Reformers believed that the moral training of children occurred hand in hand with their academic training.  The McGuffey Readers provided the necessary lessons in conjunction with a moral undertone.  McGuffey Readers were called âeclectic readersâ because they were written from a number of sources.  They were considered remarkable literary works and had great influence (Payne).  The McGuffey Readers have sold over 100 million copies since 1836 (Church, 1976).

I like to see a lit-tle dog, 
And pat him on the head; 
So pret-ti-ly he wags his tail

=='''CONCLUSION'''==

The 19th century was a turning point in American education.  The beginning of public schools, school reform and state funding were just a few of these changes.  Innovators and reformers sought to make education available to the masses and not just to the wealthy and privileged.  Innovators and reformers like Horace Mann and William Holmes McGuffey made it possible for common schools to establish themselves as the first public schools in the nation.  This era and its innovators paved the way for our public school system as we know it today.

=='''Education in the 19th Century'''==

by Keenan Buchanan

Learning Target:
'''The reader will learn about major changes in thought during the 19th century.'''


== Introduction ==

The 19th century was a time of dramatic change. Beginning in the late 1700's and continuing throughout the 1800's was the Industrial Revolution, which brought about a completely new way of life. There was the invention of the steam engine, industrialization, capitalism, and many more that changed the life of the working class for the worse. There was even the advent of the middle class throughout Europe. With this stronger sense of a division of labor came Karl Marx and his socialist ideals.


== Women ==

The 19th century was a period of some advancement for minorities, namely Women and African Americans. In 1848 a Woman's Rights Convention was held in Seneca Falls, NY. There were a string of revolutions across Europe at this time. These revolutions could have inspired women to fight harder for their own rights. It was at this convention that women pushed the Declaration of Sentiments and fought for a right to higher education. At this time it was still believed that women were inferior to men and were not capable of being intellectual creatures or that higher education would ruin them and make them unsuitable mothers or wives. In fact, most men were strongly opposed to the idea of women in college. But, by the end of the Civil War (1861-1865) women were beginning to attend college. This does not mean that a large population of women attended college, in 1870 approximately .7% of the female population went to college. That number increased to 2.8% in 1900 and 7.6% in 1920. Nevertheless, these were still strides towards eventual equality.

== 13th Amendment ==

Passed on January 31, 1865 the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in the United States. Although it took another one hundred years to gain full rights as citizens, in practice as well as laws. It was still the first step in the direction of toleration and unity. Women were beginning to get educated and join the work force, and blacks were technically free. Most of the education blacks received came from themselves and the efforts of other blacks. After the Civil War there were Jim Crow laws. Which are essentially a series of laws, in the South, used to keep blacks oppressed. Jim Crow laws made Southern schools segregated and stuck around until the 1960's. In 1896 the case of Plessy v. Ferguson went to the Supreme Court and reinforced the Jim Crow laws with the ruling of separate but equal accommodations for blacks. These separate services for blacks were always separate but very rarely were they equal.

== General Education ==

In the United States, the 19th century marks the beginning of the &quot;Common School Period&quot;, due to the shift of education from private to public. It took until the 1840's for an organized education system to take hold. In Massachusetts and Connecticut Horace Mann and Henry Barnard helped to create school systems for their respective states. They worked to get a free public school education paid for by the public, which we currently use today. They established compulsory school attendance laws and made public schools accountable to local school boards and the state government.From 1785-1787 the Northwest Ordinance was passed, which sold land in Michigan for $1 an acre to raise money for schools. One of the first laws passed towards public education.


== Marxism ==
The 19th century also brought about a change in the outlook on life and a contributions to sociology. With the industrialization of the modern world, the introduction of capitalism, and an increasing division of labor, Karl Marx based his class theory. Marx claimed that the history of the world was the history of class struggle. And that there would be a revolution of the working class where they rise up and basically bring the world to socialism, distributing the wealth equally. Most modern sociologists do not agree with Karl Marx's theories, but he contributed nonetheless. His theory was disproved during World War 1 where he anticipated the working class would band together. But Europe was in the grip of extreme nationalism, and everybody strongly supported their nation. Communism has its roots in Karl Marx's theories in his book, &quot;The Communist Manifesto.&quot;


== Darwinism ==

In 1859 the most revolutionary idea of the time was published by Charles Darwin in his book &quot;On The Origin of Species.&quot; Through his travels, most notably to the Galapagos Islands, he put together evidence to support the theory of evolution. Today evolution is agreed to be true by most people, even the Pope acknowledges evolution and the age of the earth. In Darwin's travels he noticed that animals of the same species would have different qualities, enabling them to survive in their particular environment. For example the finches on the Galapagos Islands varied in size, beak size or shape, or any other characteristics that helped them survive. And he correctly assumed that the variations already existed, nature just enabled the ones with the best variations to survive. This was a very big deal, and Darwin's evidence in support of evolution really shook the world.

Later his theory of survival of the fittest took a horrible turn for the worst. A British philosopher by the name of Herbert Spencer turned the survival of the fittest towards society and developed Social Darwinism. Which claimed that survival of the fittest applied the human society and those that were poor and suffering simply were not meant to survive. Used to defend unequal distribution of wealth and power in Europe. It was also used to support European imperialism, which was very aggressive around this point in history.. Europe had colonies all over the world including North America, India, China, and numerous African nations( subsequently throwing the whole continent out of whack.


== Conclusion ==
The 19th century was time of dramatic change. The Industrial Revolution completely changing the face of society. The development of the middle class and overpopulated dirty cities. The decreased standard of living for factory workers led to Karl Marx and his &quot;Communist Manifesto.&quot; Over in America school was beginning to become public instead of private, even for women who were beginning to attend college. The civil war, which brought advancements of its own, and America joining their European counterparts and abolishing slavery. Close to the same time Charles Darwin completely changed the way the world thought by proving evolution and outraging whites who now had a connection to the blacks of Africa. And the development of Social Darwinism to continue the rule of the rich, white populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; Twentieth Century Milestones in Education:  Towards a More Inclusive Education for All &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''


Veronica Montalvo

=='''INTRODUCTION AND THE GROWTH OF EDUCATION'''==

In the United States, the start of the twentieth century marked a movement towards the inclusion of more people than ever into the educational system.  In 1900, close to six percent of teenagers graduated from high school (Thattai, 2001).  States attempted to increase that number by making that goal more accessible through the construction of more high schools in both urban and rural localities (Wolfe, 2001).  Laws were passed that made school mandatory for children until elementary school; later it became obligatory until the child became sixteen years old (Thattai, 2001).  However, a good and equal education was not yet widely available to all Americans.  Marginalized groups hovered at the fringes of the educational system.  African-Americans received unequal and inferior educations as compared to that of whites, as did other minorities and students with limited-English-proficiency (LEP).  Women were discriminated against, as well as the handicapped, in being fully included in the educational system.  Major developments in the twentieth-century education system include various rulings and acts that promoted a fair and equal education for Americans that had been neglected and marginalized.

=='''G.I. BILL of 1944'''==

Established in 1944, the G.I. Bill was designed to provide assistance to veterans returning from World War II.  Although the educational provisions within the Bill were originally intended as âanother form of unemployment relief,â the educational system experienced a drastic change in its perception by Americans (Clark, 1998, p. 173).  Prior to the influx of veterans in colleges and universities, a college education was perceived as being a privilege of the wealthy and a mark of high status.  The veterans returning from WWII were viewed as everyday men, and to see and hear about them going to college broke down that perception and made the dream of a college education more of a reality for all Americans (Clark, 1998).  According to Hess and McGuinn (2002), âEducation gained a new prominence after World War IIâ (p. 76).  More students were graduating from high school and going to college after the G.I. Bill passed (Hess and McGuinn, 2002).

Aside from changing the perception of college education and increasing enrollments, the G.I. Bill led to the growth of community colleges and vocational schools (Wolfe, 2001).  The 2.2 million veterans utilizing the educational benefits of the G.I. Bill (Bound and Turner, 2002) demanded a curriculum with classes more similar to what they had been exposed to in the military.  Practicality was a vital aspect in their desired education, and schools responded by creating vocational programs to suit their needs (Clark, 1998).  The G.I. Bill impacted future generations by making college more accessible to the average citizen and by causing the expansion of the college curriculum.   

=='''BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, 1954'''==

In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional in ''Brown v. Board of Education''.  The decision marked the beginning of more educational opportunities for African-Americans, but these opportunities were still severely limited.  The Supreme Court declared that schools must desegregate, but did not make a deadline or any guidelines as to when it must be complete (Carson, 2004).  A decade after the decision, less than 10% of black students were attending an integrated school (Ravitch, 2000).  Throughout the â60s and â70s, the government used funds to force schools to desegregate or risk losing their funding (Carper, 2001), and by 1980, the practice of legal segregation for the most part had ended (Thattai, 2001).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Despite the long delay in achieving the goal of desegregation, the message that ''Brown'' delivered impacted the educational system and future policy in civil rights (Carson, 2004).  ''Brown'' revealed the potential for other minority groups to begin the struggle for equal educational access (GÃ¡ndara, Moran, and GarcÃ­a, 2004).  Equal and fair education began to be viewed as âthe birthright of a free citizenryâ (Hess and McGuinn, 2002, pp. 76-77), and more groups began demanding that right. 

=='''ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OF 1965'''==

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 sought to equalize the education opportunities for all children.  As the start of federal government grants to states for education (Hess and McGuinn, 2000), the law attempted âto compensate in some sense for disadvantages due to inequities in the social systemâ (Wolfe, 2001).  President Johnson hoped that increasing and equalizing education for all children would one day rid the country of poverty (Easley, 2005).  Funds were provided to the states for services for poor and minority students (Baker, 2001) as well as for âschool library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials for school childrenâ (''Digest of Education Statistics'', 2006).  In 1967, Title VII authorized grants to be given for programs for LEP students (Baker, 2001).  More than giving funds for different programs for the poor and minorities, ESEA along with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 aided in providing funds for the desegregation of southern schools who had refused to do so (Ravitch, 2000), more than a decade after the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruling.  ESEA served to make an equal education more obtainable for all classes and races.

=='''TITLE IX OF 1972'''==

The place of women within the educational system was limited in terms of opportunities and the material being taught.  The Civil Rights Movement during the â60s and â70s led women to protest more and demand equality in education.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 included the requirement that grants be given to the states in order for them to work towards that gender equality in education, and in 1972, Title IX of the Education Amendments was passed (Marshall, 2002).  Title IX required that there be gender equality in schools that received money from the government and that âcurricula should not stereotype girlsâ and boysâ interests and careersâ (Marshall, 2002, p. 712).  In spite of the worthwhile objectives of Title IX, it was a feeble mandate.  No penalties existed for schools that refused to comply, and a way to even supervise them was not set up until a quarter of the century after the passage of Title IX (Marshall, 2002).

In 1974, the Womenâs Educational Equity Act (WEEA) was passed.  This act provided a financial backbone to Title IX with funds granted to the schools and agencies in order to fulfill the goals of Title IX (''Womenâs Educational Equity'').  Title IX and WEEA made great strides in opening up more doors to education for women in the twentieth century.

=='''INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1975'''==

The place of handicapped children in schools improved in the twentieth century.  Almost five percent of students have a mental disability (Gunning, 2008), and with the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Childrenâs Act, they are able to receive a better education (Keyes, Hanley-Maxwell, and Capper, 1999).  The name later changed to the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), but the goal of guaranteeing an education to disabled students remained the same (Keyes, Hanley-Maxwell, and Capper, 1999).  A âfree appropriate public educationâ or FAPE requires that âspecial education and related services are provided at public expenseâ (McLaughlin and Thurlow, 2003, p. 436).  Disabled children must be placed in the least restrictive environment possible, meaning that their educational environment is as close to that of their nondisabled classmates as possible (Keyes, Hanley-Maxwell, and Capper, 1999).  Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) are used to monitor the learning disabled studentâs progress, and in 1997, assessments became mandatory for disabled students in order to make the schools more accountable for the studentsâ progress (McLaughlin and Thurlow, 2003).  If necessary, accommodations in the assessments may be used (Gunning, 2008).  Thanks to IDEA, more disabled students are graduating than if IDEA had not been passed (''Special Education and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act''). 


=='''CONCLUSION'''==

The twentieth century achieved a great deal in terms of including more groups that had been previously excluded or marginalized.  A great deal still remains to be done in making education truly equal and accessible to every American, but the foundation has been laid for more work in the twenty-first century.  Each American deserves to have equal educational opportunities, and as society progresses and more policies are created, that goal may be achievable.

When sitting in class one day, look to the person on your left, then look to the person on your right. Chances are at least one of those two students will be a student of color, and also, a female. A series of laws has changed the face of education to include minorities and women. By understanding where we have come from, education can move forward and develop new ways for learning.

== Brown VS The Board Of Education ==



Schools in the state of Kansas had been segregated since the late 1870's because of a state law that allowed cities of 15,000 people to build schools for 
children African American children and White Children. In many of the black schools across the country, most of the buildings were made of wood with no indoor plumbing, and kept the rooms heated with wood, coal, or kerosene stoves. By contrast, white schools had many more schools made of brick, 
had indoor plumbing facilities, and had hot water heat. Across the country, $195 was spent for every one African American child, compared to $317
spent of white children. (One with school pics.) By 1950, eleven court challenges about the desegregation of schools in Kansas made it to the Kansas 
State Supreme Court. While none of these cases overturned the law, at least the ball got rolling. In 1950 Topeaka NAACP organized another case with the 
main complaint that the children of the thirteen families involved in this case, had to ride school buses in order to reach segregated schools that was far 
from their homes. Even though there would be a white school just a few blocks away, the black children were not allowed to attend. When this case reached the 
federal court in Kansas, it was ruled that segregation was not illegal because the state provided the same facilities to each school. The NAACP then appealed 
to the Unted States Supreme court and their case was joined by similar cases from South Carolina, Delaware, Virginia, and Washington D.C. Combining these
five cases under the name (underlined) Oliver L. Brown ''et al.'' vs. the Board of Education of Topeka, KS et al. It was special counsel Thurgood Marshall
who argued that segregation was unconstitutional because it denied African Americans equal protection guaranteed by the 14th amendment.

== Virginia Local News ==


After the historic case of (italics) Brown vs the Board of Education, young African American school children were encouraged by their parents and family 
members to join the NAACP and attempt to integrate into the white school system. At the time, and this was after the ruling of the court case is Kansas, 
not one public school in the state of Virginia had been integrated yet. When all was said and done, 151 students attempted to transfer from their black
schools and attend white schools. Before this could happen, members of the school board in Norfolk made the children jump through hoops by making them take
academic and psychological tests. After reviewing all the test scores, the board denied all 151 students at first. However, after meeting with the 
District Court they allowed 17 of the 151 students to attend the white high schools (The Brown Decision).

== Women in Education ==
&lt;br&gt;

A new tide was turning after the 19th Amendment was signed giving women the right to vote in America. Thanks to the unending dedication of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, who picketed the White House every day, suffered 
the batons of policemen, were then imprisoned and forced to eat food while on a hunger strike, women no longer belonged to their husbands and could start seeking an education for themselves outside the home.
Suddenly, women were able to have their voices heard and count among their male counterparts. However,when it came to women in the education system, the inequalities were still clear. Men were still the predominant
sex at universities, and generally, men also received most of the diplomas handed out by universities. It wasn't until after the end of World War II that change starts to come. In 1945, the first woman was accepted to 
Harvard Medical School(Eisenmann appendix). Harvard didn't start accepting 
women into their undergraduate programs until 1973. In 1972, Title IX in the Educational Amendments of 1972 was created to so that, &quot;No person in the U.S. shall, on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in or 
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal aid.&quot; 
In 1994, women received 38% of medical degrees, compared with 9% in 1972. 
In 1994, women earned 43% of law degrees, compared with 7% in 1972. 
In 1994, 44% of all doctoral degrees to U.S. citizens went to women, up from 25% in 1977

 == Bilingual Education Act of 1968 == 


The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 was established to provide students who couldn't speak English well, attending public schools, the opportunity to be taught
in their native tongue. What good is providing a student with facilites, textbooks, and teachers if they do not understand the language in which they are
taught in? Interestingly enough, the practice of teaching a student in a different language started before 1968. Before World War II, if a student did not speak
English they were taught in their native language. However, as the Cold War started and fear of communism spread, this method of teaching was no longer practiced.
Everything in that era had to be &quot;American.&quot; How was speaking another language patriotic? Thankfully, after the Cold War, the nation started questioning the
behavior of the federal government toward &quot;non-American behavior,&quot; and they didn't like what they saw. Thus, in 1968 the act was born.

'''Using a greyscale texture - white for opaque'''

: No RGB is not necessary (though it doesn't hurt). You have probably activated &quot;use alpha&quot; for the texture. Since it has no alpha values, this leads to a different input value. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 19:14, 11 May 2009 (UTC)

Indeed, had the &quot;use Alpha&quot; on! Thanks!

I had concluded that I just had to use a picture that already had a transparent background.  Turns out, I had &quot;use Alpha&quot; on as well.  I was using 2.54 beta, but I had tried it with 2.49 before that with no success, so I imagine the &quot;use Alpha&quot; checkbox was my issue in that version too.''</text>

by: Jim Eason


== &lt;big&gt;Teaching Technology: An Introduction&lt;/big&gt; ==


Modern technology is advancing at a blistering pace.  New innovations are available to the public so quickly that tech gadgets are obsolete within a year.  Todayâs society is practically run by computers and other technologies.  It is very important that we, as educators, prepare students for the real life challenges that lie ahead for them upon graduating high school and even university.  New collaborative learning environments must also be incorporated to help them achieve success.  Nearly every job on the planet requires technological knowledge. âTo be able to compete for these positions, workers must have viable technology skills, and the educational system must prepare students for this workâ (Thomas, 2007, p.4).  We can't expect students to learn these skills on their own. Educators must instill proper techniques at early ages to make sure they are ready for the workforce.

== The Educatorâs Role ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9900;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Teacher education programs in the United States are trying to equip tomorrow's teachers with the technology skills needed to impact learning in the classroom.  Learning the skills is not enough - teachers must learn how to integrate these skills in the classroom (Graham, Culatta, &amp; Pratt, 2004, p.127).&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Modern teaching is much different from the methods used in years past. We must adapt our teaching to the way students learn.  As students learn about computers at younger and younger ages, it is important that the educator is competent enough to teach to their level of learning.  âTeacher education programs in the United States are trying to equip tomorrowâs teachers with the technology skills needed to impact learning in the classroomâ (Graham, Culatta, &amp; Pratt, 2004, p.127). This article contends further that learning the skills is not enough- teachers must learn how to integrate these skills in the classroom (Graham ''et al.'', p.127).  This article is emphasizing that it is our job to learn this technology, and in turn, relay this knowledge to the student. 

Every school has some form of technology available for teacher use.  These range anywhere from an overhead and a VCR to network connected classrooms with Smart Board technology.  There are many strategies to implement technology.  Students use the Internet to do research or to expand learning of certain topics.  This technology âallows students to have more control over their own learning, to think analytically and critically and to work collaborativelyâ (Kosakowski, 1998).  

Repetition is also an imperative use of this technology.  Lessons can be delivered using a variety of sources.  Teachers can present material, and then follow up with online games and quizzes.  Regular and special education classes benefit from this type of learning.  Students usually learn more, and more rapidly (Kosakowski, 1998).

== Cooperative Learning ==




Cooperative learning is another method of teaching considered vital to todayâs educational environment.  Students can be put into small groups to complete certain tasks.  âCooperative learning is beneficial because knowledge is exchanged and converges through social interactionâ (Weinberger, Stegmann, &amp; Fischer, 2007, p.416). When the grade of an entire project depends on the group as a whole, students are encouraged to share opinions and knowledge.  This offers a less competitive learning environment.  Weaker students or those that are less apt to share ideas openly or take part in classroom discussions are encouraged to participate.  This helps build self confidence in those students.
Computers are a tool that teachers can use to create their cooperative learning classroom.  âStudents have shown overall positive effects of learning with computer based technology on student achievement, attitudes towards learning, and self concept as compared to traditional instruction (Lou, 2001, p. 452).

== Learning with Technology ==


It is important to note that there is a difference between learning from technology and learning with technology.  Learning from technology is simply looking at a machine â whether it is a computer or an overhead projector â and gaining knowledge.  Learning with technology puts the problem solving skills in the studentsâ hands.  The technology gives them the resources they need to analyze material and draw their own conclusions.  This gives them the opportunity to expand on the given lesson.  This is vital to life after school.  It gives them the chance to solve real world problems by âexploring, analyzing, and interpreting informationâ (Lou, p.453).
This doesnât suggest that learning from technology should be avoided.  Using computers for information is akin to having an expert in the classroom other than the teacher.  Other benefits are âdecreased instruction time, and an increase in the equity of access to quality instructionâ (Lou, p.453).  This type of environment will give the teacher one on one time with the weaker students, which will keep them from falling behind in the curriculum.  

==Teacher Perspecitves on Technology==
Teachers generally view technology as advantage, but there are problems associated with the desire to use technology.  One such problem is availability.  Many school systems have limited resources and only purchase a limited supply of technological tools.  Often there are several teachers wanting to use the same tools at the same time. Another thought teachers state is that it affects their planning time.  Teachers with more experience with technology themselves believe that the lesson planning time is shorter, while those with less experience with the use of technology believe it takes longer to prepare a lesson when incorporating technology.  Teachers also express that students are more engaged when forms of technology is used and they gain a greater understanding of the material.  The students learn the given material faster.   When students have the opportunity to learn from technology, they tend to grasp the content quicker and the teacher is able to cover more material in a shorter amount of time.  Technology aids in the reinforcement of content with extra practice with more &quot;drill, practice and hands-on learning (Oncu, Delialioglu, Brown, 2008).

 == The Governmentâs Role ==


The government, in January of 2002, enacted the No Child Left Behind Act.  âA major objective of this act is to ensure high quality teachers for all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, or income, because a well prepared teacher is vitally important to a childâs educationâ (No Child Left Behind Act [NCLB]).

Schools are now held accountable for their studentsâ progress. Public schools receiving federal funds are now required to ensure all teachers hired after January 2002 are highly qualified.  Each state is mandated to ensure all teachers are highly qualified no later than the end of the 2005-2006 school year.  This information is available on the NCLB website section 1111.  A âhighly qualifiedâ teacher, according to the Department of Education website is   one with full certification, a bachelorâs degree, and demonstrated competence in subject knowledge and teaching (NCLB).

The benefits of this are profound, especially among minorities.  Annual assessments of nine and thirteen year old African American students are at all time highs (NCLB).  The No Child Left Behind Act also encourages parental involvement.  Parents have more options and resources than ever at their disposal to ensure that their children are getting a quality education.  Parents now have a choice to send their children to accredited schools if their own school is not meeting national standards.  Students who are performing below standards have access to free tutoring and other academic support services.



== A (maybe not so) Fictional Look into the Future ==

In this section let's throw the research aside and see where all this technology can take us.  We already have podcasts of class lectures.  How far off will it be before this technology goes into secondary and even middle schools.  I'll explain: Some university students can get a degree online - never stepping into a classroom.  What about homeschool students?  More and more parents are taking their children out of public and private schools and opting to teach their children themselves.  What about the mothers that would like the opportunity to homeschool, but lack the knowledge or education to do it themselves?  This is where podcasts come in!  Parents can download lessons that their child would normally be getting at school.  They can follow along with the teacher and make sure their child keeps up with the workload.  He or she can take the tests at home and then the parent can submit his or her work for grading. Video conferencing is prevalent in business.  It would be a great start if a student can experience this first hand in middle school.  He can because, a new program could be implemented so that children from foreign countries can now learn from American schools via a video conference inside a middle school classroom.  Students can be put into cooperative learning groups with a student from Russia, one from Kenya, and one in Brazil.  They can break down language barriers and even learn multiple languages from communicating across the globe.
Simple things like getting homework assignments from your teacher from a text message are not far off in the future if it's not here already.  We already live in a global work environment.  Is global education far behind?  This last question will leave people debating for years to come.

== Conclusion ==


It is imperative, as modern day educators, to adapt teaching styles to the many ways students learn.  The days of just standing in front of the class to deliver material are now gone.  This practice is no longer adequate.  Ever changing technology has given students renewed motivation in the classroom to fill their minds with information.  Teachers must also be open to learning.  Most students learn early on how to use technology devices.  They have access to an unlimited amount of information on the Internet.  It is the responsibility of adults, especially teachers, to guide them and help them decipher what information is accurate and pertinent to their studies.  Teachers must have the knowledge to be their guide in these endeavors.  Students, teachers, parents, administrators, and even state and local governments must work collaboratively to ensure students are getting the quality education they deserve; an education that will prepare them for the world outside of school grounds.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Educational Milestones of the 21st Century'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Introduction==

Todayâs classrooms are not like they were when students were in elementary and middle school in the 80âs and 90âs. The way todayâs teachers teach and the tools they use have come a long way from pencil, paper and once a week spelling test. Teachers have been handed a whole new set of guide lines in the past few years, some to keep up with new laws and others to keep up with new technologies, all and all itâs a new world out there for both new teachers and teachers that have been in the system for 15 to 20 years.

==Technology in the class room==

Class rooms today have seen many changes since they first started out in the 1600âs. Students have come from working with chalk and chalk boards to pencil and paper to now computers and smart boards. Now that we have entered the 21st century, school systems all across the nation are moving into the age of teaching with technology. While most people are for it, there are some that fear that students will not benefit and also fall behind in their studies.  If teachers use the right tools and teach to the liking of the students then there should be little to no problems.

When it comes to learning a new subject it can be scary for any student, but using technology that some students have never used or seen before can be very over whelming. When it comes to intergrading technology into todayâs class roomâs teachers need to do it slowly. They can start with walking the students through a power point of what they will be working on throughout the school year and then move on to a video from online. This way the students can get a feel for what is to come and also to look forward to.

âAnd that is because schools are using technology not to only teach technology, but to teach the other subjects as well. Power Point Projectors have replaced slide projectors and the DVD's are played on the computer, then on to HDTV for teaching about rain forests, the sounds and creatures almost come to life for the students.â (Johnson, J) Using technology does not have to be a boring subject or something that is hard to follow. When the student uses technology it should be fun and exciting. Technology can be a great learning tool that can draw students in and make them want to learn more. After a class is done studying the civil war, the teacher can show the students a battle reenactment at bull run or have the students team up and look up the different kinds of wild life that live in the rain forest after studying about wild life in science class.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;###408080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
''Technology continues to advance and, for young people to get ahead they must understand it and be able to use it. Where better to learn technology than at school?'' (Johnson)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Technology doesnât just have to be about learning new and cool things it can also help students improve their skills in math and grammar. There are programs out now where students can type their papers on the computer and the computer will talk back to the students and tell them what is wrong and what areas need to be fixed. This can be great for shy students who do not feel comfortable with others reading and grading their paper.  

==Video games in the class room?==
There are many forms of technology that can make a student lose focus and not want to pay attention to their homework and studies. What if there was a technology that engaged the student to study while having fun at the same time. Would a teacher use it? Should a teacher use it? Program writers are trying a new way to reach students and to get them to learn, all though video games. The makers of these programs are not saying that this is the only way for students to learn and understand materials; they are just saying that it could be one of the best ways. âRecently, the game was used in a science curriculum at a Waltham, Mass. middle school and students who played the game outperformed those who used a traditional curriculum by 20 percent in a final test of main concepts, Squire says.â (Chaptman, D) These types of video games focus on a chapterâs information and the player moves level to level learning more and more information as they go. At the end of the game students hadnât even realized that they were taught a lesson because they were having too much fun. 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #;
border: solid 10px #800080; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;###408080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt; ''The goal is to hook you,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;You can reach people who think they hate the subject. The minute you get swept up in the thing, you sort of forget that you hate science.''(Hoppock)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Some teachers on the other hand feel that these new programs are unnecessary. âSome critics worry that relying too much on video games and other interactive simulations to teach will only hurt students in the long run. They argue that it will leave students ill-prepared for higher education where reading textbooks still make up the bulk of the work.â(Hoppock, J) Teachers cannot rely just on video games to teach students the subjects they need to know.  There would be no point and video games cannot teach students everything they need to know, they should only bring to light the information the student has already learned in class  and applying it when playing a video game. Video games cannot teach a student about long division, or how to read this is where the teacher comes in and in no way should students rely on just games to learn new information. If teachers do decide to use this technology it should be a combination of both book studying and a video game follow up. 

==Conclusion== 

Teaching students about technology and how to use it can only improve the studentâs skills that will be needed and used in the future. It is a great way to draw students in and make them want to learn more about the subjects that they will be studying; technology can be used in many forms to educate students such as power points, history videos, and video games. If these programs make it easier for students to learn and helps improve their test scores then teachers should use this to their advantage.

&lt;big&gt;'''History of Teacher Education'''&lt;/big&gt;

by Rebeca Coleman

----


== Learning Targets ==

Students should be able to understand the beginnings of teacher education, starting in the ancient times.

Students should understand the progression from few requirements to many requirements to teach.


== Introduction ==

Teacher education has changed quite a bit over the last few hundred years.  Teachers have gone from scholars to men and women in a schoolroom to trained educators from specific schools.  Over time though, the gift of being able to teach stayed true in those teachers.

== Before the Seventeenth Century ==

In earlier times, priests and prophets taught noble and wealthy children skills that were needed to excel in business and politics.  Priests were treated well because of their great knowledge.  The first private teacher was Confucius in the fifth century BCE.  In Ancient Greece, knowledge was considered very sacred and the same ideology passed through the time of Christianity.  Education was not very popular among lower classes of people until after the Middle Ages.  The Roman Catholic Church took responsibility and created centers of learning, which eventually became the great universities of Europe, including Cambridge (Johnâs 2003).  


== The Beginnings of Specific Training ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Children are guilty of unpardonable rudeness when they spit in the face of a companion; neither are they excusable who spit from windows or on walls or furniture.&quot; St. John Baptist de la Salle (de la Salle, 1695) &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Specific teacher training originated in France in 1685 by St. John Baptist de la Salle (Teacher 2007).  The training spread through Europe through the monitorial system, which is the method of education where there are number of students at a bench, a monitor (older student) who is instructed by the teacher and then instructs the younger students, and then the teacher (Teacher 2007).  It spread through Europe thanks to August Hermann Francke and Johann Pestalozzi.  It came to the United States in the early 1800s through this system (Teacher 2007).  Schools could be a studentâs room in a wealthy household or a one-room schoolhouse for poorer groups of children.  


== Teacher Education Moves to the United States ==

Teachers were predominantly male before the early 1800s.  Men were taught to read and write from the early days of language, and women were not taught very widely until the nineteenth century.  This made it very difficult for them to teach.  If a person could read and write, that person was basically qualified to teach.  Teachers were chosen based on their moral quality by the local government (Johnâs 2003).


In the 1820s, teacher training became important in the universities and academies in the United States.  Women could only be taught in teacher training academies, while men could be taught in universities (History 2007).  Samuel Hall created the first private normal after-high school teaching school which taught teachers in 1823.  The first government funded normal school was created in Massachusetts in 1837 (Johnâs 2003).  Henry Barnard and Horace Mann helped the spread of more normal teacher-education schools (Teacher 2007).  More and more universities then began to take note and included teaching schools within them.  By the end of the eighteenth century, there were 127 state-supported normal schools and a larger number of private normal schools (Angus 2001 p. 6).  


Teachers were starting to be required to be certified in the late nineteenth century (Angus 2001 p. 4).  Pennsylvania was the first state in 1834 to require tests to show general knowledge of arithmetic, writing, and reading (Ravitch 2003).  And by the middle of the nineteenth century, most other states required this sort of testing.  This was a huge development because before this testing came about on the state level, teachers only had to prove themselves to the cities and counties and that usually rested upon a teacherâs morality.  By mid-century, the test also started to require history, spelling, grammar, and geography (Ravitch 2003).  


== Teaching Styles and Schools ==

There were two different types of teaching styles-eastern and western.  Eastern normal schools mainly taught to young women with no prior teaching experience, and aimed at teaching them for elementary education.  The western normal schools taught mainly older students, especially more men, and the teaching was aimed at getting young women better jobs and then young men better administrative jobs (Angus 2001).  This difference in teaching led to a change from normal schools to teaching schools in the late 1800s.  There also became more requirements to attend teaching schools. 


The first two graduate schools in education were established at New York University (1887) and then Teachers College, Columbia University (1888), and since then graduate programs have increased exponentially (Teacher 2007).  Graduate schools gave the idea to teachers to consider themselves as a profession, which became a very controversial idea in the twentieth century, and continues to remain one today.


== The Twentieth Century ==

By the beginning of the twentieth century, there came about the idea to make teaching more of a profession, with specific standards for certification.  At this point, every state had different standards.  There also was dispute because, since the creation of graduate programs, teachers wanted to be considered a profession, just like law and medicine, but they were not considered such to the professional world.  This was mostly because it was such a new idea for it to be a profession, and also there were no specific standards yet.  So the American Council on Education established a National Teacherâs Examination in the 1930s (Ravitch 2007).  This was very controversial.  There was a large setback with this test because of World War II.  There was a teacher shortage, and school systems did not have the luxury of caring if a teacher was properly certified or not.  After World War II, though, it became more received.  The requirements for having the testing became more rigorous (Angus 2001 p. 21).  


== Arguments ==

Some people argue that teachers should better themselves and should learn the latest teaching research to stay on top of everything, much like in the medical field with new medical advancements (Ravitch 2007).  People like this argue that teaching cannot become a viable profession until such measures are taken to learn from history and continue to learn from research.  Some people question the competency of teacherâs policy analysis (Martinez 2008).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

I believe that teaching is a profession in itself.  I think it is important along with law and medicine in the professional field.  Where would doctors and lawyers be without the teachers who taught them?  I believe that teachers should educate themselves and keep up-to-date on current research and ideas.  Technology is wonderful and should be integrated into classrooms, especially with younger generations now growing up entirely in a technologically advanced world.

&lt;big&gt;'''History of Teacher Education'''&lt;/big&gt;

by Rebeca Coleman

----


== Learning Targets ==

Students should be able to understand the beginnings of teacher education, starting in the ancient times.

Students should understand the progression from few requirements to many requirements to teach.


== Introduction ==

Teacher education has changed quite a bit over the last few hundred years.  Teachers have gone from scholars to men and women in a schoolroom to trained educators from specific schools.  Over time though, the gift of being able to teach stayed true in those teachers.

== Before the Seventeenth Century ==

In earlier times, priests and prophets taught noble and wealthy children skills that were needed to excel in business and politics.  Priests were treated well because of their great knowledge.  The first private teacher was Confucius in the fifth century BCE.  In Ancient Greece, knowledge was considered very sacred and the same ideology passed through the time of Christianity.  Education was not very popular among lower classes of people until after the Middle Ages.  The Roman Catholic Church took responsibility and created centers of learning, which eventually became the great universities of Europe, including Cambridge (Johnâs 2003).  


== The Beginnings of Specific Training ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Children are guilty of unpardonable rudeness when they spit in the face of a companion; neither are they excusable who spit from windows or on walls or furniture.&quot; St. John Baptist de la Salle (de la Salle, 1695) &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

*Readers should be able to identify 3 benefits resulting from inclusion in the classroom.
*Readers should be able to identify 3 problems resulting from inclusion in the classroom.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/font&gt;===
In 1975 Congress passed an act called the Education for All Handicapped Children. This was commonly referred to as Public Law 94-142. This law established that all children are entitled to a &quot;free appropriate public education&quot; in the &quot;least restrictive environment possible&quot; (Pardini 2002). This law includes, but is not limited to, students with disabilities such as mental retardation, physical handicaps, speech, vision and language problems, emotional and behavioral problems and other learning disorders. This law has since been renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, also known as IDEA. The Department of Education stated that 6 million children obtain special education services from our nation's public schools (Pardini 2002). However, receiving special education was just the beginning to educating children with disabilities.







===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;What is Inclusion?:&lt;/font&gt;===
Inclusion was the next big movement and is still a controversial topic among parents, teachers, students, school boards, politicians and governments today. The current policy on inclusion with special education in the regular classroom states that all children should be enrolled and in attendance to regular schools unless there is otherwise overwhelming evidence that they should be enrolled elsewhere (Hornby 1999). In the regulations governing special education programs for children with disabilities in Virginia, section 8 VAC 20-80-64, general least environment requirements, also known as inclusion, include that each local educational agency shall ensure &quot;to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities including those in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children without disabilities&quot; (Education for...2002).



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;65%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF3366;border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; font color=&quot;black&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
'''&lt;center&gt;&quot;We are difference: For respecting difference, for allowing difference, for encouraging difference, until difference no longer makes a difference&quot; (Inclusion Benefits 2008).   &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;Benefits Resulting from Inclusion in the Regular Classroom:&lt;/font&gt;===
Many benefits come from inclusion of special education students into regular education classrooms. Teachers, regular students and students with disabilities all benefit in ways. The classroom is not only a place for learning academics, but a place where social skills are obtained. Children with disabilities are given the chance to experience normal school experiences when given the chance to be in a regular classroom. In 1963 about sixty-three percent of special education students divided their school day between the special education classroom and the regular education classroom (Osgood 2008). In doing this, special needs children began to experience, as much as possible, the learning and social experiences that other children were able to experience their whole lives. Including special needs children in regular classrooms ensures they receive the core curriculum, the stigmatism and labeling of them among other students is minimized and the increase of relationships and friendships develop between special needs and regular education children. By including these students in regular classrooms, teachers, teacher's aids and even students without disabilities become available to introduce different learning skills. No one child learns the exact same way and educators must realize this. Inclusion helps promote different teaching techniques and strategies to benefit students (&quot;Inclusion Benefits&quot; 2008). According to a study found in a scholarly peer reviewed journal article by Garry Hornby, sixty-five percent of teachers supported the idea of inclusion. Along with this percentage, fifty-four percent believed that these students could benefit from inclusion (Hornby 1999).


===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;Problems Resulting from Inclusion in the Regular Classroom:&lt;/font&gt;===
According to Claes Nilholm, a professor at the Orebro University and Jonkoping University in Sweden, &quot;if one identifies groups of Children, one risks stigmatizing them. However, if one does not identify groups of children, one risks neglecting children who need more support&quot; (Nilholm 2006). Once a child is placed with the special education program and label, it follows them throughout their K-12 educational years. This is sometimes frowned upon by students and their parents because they do not want their child or themselves to be considered &quot;different&quot;. On the other hand, some believe that inclusion takes away from their children's learning; both regular students and students with disabilities. Many parents of regular education students are afraid that if their child with disabilities is placed in a regular classroom special assistance from teachers will be limited. These parents worry about the amount of quality time a regular education teacher can provide when he or she has twenty some other students to tend to. On the other side of things, parents of regular education children are worried that inclusion will take away from their child's learning experience. They fear that the teacher will have to slow the learning process in order for the child with disabilities to keep up.


===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/font&gt;===
Although overall the policy of inclusion is accepted, there is not a policy of inclusion for all students with special education needs. Many groups still support the continuum for placement options among these students; such as the Council for Exceptional Children, American Foundation for the Blind, the Council for Learning Disabilities, American Society for Deaf Children and American Federation for Teachers. These groups are not in support of only offering inclusion for these students. They support inclusion when it is appropriate but also believe there is a great importance in having many placement options available (Hornby 1999). Inclusion, whether we are in favor of it or not, is an ongoing process and debate in the educational system.

:::* Be able to recognize symptoms of ADHD.
:::* Comprehend the need for behavioral modification to be used in the classroom with an ADHD student.
:::* Be able to differentiate between positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement.
:::* Understand the important role of the teacher in making a connection with the ADHD student. 



==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

It is inevitable in  a teacher's career that a student diagnosed with ADHD will be present in their classroom.  It will most likely be one of the biggest challenges a teacher can face.  They can experience frustration and exhaustion, which will then trickle down to the rest of their students in the classroom.  Turning the event of having a student with ADHD into a positive experience, incorporating behavioral modifications, and using classroom techniques will result in success.  Success for the teacher, the ADHD student and the entire classroom.  Behavior modifications and classroom modifications can be the lifeline for a teacher with an ADHD student, but more importantly, they teach the student very valuable skills to exist within the confines of their diagnosis.

'''Teaching Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder'''

'''Instructional Strategies And Practices'''

Written by the U.S Department of Education and covers everything from how to identify ADHD, great teacher strategies to classroom seating plans.  It is 32 pages full of everything a teacher needs to survive in the classroom!

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;It's Everywhere, It's Everywhere:  Statistical Data and Information&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Let's begin by briefly looking into the scientific data to allow for a better understanding of ADHD.  ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  The American Psychiatric Association defines ADHD as a &quot;persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequently displayed and more severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development&quot; (Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2000, p. 85).  ADD stands for Attention Deficit Disorder and is also a form of ADHD.  ADD is not accompanied by hyperactivity (Swanson, 2007).  Barkley discusses in his book the staggering toll that ADHD has unleashed on society. He conservatively estimates that 1-2 ADHD students will be present in every classroom in the United States.  This breaks down to 2.5 million school-age students that are diagnosed with ADHD or 5-8% of all children attending school (Barkley, 2005).  So in every classroom there will most likely be two students diagnosed with ADHD.  Teachers are going to have to be proactive by understanding the symptoms of ADHD so let's discuss some a teacher might encounter with an ADHD student.

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;You're So Smart Now Act Like It:  Characteristics of ADHD&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Not too uncommon words from a teacher who is frustrated with a student's behavior who they feel is bright and clever, but just can't get to the final stage in a project, sentence or thought.  Teachers also witness the impulsive, unorganized, and easily distracted student, along with the fidgety hands, excessive talking, forgetfulness and inability to stay in their seat (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2000).  In Charles's book, he discusses a hidden meaning behind the inappropriate behavior of a student with ADHD.  The hidden meaning is a cry for help saying &quot;reach me and their desire for a connection with their teacher and to be accepted&quot; (Charles, 2008, p. 167).  Teachers can look at the glass half-full or half-empty when dealing with a student with ADHD.  Making a connection with the student and incorporating behavior and classroom modifications will yield a higher success rate.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 





==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Dr. Pavlov, May I Use A Dog Or Two?: Behavior Modification&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Two words can sum up the teacher's approach to the ADHD student in the classroom:  behavior modification.  It will be their life preserver when dealing with the student by using both positive and negative reinforcement.  Let's look closer into just what positive and negative reinforcement consists of:

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Positive Reinforcement&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==
:::* A touch on the shoulder and a smile so the student knows what good behavior is (Barkley, 2005).
:::* Ask the ADHD student what types of rewards they enjoy within the first few days of school (Rief, 2007.)
:::* Tape a piece of paper down on the corner of a desk and as you pass by the student place a sticker on it (Barkley, 2005).
:::* Place smiley posters up randomly throughout the classroom and stand next to one when the student is making good choices (Barkley,
::::2005).
:::* Use verbal reinforcement with positive praise (Harwell, 2001).  An example might be, &quot;How wonderful you raised your hand instead of
::::just blurting out the answer Hayden.&quot; To change the reward system up a bit, allow special privileges like lunch with the teacher,
::::extra time on the computer, and extra recess (Barkley, 2005).
:::* Use a token system for immediate rewards.  In other words, a teacher might want to start with every 2-3 tokens resulting in candy,
::::stickers, special classroom duties or free play (Barkley, 2005).
:::* Give the ADHD student specific tasks (e.g., turning off/on lights, pencil and paper pusher) that will require movement in the
::::classroom.  Students can also be allowed to move around the room quietly after they complete a task (Nowacek and Mamlin, 2007.  An
::::example might be, &quot;Hayden, when you are finished with your writing I want you to quietly get up and walk around the classroom for me
::::three times while you are keeping your eyes and hands to yourself.&quot;

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Negative Reinforcement&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

:::* Ignoring mild inappropriate behavior (Nowacek and Mamlin, 2007).  An example might be, &quot;Alright, I see all but two of my students sitting in
::::their chairs and getting ready to go to lunch.&quot;  This is purposely ignoring the inappropriate behavior, while rewarding the students with
::::appropriate behavior.
:::* Putting a hand on the student's shoulder to remind him or her their behavior is escalating (&quot;Advice for schools..., 2005).
:::* If the student is destructive or disruptive, the teacher can incorporate a time out system where the student is immediately asked to put away
::::their work and place their head on their desk (Barkley, 2005). 
:::* Use a timer that is started when bad behavior is occurring, which is then taken off recess time for the ADHD student (Barkley, 2005).
:::* Start each day by giving the student 15 minutes of free time to use in the classroom.  From that time, the teacher can deduct a minute of free
::::time for every instance the student was seen not working or acting inappropriately (Barkley, 2005).

Behavior modification is a useful and positive tool that emphasizes appropriate behavior instead of inappropriate behavior.  In addition to behavior modification, there are some other techniques teachers can also incorporate inside the classroom.  Let's take a closer look at some of these techniques in the next section.


==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Tricks Of The Trade:  Classroom Modifications&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Not only is behavioral modification and reinforcement pivotal in dealing with ADHD students, but just as imperative are classroom modifications.  One simply cannot have one without the other.  This is really what it is all about:  surviving and keeping control of the classroom.  Let's take a closer look at the following techniques, which can be used as a cheat sheet for teachers in dealing with ADHD students:

:::* Provide structure at all times in the classroom and remain calm (Charles, 2008).
:::* Get eye contact before giving instructions or asking questions (Rief, 2005).
:::* Stand close to the student to allow for less distraction (Charles, 2008).
:::* State directions in a logical and ordered sequence (e.g., first, next, last).  The teacher should aim for educating the student on how to
::::follow rules as quickly as possible without repeating them (Charles, 2008).
:::* Have the student repeat verbal instructions to ensure he or she clearly understands what is being said (Rief, 2007).
:::* Provide advanced warning when a change is about to take place (e.g., in five minutes we are going to put away our math work and begin our
::::reading).  This reduces anxiety and frustration (Rief, 2007).
:::* Use webbing techniques for writing and graphic organizers, which helps with visual-spatial skills (Harwell, 2007).
:::* Take five minutes with the student each day to make sure he or she is using a planner for organization (Harwell, 2007).
:::* Charts and outlines are useful in maintaining attention and understanding concepts (Harwell, 2007).
:::* Divide tasks into chunks to help decrease frustration and make tasks obtainable (Swanson, 2007).  An example might be, &quot;Hayden, we
::::will do 15 minutes of writing and 5 minutes of computer.&quot;
:::* Consider shortening assignments if they are too long and overwhelming to the student (Nowacek and Mamlin, 2007).
:::* Utilize the computer as much as possible with an ADHD student as it will give them immediate feedback (Amen, 2001).
:::* Give the student encouraging and positive feedback to increase his or her motivation and attention (Rief, 2005).
:::* Consider how desks are arranged in the classroom and be sure ADHD students are grouped with other non-diagnosed students.  Frequently switch
::::groups of two students so the ADHD student builds relationships with other students in the classroom.  An ADHD student wants nothing more than
::::to be accepted by others (Nowacek and Mamlin, 2007).

It's a great idea to have a copy of these techniques handy, even laminated, to reference them quickly when just beginning to teach a student with ADHD.

Dawn Hogan, a 2nd grade teacher from Connecticut, has a fantastic website for teachers. Her first hand experience and knowledge are priceless.

'''This is a must see!''' 

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;





==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

As learned in this article, there is no magic pill or ointment to make the symptoms of ADHD disappear. The teacher needs to be able to face this adversity with a smile, words of support and determination. A deep connection with the ADHD student along with both behavior and classroom modifications are more likely to result in a stimulating and positive educational experience. Teamwork involving teachers, the ADHD student, parents, fellow students and administration is the only way to help combat the diagnosis of ADHD. Students who are ADHD must be taught not just from a book, but they also need to hear they are special and discover that their differences are okay. The success rate for ADHD students depends on the teacher, the teacher's attitude, classroom tips and techniques being used, and their knowledge and comfort level of behavior modification involving ''both'' positive and negative reinforcements.

===&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''Help!  I have a student with ADHD.  What can I do?'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt; ''by Carissa Eckelman''===

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt; Learning Targets &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ==

1. Be able to successfully identify the differences between the myths and truths of ADHD.

2. Be able to understand how to integrate positive and negative reinforcement in the classroom.

3. Be able to successfully manage a classroom with children who are ADHD. 

4. Be able to get parents positively involved with their childâs education. 


==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt; Introduction:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ==
Attention Deficit- Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common behavioral disorders in childhood and can last throughout adulthood. In most cases teachers will be able to identify a child with ADHD who is inattentive, excessively hyper, or both. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005) It can be very challenging for teachers who have students who are ADHD. But luckily, there are many things that teachers can do. By identifying the myths and facts of ADHD, using behaviorial modifications, effective classroom management, and getting the parents involved teachers can surely be successful in teaching children with ADHD. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005).


==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt; So What's REALLY the Truth About ADHD?!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==


There are many different myths about ADHD. Some people think that just because you are ADHD you can't be smart, or that if the parents are lazy that it causes ADHD. Below we will identify some very common myths and facts that people seem to have about ADHD.


Myth # 1: Children outgrow ADHD when they get older.

Fact # 1: Some children due outgrow the symptoms while they get older, but once they hit high school it seems to resurface. This is based on the fact that in high school you must be more organized and punctual. Also some children remain the same in their symptoms throughout their adulthood (Editors, ADDitude 2005).

Myth # 2: ADHD is caused by poor parenting. 

Fact # 2: ADHD is caused by a neurological dysfunction. There are some things like family conflicts, divorce and other problems that can make the situation worse, but they do not cause it(Editors, ADDitude 2005).

Myth # 3: People who have ADHD arenât smart and will amount to nothing. 

Fact # 3: People who have ADHD are of usually above-average or intelligence. In fact there are many famous and intellectual people who have or had ADHD. Some examples are: Mozart, Abraham Lincoln, and Benjamin Franklin(Editors, ADDitude 2005).

Myth # 4: Ritalin is unsafe and causes many things like, weight loss, mood swings, Touretteâs Syndrome, and even death.

Fact # 4: There is no research that proves this. In fact research proves that Ritalin has been effective in treating ADHD for over 50 years. Even if you take too much of Ritalin, you will feel strange, but you wonât die from it unless of overdose. While it does cause some weight loss and mood swings when the Ritalin wear off, but it is not permanent(Matlen, T 2000). 

Myth #5: Teachers can make the attention problems go away more than Ritalin.

Fact # 5: This is not true. In a perfect world that would happen. But ADHD is more than just an attention problem, it is a neurological malfunction. It does help to have teachers who work with students who have ADHD, but that alone wonât make it go away(Matlen, T 2000.)




==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt; &quot;Who Wants Some Candy?!&quot; Behavioral Modification &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

To really be successful in teaching students with ADHD it is important to use behavioral modifications. Whether a student has a problem with staying on task, listening or being disruptive these tips will surely help you succeed. 


~ Use an incentive chart. This can be done at both school and home. Once they get a certain number of stickers on the chart they get a reward. If they do something wrong, they lose their stickers(ADHD News 2008). 

~Use both positive and negative reinforcement. They go hand in hand. One cannot work without the other(ADHD News 2008.)

~ Direct Instructions (Goldstein, S &amp; Mather, N.2001). 


~Group contingency techniques such as âQuiet teacherâ or the âgood behavior gameâ (Goldstein, S &amp; Mather, N. 2001). 


~Develop a private joke between you and the child so that you can reuse it to re-involve the child(childdevelopmentinfo.com)


~Incorporate the childâs interest into the lesson plan (childdevelopmentinfo.com)


~Have the child help with âspecialâ jobs to keep their attention(childdevelopmentinfo.com)


~Keep assignments short(childdevelopmentinfo.com)


~Keep a planner to help the child with their assignments(childdevelopmentinfo.com)


~Have child repeat questions before answering (childdevelopmentinfo.com)


==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt; &quot;ATTENTION PLEASE!! ATTENTION PLEASE!!&quot; Classroom Management &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==



Classroom management is also very important in making a child with ADHD to be successful in their education. The goal is to focus the classroom environment to better fit the childâs needs. The classroom management can be grouped into three major areas. 1. Classroom environment 2. Tasks and materials 3. Curriculum and material. Some examples of good classroom management are:

~Create and maintain a stable, structured instructional regimen (Robert, R. 2001)


~The Mouth Goes Shut: this means that when you say, âWhen the hand goes up, the mouth goes shut.â (Wells, R. 2006).


~Give me Five!! âHave the student give you a high five while stating 2 ears listening, 2 eyes watching, 1 mouth shut.â (Wells, R. 2006).


~Use a pointer to direct the students attention to the work(www.ed.gov/teachers...).


~Seat the child near the teacher and away from windows(www.ed.gov/teachers...).


~Play low classical music, and donât turn it up so they have to be quiet to hear it (www.ed.gov/teachers...).


~Use a signal to help the child stay on task(Bailey, E).


~Make sure the child looks directly at your eyes when speaking to you (Bailey, E).


~Keep directions short and simple (Bailey, E).


~Find the student a âhomeworkâ buddy (Bailey, E).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


~Provide practice tests or quizzes (www.adhdinfo.com...).


~Schedule difficult subjects in the morning(www.adhdinfo.com...).


~Mix classroom lectures with brief physical activities, like going to the bathroom or a water break(www.adhdinfo.com...).


~Give the student extra time to finish a worksheet or reading assignment in class(www.adhdinfo.com...).


~Make examples of the other students. (If Jimmy is doing something disruptive say, &quot;Oh look how nice Cindy Lou is doing her worksheet.)(www.adhdinfo.com...).



==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt; PG: Parental Guidance (A How-To guide for Parents) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==


Parental help is something that is extremely important in the success of a child with ADHDâs education. Here are some tips that parents can do at home to help the child soar!

~Communicate with the teacher 

~Be available for conferences with the teacher frequently

~Make sure your child has a quiet place for homework

~Praise your child for well done work

~Have a reward system for good days or weeks at school

~Help your child develop good social skills

~Educate yourself about how ADHD effects your childâs schooling

~Check your childâs homework planner to make sure all assignments are complete

~Reinforce study skills with note-taking, highlighting, and reading out loud 

~Praise your child for behaving well in school(Gill-Jaffe, E., Dumke, L. , Segal R., Benedictis, T., Smith, M., Segal, J. Sept. 2007). 


==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt; Final Thoughts &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt; == 

So as you have learned from this article, there is no cure for ADHD. Sure, some might grow out of it, or just simply adjust to it, but more than likely not. It is important not only for teachers, but parents as well to get involved and really learn how to help your child succeed. From my experience that I've had working with children who are ADHD, they are some of the smartest kids that I know. They just need to learn to focus and really put in the effort, and their work will be amazing. For example, I had this one child I was working with in summer school named Dylan. He was labeled ADHD and when he first came to summer school his medicine wasn't the right doses. Because of this he was erratic, unable to focus, sit still or really learn. We started him an incentive chart and that combined with getting his medicine under control he was a completely different kid. He was able to focus and learn. He has made great progress in math and is continuing to make slow and steady progress in reading.  So just make sure to be patient, listen kindly and really get to know the children who you are working with and what makes them truly great!

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;center&gt;'''How should we teach English Language Learners?:&lt;br&gt;  
Birth to Age Three Instruction&lt;br&gt;By Deanna Lavery'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFB5D;
border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Learning Targets: &lt;br&gt;
â¢	Readers should be able to identify the two different types of communication.&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Readers should be able to identify two different concerns that parents have about raising a dual language learner.&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Reader should be able to identify and explain different ways a early childcare facility may foster the learning of an English Language Learner.'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;u&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Supporting Young English Language Learners&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
The subject of English Language acquisition is surrounded by controversy.  Approaches touted as &quot;best practice&quot; are many and parents are faced with contradictory information on a regular basis. Amidst the turmoil, the birth to age three sector of English Language Learners are often forgotten.  Perhaps there are fewer reports on this age group as they are not yet of public school age.  Never-the-less, young English Language Learners are a growing group and this area of research is lacking in thoroughly researched information.  The United States Census reports that 25% of young children live in immigrant families and represent 10% of all children in the United States (Hernandez, Denton, &amp; Macartney 2008, p.5).  Furthermore, the statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau suggest that &quot;[o]ne half of children in newcomer families have a mother or father who has limited proficiency in speaking English [and]...58% of children in newcomer families live with at least one parent who is not proficient in English (by self-report or report of an adult in the household)&quot; (Hernandez ''et al.'', 2008, p. 5).  Thus, our youngest English Language Learners are an integral part of the story of the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Finally, for this article the reader may notice that I have mostly pulled resources from the Zero to Three Journal, one of the leading journals in early development.  This journal pulls from a variety of different academic sources and presents the most broad approach to understanding the benefits and challenges of teaching early English Language Learners in the United States.  Furthermore, of the information that I have been able to find in the form of an academic journal, ''Zero to Three'' presents the information in the most concise, reader friendly manner.  As I have previously stated, there is very little ''researched'' information available on the topic of ''English Language Learners'' in the birth to age three area of development.  One possible reason for this deficit in research is that it is particularly difficult to gather information on a group that is considered minority in number and is not found in large, testable groups, such as the public pre-kindergarten to high school group.  Regardless, the few academic journals that speak ''particularly'' to the birth to age three group are of equal consensus.  Because of limited information, there is the possibility of the authors drawing conclusions based on bias, and that is a factor to be considered as the reader approaches this article.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  

&lt;u&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Early Language Acquisition:  Who are the teachers and how do we learn language?'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Early English Language Learners are found in day care centers, home day care facilities, at home, and in the home of family members.  Because infants and toddlers learn through play, the &quot;teachers&quot; are often not those whom we would traditionally view as teachers.  The &quot;teachers&quot; are caregivers: whether they are parents, family members, adoptive families, or daycare providers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
The first three years of life are important to a child's foundation as these are the very beginnings of communication (Eichten, 2000, p.4-5).  In order to delve into the issue of teaching English Language Learners or ELL's, one must first grasp a general understanding of early language acquisition in all infants and toddlers. According to Philip I. Eichten, CCC-SLP, there are two basic kinds of language:  receptive and expressive (Eichten, 2000, p. 16-17).   Receptive and expressive language are closely linked to all other areas of development and are integral to the discussion of English Language Acquisition. According to Eichten:&lt;br&gt;
Receptive Language &quot;...is the processing of language information being received by a child [and] his ability to understand what is said to him&quot;&lt;br&gt; and expressive language &quot;...is the processing of language information being spoken by a child [and] his ability to state his needs, ideas, and feelings&quot; (Eichten, 2000, p. 16-17).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFB5D;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Birth to Age Three and Beyond...'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Children between the ages of 1 1/2 and 6 years quickly acquire an extensive vocabulary and learn to comprehend over 14,000 words&quot; (Pham, 1994)&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An example of receptive language, according to Eichten's definition, might be expressed through a toddler retrieving his shoes when his mother asks him to go find them.  In contrast, expressive language might be the mother asking the toddler, &quot;What do you want?&quot; and the toddler proclaiming, &quot;Juice!&quot;  
Along with understanding the different kinds of language, it is important to note that infants and toddlers from all cultural and linguistic backgrounds learn these skills in similar ways.  Betty Bardige and M. Kori Bardige note that, &quot;Around the world, babies in widely varying cultures and circumstances tune in to human voices and non-verbal communications; build relationships through responsive interactions; coo and babble; attach meaning to words; use single words to label, inquire, demand, and insist; put words together in novel combinations; and master the key elements of grammar in a similar pattern and on a similar timetable.&quot; (Bardige &amp; Bardige, 2008, p. 4)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Most Importantly...'''
Across the board, therapists, specialists, and experts emphasize meaningful social interaction as the basis for successful communication and language development.  This concept is vital to remember when interacting with all infants and toddlers, including ELL's.  Often, instructors and parents become frustrated with an overload of information about &quot;best practice&quot; and forget that the fundamentals are the most important in raising a child that is a successful communicator.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

&lt;u&gt;'''Teaching:  Early Childhood Centers and Daycares'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Center for Early Childcare and Education notes that, &quot;human interactions, accompanied by the use of language, are exceedingly complex.  The term 'socio-linguistic environment' (SLE) is used to acknowledge that a multitude of variables influence human communication processes&quot; (Stechuk, Burns, &amp; Yandian, 2006, p.32). Thus, it follows that an environment that honors the equal importance of the family's culture and language will further the child's ability to learn.  In fact, there is even a great deal of evidence that exposure to another child's minority language may benefit the native English speaking children in the class. (Espinosa, 2008, p. 10)  Pilar Fort and Robert Stechuk state &quot;In a place where no one speaks the child's language and knows very little of his culture, a child could feel lost, misunderstood, and alienated&quot; (Fort &amp; Stechuk, 2008, p. 24).  However, they also suggest that &quot;Staff members [of early childhood facilities] struggle with how to best support children and families who are working to preserve their home language and culture while helping their children succeed in educational settings outside the home where English is the predominant language&quot; (Fort &amp; Stechuk, 2008, p. 24). &lt;br&gt;

In their article &quot;The Relationship Between Language and Culture,&quot; Wendy Jones and Isabella Lorenzo-Hubert offer the following suggestions for preserving language and culture that all reflect intense family involvement as the cornerstone, &quot;Whenever possible ensure that signs, memos, announcements, or materials are translated into the families' preferred languages; use interpreters or bilingual staff trained in interpretation when conveying information orally, and use translators or qualified bilingual staff to provide information in written formats; encourage bilingual staff and families to assist staff members who are not bilingual to learn and use basic phrases (e.g. hello, good-bye, thank you) in the languages of the families that participate in the program&quot; (Jones &amp; Lorenzo-Hubert, 2008, p. 14).  Thus, a daunting task is made palatable by a mere focus on a parent-staff relationship and a utilization of community resources.  At the same time, access to bilingual teachers is not always readily available, but evidence suggests that fully bilingual teachers are not essential to maintenance of a child's first language (Hernandez, Denton, Macartney, 2008, p. 5).  As previously expressed, what is most essential is a dedication to encouraging families to &quot;talk, read, and sing with the child in the parents' home language, and to use the home language in everyday activities&quot; (Hernandez ''et al.'', 2008, p. 6) as a part of the inclusive learning environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For the purposes of Early Intervention, parents or primary caregivers are seen as the teacher within the context of the home.  In an English-dominated country, parents often feel a great deal of anxiety about the task of raising a dual language learner (Hornblower, 1998).  However, in his article &quot;Early Dual Language Learning,&quot; Fred Genesee puts parents at ease by summarizing the research available on the benefits and challenges to dual language acquisition.  Genesee suggests that there is no research that opposes dual language acquisition, if that is what the parent chooses (Genesee, 2008).  According to Genesee, parents are generally concerned with whether or not their child should attain two languages.  Research shows that there are, in fact, both social and cognitive advantages to bilingualism over monolingualism (Genesee, 2008, p. 17).  Furthermore, as stated previously, &quot;Children need to learn their home language to connect with family members.&quot; (Genesee, 2008, p. 18)  As for questioning whether bilingual children are normal, the research reports a resounding yes (Genesee, 2008, p.16-19)! In fact, it is possibly more &quot;normal&quot; to be bilingual as &quot;It has been estimated that there may be more children who grow up learning two or more languages than children who learn only one&quot; (Genesee, 2008, p. 18).  Finally, children do not become confused when acquiring different languages (Genesee, 2008, pp. 18-19).  In general, Genesee encourages bilingualism and minority language preservation as a successful in-home strategy.  Learning two languages, Genesee suggests, is natural and promotes a well-rounded social experience. In fact, there is further research to suggest that &quot;proficiency in the heritage language acquisition and leads to higher academic achievement, but also results in greater cognitive flexibility including an enhanced ability to deal with abstract concepts&quot; (Lee &amp; Oxelson, 2006, 453-455)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
 &lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though the topic of teaching early English Language Learners is still under-researched, the information that we have available suggests that there are no negative side affects to dual language acquisition (Genesee, 2008, p. 18).  In fact, the information is quite to the contrary.  Furthermore, though we have a sizable oppositional group to bilingual or dual acquisition, pre-kindergarten to high school, classroom environments (Hornblower, 1998), there appears to be no headlining opposition to the individual's personal choice of whether or not to raise their child bilingually.  Regardless of personal opinion or language ability, the research further suggests that caregivers and parents should equally honor the child's heritage, which is deeply connected to their language of origin (Fort &amp; Stechuk, 2008, p. 24).  Finally, as educators we must always approach the subject with the child's best interest in mind and think of each child as a unique individual from a unique familial situation.

----


==âIntroductionâ==
Learning how to do something new can be a challenge for anyone. Learning how to speak and become familiar with another language other than the one you are accustomed to may be an even harder obstacle to overcome. This challenge is not only difficult for students, but also for their instructors. However, by understanding each student, their abilities, strengths and weaknesses, having patience, an open mind, and not fearing from trying new things, the outcome can be very rewarding and exciting. This sort of task takes a certain kind of understanding and willingness to listen to students and their difficulties, and make themselves available for extra time outside of class. With that in mind there are several techniques, strategies, and approaches to help not only English Language Learners (ELLs), but also their instructors.


=='''What has Been Done?'''==
----
 
The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 is the first piece of federal legislation to address the 
issue of those who are limited in their proficiency of speaking English. At first, this act 
does not specifically state that English must be taught in the studentâs native tongue, but 
rather find different ways and tactics to ensure success. It also was directed towards individuals 
who come from low income families. This Act has undergone numerous amounts of revisions. 
However, one thing remains the same. âCurrent legislation reflects the belief that school districts 
need to provide a variety of alternatives to enable their LEP students to reach proficiency in English 
and to be academically successful in mainstream classes.â As the country has become more diverse, and 
immigration more popular the educational system has had to adapt to the changes in students in the 
classroom (The Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later).

=='''How to Accommodate ELLs Effectively'''==
----
A study shows that by the year 2010 about thirty percent of all school age children will come from homes whose primary language is not English (English Language Learners). With that in mind, teachers must become more flexible and trained to teach a diverse group of students. Teachers must understand that not only is it tough for their students to adjust to a new culture and language, they must also deal with pressures and obstacles from their daily lives.  A few crisesâ their students may face are:
â- a loss of identity, friends, and cultureâ
â-an inability to express ideas or communicate in the community at largeâ
â- high familial expectations for academic successâ
â-unfamiliar learning environments and teaching stylesâ(Helping English language Learners in the Classroom)
Teachers must also take into consideration the different backgrounds and circumstances that each student possesses when teaching. An individualâs age, native language, literacy of parentâs, and reason for immigrating will also impact the technique that will be most efficient. Age is an important factor to think about because when students are younger it is easier for them to learn and obtain knowledge. In contrast the older a student is, the harder it will be for them to learn a new language. One way to aid in the transition and learning process is by possibly using a combination of learning English in their native language. The literacy of a studentâs parents may be a vital part of the studentâs success. If their parents are already familiar and proficient with the language both written and spoken, it will be easier for the student to understand and learn. Finally, and quite possibly the most important factor to take into consideration is the reason for the student and the studentâs family immigrating. Psychological factors may cloud the learnerâs ability to want to learn, because they may feel distracted and uneasy. Factors such as war, political or religious persecution, and escaping from violence may have a large impact on an individualâs willingness to learn. (Helping English Language Learners in the Classroom)

=='''Tips for Teaching Beginner English Language Learners'''==
----
Learning a new language is very difficult. As with learning anything new, practice makes perfect. Even Thomas Edison once said about his many attempts to create the light bulb, âI have not failed 1,000 times. I have successfully discovered 1,000 ways not to make a light bulb.â As with teaching ELLs, there is not only one correct way to do so. Every student is different and so is the way that they are able to be taught. Each student should be treated as an individual and feel comfortable in their learning environment. Mistakes should be accepted and encouraged because that shows that there are areas that can be improved upon. There are many tactics and tips that English Language Teachers can use and should keep in mind when teaching so that they may maximize the benefits that their students will obtain.

â¢	S-p-ea-k s-l-ooooow-ly and distinctly. 

â¢	Use hand signals and body language. 

â¢	Repetition is not boring. Repetition is not boring. 

â¢	Model a task or a dialogue more than once before students try it.

â¢	If something doesnât work, DROP it and move on. 

â¢	Be warm and welcoming. 

â¢	Present material using different approaches: oral, written, hands-on activities or games. 

â¢	Use many examples. Use props. 

â¢	Be aware of your pacing; check for understanding. Do your students need more explanation? More time to practice? 

â¢	Repeat &amp; review. Several short sessions are more effective than one long one. 

â¢	In each lesson, give students an opportunity 

	- to listen

	- to speak

	- to read

	- to write

	- to ask questions 

â¢	Monitor your language; limit the use of slang and idioms. Take time to explain. 

â¢	Be objective about controversial issues. It is fine to let students know your opinions, but strive to present a balance of information. We want students to be able to determine their own views.

=='''Final Thoughts ==
----
As with learning any language for the first time, everyone knows that it does not come easy. Teachers and schools must be supportive, open, and positive when teaching individuals that are not accustomed to a particular culture and language practices. I believe that by teaching English to others, we can promote a more positive outlook on our culture because different individuals may be able to see where we are coming from and understand our way of life better. When teaching English Language Learners, teachers must keep in mind that there is not only approach that works for all students. When teaching a language more hands on and interactive activities must be exhausted, because language is an applied subject. 
 One anonymous writer once said:

&quot;Through learning language, we learn about culture.
Through learning about culture, we learn respect for others.
Through learning respect for others, we can hope for peace.&quot;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;by Jenny Pennington&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



==&lt;big&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/big&gt;==

The reader should be able to identify how Culturally Responsive Teaching can be integrated into the classroom

The reader should be able to recognize examples of different cultural norms that may conflict with standard classroom behavior

The reader should be able to understand how typical teacher candidate training may create culturally insular educators


==&lt;big&gt;The Increasing Need for Cultural Response&lt;/big&gt;==

As our nationâs cultural diversity continues to evolve, teachers are finding it necessary to adapt their mindset and lesson plans to accommodate students with varying cultural identities and experiences. A common phrase for helping students from different backgrounds adapt to each other is building a cultural bridge. According to the &quot;InTime: Integrating New Technologies Into the Methods of Education&quot; (2002) website, teachers can become proactive in combining âacademic abstractionsâ and âlived sociocultural realitiesâ through Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT). Today's teachers have a greater responsibility to address the growing &quot;melting pot&quot; of students in their classrooms and to adapt lesson plans to respect the varying cultural identities of a heterogeneous group.


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #F433FF;
border: solid 10px #6A287E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8D38C9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Noted scholar Gay describes Culturally Responsive Teaching as &quot;Validating, Comprehensive, Multidimensional, Empowering, Transformative, and Emancipatory&quot; (as cited in Edwards and Kuhlman, 2007)&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


 
===&lt;big&gt;What Is It?&lt;/big&gt;===


Culturally Responsive Teaching is âusing the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, and performance styles of diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective for themâ (&quot;Intime&quot; par. 1). Being mindful of this type of teaching requires âteach[ing] to and through the strengths of studentsâ (&quot;InTime&quot;, 2002, para. 1) by using âmulticultural information, resources, and materials in all subjectsâ (para. 1). 

Some characteristics of Culturally Responsive Teaching include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; âAcknowledg[ing] the legitimacy of the cultural heritages of different ethnic groups, both as legacies that affect students' dispositions, attitudes, and approaches to learning and as worthy content to be taught in the formal curriculum &lt;li&gt; Us[ing] a wide variety of instructional strategies that are connected to different learning styles &lt;li&gt; Teach[ing] students to know and praise their own and each othersâ cultural heritagesâ (&quot;InTime&quot;, 2002, para. 2).&lt;/ul&gt;


==&lt;big&gt;How CRT Affects Teachers&lt;/big&gt;==


Noted and oft-cited scholar in CRT studies, Gay contends teachers tend to be âculturally insularâ (as cited in Edwards and Kuhlman, 2007, para. 3), or narrow-minded, and can learn how to use CRT as a âmeans for releasing the potential of ethnically diverse students by exploring both the academic and psychosocial abilities of the studentsâ (para. 3). Gay finds teachers âoften focus on what their students âdonât have and canât doâ while claiming cultural neutrality, believing that their own personal experiences are normalâ (para. 6). Furthermore, Gay explains the reason behind this mentality is that teacher candidates begin their teaching careers âwith little preparation for working with children who differ from them racially, culturally, and economicallyâ (para. 7). Obviously, Gay's stance is not true of all teachers and their training. Yet it is worth questioning if teaching in an area where students' backgrounds are similar to each other or similar to the teacher is the fault of either. It is hard to imagine anyone disputing the need for cultural sensitivity whether students experience different cultures firsthand or study them in class. Barnes (2006) notes in her article âPreparing Preservice Teachers to Teach in a Culturally Responsive Wayâ that the âteaching force remains homogenousâpredominantly white, female, and middle classâ (para. 1). The perception that the teaching force is not heterogeneous highlights a larger issue that isn't addressed here, but the idea that those who typically choose to enter the teacher profession exhibit similar traits certainly does not mean the teachers are doomed to complacency in their lessons or apathy toward their students. There may be a âcultural discontinuityâ between teacher and student (para. 1), but it can be inferred that as the diversity in our population increases, it will be evident among teaching staff, not just students. Diversity is more apparent in urban school settings; however, research indicates that teachers across the nation train through âcurricula historically grounded in Euro centric traditional styles of pedagogyâ (Barnes, 2006, para. 1). Therefore, until the teacher training curriculum reflects an understanding of different cultures (i.e. reading literature from authors with more diverse backgrounds), new teachers may have to adopt the practice that how they teach is not how they were taught. Respecting and having a passionate curiosity in each other's cultures are ways to break the perceived disconnect in the teacher-student relationship.

Another factor that may account for a lack of Culturally Responsive Teaching in the past is the common âfosteringâ of individualism in U.S. school systems (Rothstein-Fisch, Greendfield, and Trumbull, 1999, p. 64), which âemphasizes information disengaged from its social contextâ (p. 64). Educators may recognize collectivistic values in some students, or values that âemphasize the interdependence of family membersâ (p. 64). Teachers see collectivism in students who tend to join or help others in a task so that they are âcontribut[ing] to the success of any group they belong toâ (p. 64). Collectivism may also account for students who relate school-based instruction to stories told in their home instead of discussing learned information in more âscientific languageâ (p. 66). Rothstein-Fisch, Greenfield, and Trumbull (1999) suggest that as part of âadvocating cultural sensitivity [. . .] teachers recognize their own practices as cultural in origin rather than as simply the âright wayâ to do thingsâ (p. 66). Acknowledging cultural differences and how they affect learning is akin to the need to realize that everyone has an accent--everyone has a culture and we all should respect that if we wish to address the needs of all our students.

In âCultural and Academic Excellence Leaves No Child Behind,â Stickney (2003) states that â[e]ffective educators understand the verbal and nonverbal communication styles of cultures other than their ownâ (para. 6). Cultural norms may dictate students perform or react in ways anathema to what teachers expect, which is using âeye contact, tak[ing] turns, speak[ing] one at a time, and us[ing] body language that shows they are being attentiveâ (para. 6). One example of this perceived deviation is in African American cultures in which students âsometimes use call-and-response banter when communicating (a self-explanatory practice in which someone speaks and another replies = banter), [in] Latino cultures [when students] at times talk along with speakers to show support for what is being said, and [in] Hawaiian cultures [when students] communicate more effectively by storytelling than by quick repliesâ (para. 6). Teachers will need to research the cultural norms of their students--such norms are far too varied and complex to be summarized here, and new norms may emerge each year as new students enter our classrooms. In general, studentsâ behavior in classrooms will âdepend upon cultural norms regarding what is polite or respectful, [even] culturally accepted gender rolesâ (para. 7). If one is to incorporate cultural sensitivity in his or her teaching, âlesson plans need to blend information on how students can become comfortable with American culture with ways that other students can become culturally responsive to members of diverse culturesâ (para. 7). As the U.S. population diversifies, an inspiring definition of American culture will be just that--diversity, the idea of the &quot;melting pot&quot; becoming a lived reality in more and more places.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8D38C9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Ladson-Billings (Education Alliance, 2009) contends that Culturally Responsive Teaching is &quot;an approach that empowers students intellectually, socially, emotionally, and politically by using cultural referents to impart knowledge, skills, and attitudes.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



===&lt;big&gt;What Can CRT Do?&lt;/big&gt;===


CRT can capitalize on cooperative learning (&quot;InTime&quot;, 2009, para. 11) as students âbecome social criticsâ (para. 10) with âmore caring, concerned, and humane interpersonal skillsâ (para. 12). Students can benefit from CRT by gaining a âbetter understanding of interconnections among individual, local, national, ethnic, global, and human identitiesâ as well as âacceptance of knowledge as something to be continuously shared, critiqued, revised, and renewedâ (para. 12). &quot;The Knowledge Loom&quot; (2009), a site created by the Education Alliance at Brown University, maintains CRT is âpremised on the idea that culture is central to student learningâ (para. 1), and also suggests CRT is a means to ârecognize, respect, and use studentsâ identities and backgrounds as meaningful sources for creating optimal learning environmentsâ (para. 1). One can deduce that the CRT concept negates the groundbreaking notion that studentsâ minds are a blank slate, or tabula rosa (&quot;The Knowledge Loom&quot;, 2009, para. 4), since background and experience are integral factors in the learning environment--and can provide richer learning experiences for student and teacher.


===&lt;big&gt;In the Classroom&lt;/big&gt;===


The premise of a learning community can come to fruition in a culturally responsive classroom. Since CRT can expand to all subjects, teachers can collaborate to make studentsâ experiences multidimensional through: âcurriculum content, learning context, classroom climate, student-teacher relationships, instructional techniques, and performance assessmentsâ (&quot;InTime&quot;, 2009, para. 6). In fact, teachers of varied subjects like language arts, science, social studies, and music can collaborate âin teaching a single cultural concept, such as protestâ (para. 6). Cooperative learning lends itself not just to student groups but to a group of teachers who can work together to strengthen cultural understanding.


==&lt;big&gt;CRT and NCLB&lt;/big&gt;==


A strong correlation between the No Child Left Behind act and Culturally Responsive Teaching is the result of higher test scores because âeducatorsâ integration of cultural nuances and acceptance of different cultural communication styles in classrooms positively correlate with improvements in time on task, attending behaviors, participation in classroom dialogue, concept mastery, recall of factual information with greater accuracy, and more student enthusiasm and confidence in learningâ (Stickney, 2003, para. 4). Proponents of the NCLB act promote CRT since they consider âstudents from less dominant cultures [. . .] to be at particular risk for school failureâ (para. 1). Cooperative learning through students working in groups helps students get to know each other's backgrounds while working together to complete a task or meet a goal. If anyone can argue against a student feeling accepted into a diverse group, it may be from a homeogenous mindset a la speaking in Standard English or all people using/speaking the same language. 



==&lt;big&gt;Conclusion&lt;/big&gt;==


Studies of Culturally Responsive Teaching indicate that teachersâ âperceptions of culturally relevant teaching varie[s]â (Edwards and Kuhlman, 2007, para. 27), but one can integrate CRT in the classroom in the same vein one works with students âwho may have emotional and physical problemsâ (para. 28)âi.e., by continuing to acknowledge and accommodate diversity among student populations. Edwards and Kuhlman (2007) urge teachers to âknow that the process of becoming a culturally responsive teacher is nurtured by living, experimenting, traveling, and readingâ (para. 28). Combining teachersâ knowledge of different cultural norms with classroom application creates an âopportunity to insert education into culture rather than culture into educationâ (para. 11). Imagine a classroom in which the teacher and student stir who they are, where they come from, and what they believe into the collective pot, creating a respectful school culture where diversity is the accepted norm.

== '''What does Culturally Responsive Mean?''' ==


In a classroom of culturally diverse students, do all students perceive information in the same manner?  How does having students of varying cultures affect learning opportunities and the teaching methods of teachers?  These questions have become a reality to consider since the US population currently consists of over 30% minority cultures and that number is projected to be greater than 50% by the year 2060, according to the 2000 US Census (Hosp &amp; Hosp, 2001).  Encountering cultural diversity in the classroom is becoming more and more common.

Pat Burke Guild considers culture and learning in the following quote: 

We know that culture and learning are connected in important ways.  Early life experiences and the values of a person's culture affect 
both the expectations and the processes of learning.  If this relationship is true, could we then assume that students who share cultural   characteristics have common ways of learning?  Does culture create a way of learning, and how would we know this?  Do African American students  have similar ways of learning?  Do girls learn differently than boys?  These questions are both important and controversial. (n.d., p.10)        
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

According to Websterâs dictionary (1997), a definition of culture is âthe customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social groupâ (&quot;Culture&quot;, p.282).  Therefore, teachers who use culturally responsive teaching respond to the beliefs, social forms, and traits of students.  âGay (2000) defines culturally responsive teaching as using the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, and performance styles of diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective for them; it teaches to and through the strengths of these studentsâ (Culturally, 2008, para. 2).  Such teachers realize the impact that they have on students, reflect on studentsâ cultures and their own in order to see areas that may facilitate or interfere with teaching or learning, and then provide meaningful and beneficial experiences for students(Morrier, Irving, Dandy, Dmitriyev, &amp; Ukeje, 2007; Peregoy, S., 2008).

== '''I heard the teacher, but she didnât like my answer.  Why not?''' ==


If a teacher does not seek to understand a studentâs background and culture, there are likely to be misunderstandings that occur.  Some areas where behavior could be misinterpreted due to cultural differences are in âattention-getting strategies, ways of responding to questions, and ways of interactingâ (Coballes-Vega, 1992, Information para. 3).  


Value differences may arise through behavior relating to informality, individualism, and egalitarianism.  Some cultures value being spoken to using formal names whereas others value an informal, relaxed setting (Copeland, 2007).  Some cultures value individualism in which a student offering a contradictory opinion to the teacher is viewed as being independent and of value; whereas, those cultures who value egalitarianism more may view a public disagreement as being arrogant and would expect the teacher to be the strong authoritarian who uses constant direct instruction (Copeland, 2007).  


A student from such an authoritarian culture may have learned only to speak to adults when asked by the adult.  When at school and the teacher requests volunteers, this student may have difficulty freely speaking (Peregoy, 2008).  The silence could be interpreted by the teacher as disinterest or uncertainty, but the student may be waiting for the teacher to call on him/her.

== '''Assessment''' ==

Teachers may need to consider alternative means of assessment based on their studentsâ cultural backgrounds.  Currently, much of reading/literature assessment is based on western values of literacy.  Some cultures, such as those in Morocco and Western Samoa, value storytelling or oral tradition (Coballes-Vega, 1992).  Students from such cultures may learn easily orallyâthrough memorization-- and may score poorly in traditional western reading assessments.  Altering curriculum to allow for these non-traditional skills may be an option to highlight strengths in such students and encourage them.

== '''Strategies for Teachers''' ==
&lt;small&gt;&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;45%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 3px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Culurally responsive teaching fosters competence in students' home and school cultures, utilizing a students' home culture as a building block for new knowledge and skills (&quot;Principles,&quot; n.d.).  Sample activities that could promote such cultural understanding, include having students:
*Share about an object from home that shows their culture
*Write about a family tradition
*Research varying features of their culture   (&quot;Principles,&quot; n.d.)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Using a variety of teaching strategies can help to meet the needs of students of varying cultures.  Cooperative grouping is one potential teaching strategy that may assist African American, Native American, and Hispanic students because it is more similar to their culture (Coballes-Vega, 1992).  Making multicultural information about different ethnic groups available to students can help encourage cultural heritage and acceptance (&quot;Culturally,&quot; n.d.).  This can be done through having literature books from many cultural perspectives.  Teachers can also verbally express differences and explain them as being equally true but just different ways of doing something.  In this way, cultural differences among students can be encouraged as opportunities to learn and as rich sources of information instead of as points of conflict.

== '''Interaction with Parents''' ==


Culturally responsive teachers will recognize that their studentsâ parents also come from varying cultures and have varying expectations of parental involvement.  Parental cultural values may be distinctly different than those expressed in schools.  Copeland (2007) offers an example in which a parent from the Netherlands and Sweden said to a teacher regarding a teacherâs request for parent volunteers, âIn my country, we leave teaching to teachers, just as we leave surgery to surgeons.  We donât expect to be invited into the operating room, and we donât expect to be invited into the classroomâ(p. 68).  Coballes-Vega (1992) describes another example of Southeast Asian parents valuing the individualâs role within the family more so than any one family memberâs personal desire. When their child--a student-- chooses to watch siblings for the parents instead of completing homework, the student is doing so because of cultural values.  


To help alleviate confusion and misunderstandings, Coballes-Vega (1992) encourages teachers to seek to understand âchild-rearing practices, family relationships, and interpersonal communicationâ of their studentsâ cultures in order to understand parents (Information par. 5).  Teachers can also encourage parental involvement by communicating in the parentâs first language via translators to write notes or during conferences (Coballes-Vega, 1992).

== '''Conclusion''' ==


From classroom management to teaching strategies, from perceiving behavior to assessing performance, culture impacts the view and understanding of both teacher and student.  âWe, as teachers, need to understand and appreciate the diverse cultural identities of our students to ensure that they feel safe and appreciated for who they are and that they have access to learning opportunities in schoolâ (Percival &amp; Black, 2008, 152).

== '''Questions''' ==

&lt;big&gt;'''Gender Issues In the Classroom      [[Image:Landaff 1940s.jpg|350px|right]]

By Euticha Hawkins'''&lt;/big&gt;



&lt;big&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/big&gt;

By reading this article, the student should be able to:

1)  Identify the general developmental differences between boys and girls

2)  Describe how to create an classroom that is fair to both genders 

3)  Explain Title IX and the push for women’s equality in education

4)  Understand the debate over single-sex schooling


&lt;big&gt;'''Gender Differences and Teaching to Both Genders'''&lt;/big&gt;


The vast majority of public educators will spend their careers in co-educational classrooms.  As a result, they get to observe firsthand how “boys and girls create very distinct cultures” (Kommer, 2006, sect. 1, para. 4).  The challenge for these teachers is to create a learning environment that is both fair and equal, taking into account differences in gender.


Boys and girls do differ, both socially and intellectually.  Generally speaking, boys are more physical and more competitive than girls (Kommer, 2006).  They like to move around a lot and learn through “exploratory play” (Geist &amp; King, 2008, No. 5, para. 1).  They often enjoy challenges where they can compete individually to see who is “the best” (Geist &amp; King).  Girls tend to be less physical – they often find it easier to sit still – and they focus more on cooperation and collaboration (Kommer).  Girls are more likely to put the needs of the group first (Geist &amp; King).  


If teachers wish to teach both genders effectively, they must learn to use methods that incorporate both competition and cooperation (Geist &amp; King, 2008).  They should create both individual and group projects for students.  They must also encourage physical exploration, since so many boys are kinesthetic learners (Geist &amp; King).  


Teachers must also understand male and female brain development and difference.  Although the two genders are essentially equal in intelligence (Raymond, 2008), they are hard-wired for learning differently.  Girls tend to use both hemispheres of their brain, while boys are predominantly right-brained (Kommer, 2006).  As result, girls tend to excel verbal tasks like language and reading, while boys tend to excel in spatial activities like “mathematics, graphs and maps” (Kommer, sect. 2, para. 7).  


Teachers can help close learning gaps by helping students learn language and math in their own ways:  for instance, girls may do better by learning math “verbally,” as in having math problems presented in the form of word problems.  On the other hand, boys may find it easier to earn language skills “spatially,” such as by means of charts or graphs (Geist &amp; King, 2008).  In any event, teachers can draft problems or assignments that can be solved or completed in different ways (Geist &amp; King).  This makes it easier for both boys and girls to learn.


As Kommer notes, &quot;Girls mature more quickly than boys&quot; (2006, sect. 2, para. 3).  As a result, boys’ language skills, fine motor skills, and handwriting skills take a bit more time to develop (Tyre, 2006).  This is not to say that girls are inherently “better” than boys – boys eventually fully catch up with girls (Geist and King, 2008).  But it is important for teachers to understand that boys and girls mature on different timetables.   


The differences between boy and girls become magnified with age.  At the middle school level, children “begin to explore gender roles” (Kommer, 2006, sect. 1, para. 3).  Boys feel pressed by society to control their emotions, while girls become more in tune with their seemingly innate “emotional intelligence” (Kommer).  Girls are still, of course, maturing more quickly than boys.  The onset of puberty arrives sooner; hormones, such as progesterone, help girls develop bonding tendencies (Kommer).  Boys soon experience an upsurge in testosterone which is a double-edged sword:  while possibly making boys more confident, it can also cause them to engage in risky behaviors (Kommer). 


Because their brains mature more quickly, middle-school girls &quot;process information faster&quot; and more accurately than middle-school boys on timed tests (Tyre, 2006, para. 17).  Although boys eventually catch up with girls in this respect, it is important for teachers to be aware of this important developmental difference (Tyre).  Teachers can, for instance, make sure they are giving students of both genders enough time to finish assignments, especially timed tests.


Although they are outpacing boys in terms of maturity, girls in middle school experience a sudden drop-off in their levels of confidence (Kommer, 2006).  It is vastly important that girls of this age be encouraged to keep developing their skills in math and science, since women tend to be underrepresented in these fields.


During adolescence, both boys and girls begin to care deeply about how the opposite sex perceives them, and a cult of appearance or personal beauty develops (Kommer, 2006).  Kommer proposes that students of this age be educated in “media literacy,” so they may combat unrealistic media portrayals of how they should look, or how thin they should be.  In this way, schools may actually reduce the incidence of eating disorders and body image disorders, which affect boys as well as girls.



&lt;big&gt;'''Title IX and Fighting for Gender Parity'''&lt;/big&gt;


In 1972, in response to the civil rights movement, Congress passed the law commonly known as Title IX (&quot;Title IX Legal Manual&quot;).  This law stipulates that any school receiving federal funds must allow equal access to educational programs.  Although Title IX is most often associated with athletics, because it is written so broadly, it actually paved the way for many improvements in women’s status in academics (&quot;Achieving Success Under Title IX&quot;; ''Title IX - Gender Equity in Education'').  It is important to remember that Title IX protects both sexes from discrimination.  According to the American Civil Liberties Union, “Title IX benefits both males and females and is the lynchpin of thirty-five years of efforts to promote and establish gender equity in schools” (&quot;Title IX – Gender Equity in Education&quot;, para. 1).


Despite the progress initiated by Title IX, many educators still felt women and girls were feeling the pangs of discrimination.  In 1992, the American Association of University Women (AAUW) published a major study titled ''How Schools Shortchange Girls''.  This study shed light of the ways in which schools consciously or unconsciously discriminated against girls.  Among other things, the study noted how girls were often stereotyped or neglected by the educational system.  The study claims that curricula and tests were sometimes even biased in favor of males (&quot;How Schools Shortchange Girls&quot;).  At times, females are also victims of sexual harassment in schools, which can cause a huge disruption in the learning process(&quot;How Schools Shortchange Girls&quot;).


''How Schools Shortchange Girls'' elicited national attention and action.  However, a popular backlash has recently begun to develop.  According to Thomas (2008, para. 7), “In recent years, a number of critics have said that attempts to achieve greater gender equity [are] producing unintended negative effects on boys.&quot;  In other words, boys may be the ones getting shortchanged now.  Boys are now deemed more likely to exhibit behavior problems and to need remedial assistance (Kommer, 2006).  Although groups like the AAUW still contend that girls’ advances have not come &quot;at the expense of boys,&quot; many feel it would be wise to bolster our support of boys (Thomas, para. 1; Tyre, 2006).  We can do this by incorporating methods that specifically appeal to boys:  kinesthetic learning, visual learning, and competitive learning.  


&lt;big&gt;'''The Debate Over Single-Sex Schooling'''&lt;/big&gt;   [[Image:Sailor fuku girls.jpg|300px|right]]


In the wake of the so-called “gender wars,” a new idea has recently come into play:  the concept of single-sex schooling.  The rewriting of Title IX in 2006 approved the creation of single-sex public schools.  In the past, co-educational schools were seen as “more socially appropriate, liberating, and enlightened” (Meyer, 2008, sect. 2, para. 5).  The co-educational movement of the 1960s and 1970s vastly improved opportunities for female students, offering them entry into previously closed prestigious institutions (Meyer).


Nowadays, many Americans have come to believe that single-sex classrooms can still be fair and equal for both sexes.  In fact, they claim that such students in such classrooms do better because there are fewer distractions, meaning that students can focus more on the material, and because teachers can “[address] gender differences in learning” (Meyer, 2008, sect. 5, para. 2).  Rather than catering to both genders at once, a teacher can tailor the instruction for one gender only.


Critics of single-sex classrooms claim that they do not adequately prepare students for the real world.  After all, as Kommer notes, “[W]e do not live in a gender segregated world” (2006, Section 1, para. 10).  Critics also claim that single-sex classrooms actually undermine the accomplishments of Title IX by making education unequal.  (In their view, separate cannot be equal.)  


The debate over single-sex classroom will continue to rage.  What is clear is that the research about its effectiveness is still not sufficient (Salomone, 2006).  In effect, single-sex schooling is still experimental.  It remains to be seen whether it should be something implemented on a broader basis.

&lt;big&gt;'''In Brief'''&lt;/big&gt;

[[Image:Cute little kid in schoolyard.JPG‎|300px|left]]‎Within the last century, education has come a long way towards achieving gender equality.  It is important that teachers understand the many differences between boys and girls, but children should still be treated as individuals.  Gender differences should be recognized as general truths, not specific truths that apply to all children across the board.


In a co-educational classroom, the needs of boys and girls should be balanced.  Single sex classrooms remain an interesting option for promoting fairness and teaching specifically to each gender, although critics contend there can be no equality between separate institutions.  Only time and further research will prove whether single-sex schooling is in fact superior.  


What is fair to say is that all teachers strive for equality and wish the best for their students, whether male or female.  Getting there is the hard part.

== Introduction: ==


Gender can be defined as the classification of sex.  The classification of sex has two divisions a person is either male or female. In the American Heritage Dictionary under sex it states that males or females can be distinguished by their physiological, functional, and psychological differences. The idea that men and women have more differences than their physical appearance has been debated for centuries. Women tend to be labeled as nurturers while men are expected to be strong and tough. This labeling of the sexes called stereotyping is when a person gathers a fixed idea of how a female or male should act. 


== Stereotyping Gender ==


When you think of a girl what image is formulated in your mind? Now, think about a boy what image comes to mind? How would you describe the differences in the images that you formulated? Everyone seems to stereotypes people into gender groups. Teachers seem to expect boys to be more unruly and less involved in their course work. This act of how a boy should behave versus how a girl should behave is considered gender stereotyping. Some educators believe that separating girls and boys can be beneficial (Sadker, 2005 p. 19-20).

== '''Generalizations:''' ==
Assumption all girls are quiet, hard-working, and good at writing.   Assumption all boys are competitive, assertive, and good at math and science (Gray, 2006 p.  654).&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




== Separating Genders in Education ==


The No Child Left Behind Act has brought up the issue of single sex education in public schools. Single sex schools can be a desirable alternative to regular schools and they are being offered by an increasing number of school systems (Cable, 2008 p. 1). Leonard Sax maintains that a female brain remains more mature than a male brain up to the age of 30.  Sax finds that boys and girls brains are wired and develop differently.  He also found that girls have more sensitive hearing. Sax found that females and males respond to stress differently. He suggests that girls do better in non-competitive communal classrooms while boys do better in competitive classrooms. Leonard Sax believes that traditional classrooms cannot be gender neutral. Sax thinks teachers cannot help but stereotype their students, which creates bias in the classroom (Cable, 2008 p. 4). People who are in favor of single sex education use Saxâs analysis of gender to help support their argument. Protesters of single sex schools argue that these schools promote segregation by separating boys from girls. Differences in family income and family education background are more influential in a childâs achievements than gender. Tracking in single sex schools is done by gender rather than ability (Cable, 2008 p. 6).


== Gender and the hearing difference ==


Did you know that there are gender-hearing differences? Studies done on babies have shown that a newborn baby girlsâ hearing is substantially more sensitive than that of a newborn boy. This difference was more noticeable in the 1,000 â 4,000 Hz range, which is the range, that speech distinction takes place in. This difference has been proven to get bigger as children get older (Sax, 2006 p. 17).Psychologist Colin Elliot studied eleven-year-old girls and found that they were distracted by noise levels, which were ten times softer than the levels, which distracted boys the same age. Girls donât learn as well as boys in a loud environment (Sax, 2006 p. 18). Boys canât hear as well as girls, therefore if a teacher is soft spoken boys will be less attentive in her class. Some boys with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) could be diagnosed wrong simply because their actions are due to their hearing deficit. In some cases this can be solved simply by moving the boys to the front of the room (Sax, 2006 p. 5).  The fact there is a hearing difference between males and female students is not taught in most schools. Experienced teachers usually figure this out after five or ten years. One veteran teacher told Leonard Sax, M.D. Ph.D. author of âWhy Gender Mattersâ that âshe puts the boys in the front of the class and the girls in the back of her class. This is usually opposite of the positions in the classroom that boys and girls pick on their own (Sax, 2006 p. 88).

&lt;center&gt; Eye Sight
&lt;center&gt; ''Color Choices''

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


































== Eye sight differences in gender ==


A study done on 102 babies by Researchers at Cambridge University suggest that girls at birth are more interested with facial expressions while boys were more intrigued with moving objects. This can be attributed to the sex difference in the eye (Sax, 2006 p. 19). Boys have a thicker retina than girls and the pathway from the retina to the cerebral cortex in both sexes is different (Sax, 2006 p. 21-22).
If crayons are given to both boys and girls you will notice a difference in the colors they choose.  Girls tend to pick red, orange, green, and beige because these are the colors their eyes are more sensitive to. Boys tend to pick black, gray, silver, and blue because these are the colors their eyes are pre-wired to (Sax, 2006 p. 23-24). 


== Example of Teacher miscue ==


Letâs look at a kindergarten teacher who has just given her students plain paper and crayons to create a drawing. She walks around encouraging students and making comments on their pictures. She stops at a girlâs desk and notices all the beautiful colors and tells the child âBeautiful work.â  When she gets to one of the boys in her room she notices his picture is all in black crayon. She asked him questions about his picture and the boy says, âItâs a rocket about to smash into the earth.â  The teacher tells the boy his picture is nice but then states how about adding some color and people in the rocket.  Kids are good at figuring out what teachers want them to do. Sax thinks this boy understands that his picture doesnât please his teacher like the girls picture with all the colors and people in it. Teachers have been taught to encourage students; however, they havenât been taught how boys see different and are drawn to different colors than girls (Sax, 2006 p. 23).  This teacher meant no harm; however, she didnât understand the difference in the way boys and girls see and do things. Had she known that boys are drawn to colors like black, blue, gray and silver, she would have understood why his picture was only drawn in black. She would have appreciated his work more for his artist ability rather than addressing its lack of color.


== Beliefs ==


Boys and girls have differing opinions on their successes and failures. When a boy fails at a task he is likely to think he didnât try hard enough or it was bad luck. When a girl fails at a task she is likely to think it was due to her inability to do the task. When girls succeed at a task they attribute their success to good luck. When a boy succeeds at a task he will likely attribute his success to intelligence (Sadker, 2005 p. 21).
Girls believe that if they are considered smart or if they like âboyâ subjects like math and science that they will become unpopular. Boys seem to stay away from âgirlâ subjects like art, music, and reading (Sadker, 2005 p 21). 


== Teacher Bias ==


There are noticeable differences in male and female teachers. âMale teachers are more assertive and direct. Female teachers are more nurturing and less dominant in the classroomâ(Gool, 2008 p. 27). Male teachers prefer lecturing and show their dominance while female teachers guide students and provide cooperative learning experiences. Teachers generally interact with male students more than their female students. Boys are not fussed at for calling out an answer, while girls are told to remember the rules.  Teacher call on boys more often than girls but they wait longer for boys to answer the question than girls. Teachers tend to assist girls more with answers rather than encouraging them to find the answer on their own (Gool, 2008 p. 27).  


== Conclusion ==


Teachers need to learn and understand about gender differences in students while being cautious about stereotyping.  I believe teachers should be taught more about how to teach boys versus girls while maintaining an unbiased classroom. This will be hard; however, I think once a teacher masters this skill her students will learn better and behave while in the classroom. Knowing that boys may act out because they canât hear a soft spoken person or girls and boys eyes are hard wired differently can be beneficial to teachers.  This awareness can help a teacher better understand her students.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;

'''Learning Targets:'''

Upon reading this article, the reader will be able: 

1.) To know the three types of code-switching: borrowing, calque, and intersentential.

2.) To use strategies/ activities to increase their students' abilities to code-switch effectively.

3.) To recognize the negative and positive aspects of code-switching.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



== What is Code-Switching? == 
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #43C6DB;
border: solid 10px #736F6E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=left&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;

'''Definitions of Code-Switching'''

âconsciously modifying speech to slip from one culture to another.â 

(Haddock, 2008)

âchange from lexical register to anotherâ 

(McCoy, 2006, p. 24)

âShift in language that is guided by a shift in contextâ 

(Knestrict &amp; Schoensteadt, 2005, p. 177)

âuse of complete sentences, phrases, and borrowed words from another languageâ 

(Hughes, Shaunessy, and Brice, 2006, p.8)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Code switching is the ability to recognize that different scenarios require a change  in speech among multilingual groups.  A person must identify that a change in a social situation has occurred in order to switch codes.  Codes refer to different contexts of speech, such as formal vs. informal language or Spanish vs. English. Students who are bilingual or who come from different cultural backgrounds are noted for their ability to code switch.  Since standard English is not their primary language, it takes these students added efforts to speak according to the standard Some are able to code switch fluently from one language to another, while some are unable to switch back and forth with ease.  Unless a proper understanding of when and how to code switch is attained by the student, a lack of understanding will sometimes translate to a lack of knowledge. (Wheeler, 2008) For African-American students this lack of knowledge means âpersistent over-representation in special education and remedial basic skills classes to under-representation in honor classes, to lagging SAT scores, to low high school graduation ratesâ (Wheeler, 2008).













== Types of Code-Switching ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #43C6DB;
border: solid 10px #736F6E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=left&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;

'''Types of Code-Switching'''

'''Borrowing''': Saying &quot;Bueno bye&quot; (Spanish and English) instead of &quot;Goodbye&quot; (English) or &quot;Buenos dias&quot; (Spanish)

'''Calque''': Saying &quot;El lote deparquear&quot; (Improper Spanish Translation) instead of &quot;Parking lot&quot; (English) or &quot;Campo de estacionamiento&quot; (Proper Spanish Translation)

'''Intersentential''': Saying &quot;Sientense, students&quot; (Spanish and English) instead of &quot;Sit down, students&quot; (English) or &quot;Sientense estudiantes&quot; (Spanish)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


There are three types of code-switching: borrowing, calque, and intersentential.  The first type refers to using words from the secondary language in the same grammatical format, but words unavailable in the primary language (Hughes et al., 2006).  Calque is literally translating a phrase without regard to proper context (Hughes et al., 2006).  Third, intersentential is inserting an entire phrase from the secondary language into a conversation using the other language (Hughes et al., 2006).  All types refer to switching back and forth from one language to another to communicate to others based on the situation.



















== Code-Switching As A Valuable Tool ==

	
For bilingual speakers, code-switching is a valuable tool for various reasons.  It offers another language to use when words in the primary language are insufficient due to the speaker or listenerâs limited English proficiency (Hughes et al., 2006).  Since code-switching is motivated by situations, the speaker may use it to identify with a particular group of people (Hughes et al., 2006). Also, it can be a sociolinguistic tool, used for clarification, emphasis, separation from feelings, and achievement of a dramatic effect(Hughes et al., 2006).  By giving the speaker more ways in which to communicate, code-switching is a useful tool in the bilingual community.

== Code-Switching As a Negative Tool ==


Although code-switching can add to a studentâs toolbox, it can also be a sign of delay in language ability.  Bilingualism can be viewed as either a subtractive or an additive language process.  Subtractive refers to increasing the fluency and vocabulary in one language while the ability in the other decreases(Hughes et al., 2006).  Therefore, this process involves the replacement of one language for the other.  The additive process is when the speaker holds on to the knowledge of the first language and adds on the skills of the second language(Hughes et al., 2006).  Some people view code-switching as negative because they view it from the subtractive perspective, believing that the addition of a second language shows lack of knowledge.  Also, a bias of which language is inserted into English is evident.  For example, if a French phrase such as âje ne sais quoiâ is used it shows academic achievement, while Spanish phrases such as âadiosâ signifies a lower status (Hughes et al., 2006).  If a language is not used at a proper time or place, a studentâs ability to communicate effectively may be misunderstood.

== Theyâre Not Speaking Incorrectly! ==


A child says to his teacher, âI be doing my homeworkâ or âHola! How are you?â  These examples both represent using vernacular language in an improper setting or lack of code switching (Wheeler, 2008).  Teachers often identify this as speaking incorrect standard English.  However, these students are not in fact making errors, but are simply speaking in their vernacular language.  They were not attempting to communicate in Standard English, therefore the problem does not lie in correcting their speech, but teaching students an alternative means of communication (Wheeler, 2008).  By knowing the focus of education, teachers are able to more effectively meet the studentsâ educational needs.  
To help teachers meet the needs of struggling students, Rebecca S. Wheeler designed a three-step strategy, including: Scientific Inquiry, Comparison and Contrast, and Code-Switching as Metacognition (2008).  The first step, Scientific Inquiry, is to build a code-switching chart identifying grammar patterns in the studentâs writings.  The chart is divided into five sections: examine sentences, seek patterns, define the pattern, test the hypothesis, and write informal English pattern.  This step identifies the area of struggle for students and the pattern they use in informal language.  For example, instead of using âowner + âs + what is ownedâ (i.e. Leonâs ball) as in formal language, students may use âowner + what is usedâ (i.e. Leon ball) in their informal language (Wheeler, 2008, p. 56).  After the pattern is defined, the next step, is to compare and contrast the Formal English with Informal English, using the chart. Now, the students can visually and audibly know the difference between the two forms of language.  Lastly, in Code-Switching as Metacognition, the child practices code switching between the two.  Students will identify the appropriate language for a given setting.  Students can understand the two choices of formal and informal language and know the appropriate time to use each. (Wheeler, 2008)  By giving students an alternative form of language and not changing their primary form of communication, teachers give students an additional tool in their education toolbox.

== From the Perspective of a Teacher ==


In William McCoy's article, âHelping Students Find A Voice, by Giving Them the Words,â a teacher gives a personal account of how he succeeded at teaching 26 âat riskâ students how to code-switch effectively.  He believes it is the lack of understanding of their expectations and an insufficient academic vocabulary that causes students to fail in school.  The first step in using the right words for a given setting is to know the audience (McCoy, 2006).  He uses code-switching activities in his class, such as:

-	Simulating a job interview with two applicants, one using slang and the other formal language.  Through this activity, students understand that the type of language used has a strong impact on otherâs perceptions of that person (McCoy, 2006).

-	Writing a conversation in informal language on the board, and asking students to translate into the language used by professionals, such as a lawyer or professor (McCoy, 2006).  

McCoy reports that at the beginning this exercise is a struggle for his students, but with practice their performance improves.  After identifying the proper audience for a situation, students are to acknowledge the difference in situations and appropriate word usage.  To teach this lesson, McCoy gives them a phrase like âI want some money,â and has them discuss how their speech would differ when robbing someone at a bank, asking for a raise at work, and requesting money from a parent. It is easy to see that each situation merits a different set of words by the speaker.  Finally the students can use their knowledge and apply it to writing, focusing on having a purpose for their work.  The goal is for the writer to have a thesis, support it with details, and recognize the opposing side's argument.  As a result of McCoyâs work, he stated âI was reminded that students can succeed when given the tools and experiences to do soâ (McCoy, 2006, p. 25).  Without first identifying that students did not possess the skills to succeed, he would not be able to give them the tools needed for success.

== '''Code Switching in the Classroom '''==


By: Ashley Barber

&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0033CC&quot; face=&quot;TAHOMA&quot;&gt;

'''Learning Targets:'''



1.	The student will be able to define âcode-switchingâ in terms of definition and educational practice.

2.	The student will be able to identify the main points of the code-switching debate.

3.	The student will be able to identify the difference between the correctionist and the contrastivist approach.

4.	The student will be able to identify how to as a teacher teach code-switching effectively to a group of students.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;





'''What is Code Switching?'''



If you search for the word âcode switchingâ at Google.com you will find a variety of sources offering definitions for the term. You will find most commonly as you search through the links available that âcode switchingâ is a linguistics term referring to the ability to switch between different dialects and/or languages by a person during conversation. So thatâs the âtextbookâ definition as we call it, but as future educators you need more than just the âtextbookâ definition, what you need to know is what code-switching means in regards to education; and why you should choose to implement, or not implement, it as a tool in your future classrooms. So letâs dig a little deeper and go beyond standard definitions and into how code-switching will affect you. 






'''Code Switching from an Educational perspective'''


From an educatorâs perspective, code-switching isnât just switching back and forth mid-sentence between two different languages or dialects; in an educational context it is much more than that. Code-switching in the classroom means the use by teacher of different forms of informal and formal English to teach students in ways that are easier for them to understand and possibly to help students differentiate between formal and informal English more effectively. (Kasperczyk)


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66;
border: solid 10px #0033FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0033FF&quot; face=&quot;VERANDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Teaching students to code-switch is a student-centered approach to learning.&quot; (Coffee).&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66;
border: solid 10px #0033FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;[[File:slang.jpg]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''The Code-Switching Debate'''
	

To introduce and help you understand the code-switching debate weâre going to talk a little about the Ebonics debate. This will show us a recent example of one of the types of arguments that are going on in today's schools related to code-switching. The Ebonics debate encompassed the argument over if the way of speaking used primarily by African Americans, formally named âEbonicsâ, should be taught and used in schools or if it should be banned. The debate was at itâs peak in the 1990âs when a number of lawsuits were brought to court concerning the use of Ebonics in the classroom. On one side it was being argued that Ebonics should not be taught in English classrooms because it hinders the learning of the children who use it. Opponents of Ebonics cited that language skills are directly related to success in academics and African American students are behind in terms of academic success. (Mufwene, 1999). On the other side of the debate, proponents of the use of Ebonics claimed that the validity of Ebonics should be acknowledged and used to assist the teaching of Standard English. (Mufwene, 1999). 

If we compare the Ebonics debate to the code-switching debate we basically see the same things. The debate over code switching includes whether or not different dialects and/or slang should be used in the classroom to help teach children more effectively. The code switching debate not only includes the debate over inclusion of the African-American dialect it also includes arguments from Creole speakers, Hispanic-American, Native American, Asian-American, and virtually any other micro-culture that can be found clustered in areas of our country. (De Fina, 2007)

The United States of America is one of the most diverse nations on earth. Countless races, cultures, communities and languages can be found from border to border. This diversity affects our interactions with one another in every aspect of our lives. Though what is often overlooked is how our education is greatly affected by language diversity, especially in our elementary school classrooms. (Sert,2005)

Think back to your elementary school days, were you good at English, or was it one of your more difficult subjects? Now imagine that your teacher had taught you Standard English while speaking to you in the dialect that you were most familiar with, or in the way of speaking that you were immersed in when you were at home. Would this have helped you learn or would it have impaired you from fully learning Standard English? What if your teacher had switched back and forth between using Standard English and the most common dialect of the area you lived to teach you other subjects? Would this have affected your learning in any way? Two big questions facing educators today are will it help my students to code-switch or will it hurt them? And should students who are bi-lingual or use a dialect such as Ebonics or Creole be taught Standard English in the same way it is taught to second language learners? Current research points to both code-switching and teaching Standard English to certain children in the way of second language learners, as being much more helpful to students than harmful. (De Fina, 2007)

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;TAHOMA&quot;&gt;

'''Effective Code-Switching Classroom Practices:'''

1.Simulate a job interview with two applicants, one using informal English and slang and the other using formal English. This activity will help students learn how to use language in the correct context and the type of language used has a strong impact on others perceptions of that person (McCoy, 2006).

2. Have students translate conversations or sentences from informal English to standard English. (McCoy, 2006)

3.Give students examples of different situations in which they may encounter a choice between using formal English and informal English. Show them that when speaking to different people, and that in different situations, one use of the language is more appropriate than the other. 

4.Have your students give a tribute speech on someone in their home community in the dialect or language in which the person would speak. This helps the student to develop pride in their culture and language history. 

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




'''I code-switch in my classroom, now how can I teach my students to code-switch effectively?'''

There are two approaches to teaching code-switching the correctionist approach and the contrastivist approach (Coffee). The correctionist approach can be seen when the teacher decides that a studentâs home speech is incorrect, or is bad English and needs to be corrected to proper English. The teacher then tries to change the studentâs speech in every situation, formal or informal to Standard English. This approach tries to abolish all other forms of English and establish Standard English as the studentâs only form of communication.(Coffee)
The contrastivist approach can be seen when the teacher acknowledges that the English language comes in many different varieties and a studentâs home language doesnât need to be abolished. The teacher then begins to teach the student how to effectively switch between their home language and Standard English. (Coffee).
Current research suggests that the contrastivist approach is much more helpful to a students learning than the correctionist approach. By using the contrastivist approach students are not made to feel less intelligent because the dialect they use is not Standard English. Students are made to feel included and are generally more willing to learn when this approach is use. Teaching students to code-switch is a student-centered approach to learning. (Coffee).

'''Conclusion'''

So it is up to you as teachers whether or not you feel that code-switching in your classroom will be helpful or harmful. I would suggest, if you are considering using it, that you research ways to do it effectively more in depth, and discuss its use with other teachers at your school or perhaps your school principle. Each school and each classroom will be different so make sure you are familiar with the positives and negatives of what you are doing before you try anything new. Code-switching can be a helpful tool in my opinion as long as it is used correctly and appropriately.

== Lesbian, Gays, Bisexual, and Transgender Students (GLBT) in the Classroom ==

''
'''By Jocelyn Carter'''''


== Learning Targets ==
Students should be able to:

a) Identify Homophobia in Class.

b) Identify the Importance of incorporating GLBT curriculum in the classroom.

c) Describe strategies for creating a safe classroom for GLBT Students.

== Introduction ==


Human diversity is a normal, natural thing. We teach our kids that it is alright to be different, but we donât tell them how different it is okay to be. Today, the most common place to study differences of the world is in the classroom.  If children are to grow up prepared to live in a complex, multicultural society, more issues of diversity need to be discussed in the classroom (Banks 1993). The issue of sexual orientation has become of great importance to todayâs children. Researchers and Social scientist suggest that 1 to 3 of every 10 students is either gay or lesbian, or has an immediate family member who is (Wood p.16). This article will focus on homosexuality and homophobia, GLBT students in the classroom, social bias, and what can be done to provide a safe classroom for GLBT students.


&lt;big&gt;'''Why is âHomophobiaâ present in the Schools?'''&lt;/big&gt;


Most people would agree that the topic of homophobia carries very negative undertones; I guess that is unless you are homophobic. Homophobia is the fear, dislike, and hatred of same-sex relationships or those who love and are sexually attracted to those of the same sex. It occurs in schools on personal, institutional, and societal levels (Woods p 14). Homophobia is often based on ignorance, because an individual is so closed-minded that they are not willing to educate themselves on something they know nothing about. When Eric Marcus, a homosexual man and author, addressed the question, âWhat do students learn about homosexuality in elementary school and high school?â his answer was simply stated.
âStudents learn plenty about homosexuality in school, almost all of it informally, and nearly all of it bad. The first lesson occurs when one child calls another a fag in elementary school cafeteria, and the lesson continue right on through high school, when a group of students decides to torment a theater teacher they think is gayâ (Marcus, 1999 p 173)

We are taught when young that being âgayâ is bad. You may not even know what the word gay means, but your parents and everyone else around you have already put in your head that it is wrong and not accepted. Everyone is afraid of what they donât know. When you are introduced to something new, it is a natural reaction to be skeptical about it. You hesitate to try it, or you state from the beginning; I know that I am not going to like it. How do we teach students about GLBT related topics? How do we protect our GLBT students in the school?


&lt;big&gt;'''Why is it important to include GLBT related issues into the curriculum?'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FCDFFF;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;âMany of us, particularly in the dark days before the Stonewall riots, remember going into libraries to check for references that would give some validity to the vague stirrings inside us we knew marked us out as differentâ â Curry 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Imagine this, Lindsey is sitting in her 4th grade class on the first day of school, and everyone is sharing stories about their families. When itâs Lindseyâs turn she tells the class that she has two moms because they are lesbians. The class is confused and Megan asks âWhat is a Lesbian?â What do you do as a teacher? DO you answer the question or ignore it and change the subject? How do you answer this without overstepping your ethical boundaries? When discussing the inclusion of GLBT it is important to understand the diversity in a classroom. There may be students in your class that are already struggling with understanding their own sexual orientation. One report indicated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual students first come to realization of their sexual orientation at age 10( DâAugelli &amp; Hershbeger, 1993) When you put that age into perspective, that child is in the 3rd or 4th grade. People fear the unknown. They fear what they are unfamiliar with. On the issue of homophobia, Kevin Jennings, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network states, â If you really want a long-term solution to homophobia, youâd better start when kids are young, and start teaching very earlyâ (Quinlan, 1999).


&lt;big&gt;'''Opposition'''&lt;/big&gt;


There are different reasons why incorporating GLBT issues in the classroom may come result in negative results rather than positive. It may not be the best to bring these issues up with children that are 8 or 9, even though some may already be experiencing a feeling of attraction towards the same sex, and not understand why they feel that way. Teachers could feel great discomfort in speaking about this subject in the classroom.  Many parents feel that incorporating GLBT curriculum into the classroom, may cause their child to choose a gay lifestyle. When a teacher raises gay and lesbian issues in the classroom, some students respond with intellectual curiosity, but often the consequences are less positive. Some students: become embarrassed and uncomfortable, become hostile, or even question the teacher's sexuality. A lot of times students tend to make homophobic accusations against other students in the class or against other students and staff within the school (Lipkin 1999). Negative results could come about when GLBT issues are raised in the classroom. 


&lt;big&gt;'''Creating a Safe learning environment for GLBT Students'''&lt;/big&gt;


Everyone is entitled to a safe learning environment, no matter what your sexual orientation is. I think it is important to let the GLBT students know that we care, and that they are not alone. It is the duty of a teacher to keep order and command respect for everyone in their classroom, and I am sure many people sincerely would like to create a safer environment for GLBT students. There are ten suggestions that were compiled by Youth Pride, Inc. that would help with reducing homophobia in your environment:

1.	Make no assumption about sexuality.

2.	Having something gay-related visible in your office or classroom.

3.	Support, normalize and validate studentâs feelings about their sexuality.

4.	Do not advise youth to come out to parents, family and friends as they need to come out at their own safe place.

5.	Guarantee confidentiality with students.

6.	Challenge homophobia.

7.	Combat heterosexism in your classroom.

8.	Learn about and refer to community organizations

9.	Encourage school administrators to adopt and enforce anti-discrimination policies for their schools or school systems which include sexual orientation

10.	Provide role models.

It is important to incorporate this suggestion into the school. GLBT students need to be protected and I think the best way to start that is by educating their classmates and peers on what it means to be GLBT. âOpening these conversations with young children gives us an opportunity to prevent prejudice, discrimination, and violence and to support the lives of all children just as they areâ (Chasnoff and Cohen, 1997, p 10)



&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;


An estimated 6 to 11 percent of school children have gay or lesbian parents, and another 5 to 9 percent will at some point realize that they are homosexual (Chasnoff and Cohen, 1997). Even with these statistics, schools are still hesitant to include gay or lesbian curriculum into the school. The fact remains that in the present 21st century, gay and lesbians no longer represent a taboo. Students are choosing to come out while still in school, and they are expecting to be accepted. No matter what a studentâs sexual preference is, they deserve to be able to come to school and feel like they are safe. Whether or not it is the teacherâs or schoolâs responsibility to educate students on GLBT issues, is still to be decided. But in the meantime it is of upmost importance that these students are treated with respect and equality.

A. Challenge homophobia

B. Point out all the GLBT students in your classroom and tell the students not to make fun of them.

B. Refers to sexual behavior with or attraction to people of both sexes, or to a bisexual orientation.

C. The fear, dislike, and hatred of same-sex relationships or those who love and are sexually attracted to those of the same sex.

D. To cause harm to those who are not like yourself within sexual preference.

== Identifying Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered Students ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #purple;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;Sexual orientation subsumes sexual attractions, sexual behavior, psychological and emotional attachments, self-identification, and affiliations with a particular community&quot; (Madson, 2001).
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The term &quot;sexual orientation&quot; lacks a universally accepted definition. One's sexual orienation can be &quot;decided&quot; based on sexual attraction, sexual arousal, emotional attachment, and several other determining factors (&quot;Definition of Terms&quot;, 2007). 

Sexual orientation is, more than anything, based upon how an individual defines themself, or the a group with which they affiliate. Gestures, vocal characteristics, clothing, and other physical characteristics cannot determine a person's sexual orienation (&quot;Definition of Terms&quot;, 2007). 

Lesbian, Gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) students are found in, virtually, every school and they often faces hardships that the students who identify themselves as hetersexual do not experience. There are steps that educators may take in order to help easy the burden that school may have on these students.

== LGBT Issues in School ==

LGBT students are subject to far more incidences of physical and verbal attacks while in school. This abuse is caused by the presence of prejudice, and homophobia. Webster's Online Dictionary defines homophobia as the &quot;irrational fear of, aversion to, or disrimination against homosexuality and homosexuals&quot; (Homophobia, 2009).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;Students hear anti-gay epithets 25 times a day, and teachers fail to respond to these comments 97% of the time. -Gay Lesbian Straight Educatorâs Network&quot; (&quot;LGBT Bullying Statistics&quot;, 2008)).
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

According to the 2007 National School Climate survey, done by the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network, close to 90% of students that identify themselves as LGBT experienced harassment, based on their sexual orientation, in the last year. 31-32% of LGBT students reported missing class or a full day of school within a month of the survey because they felt unsafe at school. The students that reported being harassed had a lower grade average due to frquently missing class because of fear (Presgraves, 2008). 

Low grades and name-callin are not the worst problems that LGBT students must endure.
They are at a greater of suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. Gay and Lesbian youths are up to three times more likely to commit suiced than heterosexual students (&quot;LGBT Bullying Statistics&quot;, 2008; Munzo-Plaza, Quinn, &amp; Rounds  2002).

Depression and suicide often come from feelings of alienation. Homosexuality and other forms of sexual orientation that are not considered &quot;normal&quot; can be worse than other characteristics for which people are discriminated because unlike skin color, or some other physical characteristics, the student often does not share this preference with family members or all of their friends. This leads to a lack of emotional and mental support throughout their ordeals. When an individual reveals that they are LGBT, it can lead to the loss of important relationships with relatives, friends, and others in which they confide. The loss of these relationships along with the daily hardships, LGBT students are often overwhelmed (Ginsberg, 1998; &quot;Creating Safe Schools&quot;, 1997).

There are several ways educators can try to make LGBT students feel safer, and more accepted while they get their education.

== How to Help These Students ==

Linda and Laurel Lamme describe important steps to creating safer schools for LGBT students in their article &quot;Welcoming Children from Sexual Minoirty Families into Our Schools&quot; (2003). The authors explain the most important step is to ensure that educators are knowlegable about LGBT students and their lifestyles. An educator must feel comfortable around LGBT individuals, and others that are different from themselves, if they intend to effectively teach all different types of children (Lamme, 2003). 

The second step is to look closely at the school environment. The staff must discover ways to erase the negativity towards students. It is imperitive that schools specify sexual orientation in their nondiscrimination policies so bullies and abusers can be held responsible specifically for comments towards gender expression.

In the third step, the authors suggest that people of sexual minority be discussed when referring to history. Their achievements should be examined and praised. Finally, school staff should be aware of resources that may be helpful for LGBT students that may need support, and be able to help them find the support that will benefit them (Lamme, 2003). 


Some educators and parents believe the best way to counter the negativity towards LGBT sudents is to incorporate the lifestyle of homosexuals into the schools sex education. This is a controversial topic because on the United States, abstinence is the focus of sex educatio in public schools. Parents and politicians may argue that educating the students about the sexual lifestyles of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgendered individuals counter the attempt to promote abstinence. 


== Conclusion ==

LGBT students are in classrooms across the country. Their trials and tribulations may or may not be of personal interest to an educator, but it is the duty of the teacher and the school to provide a student with a safe enviornment in which to obtain their education. Steps should be taken to ensure this is avialable to all students regardless of physical, mental, or emotional differences.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


== My Opinion ==

As a future educator, I believe it is imperitive that the curriculumn include material that will teach racial, cultural, and sexual tolerance, beginning as early as possible. I think that homophobia, and other discrimination, stems from a lack of exposure to differences when children are young. If students go through school learning about and being exposed to people that are different them, for any reason, they are much more likely to feel comfortable around diversity as a young adult. Many parents are opposed to their children learning about homosexuality, so it can be difficult to incorporate these teachings without upsetting parents, but at least introducing the facts about homosexuality may create more understanding among students.

Educators should do everything in their power to create a safe enviornment for their students and should not tolerate any for of abuse among students. It is appalling to know that there are so many cases of verbal and physical attacks against LGBT students that are ifnored by schools and its employees. 

Gay/Straight Alliances seem to help improve understanding and reduce abuse. These clubs are a solution that is inexpensive, and easy.

&lt;big&gt;'''SAMPLE ASSESSMENT IN READING FOR GRADE 3'''&lt;/big&gt; 

Link to sample assessment http://www.mdk12.org/instruction/assessment/sample_grade3_reading.html  (Assessment Resources 2008)
This is an example of a grade 3 reading assessment.  There are selected response multiple choice questions and                brief constructed response samples.  There is also information on the question's scoring evaluation.  It summarizes score,  ojective of the question, what the answer should be, topic, and what type of assessment the question is.  This is a great example of an effective assessment.  This site has answers for any question that you may have with data analysis, user guides, instruction, and school improvement(Assessment Resources 2008). 
        

&lt;big&gt; '''WHERE DID GRADES COME FROM?'''&lt;/big&gt;

William Farish, a tutor at Cambridge University in England in 1792, came up with a method of teaching which would allow him to process more students in a shorter period of time. He invented grades (Hartmann, 2005). This grading system had originated earlier in the factories as a way of determining if the shoes made on the assembly line were &quot;up to grade.&quot;  It was used as a benchmark to determine if the workers should be paid and if the shoes could be sold (Hartmann, 2005).  This grading method increased the salary of William Farish, while at the same time, lessened his workload and reduced the hours he needed to spend in the classroom(Hartmann, 2005).  He no longer needed to burrow into his students' minds to know if they understood a topic, his grading system would do it for him. And, it would do it just as efficiently for twenty children as it would for two hundred.  Farish brought grades to the classroom, and the transformation was both sudden and startling.  Within a generation, the lecture-hall/classroom shifted from a place where one heard the occasional speech by a famous thinker to the place of ordinary daily instruction (Hartmann, 2005).




&lt;big&gt; '''HOW DO GRADES BENEFIT STUDENTS?''' &lt;/big&gt;

Grades benefit students in many ways.  Upon entering a new grade each year, teachers distribute their expectations and grading procedures to each student.  These guidelines let students know upfront what is expected of them academically and behaviorally.  Most teachers also post bad behavior consequences in their classrooms and how repeated offenses can effect their grades.  This information equipts the students with the knowledge to excel or to fail.  There is also an understood grading scale that is in place that remains the same from kindergarten through highschool.  Assessments of skill and learning are promoted through quizzes, tests, projects, and verbal communication.   



&lt;big&gt;'''HOW DO GRADES BENEFIT PARENTS?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Grades benefit parents because it gives them an opportunity to evaluate their children's behavior and performance at school.  This gives parents an opportunity to intervene if necessary to support their children and make sure that they are given every available resource if needed to succeed.  A child may have learning disabilities that need to be addressed or may need extra tutoring in a subject that doesn't come as easy to them as another.  Parent involvement is key to their child's success rate in school.  If a child does not get the proper support from home, they will have a very hard time excelling in their education.

&lt;big&gt;'''POINTS TO CONSIDER WHEN DEVELOPING A GRADING SCALE'''&lt;/big&gt;

1. What is the purpose for grades? (class rank, sorting, motivation)

2. What is the audience for the grades? (student, parents, colleges,employers)

3. What criteria are considered? (tests, projects, effort, attitude, homework)

4. What is the system used for grades on report cards? (letter, number, narrative)

5. How to define terminology of grading? ( an A = ?, 4.0 = ?)
6. How to communicate the system to stake holders? (conferences, meetings)

7. Is the grading system grounded in sound measurement principles? (research based)

8. Does the grading system provide valid measurement of student achievement?

9. Do the teachers need staff development on grading practices?

10. What does the grade a student receives on the report card really indicate?

(Guskey, 16)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;big&gt;'''DIFFERENT WAYS OF GRADING'''&lt;/big&gt;

Letter grades are a simple indication of learning progress (Frisbie &amp; Waltman, 35).  Their use requires abstracting a great deal of information into a single symbol.  The more detailed methods also have their drawbacks.  Narratives and checklists of learning outcomes offer specific information for documenting progress, but good narratives take time to prepare, and comments become standardized. Regardless of the method used, grading and reporting remain inherently subjective.  The more detailed the reporting method and more analytic the process, the more likely subjectivity will influence the results (Frisbie &amp; Waltman, 35).  This principle is critical to an understanding of all grading methods because many teachers, parents, and students believe that more complicated methods are more objective than less complicated methods (40).  A simple checklist describing what the student knows and is able to do is inherently more objective than a score on a standard test arrived at through a complicated method (11).  Teachers often report that grades determined from their own performance testing are not as objective as grades determined from commercial tests.  This assumption continues to be debated.  The teacherâs determination of a studentâs grade from teacher-made tests and performance checklists based on the curriculum are more reliable (11).



&lt;big&gt;'''NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF GRADING'''&lt;/big&gt;

Many researchers, educators and parents are now questioning the purpose and effectiveness of grades. Certainly parents deserve to know how their children are doing in school, and students benefit from understanding how they are performing, but how that progress is communicated can have a great impact on how a child learns (Kohn, 1999).  Alfie Kohn, author of The Schools Our Children Deserve: Moving Beyond Traditional Classrooms and âTougher Standardsâ and Punished by Rewards, writes extensively about the influence of grades on learning. The research suggests three consistent effects of giving students grades or leading them to focus on what grade theyâll get (Kohn, 1999).  First, their interest in the learning itself is diminished.  Second, they come to prefer easier tasks, not because theyâre lazy, but because theyâre rational.  After all, if the point is to get an A, your odds are better if you avoid taking intellectual risks.  Third, students tend to think in a more superficial fashion and to forget what they learned more quickly when grades are involved (Kohn, 2000).  To put it positively, students who are lucky enough to be in schools or classrooms where they donât get letter or number grades are more likely to want to continue exploring whatever theyâre learning, more likely to want to challenge themselves, and more likely to think deeply. The evidence on all of these effects is very clear, and it seems to apply to students of all ages (Kohn, 2000).


&lt;big&gt;'''ALTERNATIVE GRADING SYSTEM'''&lt;/big&gt;

Just as you donât need tests to learn how well each student is doing, you donât need grades to communicate an evaluation back to the students and their parents (Kohn, 1999). You can use narrative reports, such as qualitative summaries of progress in written form, or, you can have conferences with students and their parents to discuss how things are going (Kohn, 2000).  Many schools have abolished grades entirely, and these tend to be places where students are far more engaged with what theyâre learning.  Some high schools have done this, and their students donât appear to be at any disadvantage when it comes to college admission.  We all know that changing the education system is a long process (Kohn, 2000).  While this issue of grades plays out, what can teachers do to minimize the potentially negative impact that grades have?  Here are two concrete things teachers can do. First, even if theyâre forced to give students a grade at the end of the term, they should avoid putting a number or letter on individual assignments.  This helps to make grades as invisible as possible for as long as possible and therefore minimizes the harm they do when students are thinking about them.  Second, teachers can help neutralize the destructive effects of grades and support studentsâ autonomy at the time same by allowing students to participate in deciding what grade theyâll get at the end (Kohn, 2000).

&lt;font size=&quot;8&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''The ABC's of Grading'''&lt;/font&gt;



&lt;font size=&quot;6&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''by Leanna James'''&lt;/font&gt;









==&lt;font size=&quot;11&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt;==
 

&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;Having attended school for all my life, I have not come across one person who has not either been intimidated or anxious about grades. Grades almost define who you are according to college boards and the business world.  Grades are somewhat similar to a caste system in that it predetermines who you will be professionally, sometimes even socially.  Whichever way you may look at it, grades are essential in progressing to the next level. Thus the importance of grades and the purpose in which they exist must be understood by teachers and students.&lt;/font&gt;


[[File:Idontknow.gif|75px]]&lt;font size=&quot;11&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''Purpose of Grades'''&lt;/font&gt;[[File:Idontknow.gif|75px]]


&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;Grades in the most basic context can simply be seen as a measure of what one knows. More specifically, grades are a âmark for the quality of work and/or level in scale of progression (2007).â The purposes of grades are manifold.  According to a research study found by Robert Manzano grades are âprimarily used for '''(1)''' administrative purposes, '''(2)''' to give students feedback about their progress and achievement, '''(3)''' to provide guidance to students about future course work, '''(4)''' to provide guidance to teachers for instructional planning, and '''(5)''' to motivate students (2000).â&lt;/font&gt;





&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''1) Administrative Purpose'''&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;Grades primarily used for administrative purposes reiterate the point that oneâs educational career can predetermine the professional career in oneâs future due to the fact that grades serve the purpose of the following as outlined in Manzanoâs research:

â¢âStudent matriculation and retention

â¢Placement when students transfer from one school to another

â¢Student entrance into collegeâ (2000)


[[File:Euro exchange rate to RUB.svg|75px]]A survey conducted by The College Board in 1998 reported 81% of schools use grades for Administrative Purposes. (2000) 


[[File:Cornflower blue check.svg|75px]]Pros : Encourages competition amongst students academcially 


[[File:EtruscanX-01.svg|75px]]Cons : Neglects students strengths and talents &lt;/font&gt;



&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''2) Feedback '''&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;From the perception of students, it is understood that grades are primarily used for feedback concerning the progress and achievement of themselves. Students are expected to learn material, and grades are meant to be evidence of the progress or achievability of studentsâ understanding of material - in this particular translation of grading.  According to Susan Brookhart in her article âFeedback that Fitsâ, âeffective feedback focuses on describing the studentâs work commenting on the process the student used to do the work, and makes specific suggestions for what to do nextâ  
It is evident through this type of translation of grades that grades come in forms other than numerically or alphabetically. 



[[File:Euro exchange rate to RUB.svg|75px]]Manzanoâs research indicated from a study by Austin and McCann, âthat 25 percent of school board documents, 45 percent of district documents, and 65 percent of teacher documents mentioned reporting student achievement as a basic purpose of grades (2000).â



[[File:Cornflower blue check.svg|75px]]Pros: Describes student's work in detail (both for good and bad); &quot;describes where student is in relation to the learning goal (Brookhart2007&amp;2008)&quot;;  

[[File:EtruscanX-01.svg|75px]]Cons: The feedback itself maybe ineffective thus costing the student to misinterpret feedback as criticism or judging; &lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''3) Guidance'''&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;âWhen used for guidance purposes, grades help counselors provide direction for students.  Specifically, counselors use grades to recommend to individual student courses they should or should not take and schools and occupations they might consider (2000)â Again, this is a reflection of how grades can predetermine the professional path a student can or cannot take. 

[[File:Euro exchange rate to RUB.svg|75px]]Manzaonâs research again indicated from Austin and McCann âthat 82 percent of school board documents, 40 percent of district documents, and 38 percent of teacher documents identified guidance as an important purpose of grades (2000).â

[[File:Cornflower blue check.svg|75px]]Pros: Much more easier and more organized to route student's to careers and/or schools that may compliment and/or complicate student's grades 

[[File:EtruscanX-01.svg|75px]]Cons: May misinform or mislead student's in a schhol/profession that may not be where student feels best comfortable or equipped ; Possible bias &lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''4) Instructional Strategies'''&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;As teachers we are obviously going to have to assess our students; however, assessment isnât just for the purpose of maintaining the progress of students but to also benefit teachers in their teaching strategies and methods. âThroughout the day, students produce work (journals, responses to questions, graphic organizers, and verbal responses) that is an indicator of their understanding. These formative assessments provide a much more accurate measure of how students are progressingâ¦ A formative coach guides teachers in using student work to determine the course of instruction, curriculum, and their own professional development (Niddus and Sadder 2009).â

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;85%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;
border: solid 5px #FF9900; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Niddus and Sadderâs example of dialouge a teacher may have with a formative coach to anazlye studentsâ work for the intructional refelction:[http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational_leadership/feb09/vol66/num05/Learning_from_Student_Work.aspx.shtml Instructional Strategies Example Dialouge]&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This example excellently exemplifies the appropriate interaction between teachers and guided help.

[[File:Euro exchange rate to RUB.svg|75px]]â44 percent of school board documents, 20 percent of district documents, and 10 percent of teacher documents emphasized this purpose researched by Manzon. (2000) 

[[File:Cornflower blue check.svg|75px]]Pros: 

[[File:EtruscanX-01.svg|75px]]Cons: &lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''5) Motivation'''&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;The theory that good grades promote consistent success and bad grades encourage students to do better until success is reached is frowned upon yet is evident in some US schools. 

[[File:Euro exchange rate to RUB.svg|75px]]According to Manzon, â7 percent of school board documents, 15 percent of district-level documents, and 10 percent of teacher documents emphasized motivation as a purpose for grades (2000).â


[[File:Cornflower blue check.svg|75px]]Pros: 

[[File:EtruscanX-01.svg|75px]]Cons: Theory has not been proven accurate &lt;/font&gt;

==&lt;font size=&quot;11&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''Why even give grades?'''&lt;/font&gt;==


&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;As you can see above there are many purposes of grading. All of these aspects of grading are essential to teachers. To reiterate the two main reasons why grading or assessments are done are because of accountability and improvement of teaching and learning. 



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;30%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;
border: solid 5px #00CC00; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

â1)Accountability : to determine if students have met benchmarks, to assign grades, to promote, to determine teachers, schools, programs, and school districts are effective. 

2)To improve teaching and learning: To help teachers tailor their instruction to studentâs needs, to help students understand their own strengths and weaknesses.â(Kidd 2009)&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

On the other end of the spectrum, some believe grading isn't a true measure of what one has learned. Grades are given once tests are administered, then afterwords out the window the information goes! 

âGrading and learning just donât go togetherâ â SCampus 1972-73


























==&lt;font size=&quot;11&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''If So... What kind?'''&lt;/font&gt;==


&lt;font face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;Assesments again are used for accountability and improve teaching and learning, yet what matters is not the style or format of the assessment, but how the results are used! (Kidd 2009)&lt;/font&gt;

1.Summative: after learning has taken place 

2.Formative : while learning is still going on 


&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''Styles / Formats of Tests'''&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Handwriting&quot;&gt;'''1. Norm referenced tests'''&lt;/font&gt;  - Student scores are determined by comparing a performance to an established norm ( a group of students with established  characteristics who have taken the test)

== &lt;Center&gt;'''Helping Students Set Goals and Monitor their own Learning'''==



'''by Elizabeth (Betsy) Donoghue'''

'''Edono002'''&lt;/Center&gt;


==='''Learning Targets'''===
The reader will be able to explain the benefits for students who set goals and monitor their learning.

The reader will be able to list strategies to help students set goals and monitor their learning.



=='''Introduction'''==

Itâs a teacherâs dream:  curious students, motivated to learn, are each reveling in their own progress.  Rewind to a common scene where students are daydreaming, heads on desks, while a teacher is expounding on the importance of knowing the dates of Civil War battles.  How can a teacher avoid inactive students and create a dream classroom with students involved in their learning?  This article will describe ways to involve students in setting their own learning goals and monitoring their own progress.

=='''The Active Learner'''==

Rick Stiggins and Jan Chappuis (2005) from the Assessment Training Institute in Portland, Oregon, have emphasized the importance of involving students in setting their own learning goals and monitoring their own progress.  âWhen [students] are involved in collecting evidence of their achievement, charting their growth, and setting goals for future learning, students develop insight into themselves as learners.  In addition, both the achievement and their commitment to learning increaseâ  (Stiggens &amp; Chappuis, 2004, in Condition #4 section).

In order to begin to set personal learning goals, Chappuis  suggests having students ask themselves, âWhere am I going?  Where am I now?  and  How can I close the gap?â  (Chappuis, 2005, p39).   Chappuis (2005) suggests seven strategies to help teachers create assessments that help students learn:

*1.	&quot;Provide a clear and understandable vision of the learning target.

*2.	Use examples of strong and weak work.

*3.	Offer regular descriptive feedback.

*4.	Teach students to self-assess and set goals.

*5.	Design lessons to focus on one aspect or quality at a time.

*6.	Teach students focused revision.

*7.	Engage students in self-reflection and let them document and share their learning.&quot;

(Chappuis, 2005, pp. 40 â 42)

=='''Setting Goals'''==

Having students set their own goals is easier said than done.  In fact, many students find it difficult to set their own goals.  McDevitt  ''et al.'' (2008) found that middle school students wanted help setting goals that were not too easy and not too challenging.   Schleomer and Brenan (2006) also found that college professors needed to guide college freshmen in setting goals that contained the right amount of challenge.  

Rather than assume that students know how to set goals, Rader (2005) suggested that schools teach students exactly how to set goals.  âSchools are labeling record numbers of students as attention deficit disordered (ADD), because those students are unable to focus, and yet the schools spend virtually no time teaching those students how to focus.  Because goal setting is a crucial skill for success, it needs to be introducedâ (Rader, 2005, p. 123).  



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 3px #FF0000; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''&quot;Goal Setting for Students and Teachers:
'''Six Steps to Success&quot;'''

*1.	&quot;Choose a specific goal and write it down.

*2.	Decide a time when your goal will be achieved.

*3.	Develop a plan to achieve your goal.

*4.	Visualize yourself accomplishing your goal.

*5.	Work hard and never give up.

*6.	Self-evaluate.&quot;

(Rader, 2005, pp. 124 â 125)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



==Tips and Ideas for Goal Setting and Self-Monitoring==        

Here are a few ideas which may help teachers guide students in setting goals and monitoring their learning:

*â¢	Give the students a list of the schoolâs established learning targets, so each can choose one as his or her own current goal. (Schloemer, 2006)

*â¢	Use a traffic light concept to let students indicate how much help they need.  Green = Iâm going along fine â¦ Yellow = Iâm a little confused â¦   Red = Iâm stuck.  (Chappuis, 2005).

*â¢	Have the students list their strengths and what they need further work on before they turn in an assignment, so that they will be monitoring their own learning (Chappuis, 2005).

*â¢	Well before a test, have students list what they will be tested on, what they know well already, what they still feel uncertain about, and a plan for preparing for the test (Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2005).

*â¢	Have students set a classroom goal, such as reading a certain number of books per month,  and monitor it, in order to demonstrate goal setting (Rader, 2005).



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 3px #FF0000; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;

'''Making Math a Winning Event'''

''âGail is a 5th grader who gets her math test back with â60%â marked at the top.  So her losing streak continues, she thinks.  Sheâs ready to give up on ever connecting with math.''

''â¦ But then her teacher distributes another paper â a worksheet the students will use to learn from their performance on the math test.  â¦ Column one lists the 20 test items by number.  Column tow lists what math proficiency each item tested.  The teacher calls the classâs attention to the next two columns:  Right and Wrong.  She asks the student to fill in those columns with checks for each item to indicate their performance on the test.  Gail checks 12 right and 8 wrong.''   

''The teacher then asks the students to evaluate â¦ if they made a simple mistake â¦ or  if they really donât understand what went wrong.  Gail discovers that four of her eight incorrect answers were caused by careless mistakes that she knows how to fix.  But four were math problems she really doesnât understand how to solve.''

''Gail discovers that all of her wrong answers that reflect a true lack of understanding arise from the same gap in her problem-solving ability: subtracting 3-digit numbers with regrouping.''

''The teacher then provides differentiated instruction to the groups focused on their conceptual misunderstandings.  Together the class also plans strategies that everyone can use to avoid simple mistakes.''  

''When that work is complete, the teacher gives students a second form of the same math test.  When Gail gets the test back with a grade of 100%, she jumps from her seat with arms held high. Her winning streak beginsâ''

(Stiggins, 2007, âScenario 2â  from Stiggins, Arter, Chappuis, &amp; Chappuis, 2004).
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



=='''Explanation'''==

In this scenario, Gail initially received only a letter grade as feedback for her test.  However, the teacher has Gail evaluate her performance on the test, and categorize the type of math concepts she understands well and those she needs more help with.  She then sets a goal based on the results of this test, and determines the concept she needs more help with and also that she needs to beware of careless errors.  Focused teaching then helps Gail to get the extra instruction she needs.  On the next test, Gail shows that she has met her learning goals.   

=='''Evaluation'''==

Gailâs experience with math testing and instruction is a good example of helping students to set goals and monitor their own learning.  The teacher has guided her to evaluate her test so she knows which skills she has mastered and which she still needs work on. She has set a goal for learning a math concept based on this evaluation, and she has focused her learning, with the teacherâs guidance, on her weak areas.  The second test allows for a new assessment of skills.  Hopefully, as the year goes on, Gail will be able to evaluate her performance with less guidance from the teacher and will continue to set goals on her own.  

To improve this scenario, the teacher could include a chart of some kind to help Gail monitor her learning over time.  In addition, starting the year out with Raderâs (2005) goal setting skills training would help the students understand the process of goal setting more completely.

=='''Conclusion'''==

By including goal setting and self-monitoring in the daily classroom routine, a teacher can create a learning environment that increases student involvement and motivation. (Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2005)  It is interesting to note that throughout this process, students continue to set new goals frequently as they monitor their own learning.  Teachers and administrators need to be familiarized with student goal setting and self-monitoring so that they can use it and intentionally teach it to their students  (Stiggins, 2007).  Once students begin to use this method, they will become more in charge of their own learning.

== &lt;big&gt;Setting Goals in the Classroom&lt;/big&gt; ==

by Natalie Varnell ''a very wise girl''



&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#f535aa&quot; face=&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


Readers will be able to develop an effective goal by understanding the important components of goal making as a process.

Readers will be able to identify strategies in which enable students or individuals to visualize their goal.

Readers will know that self-confidence and the power to actually believe in personal achievement is critical in any goal.

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Segoe Script &quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;  âWithout goals, and plans to reach them, you are like a ship that has set sail with no destination.â ~ Fitzhugh Dodson (Goal Setting Guide 2008)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#f535aa&quot; face=&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


Success does not happen randomly, but ultimately it is the result of a goal that has been achieved.  Goals are arguably the most important step in obtaining success.  There are thousands upon thousands of books that are written on creating and achieving goals, and thatâs not including all the self-help diet books which are essentially the same concept except the goal is specified.   It is no secret that the âsecret of successâ is envisioning a goal, and then developing a plan to achieve it.  As educators it is important to set goals not only for our class as a whole but also for students on an individual level.  Furthermore, it is important to guide and allow students in creating their own goals and aspirations.



If goals have been known and accepted to stimulate success, then why are so many people unsuccessful?   Every January people make a New Yearâs Resolution, but statistically 97% of all New Yearâs Resolutions are never achieved (York 2005).   Although making the goal is important, there are ways to move beyond the idea of the goal and into making progress towards the goal.  Michael York author of Uncommon Goals and motivational speaker states,

âEffective goals are more than just thinking or stating a âwishâ out loud but actually taking a pen and paper and beginning the process.  Promoting his case that success in any endeavor has substantial evidence that it is a PROCESS.  The getting from point A to point B.â (York 2005)



&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#f535aa&quot; face=&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;&gt;'''Commit to Paper'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


He argues that the goal needs to be physically written down to make it concrete (York 2005).  The same principle applies to classroom goals.  All goals within the class should be written down in some form or another.  One activity that a teacher could conduct in her classroom that would implement physically writing down the goals is splitting the class into groups with the objective of creating motivational posters to serve as physical reminders of what their classroom goals are.  The posters could have a catchy slogan or just a picture of the goal being accomplished.


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#f535aa&quot; face=&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;&gt;'''Tailor Made'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


Another important component in developing effective goals is to make the goal personal and specific (Synder 2003 pp389).  All too often teachers focus on overall goals for the class and neglect helping students develop their own specific individual goals.   Goals are more effective if they are what YOU desire and tailored to YOUR needs(Synder 2003 pp389).  Teachers should help guide students in figuring out exactly what they wish to accomplish in the class.  The first step in determining what goals to pursue, is one must have an understanding of his own strengths and weaknesses(Synder 2003 pp 389).  One way to help students assess their areas of improvement is to have them fill out a KWL chart.  A KWL chart is a chart that consists of three columns.  The first column is titled âKâ which is in reference to âwhat I knowâ.  The second column is âWâ in reference to âwhat I want to learnâ and the final column âLâ is a reflection column for âwhat I have learned.â  This chart is very simple and is typically used on a specific subject contents such as math and reading.  For bigger and broader goals, self-assessment would be better in a different format.  Teachers could easily develop their own assessment sheets to give students with questions that would invoke reflection on areas in need of improvement.



&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#f535aa&quot; face=&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;&gt;'''Break It Down'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;



After goals have been set in place it is important that students follow through with steps to work towards the goal.  Most often students set long-term goals which can be overwhelming without breaking the goal down into smaller sub goals(Inspiring Teachers 2009).  For example, a popular goal students often set is to make the honor roll.  The goal becomes much more attainable when broken down into smaller goals such as improving one whole letter grade on the next Science test, or getting a perfect score on the next reading quiz.  Students are able to focus better when big goals are broken down and they receive more motivation towards the big goal with each success of the mini-goals.  Teachers could also facilitate visual tools such as âGoal Laddersâ and Calendars to help demonstrate the steps necessary for the goal (Inspiring Teachers 2009).  A goal ladder is a picture of a ladder with the goal written at top and at each âStepâ of the ladder a mini-goal is written.  Each time a mini-goal is achieved the student will then color in a step in the ladder.  This is an excellent way to teach goals as a process, and to help students see their success.


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#f535aa&quot; face=&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;&gt;'''Careful Goal Development'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;



Another common mistake teacherâs make when setting goals for students is focusing primarily on grades (Inspiring Teachers 2009).  It is important to set the majority of goals outside receiving an âAâ on the next test.  When goals are centered on grades, students become fixated on their grades and not what they are learning (Inspiring Teachers 2009).  Students will begin to scrutinize and compare grades with their peers which may not be beneficial to either student.  For example, a teacher promises a pizza party to her class if no one fails their Algebra test then if one student did fail he would be open to negative criticism from the other passing classmates, or he might experience unnecessary guilt and low self-esteem afterwards.   It can also cause test taking anxieties (Synder 2003 pp 390).  A better goal for the same class would be a pizza party would be rewarded if every student made improvements with the next test.  This goal allows students to individually improve from their last test which is not a specific grade requirement, but more a general improvement requirement.  This goal is more equally challenging for every student while also being equally attainable.  An example of a goal that is completely non-grade oriented would be a studentâs goal to read five books a month, or be chosen to represent the school in a spelling bee.


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#f535aa&quot; face=&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;&gt;'''Got to Have Faith&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;



Aside from actually deciding upon the goal, it is absolutely most important that students believe they can achieve their goals.  Neither a goal nor its plan is anything without the faith in oneself to achieve it(Addison 2009).  Teachers need to help students realize their potential and foster positive self-esteem.  It is also critical that a teacher instills the perseverance in their students when they fall short of their goal.  Students need to understand that it is âokâ if they didnât make their goal and to continue to try.  


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #00ffff;border: solid 5px #f535aa; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Segoe Script &quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;  âThe tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal.  The tragedy lies in having no goals to reach&quot; ~ Benjamin Mays (Goal Setting Guide 2008)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#f535aa&quot; face=&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;&gt;'''In Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;



Setting goals is important for success both inside and outside the classroom.  Teachers need to help students develop their own individual goals which are tailored to their specific interests and needs.  Classroom goals should be agreed upon by both the teacher and students.  The teacher should help the student break their goals down into smaller sub goals and then develop an action plan to get there.  It is also helpful if students write down their goals as well as keeping track of their progress on paper to better visualize the goal.  The ultimate goal is learning and growth, not a grade.  Goals require self-belief which teachers should model and encourage.  People who set goals, make a plan, and believe they can achieve always succeed.  Teaching students to develop goals, is a skill they will benefit from their entire life.

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF3399&quot; face=&quot;Century&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;For many years, teachers spend ample amounts of time testing students and trying to come up with creative ways to test students other than the basic pencil and paper test. Teachers need to find creative ways to get students involved especially the younger children in the lower elementary age because they might not have the attention span of an older child who can with stand many pencil and paper tests. A good way to get students involved in the assessment process is by switching from the basic tests and start using performance based assessments.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

A performance based assessment is testing that requires students to create answers based on their knowledge and skills (Sweet, 1933, (&quot;''What Should''&quot;). 

Performance assessments include problem solving and answering questions in a written response form. It also allows students to work together in groups and get a sense of team work (&quot;''What Should''&quot;). 

Performance based assessments are great for young children in elementary schools because they include things such as dioramas, posters, and other things that give the children a chance to have a little bit of fun with their subjects as well as allowing them to show their creative sides. When children have fun with their assessments and subjects, it allows them to enjoy what they are learning and shows them that school and learning can be fun.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0066&quot; face=&quot;Century&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Other types of performance assessments:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#CC0066&quot; face=&quot;Occidental&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;What are the advantages and disadvantages to performance based assessments?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;




&lt;font color=&quot;#00CC00&quot; face=&quot;Century&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Advantages:'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF9900&quot; face=&quot;Century&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;There are many advantages to performance based testing not only to students but to teachers as well. Performance based assessments allow teachers to pin point their students weaknesses and strengths which gives them insight into what they did a good job of covering as well as what material may need to be recovered and possibly in a different way to get the students to understand better (&quot;''What Should''&quot;). 

Another advantage to teachers and other school officials is that these performance assessments give them the opportunity to see what skills and knowledge the children have gained and which skills they want to be taught to the kids and which areas can be bypassed (&quot;''What Should''&quot;). The biggest advantage to the school and it's officials would be that it doesn't cost the school any money.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;




&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot; face=&quot;Century&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Disadvantages:'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#66CC00&quot; face=&quot;Century&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Some disadvantages of performance based tests that are given to our children can include limitations to the teacher such as teaching specifically to the test and not allowing the students to learn outside of the test material as well as limiting the value of the test (&quot;''What Should''&quot;). A big desadvantage to the teachers is that the test can &quot;cost&quot; them time due to the preparation and planning involved with the assessments and would take away time from other lessons (Sweet, 1933). 

Performance tests can be completely new to the students because they are so used to the traditional pencil and paper tests that they need to be prepared for the new types of assignments and the new ways of being graded. 

Another disadvantage can be found in the structure of the test. The performance based assessments usually donât contain as many questions and the answers to the questions donât have right or wrong answers the majority of them are subjective (&quot;''What Should''&quot;). 


Itâs good because it allows the children to show what they have learned and how they interpreted the material that was presented to them however; since itâs subjective, it presents the problem to the teacher as to how the assignment will be graded.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 







&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF6600&quot; face=&quot;Occidental&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Example along with an explanation'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF3333&quot; face=&quot;Century&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;When searching online I found a great example of a performance based assessment. I found a sight that has several worksheets that teachers can use for lessons. One of the worksheets I found is a math lesson called &quot;Answer Me, Color Me!.&quot; This worksheets works in the teachers favor because not only is it a math lesson itâs also a color recognition lesson. 

The worksheet is of a worm and in each of its sections is a math problem that the student must solve. Upon solving the math problem, the student must match the answer with the color given and color that segment of the worm. Each segment will end up a different color once all problems are solved the students will end up with a colorful worm. 

This is a wonderful example to use with the young students in order for them to be involved in the learning process; they have two lessons in one, its fun and keeps the children involved while having fun with the assignment.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#33CC99&quot; face=&quot;Century&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Many teachers today struggle with assessments and every day assignments in the attempt to teach their lesson but at the same time make it fun and intriguing for the students so that they can be involved in the processes as well has have fun.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;Readers should be able to identify the differences between a formative assessment and a summative assessment.

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;Readers should be able to discuss the effects of different techniques of formative assessment used for assessing middle school students in a diverse environment.

----

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;When most people hear of assessments, the first kind of exams they would think of is those that will test a studentâs knowledge of a subject. However, that is not always the case. Assessments are used not only to test oneâs knowledge of a subject, but to track how far along a student is, how far they need to go, and how to get to their optimal destination. In this article one will identify different assessment types and different assessment techniques used for children at the middle school or upper elementary level.

----

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Summative vs. Formative Assessments'''&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;There are two major types of assessments, summative and formative. According to &lt;u&gt;Creating Literacy Instruction for All Students&lt;/u&gt;, âSummative assessment summarizes students' progress at the end of a unit or a semester or at some other point in timeâ.  Statewide exams such as the SOLs are considered summative exams because it assesses the studentâs knowledge and occurs after the student has learned the required materials. This kind of exam is used for accountability purposes. This holds the student, teacher, and even the state accountable for progress of the student. An example of a summative exam can be found here http://www.virginiasol.com/test/1861.htm. 

Formative is the other type of assessment. Formative assessments occur while learning is still going on. According to &lt;u&gt;Creating Literacy Instruction for All Students&lt;/u&gt;, âFormative assessments can be powerful and is especially helpful for struggling learners.â This kind of exam helps the student and teacher prepare for summative exams. Examples of formative exams include, practice quizzes, essays, and rough drafts. This allows the student and teacher to track progress and to correct mistakes. One major difference between summative and formative assessments is the notion of feedback. Feedback, which is very vital for formative assessments, is very important concerning student growth. This is very important because, it allows the student to become more aware of where they are, how far they need to go and what it takes to get there.

&lt;big&gt;'''The increased diversity in the nation's classroom has prompted much attention to the challenges associated with educating multicultural, multilingual student population

- D. Darling and H. Hodges'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
 


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;As the country becomes more diverse, the types and the deliverance of assessments have become very important for instructors, especially at the middle school level. The teacher would not only have to focus on how to deliver the lesson to English speaking students from similar backgrounds, but also to those who do not speak English from very different backgrounds as well. 

Barbara Allison and Marsha Rehm, both conducted a study within the Florida school system to determine what kinds of assessments are highly effective in diverse middle school classrooms. The state of Florida was chosen as the model for diversity within the school system because, 50% of students within the school system are members of an ethnic minority group(http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/36/29/23.pdf) According to the study, visuals, cooperative learning, and peer tutoring were considered highly effective methods of formative assessments for the Floridian teachers. Visuals are considered highly effective because it is a âuniversal languageâ regardless of background or language. Anyone can understand what an apple looks like or what numbers can entail. This is a perfect example of how formative assessment is universal for all students regardless of background.

According to Saravia-Shore and Garcia, Snowman and Bieler, the peer tutoring strategy within a diverse setting is âvery effective when two students from different backgrounds are paired togetherâ . This and the cooperative learning strategy are very effective because the students have to depend on each other to get ahead. This will entail the students to understand their differences and for non English speaking learners, to break the language barrier.

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Lucida Sans&quot;&gt;Formative Assessment techniques are very important within the classroom. As the country becomes more diverse, these kinds of assessments have accommodate every student in the classroom regardless of background or English level capacity.

&lt;font face = &quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;
== LEARNING TARGETS ==
*Students will learn some strategies to deal with missing work
*Students will learn how a zero can affect a student's grade


== MISSING WORK ==

There are a variety of reasons for students to miss assignments, ranging from being absent due to illness or being a member of a sports team that has an away event to just not wanting to do the work. 

As a teacher, how do handle the missing work? What options do you have? You want your students  to pass your class and learn something. Given the option of writing a zero in your gradebook or allowing the student to make up the work, which do you prefer? 

Schools and teachers around the country are coming up with so very innovative ways to cancel the zeros and encourage students. They are realizing the effect that a zero will have on a student's grade and the impact that will have on their learning.

== THE ZAP OPTION ==

Danna Garland, principal at Glenpool Middle School, Glenpool, OK has instituted ZAP (Zeros Aren't Permitted) as a way to counteract students who were failing classes not because they didn't understand the work, but because they chose not to do it (Bafile, 2008). The ZAP program requires students to complete assignments during lunch periods. Since beginning ZAP the &quot;ineligble list&quot; has shrunk from 100 students to 50 students. Garland told Education World, &quot;students attitudes are changing. They are beginning to understand that it is a priority to do the assignments and do them with quality.

The program doesn't ensure passing grades, but it does emphasize being accountable. The students are required to work to the best of their abilities insuring that they will get some credit for each assignment. During the ZAP periods books are provided, as well as one-on-one assistance. Ms. Garland even helps supervise during the periods. 

The program has also increased parent contact. If a student doe not complete work during lunch ZAP the school contacts a parent to schedule time before or after school when the student can complete the work. 


== WORKING LUNCH ==

Another solution to the zero issue was inspired by a conversation that Bill Ferriter, a sixth grade teacher at Salem Middle School in Apex, NC, had with a colleague. The colleague wanted to fail one of her students for the whole year because of his horrible grades in her class, the problem was that his scores on the end-of-grade exams placed him in the top 20% of sixth grade students(Bafile). Ferriter felt that this teacher's desire wasn't so much to identify if the student had mastered the content, but to punish him for not doing the work.

Ferriter realized that grades on a report card are incredibly subjective and dependent on an individual teacher's approach to late work. He worked out a grading system that would be accurately reflective of a student's work behaviors and academic ability. Every child in his class is required to turn in every assignment. When as assignment is not turned in on time, the student must finish it instead of going outside to recess. This is referrd to a &quot;working lunch.&quot;

The number of missing assignments in his clss decreases quickly over the school year. Students learn that missing work means losing recess, a hard thing for a young adolescent. Ferriter sees his kids taking a positive attitude toward completing missing tasks, and starting to take pride in having good grades for the first time. 

Parents are cautious about his grading policies, but they come to appreciate the system because it gives them accurate feedback about their children's strengths and weaknesses. They don't have to guess what a ''D'' means. They can look at the work records and to find out what behaviors are influencing the grades and exert positive parental pressure to encourage the kids to improve (Bafile).


== IMPACT ON GRADES ==

The impact of a zero on a student's grade is disproportionate. A zero can bring a ''B'' average down to failing. The impact on the student is even worse. There may be things going on at home that interfere with a student doing homework, the student could be bored in the class or they could not understand the work and be afraid to ask for help. Until a teacher starts to look at grades in a different way, they will never know.

border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;Grades are evaluations of learning. A zero, given for missing or late work, does not represent an evaluation of learning. Therefore, that zero is not a grade.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


== TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ==

!. What is one common effect of ZAP and &quot;Working Lunch&quot;?
*A) Passing grades
*B) Increased parental involvement
*C) Students don't turn in work so they have to attend
*D) More work for teachers

2. Bill Ferriter started &quot;Working Lunch&quot; because
*A) he wanted more work for himself
*B) his students were failing
*C) he felt that letter grades didn't accurately reflect a student's performance
*D) he wanted to punish students for missing work

3. You have a student who consistently misses class and doesn't turn in work, what do you do?
*A) Refer them to guiidance
*B) Talk to the student and find out what is going on
*C) Be the &quot;cool&quot; teacher and allow them extra chances to make up work and hope the problem solves itself
*D) Give them a zero, they're not doing the work, so they should fail.

4. You have a student who gets perfect scores on the SOls, but fails to turn in or do homework or written assignments, what can you do?
*A) Fail them, they obviously don't understand the subject
*B) Talk to the student and find out if there is anything going on at home that can impact their work
*C) Have them tested for a learning disability
*D) Engage them during class, their learning style may not be compatible with written work

'''By Sarah Rooks'''




== '''Learning Targets''' ==


'''Readers should be able toâ¦'''

â¢	Understand the effect zeros have on studentsâ grades

â¢	Identify alternatives to zeros in the grade book

â¢	Gain knowledge of about four mainstream theories to use when a student is missing assignments




== '''Introduction''' ==



The deadline for progress reports for the new school year is approaching, and almost everything is perfect. This afternoon, a few days before grades are due, the teacher even has the entire planning time to go over the grade book. Reviewing the low or failing grades, he is in a state of disbelief and begins to wonder if there are some grades he misplaced or forgot to enter. After some searching and a moment of reflection, he shakes his head and demands of the classroom of empty desks their missing assignments. Another moment passes and he sarcastically sighs, âI would have received a similar response from students.â What does he do now?


Zeros and missing assignments: they happen to the best, worst, novice, and veteran teachers alike. Doing background research online, I encountered blog after blog devoted to the issue. Does this not speak volumes of the frustration that teachers experience when they open their grade books? Four theories of development were researched to provide intervention techniques to help teachers find causes, as well as solutions, among students who do not turn in assignments. There are groups who support reforming the grading scale to remove zeros completely. Other groups of teachers believe that students earn zeros for overdue assignments and homework. In addition, many teachers are adjusting their degree of flexibility- or rigidness- of accepting late work depending upon the type of assignment. While a variety of methods, theories, and opinions exist on zeros and missing assignments, their common goal is to improve studentsâ grades via ethical means.




== '''Four Theories of Development''' ==


How should a teacher get a student to stop missing assignments? Dr. Isabel Killoran explains behaviorism, constructivism, maturational theory, and ecological theory, and how they can help teachers answer that question. The author does state that there are other theories of development and that every individual will have his or her own opinion as to the best theory for the situation. The chart provides a clear overview of her article.


Behaviorism indicates that peopleâs behavior can be either positively or negatively reinforced. The article demonstrates both reinforcers in the following example: ââ¦Letâs assume that every time [the student] comes to school without her homework done she has to stay in for recess with you. She may enjoy being with you, which would make this positive reinforcement. On the other hand, she may also be trying to avoid something outside, such as bullies. â¦[K]eeping her in would be negative reinforcement because you would be removing a situation she wants goneâ¦. If this is what she wants she will continue not doing her homework.â (Killoran, page 2004). The teacher would need to determine what the student likes or dislikes, and then apply either positive or negative reinforcement.


With an approach through constructivism, the teacher first needs to determine which developmental stage the student is in. When that is known, the teacher needs to select work appropriate for the developmental stage. If the issue of missing assignments is only happening repeatedly among that one student, then this approach can be considered. If the entire class is behind or far ahead, perhaps the issue is with the assignment itself. For the purposes of explanation on how to intervene with the constructivism theory, one student in the class seems to be at a different developmental stage. The teacher would need to adjust the assignment for that one student, in addition to âencouraging interaction that will lead to the next levelâ (Killoran, 2004).


The maturational theory sounds similar to constructivism, but they have distinct differences. Maturational theorists agree that the student is not at the developmental stage; however, it is due to the studentâs biological factors (Killoran, 2004). The student will require extra time for completing the assignment and should not be rushed into the next level.


The ecological systems theory, developed by Urie Bronfenbrenner, states there is a person and a series of systems in his environment. The person and systems interact with one another. The teacher needs to find which system is inhibiting completion of assignments and resolve the specific issue. This can be complicated as the person and all his systems connect to each other as well as other possible people.


'''Table 1 - ''Problem Behavior Not Completing Homework''''' (Killoran, 2004).

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Intervention&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Behaviorism&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Child is receiving a reinforcer for not completing her homework.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Identify an appropriate reinforcer and present it upon completion of homework.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Constructivism&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Child is functioning at a different operational level than what is required to complete the homework.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Give the child homework at the correct level. Continue to set up the classroom to encourage interaction that will lead to the next level.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maturation Theory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Child is unable to understand the work.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Give the gift of time. Do not push the child. Give the child developmentally appropriate homework.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ecological Systems Theory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Something in the childâs environment is interfering with the childâs ability or desire to complete the homework.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ask the child if there is a problem at home or in school. Work with the parents or peers to help the child complete the work.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;





== '''Keep or Outlaw the Zero?''' ==


Perhaps none of the four above-mentioned theories work well some teachersâ styles or beliefs. To relieve teachers and students of zeros, some people are trying to remove the zero from the grading system. This is not just a move to become the popular teacher among the students. Its basis is correlating letter grades to number grades. For example, the lowest passing grade is a D. Using the City of Newport News, Virginiaâs grading scale, 65/100 is the lowest possible D. This makes 0-64 an F, therefore making 64 a failing grade. Applying the authorâs viewpoint, the student who does not turn in the assignment will receive a 64, not a 0, in the grade book. It is mathematically difficult to recover from a few zeros in the grade book (Reeves, 2004). For another example, if the first homework assignment receives a 100, and the second received a zero, then the studentâs homework average is a 50, or an F. By replacing the zero in the above example with a failing number grade (64), the studentâs homework average is an 82, which is a C. Although most classes provide students with several homework assignments, it is common for students to not do their homework and still receive passing scores on the quizzes, tests and other work. This theory has the potential to prevent D students from failing the class in addition to making the difference between an A and a B.


In British Columbia, Canada, some principals are âordering [teachers] to never give zeros when marking class assignments [and] to accept late workâ¦â (Vancouver Sun, 2009), which is based on a program called Assessment for Learning. The article also mentions that the program allows students to re-take tests until they receive a passing score. One teacher is glad that schools are considering different avenues; however, he believes the teacher should not be forced to implement this program. Some teachers hold the opinion that the principals are using the program as a means to increase graduation rates. The majority of members of the British Columbia Teachersâ Federation, parents, and other teachers are against and even outraged by these practices. Teachersâ and parentsâ responses to this article online support the keeping of zeros and the refusing to accept late work.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


== '''How to Deal''' ==


First determine the polices regarding late work in your school (About.com, 2009). Many schools include these policies in their student handbooks, so students and parents can refer to the handbook if they question the teacherâs decision. Popular suggestions for homework are using a specific in-box for collection, or a stamp to indicate that the assignment is on time. Some teachers have found that incompletes (an âIâ) motivate their students. One teacherâs students got irritated when they received an I instead of knowing their real grade, so they learned to stay on top of their deadlines (middleweb.com, 2009). For big projects or tests turned in after the due date (without an excused absence) many teachers deduct ten points for each day it is late. This technique is meant to motivate students but sometimes this frustrates teachers whose âA studentâ is willing to accept a B because he or she is working, too busy, procrastinating, etc. Trial-and-error is a recurring theme in the published discussions, blogs and message boards by teachers who are still searching for solutions to this issue. Even though different teachers use different methods, they share the same attitude, which is to make their expectations clear and be consistent with their own policies, procedures, and consequences. 



== '''Conclusion''' ==

Nothing, nil, nought, zip, zilch, goose eggâ¦ in the English language, there are so many words which mean ''zero''. While doing only thirty hours of observation for my ECI 301 class, I heard many synonyms for zero and even more teachers beg students for missing assignments. As future educators, we want young people to do well in school so they are better prepared for lifeâs real responsibilities. Determining why a student has zeros and missing work opens the door to a myriad of solutions to help improve grades. Insightful and knowledgeable teachers possess the skills to create the delicate balance between tough love and second chances in the classroom. 





== '''Multiple Choice Questions''' ==


'''1. James earns the following grades on six homework assignments: 0, 0, 50, 100, 100, 100. What is his current homework grade and is he passing based on the following grading scale: A 92-100; B 83-91; C 74-82; D 73-65; F Below 65?'''

A.	58, F, not passing

B.	70, D, passing

C.	80, C, passing

D.	87.5, B, passing




'''2. James earns the following grades on homework assignments: 0, 0, 50, 100, 100, 100. His teacher gives zeros for late assignments, half credit for partially completed, and 100 for completed. His passing homework grade means the difference between a D and an F. What are some options his teacher can use help James pass the class?'''

A.	Allow James to re-do the two missing homework assignments

B.	Give the highest failing grade, a 64 for the late and partial assignments, giving him an 82 C for homework.

C.	Replace the zeros with Is to allow an opportunity for make-up work

D.	The teacher can choose from all of the above




'''3. Jamesâs teacher wonders why he completed half of the assignments and did not complete the others. She discovers that he works a part-time job and that his family really needed the money. By allowing extra credit for on-time assignments as positive reinforcement, what theory of development is the teacher using?'''

A.	Behaviorism

B.	Constructivism

C.	Maturational theory

D.	Ecological theory



'''4. What is one difference between constructivism and maturational theory?'''

A.	Behavior of the student

B.	Biological factors

C.	Developmental stages

D.	Outside partiesâ influences

==&lt;font color=#CC3311&gt; Introduction &lt;/font&gt;==
It is fifteen minutes until class is dismissed. The teacher has waited all day to hand out the item in his hand. He wanted to avoid the chaos that goes along with it, this small manila envelope containing, for some, the most anticipated and others the most dreaded thing of the school year. Report cards! The deed is done. Each student responds in a different way. Some can't open them fast enough, eager to see the list of As and check marks, but others hold it slowly in front of them take a deep breath and hope to some higher power that they somehow will not be grounded for the next six weeks. Report cards have long been the standard of communication between school and home. These reports are meant to show the students progress in the classroom, and display the grade that the student has earned in each subject. There is also usually a section that reflects the studentâs motor, social, and behavioral skills as well. Some schools also use midterm reports to help students judge where they stand and make improvements to grades before the next reporting period. These report periods are usually every six to nine weeks. Educators, however, are starting to question if these reports are in fact the best way to judge a studentsâ progress. Some also question whether or not report cards, that are strictly grade based, are more harmful than helpful to the student. We will look at both the pros and cons to these issues, and also some alternative ways to assess student progress.

==&lt;font color=#CC3311&gt; The Good &lt;/font&gt;==
Report cards are a great way for parents to know how their child is performing in school. &quot;The purpose of report cards is to convey information from the school to parents about a student's educational progress.&quot;(Friedman,1995)They do just that. Traditional report cards show either the numerical grade earned, or it may be converted into a letter grade: A,B,C,D,or F, with A being top performance and F failing. This serves as a great communication tool for parents. Straight letter grading can also help teach responsibility in the student. If they fail to turn in assignments or do poorly on other assessments, then this greatly affects their grades. This in turn helps teach students that they are responsible for their actions and motivates them to meet future goals. Letter grades can be assigned in many ways to help students overcome any areas of poor performance. The Association for Physiological Science discusses different types of grading to best benefit the student. These include &quot;weighted letter grades, accumulated points, definitional assessment, median grading, or holistic grading.&quot; (Zlokovich, 2001) (Click to see more information about each style.[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/teaching/tips/tips_0101.cfm]) Each of these grading styles can result in an accurate letter grade that corresponds with mastery of a state standard, and  indicates if the child is showing progress. Letter grading is seen by some as the most fair way to grade. If there are a number of points available for an assignment then every student has the same chance of scoring the highest grade. This method of grading promotes accountability on the student's and parents part. Not everyone agrees that report cards are beneficial. Let's look at some of the cons associated with report cards.

==&lt;font color=#CC3311&gt; The Bad &lt;/font&gt;==
There is much concern that traditional report cards are not successfully showing student progress.There has been much debate as to whether or not teachers should award only a letter grade. Many see the act of assigning a letter grade as being inconsistent. Some teachers may assign grades based on mastery of standards, and some assign grades in comparison to other students in the class. (Francis,2006)What this means essentially is that a child may be able to deliver a particular grade for an assignment, but he may not have mastered the material. The opposite may also occur. Maybe he knows the standard but was not able to perform well enough on an assignment to earn a grade reflective of this. This lends to an unfair grading system, and no proof of improvement or ability of the students. Another problem surrounding use of traditional grades is that students and parents may not understand exactly what the grade means. (Francis,2006) They may see Cs or Ds and think their child is falling behind, but the teacher may view that student as just being slightly below average compared to other student's performance. Traditional letter grading can be too subjective. Students may earn high letter grades, but perform poorly on standards tests, such as the Virginia SOLs.(Delisio, 2007)There is also the belief that letter grading can have a negative effect on students self esteem and motivation. If they repeatedly see themselves failing or performing lower than their friends they may begin to doubt their ability. This in turn could set the student up for even greater failure, or develop a situation of learned helplessness, in which the student feels they cannot do it and will not even try. It could also foster negative competition between friends at school or between siblings at home. In stead of focusing on learning the material, the student may be more focused on trying to beat a brother, sister, or friend by earning higher grades to impress them. This,again, could be a situation where the student my score well but not retain the information given. A student may also feel pressured to perform by parents who expect nothing short of straight As. This is a learned reaction because of the tradition of report cards. The parent was expected to earn high grades when they were a child, and may not fully understand what a letter grade means in today's education system. Although communication is needed to keep parents informed, it for these reasons that traditional report cards are often considered bad. There have been some alternatives addressed to help mend these concerns and still keep parents informed with a more accurate report.

==&lt;font color=#CC3311&gt; The Alternatives &lt;/font&gt;==
Many people argue that traditional report cards are not an effective method of measuring student progress since the focus has shifted more to state standards and accountability. According to Education World, &quot;a report card revolution has been gaining momentum in the U.S., started by state standards, and accelerated by the testing and accountability provisions of the federal No Child Left Behind Act.&quot; (Delisio, 2007)
There have been many alternatives proposed to traditional letter grade report cards. Some of the alternatives suggested are age appropriate skills checklists, narratives added to traditional report cards, pass or fail grading systems, or a combination of two or more of these. Skills checklists would indicate if a student has met a state standard, or SOL. Narratives would still support a traditional report card, but would give an opportunity for teachers to prove students have improved since the last report. (Francis, 2006) Pass/fail or met/not met is simply what it states a student has either passed the subject or met the goal being graded. These types of reports could help alleviate the concerns surrounding report cards. Checklists and narrative reports take the guess work out of determining how a child is progressing. They will clearly show whether the student has met the goals established for them. Even if a letter grade still exists, a narrative could clearly explain what that grade means. Pressure to perform and low self esteem issues when a desired score is not reached could be a thing of the past for today's students. With the face of education changing, many schools have already chosen to change their method of assessing student progress. These alternative reports are appearing in more and more schools across the country. As education is changing so is the face and role of assessments. Below are some samples of different types of report cards.

&lt;br&gt;
*Click here for examples of a traditional letter grade report card.[http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/info/grading/documents/reportcards/traditional/reportcard_traditional_3-5_eng.pdf]or [http://www.teacherease.com/DemoReportCard2.htm]
*Click here for an example of a skills checklist report card.[http://departments.bcsd.com/reportcardcentral/blankreportcards/LegalSizeBlanks/Report%20Card%20-%20Grade%203%20Legal%20FINAL%208-21-08.pdf]
*The above photo is an example of a Met/Not Met/Improvement report card.
&lt;br&gt;These three examples show the unique differences between a traditional report card,a skills checklist that is specifically tailored towards state standards, and a met not met report. Notice on the traditional cards only the subject being graded is listed and on the skills checklist each standard is listed for that individual subject. This is thought by many to be a more effective way to measure student progress. The met/not met card simply shows that they have met the goal, not met it, or needs improvement. I consider these to be great examples of three varying types of assessment reporting.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;font color=#CC3311&gt; What is the School Report Card and the Nations Report Card? &lt;/font&gt;==
In addition to individual report cards given to students the state also issues a report card for each school and school district. We will look specifically at Virginia as an example. &quot;The Virginia School Report Card provides information on student achievement, accreditation, safety, and attendance for the state as a whole and for individual schools&quot;(VDOE,2008).As part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, each state is required to meet certain federal goals and standards. Each state releases a school report card to show their progress towards these goals. The Virginia Department of Education claims it will have meet these goals when:&quot;All children achieve high academic standards and are proficient in reading and mathematics, all children of limited English proficiency become proficient in English, all children are taught by highly qualified teachers, all students attend schools that are safe, drug free, and conducive to learning, and all students graduate from high school&quot; (VDOE,2008). This report card is intended to show the federal government, parents of students and the public that our schools are meeting and/or working hard to meet these goals. Visit the Virginia Department of Education to search for individual schools or district report cards.[http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/src/]Another report card is the Nation's Report Card. [http://nationsreportcard.gov/](Click to visit)This a report of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. &quot;NAEP reports information on student performance for the nation, states, and in some cases, urban districts in a variety of subject areas.&quot; (NAEP,2008) Not every student participates in this exam. students are selected to provide the most accurate sampling possible. There is a sampling taken from different schools and states across the nation. Students are tested in various subject areas. The intent of the NAEP is to make streamlined comparisons between states, a hard task due to the different standards each state requires. The results are compiled and published as the Nation's Report Card. This is available to the public to see where our education system stands, and can also be used by policy makers, principals, educators and teachers in decision making processes. (NAEP 2008)

I personally like the topic that you picked, I have never been a fan of grades and report cards because I felt like it doesn't display what it is intended for. Report cards are supposed to asses out knowledge but I believe they don't. Report cards take away from the initial point of learning, instead you'll have a lower grade because you missed too many days or you forgot to turn in an assignment or you were sick so you didn't get a chance to take in all the knowledge so when it comes to taking the test, you are unprepared. You made it clear what a report card was and what it is intended to do. I liked the fact that you clearly elaborated on the fact that some believe report cards are negative feedback not positive. I also agreed with your alternative methods in regards to the report card. I thought the checklist in regards to a persons age was a really smart idea. I think that is the best idea thus far in regards to cirriculmn.

&lt;big&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/big&gt;

A.) Students will learn what report cards are and 
how effective they are in measuring student progress


&lt;div class=&quot;boilerplate meta data&quot; id=&quot;attention&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 2.5%; text-align: center; background: #C38EC7; padding: 20px; border: 7px solid #C0C0C0&quot;&gt;''Our current accountability systems distort curriculum's by overemphasizing basic skillsânot because we don't know any better, but because we want accountability on the cheap''  (Jacobsen, Rothstein, and Wilder).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;br&gt;

In todayâs society report cards are king, they are the main things we use to measure how well a student is  

doing in a particular subject in a specific place in time. The first student progress reports, were introduced 

in the late 1800s, and typically consisted of a list of basic skills and indicated which of those skills the 

student had mastered and which required additional practice (Starr). Those were eventually replaced with the

very popular letter grading system  in the 20th century. 


Most parents think that letters grades are very objective and donât accurately measure a students ability 
(Starr).
Parents and teachers have different goals and different expectations about the reporting process.Teachers want

to measure the success of each and every  child, they want to identify each student's strengths and 

weaknesses and report on the progress that student is making toward achieving individual goals. However, a

parentâs idea of progress in terms of their children in measured in relation to how they are doing in 

comparison to other children in the classroom (Starr). Many experts say that a report cards can and must 

provide that information (Starr). 

We have become so dependent on the A B C grading system that educators are finding it nearly impossible to

break away from it (Starr). Today report cards featuring things like skills' lists, letter grades, and teacher

narratives and can be found in schools across the country (Starr).&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;

What we teach children in school is 2 + 2 = 4 and Paris
is the capital of France. What we should be teaching
them is what they are. We should be saying: &quot;Do you
know what you are You are a marvel. You are unique.&quot;
- Pablo Casals (Jacobsen, Rothstein, and Wilder).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

More recently, scholars like John Goodlad (1979) concluded that public education should educate the whole 

child and avoid re-teaching that may raise test scores but fail to produce healthy, fulfilled, and

participating citizens (Jacobsen, Rothstein, and Wilder).Moreover, a balanced assessment system should include 

tests of critical thinking. Although measuring critical-thinking skills usually requires constructed responses 

in which students produce original work, multiple-choice questions can also assess such skills.


Education is something that is constantly changing and now we live in a society where perhaps the progress 

report is not as effective as it once was. As said by Horace Mann when reporting to the Massachusetts 

legislature he denounced the phonics based approach (with &quot;letters, taken separately . . . taught before 

words&quot;) when teaching language, insisting that reading depends more on motivation than mechanics. He concluded 

that &quot;knowledge cannot be poured into a child's mind. The pupil. . .is nor a passive recipient, but an active, 

voluntary agent&quot; (Jacobsen, Rothstein, and Wilder). This  explains why a kindergartner would know how to say a 

word but would  not know what the word meant, that system of teaching language is not a good way to measure 

student progress. A report card needs to be more than just an assessment of how a student is doing or where 

they stand, it needs to be a guide of where they need to be and what they need to do to get there. After all a 

report card can only tell you so much about a student.

A. 19th

B. 20th

C. 17th

D. 18th 

2.) &lt;u&gt;&lt;s&gt;Teachers&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;&lt;s&gt;Board members&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/u&gt; have different goals and expectations about the reporting process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''&lt;big&gt;Using Journals For Assessment&lt;/big&gt;'''==

By Zack Hill

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #003336;
border: solid 10px #3999FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;A journal is like a good friend who is never too busy to listen&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/font color&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Learning Targets==

After reading this article, the student will be able to:

--Identify the purposes of having students write journals.

--Examine the positive and negative effects of having students keep journals.

==The Purpose of Journals==

In our everyday lives, journals are places where we can turn to for inspiration or reflection. They are where we keep our deepest thoughts and secrets and express ourselves freely. Reading someone's journal is like taking a look inside their mind because of these facts. In order to understand what purposes having students keep a journal serve, we must first look at the definition of the word &quot;journal.&quot; A journal, according to Webster's Dictionary, is as follows: &quot;a record of experiences, ideas, or reflections kept regularly for private use.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; Now, how does this definition apply to teachers and students?

==Types of Journals==
Using the definition of what a journal is, it isn't hard to see how they can be used in the classroom. There are several ways in which teachers can implement a journal-type of project in the classroom; choosing one that best fits the purpose of the class is the hard part. Journals can serve any of the following purposes:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;30%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #003336;
border: solid 1px #3999FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Suggested Journal Topics'''&lt;/u&gt;
* '''Personal'''
--&quot;Choose your favorite movie and write a paragraph about why it is your favorite.&quot;


* '''Dialogue'''
--&quot;President Obama is the first African American president of the United States. Discuss why this event is historic for our country. Then exchange with a partner and write whether you agree with them or not and why.&quot;


* '''Reader Response'''
--&quot;Discuss what you liked and disliked about the play ''Macbeth''. Which characters did you like? Which didn't you like?&quot; 


* '''Math''' 
--&quot;Work out the following problems with mixed fractions and describe the steps you took to get the answer.&quot;


* '''Science'''
--&quot;We have been dissecting pigs now for two class periods. Discuss the similarities and differences between the pigs' organs and our own organs. What does this tell you about mammals?&quot; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

* '''Personal Journals'''---These are journals that allow students to freely express their thoughts and feelings on topics of their choosing. Journals of this nature should not necessarily be graded for grammatical and spelling errors, but for content. 


* '''Dialogue Journals'''---These are journals that allow students to &quot;talk&quot; with one another via writing. Put simply, in these journals, students write about a given topic and their classmate(s) write a response to what is written. This can be an activity between classmates or between the student and teacher.


* '''Reader Response Journals'''---These journals allow students to express how they felt about a novel or story that they read. An entry could include how they liked or disliked certain characters or how they felt about the way in which the story was presented or how it ended. Reader-respose journals could also include requests from students concerning books that could be read later on in the school year.


* '''Math Journals'''---These journals allow students to work out math problems, writing out their thinking processes and the steps that they took to come to the answer that was calculated by the student. This could also present a way for students to express difficulties or misconceptions regarding new types of problems discussed in class.


* '''Science Journals'''---These journals provide students with a way to express how they are feeling about lessons, projects, and experiments that the class is currently discussing. Students can draw inferences from the given material and/or data they have collected from experiments and discuss their findings&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Pros and Cons==

Journals are useful in many different ways. They can help students express on paper what they can't orally, they can allow students to work out personal issues, and recognize growth as both a writer and a person (maybe an issue presented in a personal journal finally becomes resolved)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. What's more, writing a journal entry keeps the students focused on what has been learned and gives them the ability to go back and review their entries to see how each concept connects. The best, in my opinion, aspect of journal-writing is that it allows teachers to get to know their students on a personal level. Unless otherwise stated, journals are kept private, so the students who write feel as though they can put whatever they want inside without fear of judgement, thus tempering the student-teacher bond that is crucial to any classroom.

The negatives, while they are limited in number, do have devastating effects if they are inadvertently sparked. There are two noted negative aspects of journal writing, and the effects of both instances are liable to create a wedge between the teacher and the student. The first way in which journal-writing could potentially be negative is the fact that the teacher could hurt a student's feelings by giving criticism on a most personal journal entry&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. A way to avoid this situation is for teachers to either be aware of what is &quot;touchy&quot; or for teachers in this case not to give criticism on journal entries. The second way in which journal-writing could possibly be negative is losing teaching time due to writing the entry and/or discussing entries. Oftentimes, teachers will allow students to share their entries in class and a good discussion gets going, thus distracting the students' focus off of the upcoming lesson. A way to curb this is to either not allow students to share the journal entries, only allow a set, specific amount of time aside for writing, or to give students a topic that is relevant to the day's lesson&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 


==Quick Quiz==

1. '''How can journal-writing be negative?'''

A. Parents will complain that their children are writing about controversial issues.

B.  Students' feelings could potentially get hurt if the teacher criticizes them.

C. Students will think that writing is stupid and refuse to do the assignment.

D. Teachers could be incapable of assessing students via journal-writing.


2. '''All of these are positive aspects of journal-writing EXCEPT which one?'''

A. Students can track their growth as both people and writers.

B.  Students can recap past lessons through journal entries that tied into lessons.

C. Students who write in their journals develop better writing skills.

D. Students who write in their journals often develop unconventional ideas. 


3. '''Which of the following journal topics would BEST suit a personal journal?'''

A. &quot;Name the different types of simple machines and tell what the function of each one is.&quot;

B. &quot;Write about an experience that changed you as a person, for better or for worse, and tell why.&quot;

C. &quot;Writing in pairs, discuss how you felt about the outcome of the Grammy Awards.&quot;

D. &quot;Write a paragraph about the Scientific Method. Make sure to mention each step in your paragraph.&quot;


4. '''Which type of journal would BEST suit the following prompt? &quot;Write a paragraph about the tone of the book &lt;u&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/u&gt;. How does the tone help the author's point to be made evident?&quot;'''

A. Dialogue Journal

B.  Personal Journal

C. Reader-response Journal

D. Science Journal

===&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;jokerman&quot;&gt;'''Using Classroom Discussion for Assessment'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt; ''by Megan Lee''===



==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==
:::* 1. To understand the importance of classroom discussions as an assessment FOR learning.
:::* 2. To know the benefits and downfalls of classroom discussion.
:::* 3. Tips to Leading a Discussion.

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Teachers use a variety of techniques to measure or assess the progress of their students.  Most teachers rely on the selected response method. This method is made up of multiple choice, true and false, matching, and fill in the blank questioning. There is also extended written response which isnât used as frequently. Extended written response is an essay or âShow all of your workâ math problems.  The performance assessment reflects the ability to perform tasks. However, a form of assessment that is slowly fading away from classroom practices is personal communication. Personal communication consists of questioning, oral exams, and most importantly, classroom discussions. 

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;IMPORTANCE OF CLASSROOM DISCUSSION&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Classroom discussions can be used as a tool of measuring assessment just the same as a selected response test. Classroom discussions give students that do not perform well on selected response tests to have a chance at proving their knowledge on the subject at hand. For an effective discussion to take place the teacher will ask the class a question, usually start the discussion, and let the students take over from there. The teacher will step in if the topic seems to be falling by the wayside.  Classroom discussion functions best when students are talking to students (Facilitating Effective Classroom Discussions). 

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;CLASSROOM DISCUSSION: INFORMAL AND FORMAL ASSESSMENT  EXAMPLE:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Classroom discussion can be used as both an informal and formal assessment.  For example, as a teacher you have assigned the class to read an English book outside of the classroom on their own time. Instead of giving the students a selected response test testing only the factual aspect to what they read, turn it into a classroom discussion. Give the students a handout saying what they should know for the upcoming discussion. State how they will be graded based on their discussion performance.  This would be an example of a formal assessment.  On the other hand, if you as the teacher were going over a certain chapter of the English book the students were reading then incorporate a mini classroom discussion on the studentsâ thoughts and feelings about what the particular chapter covered into the lecture already being given. This is an example of informal assessment because it can easily be incorporated into the classroom routine without interfering. 

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;BENEFITS AND DOWNFALLS OF CLASSROOM DISCUSSION&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Classroom discussions offer both positive and negative aspects.  Classroom discussions offer a nice change of pace from the regular everyday lecture. They open the door for active student participation. They allow students to challenge one another and the teacher can see if what he/she taught was comprehended correctly. Classroom discussions not only benefit the students but the teachers as well. Teachers can use the classroom discussion to see how many students understand the material that was presented and if any further classroom time needs to be dedicated to reinforcing the material. Students are empowered to be responsible for the discussion while the instructor provides learning outcomes, a text for the discussion (Using Discussion in the Classroom, 2007).
The downfalls to classroom discussion are just as important for the teacher as the benefits. Some students have a difficult time engaging in discussion because they tend to be shy. Techniques such as starting out with pairs of students talking together, followed by rotating these partners, followed by a full group discussion are a means to begin establish comfort levels for students who tend to remain quiet (Using Discussion in the Classroom, 2007). Students are well practiced in how to talk to and listen to teachers, in how to address and look to authority figures for answers. But they are not well versed in how to talk to and listen to each other (Facilitating Effective Classroom Discussions). Students are taught to listen and learn from their teachers not how to listen and learn from their peers. Another downfall to classroom discussion is that some students may feel less knowledgeable than their peers, or a competition of who gets to say the last word could possibly occur. 


==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;TIPS TO LEADING A DISCUSSION:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

1.	Communicate clear expectation at the start of the course, possibly in the syllabus.
2.	Define the purpose of discussion. Where will you lead your students?
3.	Plan the session.
4.	Conduct the discussion.
5.	Evaluate the discussion and plan next steps. (Cavanaugh, Leading a Discussion 2006).


&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Personal Conferences for Assessment ==
''by Sarah Macomber''

== Introduction ==

&lt;big&gt;A personal conference is a conversation with a student that allows both the teacher and the student talk about where the student is in the class, and what things the student may need to focus on.  Personal conferences give students goals to aim for, and to get a chance to assess their work in the class.  Conferences can be a great way to give feedback to the student while letting the teacher know what areas need more attention.&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF8C6;
border: solid 10px #8B31C7; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#571B7e&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Ultimately, parents and educators share a common goal: to improve the future quality of life for children by seeing that they receive the best possible education. With each party working alone, there is less chance of reaching that goal. But in working together there is power, and children deserve to have their parents and teachers work together as equals.&quot; (Stevens and Tollafield,2003)&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


== Learning Targets ==

&lt;big&gt;'''Students should be able to:'''
*State what a personal conference is.
*List the advantages of personal conferences.
*List the disadvantages of personal conferences.&lt;/big&gt;

== Student-Teacher Conferences ==

&lt;big&gt;Student/Teacher conferences can help close the achievement gap by showing students what they need to work on, and what goals they need to set for themselves.  It is important for students to have a chance to assess their own work, and to have one-on-one time to address their concerns.  Conferences let teachers see how the students are doing not only academically, but in social and personal areas as well. (Akmal, 2002)  It is important for the student to feel comfortable in the conference, and not feel that they are in trouble or have been singled out.  The more comfortable the student feels, the more willing they are to open up about problems they may be experiencing.  Having a formal structure for conferences lets the student know what to expect and calm anxieties they may feel. (Akmal, 2002)  Conferences can be more casual as well by having them take place during class time, and having them be shorter and more direct.&lt;/big&gt;


== Parent-Teacher-Student Conferences ==

&lt;big&gt;An important goal in a parent/teacher conference is to create an alliance between the teacher and the parent.  Both parties want the student to succeed and to have the best education possible.  When setting up conferences, teachers should be sure to set them up with all the parents, and not just with those whose children are having problems in the class.  While meeting with the parent, teachers should listen and be open to the parent's point of view.  (Stevens and Tollafield, 2003)  It is important for the teacher to be positive about the student, and to state some of their strengths while conferencing with the parents.   &quot;When explaining things like test scores to parents, teachers should be prepared to explain such specialized terms as &quot;standard score&quot; or &quot;percentile&quot; without oversimplifying.  Visual aids or examples can often help with this task.&quot; (Stevens and Tollafield, 2003) &lt;/big&gt;


&lt;u&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Student Involvement&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/u&gt;


&lt;big&gt;When possible, the student should be involved in the parent/teacher conference.  They are the ones who will be most affected by the decisions made in the conference.  Students can feel anxious if they are left at home while their parent meets with the teacher at school.  Sending a letter home with the students helps parents to better understand their role in the conference as well as what to expect. (Enz and Serafini, 1995)  Parents are often curious about their child's progress, and teachers can share with them how the student is doing and what they have observed in the classroom.  At the conference, students can have a chance to show the parents a notebook or portfolio of their work.  Students are often excited to get a chance to share their hard work and what they have accomplished. (Enz and Serafini, 1995)&lt;/big&gt;



== Disadvantages ==

&lt;big&gt;Although conferences can be beneficial to all parties involved, attendance is often a problem many teachers face.  &quot;Research shows that 40% of parents never attend school programs.&quot; (Stevens and Tolafield, 2003)  Oftentimes, both parents are working during the day, so teachers should be prepared to accommodate those parents who can't take off of work.  Student/Teacher conferences can be equally as hard to set up.  Holding these conferences during class time can take time away from instruction.&lt;/big&gt;

== Quiz ==

1. Teachers should only hold conferences with the parents whose children have problems in the class.

A. True
B. False

2. Why are student/teacher conferences important?

A. Students can set new goals for themselves.
B. Students get a chance to assess their work.
C. Teachers find out what they need to focus on in class.
D. All of the above.

3. Research shows that 40% of parents never attend school programs.

A. True
B. False

Answers: 1. B  2. D  3. A

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Introduction&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

Educators are becoming more and more frustrated with the pressures of standardized tests and how they are used as a method of assessment. Teachers must center their instruction around these standards because they are accountable for their studentsâ preparation of these tests (Blackbourn et al., 2004). In the end, are standardized tests truly a justified method of measuring each studentâs progress? Are there alternative approaches to assess those students who do not perform well on tests?

Portfolio-based assessment was designed as an evaluation that centers around each individual student (Blackbourn et al., 2004). The definition of a portfolio is a collection of a studentâs work over a period of time. They are used as a performance-based assessment tool to demonstrate what the student is learning and to track their progress (Abrenica). They also allow the student to reflect on his or her strengths and weaknesses and then apply these skills to improve their performance (Valdez, 2001). Letâs take a more in-depth look at the structure, evaluation, and pros and cons of portfolio assessment.


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Portfolio Implementation&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

Implementing a portfolio uses a constructivist approach because it âdeeply involves the students in the task assigned to themâ (Valdez, 2001, p. 1) Portfolios should be designed by both the teacher and student. Specific goals and objectives need to be set to not only reflect the teacherâs standards, but the interests and learning styles of the student (Blackbourn et al., 2004). Portfolios should not only be a collection of test results, journal entries, and homework. They should also include written reflections to accompany each entry that demonstrate the studentâs knowledge, skills, and application of what they have learned (Valdez, 2001).


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Electronic Portfolios&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

Portfolio assessment began by collecting student work samples and organizing them in folders or binders so that the teacher, students, and parents could monitor student progress. Oftentimes these portfolios can become bulky and begin to take up space. There is also the problem with documents that are too large to be kept in a folder or binder (Abrenica).

Because of the digital age we are living in, electronic portfolios, or e-folios, have proven to be more popular and practical. Information and documents can easily be scanned and stored on a computer hard drive, floppy disk, CD, DVD, or any other storage media. This method takes up much less space and can be easily accessed. An electronic portfolio provides endless possibilities, which include voice recordings of a student reading, video recordings of student presentations, and pictures taken from a Science Fair awards presentation.

Once the portfolio entries have been chosen and organized, the electronic portfolio can be presented as a slideshow or uploaded as a website. This is where creating a portfolio becomes an active learning strategy because the students are encouraged to use their creativity (Valdez, 2001). The electronic portfolios can be enhanced with sound clips, music, graphics, and pictures, thus making it more appealing to those viewing the presentation.

-Penelope Valdez&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

An electronic portfolio not only encourages students to use their creativity, but also enhances their computer and technology skills. Students will be introduced to the use of computers, scanners, digital cameras, multimedia software programs, and web authoring programs. In the end, students will âfeel a sense of accomplishment and empowerment by displaying, sharing and presenting their electronic portfolios to teachers, fellow classmates and parentsâ (Abrenica, p.1).



[http://seuss.wcs.sad40.k12.me.us/ep/samples/toc.htm Sample Electronic Portfolios]
These electronic portfolio examples provide entries from all subject areas on the elementary level. These are excellent examples of different types of media. Each student created their own personal website that reflects their personality. While I thought these were creatively and visually excellent electronic portfolio examples, I was disappointed that not every entry provided a personal written reflection from the student. I think a written reflection should be a requirement for every portfolio entry so that the students can analyze and reflect on their strengths and weaknesses.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Portfolio Assessment Example&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

[[Image:portfolio_scoring.jpg|300px|right]]
Penelope Valdez is a seventh grade science teacher in Los Angeles, California. She requires her students to turn in monthly portfolio entries so that by the end of the school year they will have a total of ten entries in their portfolio. Her students may choose any of the topics covered during the given month and do the following:

âState and explain in detail what concept they have learned. Students should write this section in their own words, and it should be about a page long. Statements should always begin with
âI learned that . . . â or âI learned how to . . .â Some examples include: I learned that high blood pressure afflicts African Americans more than people from other ethnic backgrounds; I
learned that HIV is called a genetic disease, not because it is a disease transmitted by inheritance, but because it is a disease that afflicts DNA, which is the building blocks of our genes; or I
learned how to use, handle, care, and store microscopes properly. . 
Create a product applying the concept they have learned with the purpose of presenting the science concept in an easy-to-understand way. For example, students could make a family tree
showing incidence of high blood pressure among relatives or have someone take photographs of the student properly using, caring for, and storing a microscope; and evaluate, judge, and critique a popular magazine article, print or TV advertisement, or overheard quote from the news or media. They must base their evaluations on the concepts learned, determine if the science in their selection is accurate or not, and explain their appraisal. (Valdez, 2001, p.2)â

Ms. Valdez is able to easily assign grades by basing her evaluation on the outline of what needs to be included in each entry. Figure I illustrates a sample of her scoring guide. For the first part she looks for âaccuracy of the concept written about and makes sure the explanation of the concept is written in the studentâs own words. The extent and depth of any extra research is also considered. For the second part of the entry, the level of originality and creativity is evaluated. For the third part, I look for originality in the studentâs choice of an article or other media example, while also evaluating the role science plays in the studentâs choice and the soundness of the studentâs critique of the piece. (Valdez, 2001, p.2)â


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Disadvantages of Portfolios&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

While portfolios are beneficial to both the teacher and students by having a positive effect on student learning, there are some disadvantages. A large amount of a teacherâs time is consumed to plan, organize, and grade each portfolio. Penelope Valdez states that she often finds herself spending as much as ten minutes grading each portfolio entry and writing comments on how the students can improve their entries (Valdez, 2001). There is also another time issue if the students are not used to using computers and technology. They must learn to use and manipulate digital media in order to complete their portfolio (Abrenica). This certainly takes time away from instruction in the classroom.


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Conclusion&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

Portfolio-based assessment offers an alternative to traditional, standardized testing. They allow the students to demonstrate their own skills of what they have learned rather than specific skills determined by test constructors (Blackbourn et al., 2004). Although portfolios are a lot of work and take longer to evaluate than a test, results reveal that portfolio assessment is well worth the investment. 


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Questions&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

I appreciated this article. I had no clue what portfolio assessment was before I read this article, but I'm glad I did because it sounds effective. You did a good job at explaining what a portfoloi assessment was and how it works. You provided clear examples as well. You showed your audience how it could be effective if implemented.

What it is and how it works

by Daysha Clark

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
After reading this article the reader should: 

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand what a portfolio is, and what it is not&lt;li&gt;
Be aware of the benefits and concerns associated with portfolio assessment
&lt;li&gt;Know basic guidelines for helping students build a portfolio&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000066&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
=A Tale of Two Papers=

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
See if this isnât a familiar scenario:  you work hard on a writing assignment, letâs say for a high school English class.  You do your research, you write you five to seven pages, and you hand it in.  That paper represents several hours of your life, and a good deal of new information absorbed and critical thought expended to present it all just right. You make sure you have the right number of sources.  You double check that your citations are correct.  You reread, and proof, and tweak until itâs just right.  But once youâve released that paper into the wild,  all of that hard work comes down to one thing  - the only consideration you will ever again take for that body of work is the number your teacher scrawls on the front cover â your grade.   Beyond that, what do you do with it?  The same thing the rest of us do - shove in a  folder where it will wait for the year end locker-purge to be thrown away with a sizable stack of other work thatâs been long since forgotten.   It becomes merely a checkpoint to pass in the course of the year. 

Letâs take that same assignment, but change the stakes a little.  Letâs say when the red ink has dried and the frenzy of late-night composition has passed, you revisit your paper in a new context.  You read it for its own sake.  You read it as a product of your intellect. You actually determine if itâs any good.  You question what youâve really gained besides points for your average and some random information about the topic that stuck to your brain in the process.  You decide why itâs good, you determine if it really does have your voice in it, you realize what could have been better.  And then you take a minute to write a defense of your answers to all of those considerations.  

The second paper, although it represents the exact same assignment and gross product, has now become much more.  Itâs now become a good candidate for a student portfolio.

=So What's a Portfolio?=

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
==&lt;b&gt;How they started&lt;/b&gt;==

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
The portfolio concept originated with University of Massachusetts professors Peter Elbow and Pat Belanoff  in the mid 80âs in response to dissatisfaction with procedures for scoring their departmentâs written exit exams. (Lombardi) The idea was that responses produced in response to fixed questions and assessed with simple numerical value did not yield an accurate representation of the studentâs abilities and identity, only a desired response to an exercise meant solely for summative assessment. 
Portfolios began as a refined version of the stack of paper mentioned earlier,  a collection of student work that was determined by the student to reflect the best of their progress and achievement.  Over time, portfolios have evolved into eFolios or webfolios that showcase not only classroom work, but the activities and accomplishments outside of specific assignments that represent the growth and merit of the student.


==&lt;b&gt;What exactly is a portfolio&lt;/b&gt;==

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Paulson defines student portfolios as a collection of student work intended to illustrate the efforts, progress, and achievement of a student in either a specific area (creative writing) or across subjects, representing the studentâs academic endeavors as a whole. (Paulson et al. )
Portfolios are meant to be a snapshot of the student, by the student.  Theyâre a cumulative body of work that spans the school year that shows where the student started, where they are now, and the process in between.  But theyâre intended to be more than just an elaborate resume; they are an ongoing exercise in learning and evaluation.  Portfolios, by their nature, are a complex portrait of the individual student that moves beyond averages and rank and into the realm of authentic student representation. 


&lt;font color=&quot;#0033CC&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt; â[Portfolios] can become a window into the studentâs heads for both staff and student to understand 
the educational process as the level of the individual 
learner.â&lt;/b&gt;  (Paulson)

=Anatomy of a Portfolio=

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
==&lt;b&gt;What they are&lt;/b&gt;==

Portfolios breakdown into two categories: the process portfolio, and the product  portfolio. Process-oriented work demonstrates the growth of the learner over time, such as various drafts of a particular piece of work. Product-oriented portfolios  focus on the best work of the student, the items that represent the highest quality created From demonstrating progress through selection of best works, the portfolio system provides new ways for students to exhibit what they have learned over time. (Lombardi)

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
==&lt;b&gt;What they aren't&lt;/b&gt;==

Barrett warns against confusing portfolios, which have multiple purposes, such as learning, assessment, and even employment-with assessment management systems, which are primarily used for formative and summative assessment. The true Portfolio is student-centered, with works selected by the student, whereas the assessment management system is institution or instructor-centered, with works prescribed by the institution (Barrett 2003).

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;What's in them&lt;/b&gt;==

The criteria for portfolios tends to be loosely defined as a collection of elements representative of a studentâs work.  It is important that students determine these elements for themselves, as part of the purpose of the portfolio is not only to summatively assess the quality of the work, but to determine the individual studentâs point of view.  Criteria that are imposed on the student work will result in the students working to present what they feel is expected of them, rather than strive to present their own ideas about what pieces of their work are valuable and why, defeating  much of the potential of portfolio assessment.  (Benjamin-Cook)

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
==&lt;b&gt;Self-reflection - The Defining Feature of Student Portfolios&lt;/b&gt;==

A defining feature of portfolios is the inclusion of a self-reflection.  The self-reflection is a brief summary of the studentâs own assessment of their work; it should represent not only assessment of the work itself and any relevant context, but assessment of the student themselves.  What have they learned, where have they grown, and how these things are applicable beyond the classroom.

As a demonstration of self-assessment, the self-reflection becomes an assessable feature in and of itself.  It demonstrated the students ability to evaluate for both context and content; it also highlights what the student considered to be of merit and why.  These are important windows into understanding the viewpoint from which students are learning, and helps instructors evaluate if students are able to apply reasoning and synthesizing abilities to their own work in addition to possessing the knowledge and performance skills needed to create the work.  This gives the portfolio the unique ability to simultaneously assess several levels of learning. 

Self-reflection may be as open as allowing the student to comment as they see fit on their body of work, or may follow guidelines intended to evoke thoughtful comments on their collective achievements.  For example, the following are suggested topics for inclusion in the self-reflections for portfolios compiled by students in a post-secondary teacher preparation program in the state of California, as presented by Lombardi:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1. What insights about your teaching or student learning have you gained?&lt;li&gt;
2. How does the lesson, activity, or assignment allow you to make decisions about your eaching in the future, with increased understanding or pedagogical skill?&lt;li&gt;
3. How does the piece reflect what you value in your teaching practice?
(Lombardi)&lt;/ul&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;The Teacher's Influence on Portfolio Success&lt;/b&gt;==

Also the concept of portfolios aligns with a progressivist educational philosophy, the role of the teacher in influence positive outcomes in portfolio compilation should not be underestimated. Paulson presented several suggested guidelines for instructors to bear in mind when implementing portfolio development and assessment:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1.	Portfolios should give the student the opportunity to learn about learning. End product must contain information that shows engagement in self-reflection
&lt;li&gt;2.	Portfolios should be done BY the student, no TO the student.  They represent a way for students to learn to value their own work, and in turn value themselves as learners. Therefore, students should be involved in selecting the pieces to be included.
&lt;li&gt;3.	The portfolio should not become merely an accumulation of the studentsâ work; scores, grades, and samples of student performance on summative assessment tasks should not be a part of the portfolio, unless they add meaning or context to other work selected. 
&lt;li&gt;4.	The portfolio should convey implicitly or explicitly the studentâs activities and attitudes; their rationale  and intents(purpose for forming the portfolio and goals for its presentation),  content (the actual work  chosen for inclusion), standards (what they think is good or bad work and why), and judgments (what the collective contents communicate about the student)
&lt;li&gt;5.	A valuable portfolio will function formatively during the year while it is being assembled, and summatively once it is complete. For example incomplete or unsatisfactory pieces may be included as benchmarks for progress in problem area, or to highlight goals for future work. The final product would include work only suitable for review and representative of the studentâs best work.  (Paulson) &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000066&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
=What's So Great About Portfolios?=

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Lambdin and Walker (1994) find that students develop better self-assessment skills and become less reliant on grades when portfolio assessment is used. (Cook-Benjamin).  Portfolios are also very versatile in that they are applicable  a variety of skills and skill level, being found in elementary grade levels through the graduate level of secondary education.

Cook-Benjamin makes the following statement about her personal experience with portfolios: 
âI have found that they feel a sense of accomplishment in the completeness of the portfolio. They see the growth they have  achieved and the areas in which they still need to improve. I have also found that students use the portfolio as a referral device in later classes, an act I have not observed with traditional assessments.â (Cook-Benjamin)

Stanford University's Lee Shulman, a leader in the portfolio movement: 
discusses five benefits in the use of portfolios:
1. Portfolios permit the tracking of longer episodes of teaching more effectively than single observations do.
2. Portfolios encourage important connections between process and product, through bridging what goes on in teaching with how it is manifested in portfolio products.
3. Portfolios institutionalize norms of collaboration, reflection, and discussion. 
4. A portfolio introduces structure to the field experience and can be seen as a &quot;portable residency.&quot;
5. Portfolios shift the responsibility for demonstrating learning back to the student
teacher, as a participant rather than an observer. (Shulman 1998 qtd. in Barrett 2003, 4) (Paulson)

Henkin (1993) finds that the portfolio provides a holistic assessment that contributes to a valid measure of  higher order thinking skills. According to Calvin (1993), when students are assessed using authentic materials such as portfolios, bias is reduced. Students also profit from the portfolio by becoming better evaluators and practicing self-reflection in their work (Cook-Benjamin)


&lt;font color=&quot;#000066&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
=The Trouble With Portfolios=

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;CALIBRI&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
Shulman also describes five dangers of portfolios: 
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;lamination-A portfolio becomes a mere exhibition, an opportunity for self-aggrandizement,
a chance to show off.
&lt;li&gt;heavy lifting-Is all the hard work a portfolio demands really worth the effort?
&lt;li&gt;trivialization-People document material that does not merit reflection.
&lt;li&gt;perversion-Portfolio scoring systems might objectify portfolios to the point that the portfolios lose their ability to evaluate individual outcomes,
&lt;li&gt;misrepresentation-Does the emphasis on best work misrepresent the candidate's work, so as not to be a true picture of competency? (Shulman 1998 qtd. In Barrett 2003, 3-4) (Paulson)&lt;/ul&gt;

There are also concerns regarding who really is determining portfolio contents, the instructors or the students, and how the entity governing the contents of the portfolio impacts its validity as an assessment tool. (Cook-Benjamin). Assessment of the portfolios presents a problem as well â how can they be evaluated in a way that is reflective of the purpose of portfolios; is a rubric more appropriate, or a type of scoring method that yields a calculable grade?  How can this progressive idea be meshed with the scoring methods currently present in many school systems?
There is also the argument that portfolios are simply a waste of time.  They are time-consuming to manage and maintain, and require large amount of effort, individual communication, and instructor input to develop and evaluate.
Portfolios also create a storage issue due to their size, be it physical space in the case of paper portfolios, or internet bandwidth in the case of webfolios.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''By Lauren Kathryn Crawford'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Preparation, sweaty palms, anxiety over the results, these could all either be symptoms of a hot date, or of the dreaded t-word, test. In particular standardized testing which causes anxiety to everyone in the educational system from the President of the United States, to school boards, principals, teachers and students.

In the following article we are going to discuss the standardized testing, its' criticisms, the necessity for its' existence, and how to use the results as an instructor to help narrow achievement gaps.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;A principal from an Appalachian school in eastern Kentucky, 

&quot;There's a school eighteen miles down the road that has 80% 

of the kids on free and reduced lunch... and they are at a

Higher absolute rank,&quot; to his teaching staff, &quot;Don't bring up

to me about how our kids are disadvantaged. 'That dog won't 

hunt!'&quot;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;1. The student will be able to identify basic subject areas of standardized testing and understand how it is scored.

2. The student will be able to identify the arguments against standardized testing.

3. The student will be able to identify the benefits of standardized testing.

4. The student will be able to recognize some ways that results can help him/her as an instructor to help narrow achievement gaps in their classroom.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;Standardized Testing==

&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Since the 1970's, standardized tests have been the aim of much criticism in the United States, but their basic purpose is to serve as a measure or rule of preparedness in the early grades and mastery of core subject matter in later grades (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

School entry test  like the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised and The Stanford Binet- Intelligence tests are intended to determine the readiness levels of kindergartners entering schools (Rock, Stenner, 2005). These tests measure  the vocabulary and cognitive ability of a child(Rock, Stenner, 2005). Similar tests are conducted in groups or individually throughout the year and many of these tests are adaptive and measure progress,they are not static measures that result in either a passing or failing grade (Rock, Stenner, 2005). An adaptive test instead uses what is known as a floor/ceiling rule (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  This rule means that (in the case of vocabulary testing) a group of words will be easy for the student, falling below the floor, while a group of words will be more difficult for the student, above the ceiling (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  Throughout the year progress will dictate what level the ceiling and floor will move to (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

Other tests, like the SOL used in Virginia are used to determine mastery of core subject matter taught throughout the year (Bagin, 1994).  Generally, these tests measure understanding in mathematics, science, reading and writing (Bagin, 1994).  Some tests, the SOL is an example, are given at a predetermined time and scoring is based on either multiple choice, short answer or open response (Bagin,Stenner 1994). Another type of testing, used in states like Kentucky uses a portfolio system that students add to all year long in conjunction with a time allotted test at another time of the year (Wolf, Borko, Elliot, 2000).

All of these tests are graded on a percentile system (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  That is, how well the student does on the test in comparison with other students tested at the same grade level (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  For example, a student who scores in the 90th percentile has done better than 90 percent of other students taking the test (How Standardized Testing, 2009).  A student that test in the 10th percentile has only done better than 10 percent of his/her peers (How Standardized Testing, 2009).

Scores on these tests are used in a number of ways. Collectively, nation-wide these scores tell our president how well our students are doing as a whole and at the state level (Bagin, 1994). States allocate funding based on test results and individual schools determine which programs need more improvement (King, Houston, Middleton, 2000).  Teachers use these scores to evaluate their teaching methods and yes, these scores are also used at times to determine the readiness of students to continue to the next grade level (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;Criticisms of Standardized Testing==
&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Opponents to current standardized testing techniques dislike test like the Peabody and the SOL for a number of reasons, but the two main arguments are against their reliability and what they see as racial bias existing in the questions themselves.

In order for a test to be deemed useful, it must above all else be reliable (Rock, Stenner, 2005). That is that results should be consistent (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  One way tests are measured for consistency is by doing sample runs with panels of a representative sample of students (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  Sample runs of the tests are conducted in two different ways:

1.  Two versions of the test with like questions are run.  If the test is reliable similar results should be yielded by both groups of test takers (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

2.  A single test is randomly and equally divided (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  This test is ran and reliability is determined by the similarity of these results (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

The results of these sample runs are measured in much the same way that standardized tests results are measured.  A rating of 90% means a test yields similar results 90 percent of the time while a rating of 10% would mean that the test yields similar results only ten percent of the time.

Because it is generally accepted that the range of achievement cannot be accurately predicted; a reliability rating of eighty-percent or more is seen as acceptable by national standards and critics disagree (Thernstrom, 1992).

Critics believe that if a test yields dissimilar results even only twenty percent of the time that the test could not possibly be measuring what it is intended to (Thernstrom, 1992(.

Other critics of the tests believe that they are racially biased for a number of reasons (King ''et al.'', 2000).  One basis for this belief is that the achievement gap between students of European heritage typically score much higher than minorities do (Thernstrom, 1992). One test for scholastic readiness showed that when test results were compared between students of European heritage and those of African descent, the former group scored higher seventy-six percent of the time, while the latter only scored higher twenty-four (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

On the other hand,some questions are viewed as being racially biased because they are deemed as culturally irrelevant (Thernstrom, 1992).  For example,  a question that asks &quot;What is the name of a baby cow?&quot;, is more relevant to someone growing up in a rural area than someone living in an urban one (Thernstrom, 1992).  Some critiques even believe that language tests are racially biased because they see one form of spoken language as correct while another form of the same language as incorrect (Thernstrom, 1992).

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;A Need For Change: The Case for Standardized Testing==
&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt; While both critiques and proponents of standardized testing could debate their sides all day, the need to assess students to determine both their progress and the progress of their teachers and schools is undeniable.

Standardized testing evaluates students early in their education on their readiness both scholastically and behaviorally (Rock, Stenner, 2005). Students and their parents are able to measure at least generally their progress and areas in which they need improvement (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

In older grades standardized testing measures where students rate in comparison with their peers and thus how the student and his teachers are doing (Bagin, 1994).  While these test do rate students according to how well they do on these tests, some schools have used these scores to reform their systems and in turn drastically improve their methods (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

Schools in economically devastated areas like the ones in eastern Kentucky, have under the strong leadership of their principals and the dedication of their teachers achieved higher ratings (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  One principal of such a school stated, &quot;there's a school 18 miles down the road that has 80% of their kids on free and reduced lunch... and they have made progress and are at a higher absolute rank.&quot; To his teachers this same principal would say, &quot; Don't bring up to me about how our kids are disadvantaged. That dog won't hunt.&quot; The latter part of the statement is a local expression he used in this case to mean that excuses would not help their school improve (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

Instead of making excuses, schools that have taken poor standardized testing results and used them to improve their schools, have used them more in how one principal put it, as &quot;stock market quotes.&quot;  They see poor results in one area as a flag to improve that department (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  They have teachers take classes in new teaching methods and they work together to see that their children improve (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

While the jury is still out on whether or not there is a better method of determining individual student progress.  The need for a common measure to compare students to bring about change is still more present than ever.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;How to use Standardized Testing Results to Bridge Achievement Gaps==
&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;So the question is, is if these test are not completely reliable, and if they are irrelevant to some students, how do we change that?

The answer: Be Innovative Forward Thinking Teachers!

The best teachers, one principal, stated were teachers that were in fact themselves learners (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  Actively seeking out new methods to add to and modify their instruction (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000). The teachers that work together with parents and their fellow students as well as counselors to understand individual needs (Wolf ''et al.''). Lastly the teachers that ignore the pessimism of others and raise expectation levels of their students and make the material relevant for those it might not other wise be ( Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

Several companies currently travel from state to state and hold seminars and lesson demos (Wolf, ''et al.'', 2000).  These seminars cover an array of matter from core areas like writing and math to how to incorporate technology into their lessons (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000). The attitude today is to work smarter not harder (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000). Teachers that attend these continuing education generally report positive feedback (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  One teacher reported after a lesson demo on writing where they had students add a reflection to a narrative assignment, &quot;I think what I've learned here is not something completely different from what I've been doing all together but adding to it. I'm really excited about this!&quot; Other lessons show teachers how to incorporate technology into their daily activities to make planning easier and to tie lessons together (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

Also, schools seemed to do better when the idea of community was present.(Wolf ''et al.'', 2000)  At one school where major improvements have been said to occur a teacher spoke of how there was a concept of the students being the schools responsibility and not just the particular teacher that they happened to have that year (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  Dedicated teachers attend meetings sometimes daily with other teachers and counselors of the students to better grasp their backgrounds and particular predicaments (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000). 

Lastly, despite criticisms of standardized testing, the proficient teachers of today do not accept that their students have limitations, or are incapable of learning any given concept. Instead these teacher work hard everyday to make material relevant for their children and develop lesson plans that speak to individual lesson plans.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Tips to Narrow Achievement Gaps'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;
 
1. Ask parents to talk to their kids and explain 
the importance of education to them; that education is a 
necessary step to professional success in America.(In a 
study high achievers commonly had parents that expressed 
these views.)(Lee, 1994)

2. Assess students often to keep track of their progress 
and give encouragement throughout the school year.

3. Understand that poor assessments might be the result 
of language barriers or a stressful home environment, 
have a plan to address these types of issues(Lee, 1994).&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;Questions==
&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;1. A student that scores in the 90th percentile on a standardized test like the SOL has scored how?
     a)Better than 90 percent of his/her peers.
     b)Worse than 90 percent of his/her peers.
     c)Worse than 90 of his/her peers.
     d)Better than 90 of his/her peers.

2. Which of these is NOT a criticism of standardized testing?
     a)It is unreliable.
     b)Its' results can be used by teachers and the educational system as a whole to improve their methods.
     c)It is racially biased because it asks questions that are unrelated to some students' culture.
     d)It puts unreasonable pressure on students and teachers to do well.

3. A teacher has just reviewed the results from this years SOL.  She notices that even her students who received high scores in both the math and verbal seemed to fail to grasp long division. She should...
     a)Focus on verbal instruction since the students did well in that area.
     b)Use the same verbal instruction method year after year since that seemed to work and reform her long division plans.
     c) Reteach the lesson in long division and find a reliable teacher whose students did well on that part of the test for some ideas on how to improve her instruction.
     d) Give up, these disadvantaged kids are incapable of learning anything anyway!

4. A quiet, hard working young Asian student Chris Young is getting farther and farther behind in his studies and has done poorly on the reading portion of his SOL.  He refuses to go to after school help sessions and only socializes with other Asian students. All of the following might encourage this student to do better EXCEPT...
     a)Give Chris a sheet of resources that offer online help to students with language barriers.  Being online might reduce any embarrassment he may have in learning English as a second language if this is a problem he is encountering.
     b)Discuss his progress with his family. In some Asian cultures failure is seen as an embarrassment and Chris might not admit that he is having difficulty before it is too late.
     c)Create lesson plans that allow for group work so that Chris has a chance to socialize with different types of students and might be more comfortable with getting help.
     d)Ignore the issue Asian kids ALWAYS do better on things like standardized testing, this is obviously a failure of the test!

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; 
&lt;big&gt;
*	After reading this article the reader will have gained knowledge about what standardized testing is and the drawbacks it not only brings to students but as well as the teachers. The article will also present other affective methods of assessing students.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


='''&lt;big&gt;A little History&lt;/big&gt;''' = 
Standardized tests are given from 3rd grade all the way through 12th grade, and for some students, as well as the teachers that are required to give them, when presented with these tests they are filled with a feeling of anxiety and fear.  What is a standardized test? The North Central Regional Educational Laboratory defines a standardized test as âone that is administered under standardized or controlled conditions that specify where, when, how, and for how long children may respond to the questions or promptsâ (Learning Point Associates). Standardized tests have been required in the United States since 1965 when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (also known as ESEA) was passed. This act gave federal funds to public school, to make sure the money was being put to good use the government mandated that schools give standardized test (Popham). Then with the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) passed in 2002 has put more pressure on public schools regarding standardized tests scores. The NCLB states that teachers of core academic subjects in a school that receives federal funds, must be highly qualified (American Federation of teachers). The state and federal government can determine what they feel is highly qualified by standardized test scores, if a school performs under average for consecutive years that school is in danger of losing federal funds. Does standardized testing really measure how well a school or teacher is doing their job? The answer is no. There are several reasons why standardized tests should no longer be used to assess a studentâs understanding of material.

='''&lt;big&gt;Teaching for the Test&lt;/big&gt;'''=
The phrase âteaching for the testâ simply means that teachers teach curriculum that is likely to appear on a standardized test and drill this information into their students (The Center for Public Education). This can lead to students simply memorizing the information instead of learning and therefor retaining the material even after the test has been given.  This can also lead to  narrower curriculum and excluding material that while vital is not tested. There is also the fear of devoting to much classroom time to prepping for the tests which can produce severely stressed students as well as teachers (The Center for Public Education). With so much pressure being placed on students and teachers to succeeed what happens to creativity in the classroom?
'''
='''&lt;big&gt;Creativity Crisis&lt;/big&gt;'''=
When teachers have to worry about meeting test standards and have to teach for the test, creativity gets put on the backburner and with it is a childâs excitement to learn. When a teacher whether it be a new or experienced, are handed a large binder at the beginning of the year with the curriculum that needs to be taught, it can be overwhelming. Creativity sparks interest into students; with so much time is monopolized by preparing for the tests, teachers have little time to come up with creative lesson plans.

='''&lt;big&gt;Test Anxiety Attack&lt;/big&gt;'''=
Clarkson College defines test anxiety as âbeing so afraid or worried about a test that performance suffersâ (Clarkson College). Some symptoms of test taking anxiety are; increased heart rate,dizziness,sweating,stomach or head ache, feelings of low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, and there are many other(Zbordnik)  The fear can be so strong that no matter how long the student spent preparing for the test, once the students looks at the test, all previous knowledge is forgotten. The TestEdge National Demonstration Study reported on the Institute of HeartMath site, stated that 61% of high school students suffer from test anxiety and from 61%, 26% are handicapped by their anxiety. This information shows that perhaps students should be assessed by using one or many of other assessment methods.

='''&lt;big&gt;Conclusion&lt;/big&gt;'''=
There are many reasons as to why standardized tests are not the best form of assessment and this article has only scratched the surface as to why. Standardized test are not the only form of assessing someoneâs knowledge and we should explore the other methods of assessment.

&lt;u&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a high-stress atmosphere of merit-based pay for teachers and a push for testing achievement, researchers are concentrating their efforts in to strategies and research that can help improve scores.  Additionally, because Asian youth are a racial and ethnic minority that is outperforming other groups, many researchers are exploring aspects of their culture that may aid achievement.  Unfortunately, amidst race for better scores, students are left along the wayside.  New research on the topic suggests that achievement is a complicated issue that must be matched with a comprehensive approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Testing Bias'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFB5D;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Onion&lt;/u&gt; makes fun of the controversial topic of testing bias by posting imaginary testimonials:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Gus Browning,&lt;br&gt;
Accountant&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I see no reason why any high-school senior shouldn't be able to answer questions about basic yachting terminology.&quot;(&lt;i&gt;The Onion&lt;/i&gt;, 1997)  &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are conflicting views when it comes to the topic of testing bias.  On one hand, Fredreka Schouten of &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; suggests, if we take away all bias then &quot;Florida 10-year-olds shouldn't be expected to compose essays about blizzardsâ¦&quot; (Schouten, 2004).  She goes on to list other &quot;testing taboos&quot; (Schouten, 2004) that range from reasonable to ridiculous.  On the other hand,  John Tanner, former Delaware testing director,  states, &quot;Testing is a stressful enough experience for kids.  We want to make sure there is nothing that would cause the child to stumble&quot; (Schouten, 2004).  These two views represent the two main arguments to be found.  In order to overcome the testing bias obstacle, whether one sees it as real or perceived, it is important to find a middle ground.  &quot;'The United States is obviously a country of many, many cultures, &quot;says Ravitch, a New York University professor and author of &lt;i&gt;The Language Police:  How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;If we accommodate everyone's taboos, then we don't have the kind of zone where we can say 'This is reality, and it's OK to learn about it.'&quot; (Schouten, 2004)  Thus, a proper balance must be met.  Yet, does the achievement gap problem stop with the test bias?  Most research suggests that the achievement gap is a more complicated issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;u&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Achievement Gap'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Michigan Association of School Boards Journal states that &quot;Mistakenly, many people think the [achievement] gap as measured by standardized tests is the result of what happens in school.  But assessments of young children reveal a sizable achievement gap before children start schoolâ¦&quot; (MASB, 2001)  Thus, it comes as no surprise that African-American and Hispanic children lag behind White and Asian groups in both test scores and socio-economic status (MASB, 2001).  No doubt, the reasons behind low test scores are a &quot;complex combination of school, community, and home factors&quot; (MASB, 2001).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''What can be done?''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If test bias and environment are both factors in the achievement gap, what can be done?  A glimpse in to what has been shown to narrow the gap in the past may be of assistance.  In the 1970's and 1980's government assistance programs like Head Start and Title I significantly closed the testing gap (MASB, 2001).  Studies show that programs with emphasis on early education continue to narrow the gap (Fight Crime, 2006).  It must not go without saying that African American and Hispanic groups have made significant gains since the instatement of these programs (MASB, 2001).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Educator Peggy Groover instills a love for reading and writing at the same time as improving test scores in &lt;i&gt;Joseph and the Achievement Gap&lt;/i&gt;.  Grover states, &quot;Joseph struggled in my 7th grade literature class. He didn't like to read and was reluctant to write. He was not alone. Like many of the African American boys in my literature classes, Joseph had low or failing grades.&quot; (Groover, 2005)  Groover wanted to do something about this problem so she started by putting a 1996 study by Anne Simpson to the test (Groover, 2005).  Simpson's test stated that &quot;class reading selections frequently do not reflect African American preferences, nor do they feature characters African Americans relate to&quot; (Groover, 2005).  Thus, Groover introduced two novels with African American characters in addition to the two novels with all-white characters that were already a part of the curriculum.  Groover states, &quot;African American boys averaged scores between 65 and 71 on the novels with white characters only&quot; (Groover, 2005).  However, the scores went up &quot;between 87 and 93&quot; for the novels with African American characters (Groover, 2005).  In order for students to do well on reading and writing they must enjoy and relate to books to begin with.  With an increase in a joy for reading, students are more likely to improve in comprehension, vocabulary, mechanical, and grammatical skills.  

&lt;u&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#43C6DB&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Finallyâ¦''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In order to take on the subject of testing bias and achievement gaps, we cannot just look at performing more testing.  A multi-faceted approach to improving test scores must be utilized if we wish to make any gains in this field.  We may longer rely on outdated teaching methods for a thriving classroom.

== Superior Race In Intelligence, Or Biased Testing?&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt; ==


By Wendy Belgrave



== Learning Targets ==

* Understand how standardized testing can be biased 

* Understand how social factors influence success



== Introduction ==

We have all heard the stereotype. We canât get away from it.  The word is out, in schools and movies all across the nation and maybe even all over the world.  The word is that Asian students are smarter than everyone else.  Racial gaps in standardized tests show this to be true, but could there be more to that?  Could it be that these tests could be biased, or could there be other social factors involved?

== I Want The Asian In My Group ==

Mission San Jose High School in Fremont California is considered one of the best public schools in the country.  This school raises the controversial question since 75 percent of the students are Asian (CNN 2008).  The principle himself admits that he believes that the success of his school is directly associated with the Asian population.  According to the CNN, the top 5 schools in California are majority Asian. They also say that Asian students score higher than their white peers, nationally Asians lead in grade point average, and are more likely to take higher level math courses.  

With these statistics on hand, what does the principle at Mission San Jose think about our controversial question?   His direct belief as to why that isâ¦ âThe parents come from a system where they all teach for a test.â  Hazel Marcus, a Stanford University Cultural Psychologist says that Asian students are not naturally more intelligent than other students, and that there are no biological or genetic differences in between races.  An Asian student at Thomas Nelson Community College commented, âItâs our parents.  My parents push me more on subjects like math and science.  My parents arenât so bad, but I have friends whose parents push them really hard (VU 2008).â  Since there is nothing physical that makes Asians smarter, maybe the question should be, are there other factors involved?

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFB5D;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Asian and white students saw their scores increase this year, by 5 and 4 points, respectively, across the three parts of the SAT. Score averages for minority groups other than Asians were down by 6 to 8 points across the three exams (Inside Higher Ed 2008).&lt;/table&gt;

Check out this website to view the CNN special on &quot;Are Asians Students Smarter&quot;. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opBfHXePM2Y

== Biased Perhaps? ==

With the Asian students aside for a bit, let us now ask the question.  Could the standardized tests be biased? The bias does not necessarily target one race or culture; it could affect many at a time.  What about the student that is struggling to learn the language, the student that becomes overwhelmed by the pressure of a timed test, or the student whose parents cannot afford the luxury of hiring a tutor specifically for the purpose of SAT testing.  What about the little girl in Alaska who is asked to fill in the blank about trees; Trees are ____. a) short b) food c) green.  I do not believe that test makers are purposefully trying to make the test biased, but it may just be a difficult task to make a test that fits all lifestyles and cultures.

== Blame It On Social Status ==

One commentator Jonathan Pollard had this catchy subtitle, âStandardized tests are great at ensuring that poor kids become poor adults.â  He blames the âpoor schoolsâ for spending money on standardized tests taking materials instead of using the money to hire better teachers.  He also believes that standardized tests do not test intelligence but âtend to focus on short term memory and actual test-taking ability rather than genuine understanding (Pollard 2008).  Many complain that to close the academic achievement gap, money must be spent more equally in lower class school districts.  

Although some may be able to blame social status on poor test results, others such as Hazel Marcus states that education in prized in most Asian cultures and âacademic success is a childâs duty to his family.  It is your job, it is what you are supposed to do to bring honor to your family; to be educated (Marcus 2008).â My Asian friend agrees, âSocial status has nothing to do with the drive to educate yourself, it is not just luck, it is the ability to make good decisions.  There are many people out there that do it every day (Vu 2008).â

== Conclusion ==

So the age old question remains, are Asians more intelligent than other people? No.  More disciplined?  Some may think so.  But regardless of what people may think, every person has a chance to become educated here in the United States regardless of race, or gender.  There may be factors that may put some people ahead but regardless of that, it cannot stop a person from being important.  Martin Luther King is a perfect example of what society might say is not good enough.  âMartin Luther King Jr., considered one of the greatest orators in history, scored in the third quartile, or below average, on the verbal portion of the Graduate Record Exam, a standardized test taken to get into graduate school (Facts on File, 1999).â Martin Luther King's example cautions against overreliance on standardized tests as a measure of students' potential.

In the school that I work at I have observed many methods of assessments.  Some methods that I have observed and done are the Jeopardy game, the SmartBoard, the computer and hands-on assignments. All of these are great tools for assessing students.

I have done assessments myself, not knowing that I was doing it.  When the teacher I worked with would have something else to do,a meeting or getting caught up on grades for the gradebook,  she would get me to get work together for the students, so I would make worksheets on the material they would be going over in the classroom.  Now that I know a lot more about assessments I will be looking for what students know and what they are having trouble with.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 21:37, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Throughout my observation hours, one of the things I saw very little of was formal assessments. I think this is due to the fact that the school year was very close to ending. Many of the teachers were completing grades and were not administering any more formal tests; however, I saw many assignments and activities that tested the children's knowledge and skills in other ways.

In a third grade class in Virginia Beach, the students were working on creating &quot;Flip&quot; books. These were little books that they were writing and illustrating to discuss a topic of their choice that had been covered during the school year. It was so amazing to see the variety of topics that were chosen and how each child found interest in something different. A large portion of my time in the classroom was helping students edit their work. Although this was not formal testing, they really were being tested on their writing skills, knowledge of topic material, etc. It was a fun and exiting way to let the children voice their opinion about the most interesting topic learned but it was done in an organized way. The teachers really liked to see what the children had to say and in a way this was summative in allowing the teachers to see (at the end of the year) the most frequently chosen topics and why children enjoyed them. It was a fun and exciting project and I'm so glad I was able to be a part of it! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 14:38, 1 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002

I have not yet completed my 30 hour observation, but I will speak about assessment from my prior years in school. During most of my school career, teachers viewed assessments as giving tests and grades. This was not a good practice for the students who performed poorly on tests but showed other evidence of learning.There was not much understanding of assessment in a dynamic and success-oriented classroom, and some teachers even ignored assessment and only did it when they had to. There were not assessments conducted while learning was taking place, and most assessments were formal and took place at the end of a chapter or unit. 

Through the lectures and readings, I have found that the current practices of assessment that many teachers are implementing in the classroom are much more effective than the past practices I witnessed. For example, assessment is not just about tests, and students can be given multiple ways to express their learning. More students become engaged in this processa and more students learn. It is also not necessary for assessment to always be formal. Some of the most valuable insights from students come from moments that teachers do not typically associate with assessment. Informative assessment can occur anytime during the learning process and does not always have to occur at the end of the chapter or unit. These insights that I have learned about assessment will greatly help me in my future teaching career. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 22:45, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

Throughout the summer we have talked about using formative and summative assessments.  During my observation I was not able to see these actually in the works.  I feel teachers are still in the state that summative assessments are what is still being used which i do not totally agree with and i believe there are many more ways to assess a students achievements.  And, I would say that by using formative assessments is a great way for teachers to see how they are teaching.  It is something that is desperately needed for a classroom so the teachers holds themselves accountable for a students progress. 

I wish there had ben more formative and summative assessments used..not for grades necessarily.  Just to see the students progression.  I think overall the teacher was doing a great job with the students and it was interesting to see the testing format used in the classroom and how each teacher formatted their tests differently.   [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 17:00, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I really like the idea of formative assessments.  I don't remember seeing it when I was a student but I do see it in my children's classrooms.  I believe formative assessments really help a teacher &quot;fine tune&quot; their teaching and help the students understand their own strengths and weaknesses.  I particularly like that assessments don't have to be formal to be effective.  That takes a lot of pressure off some students and helps them focus on what they need to work on.  Assessments need not always be quizzes either.  Using Bloom's Taxomony is a great way to check student's understanding of concepts.

I know that during this class we have learned many things about assessment, but none of these things seemed to apply at the school where I completed my observations. I suppose this entry could also go under &quot;Classroom Management&quot; but the problems really were the students' faults and not the teacher'.
I observed chorus class at a middle school in Suffolk. The sad thing was, since students are required to take some kind of arts class, most of the students were only taking the class for the &quot;easy A&quot;. Also, and equally as unfortunate, the school board does not value arts classes as much as &quot;core classes&quot; so the arts teachers are told to &quot;take it easy&quot; on their students. 
The final exam that the students received was about the movie West Side Story. Since the students refused to watch the movie because it was a &quot;stupid musical that made no sense&quot; they obviously had a difficult time with a very simple test about it (the test had questions like, &quot;describe maria in three words&quot; and &quot;what were the two gangs called?&quot;). I was shocked at the classes' reaction when they received the test: the entire class began to exclaim that the test was &quot;way to hard&quot; and &quot;totally unfair&quot; and that the questions were &quot;made up&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;. Despite constant demands from the teacher for the students to stop talking during a test, they all kept talking louder and louder until many of them were yelling. Like all schools, this school has a policy that states that students are not allowed to talk during an exam because of obvious reasons. Because of this, many of the students failed the exam for yelling during it. It was unbelievable and completely unacceptable.

The classroom that I conducted my observation in made plenty use of assessments! She would have reader worksheets that she would send home with the students to check their understanding of the readings. She would then require the students to compile all of their reader worksheets together, so that they could use them as a study guide for the SOLS, quizzes and tests. She had quizzes frequently as a method to prepare the students for the SOLS, and also to refresh information that they learned so they would constantly be repeating the information from the beginning of the school year to the end of the year. She valued assessments because it enabled her to give the students feedback, and also for the students to receive feedback from her. I feel that assessments are a great tool, and many of my teachers in the past not just my observation teacher have used assessments as well. I feel that she made a great use of assessments by constantly refreshing the students' minds with information. Even if it were just for ten or fifteen minutes at the beginning of class as a bell ringer exercise, which she often did, it allowed the students to keep the information fresh so they could remember it more efficiently.

Formative assessments were not used very often throughout my education. Occasionally we would use very broad rubrics in high school to grade one another and sometimes teachers would ask us what we thought of a test. Often, this resulted in the changing of one or two multiple choice questions and that was it. I think my former instructors would’ve been much improved by the use of formative assessment rather than focusing upon numerical values, and I hope that formative assessment has caught on more in recent years especially with the lower grade levels.

I have not yet completed my 30-hour observation and I am sure assessment methods have changed since my time in school.  However, after completing a lot of reading on this particular topic, I understand that almost anything can be used as a method for assessing students.  I specifically remember writing samples used as formative assessments during my early years of school.  I also remember many multiple-choice exams (which I do not agree with) and open note quizzes.  Most of my experience with assessment as a child came from the “set you up for failure” mentality.  I remember teachers not giving great reviews, guessing what I had to study, and then hoping and praying I learned the right material.  This is not the school of thought I will abide by in my teaching career.  I will make more of an effort to have my students all achieve their highest potential.  There will be no guessing in my classroom.  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 19:49, 3 August 2009 (UTC)


During my observation i noticed that the director used a couple different types of assessment. One of the main assessments were the playing tests. These consitted of the entire section or the individual players to play a selected passage from the piece of music they were preparing in front of the rest of the ensemble. This is a way for the director to tell who knows their music and who is grasping the concepts that are being taught. Another form of assessment that i noticed was a more traditional paper format. Once or twice during my observation the director passed out workshhets that contained questions that related to the music they were playing. For instance, he had them define certain terms that appear in the music. I think that this helps  in the learning of the music.

The best teachers that I have had personally and the ones my children have had are the teachers that have good control over the classroom.  These teachers have managed to maintain discipline without sacrificing personality.  I hope that I will be able to find that balance when I teach.  I managed a restaurant for ten years before returning to school and I had at times over forty employees working for me. I let them know that they are working for me but that I am also working with them. There was clear manager line that if crossed resulted in disciplinary action however, I was always available when needed.  Lead by example, children learn by seeing and doing not by lecture, this holds true for behavior. The sudents will know that I am in charge but that I am approachable.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:04, 8 August 2009 (UTC) 

I have not done my observations yet, but I will be talking about my observations as I see them being a teacher's assistant. I have had the experience of going into a teacher's classroom where there is complete classroom management and a teacher's classroom where there was no classroom management at all.  The teacher's classroom where there is classroom management is one of calm, fun, and cooperation. Students do what they are asked of them and end of story.  The teacher's classroom where there is no classroom management is chaos and confusion.  A person can tell that this teacher has no control over her students or the class.  The teachers have to set the tone on how the classroom is managed, and if the teacher does not take control from the first day of school then it is going to be a rough year. [[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 21:05, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Classroom management is a critical part of any child's education.  Before learning can occur, behavior must be controlled and expectations be established.  Working with young students can be especially difficult if effective classroom management practices are not utilized.  As a PE teacher, establishing routine is an integral part of my management practices.  I also establish rules early.  My rules are few, yet critical for a successful learning environment.  They are simply written.  Finally, I also implement a first-then activity schedule that is especially effective with young students.  They realize they must first complete an activity to be rewarded with a second activity.  Usually, they must follow my directions to complete exercises then if done successfully, they are rewarded with a game they enjoy playing.

I have not been able to complete my observation yet, but I will talk about my daughter's Pre-school teacher.  I have had the opportunity to witness her classroom management skills.  She is very experienced and has been teaching Pre-school for a long time.  When I was in my daughter's class I was amazed in how she handled all those 3/4 year olds so effectively.  Her classroom climate, the look and feel of her classroom, is very welcoming.  It has a lot of color, teaching materials are all around and class rules were clearly posted.  

One day I was there dropping off my daughter, and I witnessed one young boy really getting out of hand.  She was very quick to respond to his misbehavior.  She first tried some non-verbal cues but had to advance to verbal communication.  The problem was quickly taken care of in a positive way.  She stayed calm and had lots of patience.  It definitely seems every time I am at her school I witness something crazy.  The phrase &quot;expect the unexpected&quot; really seems to apply when managing a classroom.  I see now that as teachers we need to be flexible in responding to the &quot;unexpected.&quot;   We also need to be FAIR to all students.

I believe I mentioned this before, but during my observation my assigned teacher had a unique way of dealing with undone work. She would make a student sign a sheet listing the reason why they had not completed a particular assignment– they would continue to do so and would be held in detention or ISS until they finished whatever it is they didn't do, and when completed it would receive an auto 60. She proclaimed she did not believe in zeros, and if someone was going to sit in her class, she felt obligated to make them do the work and learn, no matter what. I commended her on an approach that was albeit a bit foreign to me, but it seemingly worked, except for one or two students that just outright refused everything out of four classes. I have a hard time getting behind this, but it seems less apathetic than simply handing out zeros. Zeros just seem so overtly negative to me now, essentially dooming someone to an academic hell. It could be their fault, but it seems they can be remedied into a better student using other measures. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 21:51, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

The classroom I observed the teacher was a veteran and really handled the classroom well.  The students obviously understood their boundaries and they really worked well for the students.  As an incentive for the end of the week there was a prize box for eveyone that behaved.  I think one of the more important things was the teacher would let the student earn back a card if it had to be taken away.  I found this to be a great incentive for the student and it would give them hope that they could earn it back by changing their attitude and doing what was expected.  This would always work for the students.  

I also appreciated the tone the teacher would use with the children.  She would seldom raise her voice and always treated them like an individual of equal stature.  It was great to see the classroom working together and understanding what needed to be done. The teacher also believed in not sending students out of the classroom unless they were causing harm to another or themselves.  I thought this was a great attitude and she was taking responsibility for the actions of her class and taking car of them.  I feel sometimes students want to be sent out because they are off the hook. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 17:12, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


The classroom that I was in the teacher had been there over fifteen years and knew the ins and outs of classroom management. She was able to be firm, but still respectful in the way she spoke and managed the students. One of the key phrases that she liked to use was &quot;there is no talking&quot;, and it seemed to work everytime. She would never raise her voice, she would just say that one phrase and they knew to be quiet. She would threaten at times to give them detention slips, and would walk around and place them on the desks infront of them at times as a warning, but she told me in our conversations that she has only actually written up two students in her whole career. Even when I was doing lessons in the class, they were respectful of me because of the expectations she told them for when I was infront of the class. I appreciated that the teacher would seldom raise her voice, she was in a seventh grade classroom, and I was in awe that she kept her patience and didn't raise her voice with the students. She would also often play Simon Says with them, as a method to calm the students down if they were getting too out of hand. I will definitely say the most important thing she taught me was classroom management. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 02:44, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I spent my observations at a local elementary school where chaos seemed to permeate the hallways. The first classroom I observed in was a kindergarten class. I found through my observation in this classroom, some techniques the teacher tried to employ, did not seem to phase the kids because there were no consequences that mattered to the children. When the children became noisy, she would put on a microphone attached to her pocket so she could speak over the children. One child, in particular, was allowed to run around the classroom during class circle time. The teacher said that he would join the group in his own time. However, during my 15 hour observations, I did not see him join the class once on any of the projects. As for classroom management, this classroom received a C because it was late in the school year, the children were kindergartners, and the teacher did not seem to set any boundaries to maintain classroom management.
The second classroom I observed in, was a classroom that I feel compelled to discuss. In terms of classroom management, there was none. The teacher called it &quot;controlled chaos&quot;. In order to &quot;control&quot; the kids, the teacher would either play on their sympathies (which did not always work) by telling them she was not feeling well or she would put in a movie. During my observation there were only a couple of occasions where the students actually did some school work for about 10 minutes each. This particular teacher had been teaching for over 30 years so I made the assumption that her techniques would be something I could mimic and employ in my future classroom. However, this was not the case. Students were allowed to freely walk around the classroom. It would be understandable if they were walking around gathering information for an assignment, but they were not. The whole classroom time was socialization in its extreme. This was one of the dirtiest classrooms I have been in. There were numerous trashcans around the room, but the students used the floor instead. One of the students in class had ADHD, as the teacher pointed out to me the first day of my observation. If any infraction took place in the classroom, the teacher would directly call out the ADHD student. This student was sent to the office on a regular basis instead of employing other tactics because the teacher said that she did not want to deal with the student.
After all was said and done, I realize that not all schools or classrooms are the same. For one, I observed that many of the teachers were burnt out and did not have that drive they once had. I also noticed that there was not much support from the administration, which goes a long way, in my opinion. It's sad to say, but this particular school really needs an overhaul to redefine what they should be doing.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 20:13, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I observed a 1st grade class for 15 hrs. This teacher was very good with her students and was always able to keep control and focus. She did not have to raise her voice, etc. Instead, if the class were talking over her, she would pause and wait for them to quiet themselves. She used the red light, green light method of behavioral management which seemed very effective. She also had a jar of marbles, that she would add to or take out as needed. When the marbles got to the top of the jar, there was some type of reward (I can't remember what the reward was, longer recess or something of that nature perhaps?) There was also a prize box or something that the students with no infractions all week could choose something out of.  I would say that this teacher had very good classroom management skills. Her students were rarely out of line, and when they were she was very quick with re-focusing them. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 00:55, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

As I observed a Spanish 3 class at Princes Anne High School, I was very aware that the teacher had total control. During the first classes as I spoke to the teacher he made it very clear to me that one of the most challenging things was to keep control of the environment of the class. He said that as long as I was able to manage the class in the way that I kept the attention of the students at all time and that they respected me as their teacher that everything else was easy. 

This teacher clearly knew what he was doing. He was always calm and commanded respect for example, everytime he needed to give instructions or teach something if everyone else was talking he would stand ion the front of the class and stay quiet until everyone was quiet and then proceeded. I was amazed to see that this worked everytime. Students would quickly be quiet and tell each other to be quiet so that he could start the class. He always showed respect to his students to be able to demand it in return. I found this to be very helpful and most likely will try this technique when I start teaching.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 02:39, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Throughout my observation time, I witnessed so many examples of cooperative learning taking place in the classroom. The Virginia Beach Public Schools, as well as many other school districts in Virginia, use the Kagan method which promotes group work and cooperation. I have found this method to be so successful in all of the grade levels that I have observed and I hope to use it in my own classroom as well! 

Cooperative learning is a science.  It is a method of placing students in the right types of groups to explore, learn, and create.  I do not remember many cooperative learning situations throughout my entire education.  I remember working with partners of my choice.  I remember dreading certain small group activities, where the teacher decided who we were to work with.  My small group experiences were usually meant to complete only random assignments.  I never felt a sense of community from these groups or the understanding of how to work with everyone’s strengths and weaknesses.  After reading, I hope to incorporate the “science”” of cooperative learning in my class.  I hope to utilize Kagan structures so that students get the most from these types of learning situations.

I was able to see the 5th graders in a Virginia Beach classroom working on a group project and incorporating cooperative learning into this assignment. The teacher encouraged the students to listen to one another, value each others opinions and work together nicely. The students worked on creating a board game that included all the different subjects into the questions and theme of the game. I must say that these were some of the most creative kids I have ever seen. The ideas they came up with in a short period of time were incredible! I attribute a big part of this to the teacher and her ability to encourage the children to work together. They were able to come up with such great ideas because they all offered suggestions and opinions that were used in the project. The cooperative learning techniques were very visible in this classroom and it was exciting to see! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 14:18, 1 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002


Cooperative learning is a great tool to engage all learners.  When students participate in small group activities they are engaging their minds and sparking creativity.  Concepts can be reinforced and teachers can find assessment opportunities in a cooperative learning classroom.  This teaching method can be utilized in any subject, area but I have found it particularly useful in the science classroom.  Students can explore new topics, brainstorm to find solutions to research questions, and review previously taught materials.  I also believe cooperative learning environments provide great opportunities for developing social skills and increasing self-esteem.

In a 5th grade classroom in Mecklenburg County, I observed students working on an Internet safety lesson in a cooperative learning setting.  The teacher introduced the lesson and played a video clip about personal information on the Internet.  The students, with desks in groups of 4-5, worked together to find a solution to the dilemma that was given to each group.  They brainstormed and made a web on newsprint. The teacher walked around the room and made notes about the student's graphic organizers and individual participation. At the conclusion of the activity a spokesperson reviewed the web and the group's decision.  The students had wonderful ideas!  The teacher and I concluded that the students provided answers that she couldn't have come up with due to the generation gap.  This was an example of cooperative learning at its finest.

I watched a 4th grade class use cooperative learning for a weather unit.  The students were excited and engaged.  The teacher assigned small groups different geographical areas to study the weather.  Each student had a different job within the group. The groups completed their tasks then presented their information to the entire class.  When all the groups had finished, the entire class took a test on what had been presented.  As the teacher used good cooperative learning techniques, no one student did more or less than another.  The students enjoyed teaching what they had learned to the other students.

I love cooperative learning techniques and can't wait to use them in my classroom.  I think that besides engaging the students in learning, the students also learn good social skills and that they must depend on each other.  Studies have shown that students who engage in cooperative learning not only learn more, but retain it longer.  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 21:40, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


I completed my observation in a 4th grade classroom and also a K-2 special education classroom.  In the 4th grade classroom there were many opportunities for the class to participate in cooperative learning.  The teacher had passed out a review guide for the students to complete in class and then finish up at home for homework.  The teacher had them organize into table groups and review their answers, if they had any questions that they could not come to a consensus they were to raise their hands and then the helper student, that had received 100% on the assignment would come around and give them the correct answer.  I liked the way the students interacted with each other and really listened to each other's answers.  I will definitely use this practice when I am a teacher.  Although I did observe at the end of the school year and the students were very comfortable with directions and each other, I would be curious if there would be as much cooperation at the start of the school year.  In the other classroom that I observed the students all had different jobs that they would be assigned that would give them responsibility in the classroom. Some of those tasks involved small groups and passing out papers and materials for a project.  I also had the great pleasure of doing a picnic with this class and the children played very well with each other using group oriented games and activities.  It was a fabulous experience in both settings and I treasure those times with all of the students.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 23:54, 31 July 2009 (UTC)


I completed half of my observation this summer in Hampton in a 1st grade classroom. I noticed a reasonable amount of cooperative learning. All of students' desks were positioned in groups which made it easy for them to ask each other questions and participate in group work. Throughout the several days that I visited this class, I also saw the teacher dividing the room up into different centers. One center was a board game that involved addition, another was a long mat that had the alphabet on it that the students could use to spell out words. It was interactive and would give the students feedback on spelling the world correctly. There were several centers, all with interactive games, puzzles, etc., that would require the students to work together and use cooperative learning. 

I think that cooperative learning is a great way for students to not only learn, but also build very important skills for the future. At this age, they are learning valuable social skills as well as accountability and interdependence. I am very curious to see how cooperative learning is different when I visit a higher grade level in the fall. I would think that there would be more advanced assignments that may give more defined &quot;roles&quot; to each group member. I can definitely see the value of cooperative learning in our schools and will certainly take advantage of this practice in my classroom in the future.

I observed several Spanish classes at princess Anne Hight School, in which I observed allot of cooperative learning. Being that the class was to learn another language it is very difficult for some and easier for others. The teacher encouraged allot of work in groups, the use of dictionaries and for students to ask other students that were more familiar with the language for help. It was very interesting seeing how students on a day to day teach and learn from each other.

In many occasions I noticed that when the students worked together, they had mor fin with the assignments and also participated more. During the class there were many instances where the students needed to go to the board and write an answer during a debate. Students reaching to other students instead of asking the teacher was really good to see. I think that when there is someone other than the teacher that the students can reach for help it eases the load of the teacher. Having students interact with each other for the purpose of learning was a great thing to witness and I hope to see more of it in my future career.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 02:33, 3 August 2009 (UTC)


Cooperative learning is one of the biggest part of the music experience. There were several different techniques that were used to hwlp a student better understand an articulation or a rhythm. For instance, the advanced band was playing a piece that was very percussive with heavy articulation. The director had one of the percussionists demonstrate on a marimba to demonstrate the articulation that he was looking for. I think that coming from a performers stand point that is a very good way to look at the proper way to play something. Using one students ability to aid in the teaching of another, if that's not cooperative learning I'm not sure what is.

I attended a predominately white, Catholic school as an adolescent and upon entering high school I began going to public school where I quickly became the minority.  I remember feeling out of place at times.  I observed kindergarten and fourth grade and noticed many differences in regards to diversity in the classroom.  In kindergarten I noticed more children played with each other of different diversities than in the fourth grade class I observed.  When I observed fourth grade I found many of the girls had their own &quot;cliques&quot; and hung more with their familiarities than all the children in the kindergarten class. However, when the children were working in a group or with the classroom tables most of the children got along with all their classmates.

I have not yet completed my 30 hour observation, so I will write about my experiences with diversity in the classroom during my school years. During my school career, I do not feel that diversity was appropriately addressed in the classroom. Cultural differences were not as accepted as they are today, and cultural interaction patterns were not accommodated. Teachers tried the best they could to address diversity, however, most were biased to students who grew up in the same culture as they did. 

These days, I feel that diversity is more appropriately addressed in the classroom. Diversity comes in many forms: cultural, gender, sexual identity, language, ability and intelligence. Most teachers accept and value cultural differences and express an interest in their students' culture and background. Teachers will accommodate cultural interaction patterns and they will build on students' backgrounds. Most teachers will try to connect with the local community, provide opportunities for success for all students, and actively challenge social injustice. To do this, it is necessary these days for teachers to acknowledge personal fears, barriers and ignorance, and to develop ideas for overcoming them. Respect is shown to all students, and uniqueness is celebrated. I plan to use these methods in my future classroom to celebrate diversity with all students. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 23:16, 20 July 2009 (UTC)


Diversity in the classroom is an issue that is often overlooked.  While many equate diversity with ethnicity, it also refers to gender, language, and overall ability.  Many teachers focus only on what they see on the outside and fail to address intrinsic differences.  As educators, we must look at the &quot;total student&quot; and be sensitive to their needs.  Make an effort to understand your students and celebrate diversity in your classroom.

My observations were done in a school, were I floated around many different science classes. Do to the diversity of the different classes and the grade levels I was able to observe several different types diversity. The freshman mandatory biology class (which was the class I observed daily the others were a random variety) was the most diverse, as far as learning styles, levels of learning, and ethnicity. Although there were a few cliquey moments for the most part the class act and were treated as one group. This class was one of that showed to me how effective teachers run their class.

The 1st grade teacher that I observed did a fabulous job addressing the diverse cultures and languages found in her classroom.  Out of 15 students, 5 were Hispanic and spoke little English.  Those students received services once a week from the ESL teacher.  However, each day the teacher managed to incorporate Spanish into her calendar time. During this time students review concepts including months, days of the week, date, numbers, letters, colors, weather, etc.  When the initial review is complete, calendar time is repeated in Spanish.  What a great way to teach a second language to the class while making the other children feel welcome in this learning environment.  It is definitely an idea I will use if I am in a primary classroom.   [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 00:44, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I had many experiences with diversity in classroom settings.  For my observation I was with a younger group of students and I do not find that there are many diversity problems.  I do feel though that this is an important time to introduce these young students to a variety of cultures and people and hopefully form an appreciation for all people.  I believe this early base will have a lot of benefits for the future in grade level and further on in their life.  

During the class I observed there was a large number of diversity but I did not witness and problems within the classroom.  I think the teacher or the students have done a great job in adapting to their surroundings and accepting the class for who they all are.  I have been in an experience where there were cultural problems and this is where the teacher would step in and form groups for them to work together team tasks.  It was great to see the growth and changes that were occurring.  [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 17:05, 30 July 2009 (UTC)


I don’t think diversity was addressed very much while I was growing up in school. And I don’t think that was necessarily a bad thing. I don’t know about the rest of the world, but I find myself feeling awkward, nervous, and generally more offended when I see the sweeping generalizations we categorize as “cultural sensitivity”, or whatever other absurd label we’ve slapped on stereotyping these days. Don’t get me wrong, I love culture, and I think everyone should respect cultural backgrounds and limitations. But for the love of God, someone tell the very enlightened white people that the color of your skin or the region you hail from does not define you as a person or dictate your actions. 
Let me give an example from this class. Did anyone look at that diversity PowerPoint? Did anyone not burst into uncontrollable fits of laughter? Because I know I did. It was very much the PC way of saying, “ all(insert color or ethnicity) are (insert stereotype).” I just think that very often these programs seem to have the opposite of their intended effect. Don’t get it twisted, I love not being white in this country, for one thing I don’t get sun burned. For another, I have access to strange smelling and wonderful foods. But for the love of God when will white people stop reminding me that I’m hard working, good at math, stoic and humble? Do people really not realize how racist it is? It’s pleasantly racist sure, but if I’m all those things it stands to reason I’m the stereotypical opposites as well.  While those attributes are what I’m given on the page everyone is surely rattling off the other greatest hits smelly, slant eyed and poorly endowed.    [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 15:34, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I feel compelled to post my response under the &quot;BitterAsianMan&quot; :-)  
I thought the PowerPoint was funny as well.  I actually told my husband about it.  He teaches fire department stuff for the state of VA.  He said that he was told it was PC to never call the white board a &quot;white board&quot;, nor a black board a &quot;black board&quot;.  Silly stuff!  Are we really that sensitive??  
So anyway, when I was in school until I was well into my high school years I didn't have any black or  Asian kids in any of my classes.  I got all of my diversity from Sesame Street, and I turned out ok.  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:01, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

I have not completed my observation, but as a student that is a minority I would like to voice my opinion on this matter. I feel that diversity in the classroom is great and it helps the students develop social skills, inclusiveness, and understanding of people who are culturally and/or racially different. I think that if teachers could take this issue a little bit more seriously it would be a better learning atmosphere for all. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 17:28, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

In the future I plan on teaching Spanish, so I feel that this topic was one of the most important for me to observe because it is mostly the reason why I want to teach. I observed three different Spanish level classes at Princess Ann High School and they were all diverse. From Spanish speaking children to children from other races to Causian and African American students in the class, they all showed to get along. Diversity was everywhere I looked in the school. 

In class I observed that many students looked for guidance from the Spanish speaking students. During one of the classes I had the opportunity to talk to the students and ask them why they wanted to learn Spanish. Some said they just needed the credit, but others said that they would like to know the language because it is interesting to them, and also that they would be able to travel to Spanish speaking countries and not have that language barrier. There was a student in particular who his grandparents were native from Spain and they only spoke Spanish. He wanted to learn the language to be able to communicate with his grandparents. As a future foreign language teacher I am motivated by most of these reasons why a student would want lo learn another language. I think that the world is becoming more diverse everyday. I think that as humans we should want to learn from other cultures and probably embrace things from it. Diversity is important in every setting, it can be dangerous and complicated but if we all make an effort to respect and learn from other cultures, I think that we will be better off in the long run.

There were a few English language learners in the class that I worked with.  I was surprised to see that there were too many extra resources to help them.  I found that the teacher would give a lot of one on one attention.  Which is great for the one student but I could see it causing a problem overall for the whole classroom.  I would have liked to have seen more visuals used possibly for instruction and other resources for the English language learners.  

The plus was that the students were very bright and caught on very well.  The students would also receive outside services such as ESL for an hour or two.  I always think it is a great thing to have English language learners in a regular ed classroom.  It really gets the few students to grasp concepts a lot quicker and become more adapted.  The teacher I worked with did a great job with all of the students in her classroom.  [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 17:19, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Since I have not completed my observation I can tell of a personal experience being an English learning student myself. It was difficult for me at first and it took time for me to be fluent, but if it was not for the additional resources provided for me, I would still have difficulty even writing this paragraph. For one, I am not saying to give all the attention to ESL students but they are students first and foremost, with a great change upon them. If this matter is overlooked, it can even cause adaptation and behavioral problems because the individual feels secluded. I strongly believe in an inclusive classroom ideal and I think educators should take into account the needs of each student.

Grouping children in today's classrooms is becoming less of a trend compared to previous years.  I can vividly remember going to the cafeteria with 4 other students during naptime to learn to read from &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; while I was in kindergarten.  I was always in the &quot;high&quot; reading group through out elementary school.  In middle and high school, grouping gave way to tracking and I was cruising down the college prep./advanced placement highway. Everyone knew who was considered a smart kid and who was not.  Labeling is a double edged sword.  It could be cool or it could ruin you academically and socially.

In my teaching experiences, my principal discourages grouping in the classroom because she feels it promotes inequality and labeling.  She asserts that we should all be able to teach a child regardless of their &quot;level.&quot;  I came across a unique situation while I was observing in a 5th grade classroom.  While the students were preparing to exchange classes, the reading teacher explained to me that the reading and math classes were grouped.  The two teachers used 4th grade SOL scores, report card grades, and STAR Reading &amp; Math scores to group children according to ability.  I have to admit that I was shocked because I thought very few schools still practiced grouping, and if they did it was at the primary level.  I asked about her feeling of success with this system and she was very happy.  The classes were named Reading 1/2 and Math 1/2, but the students were very aware of the differences.  I also could detect different treatment by the teachers depending on which group they had in the classroom.  I'm sticking to my guns and staying away from grouping, especially at the elementary level.   [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 01:01, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

The school I observed in, grouping was the norm. Students were split up into separate groups for reading and math. Instead of staying in their own classrooms, they were sent to other classroom. One of the problems I observed right off was how the teachers reacted to the switch. It was made known to me in front of the other children, who was low in reading and math. This caused a problem with the children because they were teased by other children and ridiculed by some of the teachers. This is not appropriate behavior from teachers, in my opinnion, and should never be tolerated. I have to say, I was appalled that some of the teachers used poor judgement in regards to students who just required a little extra help. Not only did the students' reactions turn poor, but you could see how this affected the rest of the class time. In reaction to the open communication of their &quot;problem&quot;, students either shut down and did not participate or they started acting out.
Grouping, in and of itself, can be used as a beneficial tool to help those who need that extra one-on-one time. When I worked as a Instructional Assistant in a high school reading class, I did a lot of one-on-one reading with students. One of the things, we started with was giving the kids a survey to see what they hoped to accomplish from the reading class...then we had them set goals and check them off when they reached them. Through tracking their progress and showing them their progress, the outcome from beneficial for not only the students, but myself as well.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 21:21, 1 August 2009 (UTC)


This is a particularly interesting topic to me. My principal highly discourages grouping, however in the same breath boasts about differentiation. I asked her once how to accomplish differentiated instruction, and one of her responses was to teach the excelled students some further extensions of the material and give them more exploratory higher thinking work , while the regular students focus on the main information. Okay, so that's fine but I could not help think how I would manage teaching certain students something but not another group. Well the only thing that comes to mind is grouping by ability, as only one teacher, I must delineate them in some fashion so that I can efficiently differentiate their lesson, but yet at the same time this goes directly against what most textbooks say about ability grouping. Isn't differentiated instruction just another path to ability grouping which in turn still leads to self fulfilling prophecies?

Students with special needs benefit from the social interaction obtained during PE classes with their non-disabled peers.  However, if skill acquisition is the focus, I have found that students with special needs benefit more from adaptive PE classes.  Therefore, my elementary school provides students with special needs the opportunity to attend both inclusive and adaptive PE classes each week.

I have not yet completed my 30 hour observation, so I will write about inclusion from past experiences during my school career. When I was in school, special education students had their own classrooms where they interacted only with other special education students. There were few times when special education students interacted with students in the general classroom. Teachers and administrators believed the best thing to do was to separate the special ed students from the general classroom. However, inclusion has come to show positive effects on both special education students and regular education students. 

Inclusion education means that all students, regardless of their strengths or weaknesses in any area, become part of the school community. They are included in the feeling of belonging among other students, teachers and support staff. The IDEA Act and its 1997 amendments make it clear that schools have a duty to educate children with disabilities in general education classrooms. Studies have shown that special education students who remain in regualar edcuation classrooms outperform those who get pulled out. They have better social adjustment and reported improved behavior. With inclusion, regular education students have improved performance and they become more tolerant of students with disabilities. They become more responsive to others' needs and develop warm friendships. If I work with special education students in my future classroom, I plan to use the inclusion model because of the many benefits it provides.

I observed two classrooms, one of which was a special education classroom.  Those students had different challenges, some of them had developmental delays and some had severe learning disabilities.  All of the students had the ability to participate in learning, there were some that needed extra assistance and reiteration to stay on task.  The greatest part of the observation was the chance to spend a picnic day with the students outside and watch them interact with other children in the first grade setting.  They loved the time that they were included.  I also observed a 4th grade class that had many gifted students.  It is really the opposite of what some would think inclusion means because these students are exceptional learners and generally do well in their classrooms, but I was informed by the teacher that some of those students have a hard time socially and also at times are not accepted by some class members because they have the opportunity to leave the class and the other students see that as unfair.  I experienced this when I was in school as a child.  I was treated unfairly by a teacher that was not happy that I left class to go to gifted, therefore her attitude created a situation that was not positive while in class.  I think that in all aspects, it is important for teachers to remember that each student is an individual.  They will all be different in their learning styles and it is our job to ensure that they all get the chance to find what works for them without feeling different.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 00:27, 1 August 2009 (UTC)


At the high school where I did my observations I only observed one classroom that had students with an IEP. There were several students with various learning disabilities. The special education teacher, who came to the classroom during that class period, assisted all the students in the class. I knew the special education teacher was there because a few of the students required extra help, but because help was available for all the students, if I had not been told ahead of time that it was an inclusive class I would never have known.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 17:18, 2 August 2009 (UT

I have not done my observations yet, but I have some insight on how inclusion is working in schools in Southwest Virginia. While talking to several different regular education teachers they all told me somewhat the same thing; inclusion is working quite well for both the children and the teachers. Some teachers even commented on how nice it was to have an extra teacher in the classroom. They said it made them strive to do better themselves. One teacher said she thought inclusion would be a flop because she felt like special education students would feel singled out by receiving extra help within a classroom of regular education students. She also thought that there would be more bullying and picking placed upon the special education students. However, this has not been the case for teachers in Russell County, VA. Each one thinks it has went quite beautifully and thinks it was an excellent idea. I did find one special education teacher who stated she felt nervous sometimes in the regular education classroom. She couldn't explain why, but said she felt like that often. The teachers said the students have adapted well and look to see something great come of inclusion. By the way, various school assessments have shown inclusion to be a success.[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 22:09, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

 
I teach inclusion math to high school students. Legally, a school is not supposed to have a majority of special needs students with regular students in a class. However this is what usually happens, not to mention with 20 out of 23 being special needs, I had no inclusion teacher or aid. Although the idea of inclusion teaching is inspiring and seems to have positive benefits for all parties, the reality of the situation is that most times the regular students become behind because of the overwhelming issues of the special needs individuals, especially with the lack of school support offered to the regular education teacher. In the secondary setting, I am a math teacher, I have no specialized training to deal with some of the more extensive needs of some of the kids, but yet am expected to teach them just as I do the regular ed kids with no added help. Who is this system really doing justice to? [[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:54, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Inclusion is a very important part of educating the students at the high school where I work.  I have never had an inclusion teacher in my own class, but I have observed other classes where inclusion is taking place.  Last semester, there was an Algebra I course for all students who had previously failed Algebra I.  So in total, everyone in the class had failed Algebra I before.  This class is traditionally very difficult to manage because it tends to have students who are the least motivated and prone to misbehave.  For this particular course, there were a number of special education students in the class, and there was an inclusion teacher.  The inclusion teacher would spend most of her time around special students, and the inclusion teacher would be there to offer these students extra individual attention.  Her presence also helped with classroom management.  This fits with some of what I learned that inclusion teachers should be doing in the classroom.

I'm not going to lie, I'm still prone to lengthy lectures and using a good old white board/black board. Computers and projectors are all the rage, but the high school classes I've stepped into as of recent, still do not use them. I would definitely take the approach of involving students more in lectures– effectively making it more of a discussion or discourse than anything, but hey. If they're involved, they're involved. If that requires me to pelt them rigorously with questions right in the face when I think they're not paying attention or drifting, then so be it. They'll eventually soften up, and their gooey decadent brains will be mine to mold and shape at whim.[[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 21:42, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

The kindergarten classroom I observed in had a couple of techniques I really enjoyed watching. The first technique the teacher used when singing the alphabet, was the use of sign language. The kindergarteners all participated (with the exception of a few) and new all of the signs for each letter. I found that fascinating to watch. The next strategy I observed was in regards to classroom chores. Everyday, the teacher would assign classroom duties for students who had put their backpacks up without daudling, set in their assigned seats, and raised their hands when called upon. The teacher had special laminated cards with each of the chores (first in line, box carrier, door holder, etc.) on them and the students who were invited to do the chores as a privilege, went to the board and moved the laminated card by their name. She used this technique as a reward for good behavior. As a result, some of the students tried really hard so that they could get picked for the chore of the day.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 21:33, 1 August 2009 (UTC)


I have learned many instructional strategies and techniques through the instructional strategies classes that were very creative and effective. However, there were several strategies that I learned from observation in a Kindergarten class. One of my favorite techniques was how she promoted reading in her classroom; she had hundreds of children’s books on the side and back of her room. When I asked if the school provided them, she informed me that she bought every single one. Over the years, she would go to garage sales and thrift stores buying books for almost nothing. I do not know how long she had been teaching, but I do know that for her classroom, and maybe even the second and third Kindergarten classes, she had a personal library. Students got to sit in beanbags and small sofas, so it was very comfortable to read during centers and free time. With the additional books that they got at the school’s library, the class was constantly improving their reading skills. Another important technique I observed was that she did many activities that required students to use scissors, pencils, glue sticks and other small objects. In other words, she was developing their fine motor skills. She told me that many students did not really develop them at home when they were younger. Therefore, she had to do many fine motor activities in class. Another benefit was that most of the activities were hands-on, such as have the phrase “at” on a piece of paper, and then students would color, cut and paste objects that rhymed with it (cat, bat, hat).[[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 00:50, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

I am completely open to observing all types of instructional methods and techniques.  I am, however, not a fan of traditional teacher-centered classrooms.  I am an elementary education major.  I do not think that my students would retain much information if I just stood in front of the class and lectured at them.  I am a huge proponent of project-based learning.  I think students need hands-on, real world exploration in the classroom.  I do not believe there should be this dividing line between what happens in the classroom and what happens at home.  Children need to explore their own curiosities, learn how to research answers to their questions, and solve problems.  Project based learning accomplishes these goals by incorporating teamwork, as well as autonomy, in a positively reinforcing environment.

At the school that I work at we have a PTA (Parent Teacher Association). This past year I attended a lot of the meeting because 1) I work there and I want to support the association, and 2) I have a child that attends the school so it gave me a great opportunity to keep up with activities that were planned.  There was not a lot of participation when it came to parents. I know the biggest turn-out for a PTA meeting was when there was an open house for the bookfair that was going on, so it brought a lot of parents and this is how we had parents at the meeting and there was also entertainment that some of the students participated in. 

Personally, I am a parent that is very involved in my children's education.  I have had the privilege and not so privileged to have come to know some of my children's teachers, but one thing a teacher cannot say is that I am not involved in my child's education. Parents have to be and should want to be involved in their child's education because it shows that they care.

I saw both positive and negative parental involvement during my observations at an elementary school. The positive involvement was of parent volunteers helping out in the art classroom. They would come in to help with the art projects and especially enjoyed working with their child's class. The parents were not only being involved in their child's life at school, they were also very helpful to the teacher. The negative parental involvement was when a very negative, hard divorce of one of the child's parents came into the school. The mom and dad were fighting over custody of the child and one parent tried to take the child without the courts consent from school. The cops had to be called![[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 20:52, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

At our elementary school we have a great Parent Teacher Organization.  There wasn't a day when you didn't see multiple parents in the school.  They helped with everything from lunch duties to photocopying.  The highlight of our year in the Physical Education department is &quot;Field Day&quot;.  At our elementary school of 300 students we had over 30 parents volunteering that morning.  They run our events and allow our two PE staff to oversee everything.  Their help is priceless for us.  Having active parents in the schools leads to better student achievement in the classroom.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 19:20, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

I completed my observation at a local elementary school in two different grades.  I observed kindergarten and fourth grade.  It was mainly in my fourth grade observations that I noticed for a poetry jam a large number of the parents came to support their children.  During the poetry jam students took turns going in front of the class and reading selected poems from a journal they had been working on the entire year.  It was during school hours and I was very pleased and a little shocked to see how many children's parents left work or previous engagements to make it to the poetry jam.  The children whose parents could not attend were cheered on just as loudly as the children who parents were able to attend.  It made me realize how important parents involvement is with the school and thir children. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 18:08, 31 July 2009 (UTC)  

I have not been able to complete my observation yet, but I am a parent of 2 children one of which has completed two years pre-school.  I believe parental involvement is crucial to a childs success.  When teachers assess students it is beneficial to students as well as parents.  This helps us to be aware if our children need extra help.  I know from my experience I could never get enough feedback from her teacher.  I was always wanting to ask questions and find out how she was doing with everything.  No matter what I always wanted to be at school for every function and event.  I really want my daughter to see that I am supporting her and care about how she does in school.  I know parental involvement is so important for the teachers as well.  If teachers and parents work together for the benefit of the student they will be sure to succeed.  
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 05:12, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

I have spent many volunteer hours in my children's school during the last 6 years and I can't say enough about how beneficial parental involvement is.  Their school has a 30 hour per family volunteer requirement each year.  You don't have to interact directly with the students, (other volunteer activities include lawn care, maintenance, etc.) but overall, the parents are very involved with their kids here.  It is truly a nurturing environment and very family oriented.  Unfortunately, I know it won't be this way at a public school, which is so sad.  I wish it was a requirement that parents had to volunteer in some way at their kid's school.  Children need to know their parents are interested in what they do.  Parental involvement generally helps teachers too.  I know I will try my hardest to get parents involved with their children in my future classroom.  ~~  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 23:06, 7 September 2009 (UTC)     


Parental involvement is the bridge between school and home.  I learned a lot in my observations about the importance of parental involvement from the two teachers that I observed.  The resounding message was that the students that had the most difficulty in class also had a challenging home life.  One of the students in the 4th grade was a poor student, she had difficulty in class completing her assignments.  I learned from the teacher that she was going to be held back in that grade.  Her father was in prison and the mother worked full time and also had a part time job to make ends meet.  The girl stayed with her grandparents frequently and did not make friends very easily.  It was not that the mother did not try and participate in her school life but she really did not have the time to attend functions or go over homework.  I felt so sorry for her, but the teacher was encouraged that she would be fine, she just needed another year to mature and establish a firmer foundation.  Also in the special education classroom the teacher pointed out that the students that had parents that were involved greatly influenced the advancement of the students. As a parent, I also know the importance of staying on top of their assignments and maintaining constant contact with the teachers.  One of the ways that we have been able to do this is through the website that posts grades and assignments and messages for our student which has resulted in a great tool for maintaining parental involvement.  I think that this will prove useful as a teacher also.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 00:59, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I have yet to complete my observation, but one things stands clear: parental involvement is critical to the advancement and learning of a student. My mom was always head first in everything that had to do with my education and my extra-curricular activities that ultimately landed me where I am today. I have a full scholarship at Old Dominion. If my mom would not have gotten involved like she did, I don't know where I would stand today. It is vital to a student's development to have the support of parents and/or legal guardians. When a parent never makes the time or ignores the needs of the student, then it becomes a deeper problem. I tell this occurs by observing classmates and friends whose parents are never around. They seem to not take school in a serious manner. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 17:39, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I have not done my observations yet, but I have an excellent story about parental involvement that I heard/dealt with when I was substitute teaching last year. I was substituting for an ninth grade earth science teacher who I had in high school. Excellent teacher might I add;  all the students loved and still do love her. Anyway she left a list of possible trouble makers and told me if I had any problems to leave their name and she would take care of them. Well I had a big problem out of one boy. I left her his name and she ended up calling me at home and asking me exactly what happened. I told her and afterward she apologized for his acitons (which wasn't her fought). Then she proceeded to tell me about him and how he was toward her. She decided to give his parents a call and let them know how he was behaving in her classroom. Hoping to seek extra help she talked with her mother and told her what was happening and to her surprise the mother cussed her out and told her she was the worst teacher at the school (teacher won teacher of the year the year before if that tells you anything) and then proceeded to call the principle. Crazy huh? When I was in high school my mom would have thanked her then busted my bottom!! The teacher then told me that parents have changed just as much as the students have over the last couple of years. She stated that they are not near as involved today as they have been and tend to blame you instead of their child. She said that each year it gets worse and worse. She firmly belives that most parents just don't care how their child behaves or acts, which is very sad. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 22:20, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


I have completed 15/30 hrs of my observation, but so far have not seen any instances of parental involvement to report on. However, I work at a preschool, and can certainly speak about parental involvement in my classroom. We have one student, who is now 3 and has recently moved up to our room from the 2 yr old room. Since day 1, he has been having problems with hitting the other kids. We immediately began talking with his parents, who requested that we leave a note in his &quot;mailbox&quot; everyday with a happy face or sad face, depending on how his day went. Apparently his parents gave him rewards and praise for &quot;happy notes&quot; and the behavior soon stopped. It was through the involvement of the parents that we were able to redirect his negative behavior into something positive. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 00:45, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

If there has been one thing I have learned about a school in general, it is that the parents’ involvement will more or less decide a school’s success or failure. As a child, I use to think that Parent Teacher Associations were just organizations for adults to raise money so that students could go on field trips. Now that I am older and am actually examining education, I see that PTAs and similar organizations are much bigger than that. It is a way for a community to build a thriving environment in which their children can learn. I know one of the main reasons teachers leave is because of work load, but I think that contributes to the lack of parental support. I know that many students would actually learn quicker and better if they had additional assistance at home. But I also know that not every parent is like mine, who put in hours during the evening when I was in elementary and even middle school. And it is also not an issue that parents do not want to help their student, but they simply do not have the time to do so. That is why I think that classroom websites and emails are more beneficial for parent than the students. They can just access the site from the computer at work or home, and be updated with the classroom. Email is also so readily available to the public that if a parent cannot physically come to a school, they can still be in contact with the teacher and their child’s progress. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 01:37, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

In my experience as a teacher, parent involvement can determine everything. It is not how motivated, or smart a kid is, but if they are borderline then it is their parents that can make the difference. Sadly, parental involvement rarely comes from those kids who could have the most benefit from it. It is the parents of the A students who is constantly calling for questions, and extra study materials, and it is the F students parents 9 times out of 10 that won't even return my phone calls when I inquire about study habits or other ways I can try to help. All the books say parental involvement is the key, but in practicality, the kids who really need a parent to be involved, rarely have one.[[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:58, 3 August 2009 (UTC)


The majority of the parental involvement in the classroom itself stops about middle school in most cases. I did my observations in a band classroom, where the parents are relied upon to help theprogram run smoothly. The school band program has a very good history of a very active parental body. The parents help with everything. Whether it be chaperoning the competition trips or helping make sure everyone is wearing a bow-tie. The likely hood of the band program being able to function without the help and dedication of the parents is very unlikely. For instance, if the parents weren't involved then the students wouldn't be able to take those competition trips due to the school system rules regarding the ratio of chaperones to students. I think that the parents involvement also takes a great deal of stress off of the teacher's shoulders. [[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 04:11, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

Parental involvement is very important in order to help students reach their potential at school.  During my years of teaching, I have followed the advice of my bosses with respect to contacting parents.  The administration requires that we contact parents and record such contacts on a contact log.  I also try to get parents involved through extra curricular activities such as potluck functions or field trips.  Sending home progress reports frequently is another way to stay in touch with parents; this helps them know whats going on with their child and help the child where help is needed.

Positive interaction among teachers and teammates builds a strong learning environment.  My first (and only) full year of teaching was ssuccessful due to the support and guidance of veteran teachers and my teammates.  My teammates and I worked wonderfully together because we always put the needs of our students first.  We searched for new lessons, innovative ways to incorporate technology in the classroom, and shared our individual philosophies with each other.  I believe that our philosophical similarities were key in building a strong team.  When I left to work on my degree, they all balled like babies.  Our bond grew extremely strong over just one year.  I was no longer an only child, but a member of a teaching family with three great sisters.

One of the strongest bonds I share is with my special ed. paraprofessional.  She spent 3/4 of her day in my classroom assisting the students with IEPs and 504s.  I always took time to listen to her suggestions and often incorporated them with much success.  Not only was she a gift to me and the special education students, but she was a gift to all of the 4th grade teachers and students.  Without her guidance and expertise, kids would have probably been hanging from the rafters.  Always show respect and support teachers in a collaborative environment.  Communication is the most important thing in a collaborative teaching relationship.  With out it, a classroom can become detached.  Collaboration = communication.

As scared as I will be on my first day of teaching, I will be very relieved to know that I will have a team to lean on until I can stand completely on my own 2 feet. One of the things I am actually looking forward to are the half-days on Wednesdays, because it will at least allow me enough time to look at how well students are learning and how effective my own teaching is. More importantly, I will have others that understand what I am going through and have possible solutions. While researching for my Wikibook article, I came across an article that discussed how social networking was being used for teacher collaboration. Teachers of the same district, state and even nation-wide would attend virtual conferences about strategies, testing, students, parents and overall education. It was actually very beneficial to teachers, as well as schools and administration because teachers did not have to travel long distances to see each other. They could simply go on an online chat or have a video chat and discuss IEPs, department plans or standardized testing. One state actually require first year teachers to do teacher collaboration through social networking so that they could transition easier into the classroom. Although I am still a pre-service teacher, I occasionally go on educator website and read forums. They are extremely informative and make me think about things I would never even consider.

Collaboration is great! As a new teacher, I discovered that there were always people around to ask advice. In particular, one colleague and I were both new teachers and the only two in our district teaching our subject. So we used this to our advantage. Why recreate the wheel, when people have already made it and you have help. Between the two of us we come up with all kinds of games and interactive activities for the kids as well as halved our stress levels since it was that much less we had to do as individuals. This was an idealistic case, not all teachers are as open and helpful and books would lead you to believe. Many of the teacher I talked to were not open to collaboration, or willing to help at all. Some of the older teachers especially were very territorial over their ideas and work and did not see the common goal.

I know that my expectations for my classroom will need to be adjusted throughout the beginning of my career. I like to think that every student can learn everything they need to if they are given the right tools, motivation, and time. I also know that since I will be teaching in the real world these expectations are not obtainable.  There may not be enough time, tools, or motivation to reach every student.  I do know that I will give every students as much of these as I have.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 01:55, 8 August 2009 (UTC)


One of my favorite teachers teaches 2nd grade.  Her classroom is always under control and she is always calm and easy going which in turn makes her students calm and easy going.  I admire her technique.  What I've learned by watching her with her students is that she has clear expectations for them and expects them to be met.  The students respond to that and meet them.  Her class rules are posted in a place that's easy for kids to see.  She means what she says and her consequences are clear (she uses the green, yellow, red light system of behavior).  She disciplines in a positive manner and allows her students to make behavior choices and then be responsible for their actions.  She doesn't overpraise, which I think is as much a problem as not being supportive.  Overall, her students are very happy and secure in her classroom because they know what to expect from her and what she expects from them.

I observed the elementary art teacher, and her interaction with the class was typically positive. However, the thought that comes to my mind is not the teacher I observed, but another teacher I met while at this elementary school. She teaches kindergarten and I told her that I used to want to teach kindergarten until I decided on art. I told her some of my fondest elementary school memories were when I was in kindergarten. And she told me I wouldn't like kindergarten anymore because she couldn't do any fun stuff with them, they didn't even have centers anymore. My thought was the teacher makes the classroom fun, she might have certain rules to follow or certain things to teach, but she makes the class the way it is ... fun or not. I believe it is up to the teacher to decide how her classroom will run, and I felt terrible knowing that this teacher had called in the white flags of defeat because she didn't think she could make something different fun for her students.

When I think about teacher expectations, I also think back to my elementary school and my favorite teacher of all time. She was my reading teacher in 3rd grade. She was always in control of her class, and she never ever had to raise her voice. She was always very calm and collected and she had a special way of dealing with the students that challenged her. There was always a lot of fun and learning in her class, but she always had high expectations for us. It was as if all of her students simply wanted to please her. As I can remember, there were a few students in my class had discipline problems. However, I never saw any of these issues in her class. It seemed like the students just knew that when they were in her class they were there to be good students and learn and that behavior problems were simply unacceptable. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 00:35, 3 August 2009 (UTC) 

Educational theory argues that it is important for teachers to have high expectations for student performance.  There have been studies that have shown that if teachers have higher expectations, students are more likely to achieve higher levels of success.  For the classes that I observed, there did not seem to be very high expectations by the teacher.  During the class, most of the students were sitting up during the first five minutes.  But by the first 30 minutes of class, about half the class had their head down, and many of the students were not doing any work at all.  This class had apparently been one where the students have acted up and not done much work; the teacher seemed a bit discouraged and therefore, there he did not express high expectations for them.  Maybe if the class had started better, with less discipline problems and more organization, the teacher could have shared his high expectations for the class, motivating them to reach higher levels of success.

&lt;center&gt;Observations and Reflections from Today's Classrooms&lt;/center&gt;
----
It is the first day of school, and the students are already on edge about the teachers they have to deal with five days a week, so why not have a classroom environment that is calm and fun.  At the school that I work at some teachers change their bullentin boards every six weeks to go along with the curriculum they will be teaching.  I think the teacher should make a game out of it called &quot;What's Different in the Classroom?&quot;  I have observed where some teachers will let the students play games to relax themselves before a test or quiz. The classroom environment does not have to be one that is hostile all the time, but it can be a place where students come in to have fun in the process of learning.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 21:24, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I began a few months ago working at a preschool summer camp.  In the fall I will teacher younger four year olds.  During my observation of a kindergarten class I paid a great deal of attention to the classroom environment and setup.  I feel the way a classroom is set up is vital to ones students.  I have been working on my own classroom for the fall over the summer and have found I have changed things around or moved things many times.  I finally feel like I have it set up in a good way and now i am moving on to decorating the walls with posters and letters and numbers and shapes and feel overwhelmed trying to get it to look just the right way.  But I think it will all be worth it when the children walk into the room.  Having visuals on the walls and the right tools in the room is important and I feel will make the children feel more welcome and excited to learn.

The classroom I observed in was a happy and caring environment. The teacher made the children feel welcomed and excited to start new art assignments. It was nice to see excitement in the children's eyes as they enter the room and I hope that I can one day be a teacher that makes learning exciting for children. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 21:30, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I think that a positive classroom environment is crucial in creating successful students. While doing my observation I saw a few different types of classrooms and how they were run on a daily basis. When the teacher maintains control of the class and keeps the children on track in a positive way, I have seen that the students are most responsive and cooperative. 

In the third grade class in a Virginia Beach public school, I was able to take lots of great ideas with me. The teacher used many of the Kagan techniques and incorporated them into every activity. By doing this, the class was constantly praising one another interacting and working together. I think this is so important because it reflects the way the world works outside of school as well. The children are required to work together, solve problems and accomplish tasks. The teacher had so many little ways of keeping the children motivated and on track that things rarely got out of control. I really was encouraged by seeing this all take place. A positive environment with control can really allow the students to learn and work together constantly. [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 14:26, 1 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002

I have not yet been able to complete my observation.  Classroom environment is so important.  It needs to be well organized, and positive.  One teacher I really remember I had in 6th grade.  She was definitely one of my favorite teachers.  I still recall it like it was yesterday.  She was so positive, always upbeat with a smile on her face.  I could not wait to get to school each day to see what this teacher had in store for us.  She spend a lot of time with us on field trips and fun activities.  We never knew what she would do next.  She was always changing things up to keep us motivated and engaged in what she was teaching.  She also had a lot of hands on activities and fun &quot;stuff&quot; for us to do.    She was firm but fair.  She was one of the best, and really cared about what we were going through as 6th graders.  I only hope that I can model those behaviors when I become a teacher.

Having been in college classrooms for quite a while now, I had forgotten how tedious actual high school classes are. Sure in college we have the ubiquitous texters, the facebook checkers, or the admirable sci-fi novel reader, but it had slipped my mind how damn chatty teenagers could be. So this summer's observation was a nice reminder. My god, it was like someone hit a bee's nest with a stick– an incessant drone that was going to make my head implode. However, it is obviously normal for teens to be this chatty– and it takes a good measure of presence to hush these kids up so that they'll actually pay attention. The teacher I was assigned to was a bit on the abrasive side, but in an endearing way. She more-or-less has a no BS policy with her students, and it showed as she would just go quiet– and then immediately an echo of silence would cascade across the room. It was like a serene calm, drowning out all those buzzing bees. The teacher was loud in her scoldings, a bit much for my tastes, and dripping in sarcasm, but her students seemed to respect her and knew when they had stepped afoul. Discipline and classroom management in general is possibly the least appetizing thing I am looking forward to dealing with when I become a teacher. It's not that I don't think I can handle it, I just don't have the patience for it at the moment. Maintaining the right learning environment with lessened incidences of distraction is essential important to me, but I'm definitely in need of working on my tolerance for teenage angst. I'll just start listening to nothing but the bands I liked while I was in high school– maybe it'll put me in their mindset.

During my observations in several different classrooms, I noticed that the classroom environment depends on the teacher. The teacher sets either the negative or positive environment. I noticed that the teacher’s attitude towards the students in general made large difference to the overall classroom environment. Those teachers who were quick to point out the “trouble makers” were the teachers who no matter which period it was all classes had “trouble makers”.  While those who appeared to enjoy teaching and never had anything bad to say about the students, all of their classes seem to run much smoother.

The classroom that I was in for my observation had a very good classroom enviornment. On the walls were posters and pictures that were academically stimulating, and at the same time were appealing to look at. In addition, the teacher made sure that each student respected one another and took equal participation in classroom discussions. She made sure that each student felt accepted and welcome, and that they could freely express their minds. She also kept the room very positive, she didn't allow for much negativity and if there were an issue, she would handle it with patience and a respectful tone. The class was also very academically stimulating. She set the tone for open discussion of the text by allowing the students to each read a certain part of the text. In doing so, she stimulated learning and allowed for a more active classroom enviornment. She definitely set a great classroom enviornment for the students to learn in. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 02:49, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

The classroom environment must be positive for the students to achieve the ability to learn.  I observed two different classroom settings, based on the grade levels.  In the 4th grade and Special Education class setting the teachers had the students grouped into different tables.  This seemed to really help with classroom management.  Both teachers used great rapport with the students that aided in the classroom environment.  I know that a lot of the ease between teacher and student was because this was the end of the year and they shared the year together.  I did get to observe how one teacher handled a student that was unruly in class, she was very calm and maintained control of the rest of the class when this student was disruptive.  She had the advantage of the next day being field day and that student would be sent to another classroom instead of being able to participate with the rest of the class.  I thought that was a fair punishment and the student was made aware of the consequences prior to the outburst.  I had observed in middle school and high school a few years ago, my best friend taught in both.  I had thought about majoring in History and wanted to see what a day would be like.  Well, although I enjoyed the subject matter, I was not prepared for the setting.  I realized that I did not think that I could deal with that age group on a daily basis.  I have great respect to those teachers who do it every day, the great ones are the ones that maintain a positive environment for the students while demanding respect, a very difficult task at that age group.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 00:11, 1 August 2009 (UTC) 

I think a positive, welcoming classroom environment is essential to a productive education. My invision of the ideal classroom would be a classroom that is painted with soothing colors; consistent temperature setting (very imparative); comfortable seats that are arranged in a way so that disruption is minimal; and a place in the back of the room that has comfy couches where students who are disruptive can go and cool off. But alas, we live in the real world and this is definitely not the norm. In the 5th grade class I observed in, the teacher's desk was in the back of the classroom. The students desks were in groups of four all facing each other. The teacher had a large stool in the front of the classroom where she could go and write on the board. This classroom was housed in a small, cramped, warm trailer. It was definitely not condusive to learning by any means. You could not see the teachers desk on most days because there was so much stuff everywhere. There were computers in the back of the room that looked like they had not been used in a long time because no one could find them due to being covered with more stuff. There were bulletin boards on the walls in the classroom that had the students work stapled on them. The students had done a project involving promoting a soda pop/energy drink type substance and they were to promote this item so that others would by it. I would say over half of the students promoted their drink according to how much gas it would make you expel. I am a believer of freedom of speech and self expression...but I think that the students needed boundaries on this assignment and were not given them. As a result, this type of expression was evident in a lot of their assignments that I observed. Children need to be guided and know where their boundaries lie, otherwise chaos insues and the classroom environment suffers.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 21:54, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

I have not done my observations yet, but I have been inside of several very different classrooms. My favorite classroom would be a ninth grade earth science classroom that I have substituted in many times. When you walk in it is orderly, laid out nice, and has many different posters and planets hanging around. On her bulletin board she has science material on one side and school activity sheets on the other. It is very student friendly with extra sources for the students to use. The teacher is very energetic and organized which shows when you walk into her room. Other rooms are a little more bland or look like someones house instead of a classroom. The history classroom is so sad. No posters, no additional resources for the kids, not even an American flag! Can you believe that? The art classroom is pretty good. She has nothing but the children's artwork covering her walls. She creates a warm environment that makes you want to try to paint or draw. She is very encouraging and posters that she has reflects her personality. I guess overall most classroom environments are welcoming and set up to learn, but there are some that just make you feel like you are in jail. No wonder kids get bored.[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 22:52, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

Before becoming an ODU student, I was in some classroom as a volunteer. One of the classrooms I worked in was a Kindergarten class in Newport News which always seem to be different from other classrooms. Besides the typical alphabets, numbers, shapes and other important concepts for children to know, there were many posters and pictures of a “positive learning environment”. These included things like being respectful, sharing toys and materials, and responsibility. The teacher also had many of the students’ drawings and projects on the walls, ceiling and outside the classroom. Recalling on my memory in elementary school, I do not remember if I really cared if my work was shown to the entire school or if I knew why teachers did it in the first place. However, now that I am older I actually see it as motivational and positive. Students who are shy may be hesitant to display their strengths, so by posting their work, it may motivate them to use their talents more often. Another thing that I have noticed with Kindergarten classrooms, and primary classroom in particular, is that they always have group tables instead of individual desks. It actually took me some time to realize that teachers were actually building children’s social skills. Although many more children go to preschool than when I went, I know that not every child actually goes to some type of daycare as an infant or toddler. Kindergarten is a very crucial stage because it begins the transition of learning through play to learning through books and activities.[[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 00:28, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Something that always aggravates me, and something that I think that teachers should be aware of is favoritism.  I don't think under any circumstance a student should be made to feel like someone else is better liked or favored.  It's something that I have noticed in many of the classrooms that I have been in, even in college.  If I ask a question of a teacher and she or he refuses to take time with me or answer my question, BUT they have more than enough time to speak with someone else...it really is aggravating.  Certainly, teachers must have their favorite students but they should never show it in the classroom!  Also, a student should always feel that a teacher has time for them.  The student who asks to talk to a teacher after class because they have a problem should never be told that the teacher doesn't have time...etc.  Obviously the student has made time to meet with the teacher, the teacher should recognize that and make time for the student.  That is my teacher/student interaction pet peeve!  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 02:08, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

At the school where I did my observations, student-teacher interaction was a very interesting subject. I observed chorus class at  middle school in Suffolk where arts classes are considered less-important than &quot;core classes&quot;. This caused many students to take the class as an &quot;easy A&quot;. Most of these students did not want to have anything to do with the teacher, but of course she was just as nice to them, unless they were rude to her (which most of them were). Only a handful of students wanted to take chorus, meaning that only a handful of students liked the teacher.
The sad part was, the teacher was always very nice to all the students- nicer than many of them deserved. 
Since I was a guest, I expected that the students would be kind to me, but many of them were standoffish, and some were even very rude. 

At the school where I did my observations, teacher-student interactions were very prevalent. The teacher knew all of the children's names for the most part, and often asked the students to help her with simple things such as passing out papers or stapling papers to give to the other students. The teacher would also interact with the students by providing open discussions, and holding answer and question sessions. She would also read with the students through the textbook, and walk around the classroom as they completed activities to observe their progress and be there in case they had any questions about the work. The students would also interact with the teacher as well, they felt very comfortable speaking in class and asking the teacher questions. I felt that the level of teacher student interaction was great, and I feel lucky to have been able to have observed in such a great classroom.

I have not done my observations yet but I have witnessed many student-teacher interactions. For the most part I would say that they are positive. Some I have seen are like a slap stick comedy and funny. However I have seen negative interactions between students and teachers as well. There is one teacher at a high school in Russell County that stares the student down when he/she is misbehaving. He looks at them so long the students face gets red and wants to dart out of the room. With this said this teacher does not have many dissiciple problems to deal with. None of the students want to be stared at. They find it to be embarrassing beyond embarrassing. Since schools in this county are small most teachers knew the students very well and a majority had went to school with their students parents. I don't think that I have ever witnessed a student/teacher who did not know something about the other. When I was in high school I knew a lot about my teachers. For that fact several of them were my neighbors and had watched me grow up. Funny thing huh? Maybe one or all of them brainwashed me into this profession.[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 22:38, 2 August 2009 (UTC)


Student-teacher interaction is a big thing to me. It links in with understanding where your student's are coming from with their experiences and learning how to communicate with your students. My favorite types of teachers are the ones who tell stories and jokes whilst teaching, and encourage students to as well. There's a fine line between doing this well and going off on tangents though, but overall it rips apart the monotony of the average classroom. Good solid, social interaction with students makes them feel like an important part of the classroom, they tend to care more about topics at hand, feel more into learning. When I did my observation this summer, I had the luxury of having a good teacher to work with who always bounced questions at students, baring their sundry interests in mind. It did wonders to provoke responses, as long as the questions were not deliberately specific, and more or less designed just to invoke a response/opinion.

At the high school where I did my observation I noticed that teachers attitude had a lot to do with how the students behaved. I observed in several different classrooms. From what I saw the more active the teacher, the more responsive the students were. The teachers that that stood in front of the class explaining the lesson, then later interacted with the students seemed to be the teachers with more control of the class. While those that either taught from behind a desk or returned thereafter a short lecture, having the students to work.  It appeared to me to be the classes that were more likely to have student who were disruptive. Proving to me that it is important to be involved in your students learning other than  planning lessons. [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 16:12, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

During the entire time that I was doing my observations I tried to learn from the teachers how to treat the students. School know have so many policies and rules as to how to treat and engage with a student that one needs to be careful of every move. I observed both male and female teachers and can say that they were both very professional with all the students. Since they had been teaching both for over 10 years and are comfortable with the students they both had great relationships with their students. 

I noticed that students came to them for help  with different things. During the entire time of my observation I noticed that the students felt very comfortable talking to the teachers, asking for help and ideas. The teachers got along with their students and even thought they did joke with them I never saw the line of Teacher/Student fade. Students always knew who was the adult in the classa and in charge. Both teacher and student help very respectable conversations. If the teacher would hear something innapropiate they would quickly ask them to change the subject and let them know why. I think that teachers should be allowed to joke with their students as long as that line of teacher-students never is crossed.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 03:01, 3 August 2009 (UTC)



I think it has a lot to do with the subject that I observed but the interaction between the teacher and the students was evident almost the entire class. Because the teacher is actually the director of the ensemble the students are relying on him for the down beat, cut-offs and their entrances. Even though the students are producing the music the teacher has a lot to do with the articulation and the interpretation of the score. I really enjoyed my observation because instead of watching and participating from within the ensemble I was able to see the viewpoint of the director better. I also noticed from the director stand pint more behavioral problems than i had previously noticed from within. It cold have been because I wasn't in the ensemble to cause the problems, but that is a different story. I think that this observation opened my eyes to many different things that just reinforced why I wanted to be a Band director in the first place.

I recently had an experience with bullying in school.  My son would walk home with two or three friends and there would be another child calling them names and targeting my son in general. My son was in 8th grade and I have always taught him to walk away from situations like this.  This child by himself would run up and punch my son and sometimes his friends, this would result in this child getting hit repeatedly by my sons friends but he kept doing it.  I told my son maybe he wants to walk with you guys and be friends, or he just wants attention.  The final straw was when this child took his backpack hit my son in the head and knocked him down and began to kick him until my sons friends stopped him.  It took my husband being home that day to call the police and the school.  The schools response was that my son was fighting also and would probably be suspended as well.  The police found out that this child had a record for violence. We did not let the school bully us into letting it go.  They told us our son may have to be suspended and moved from his classes.  We told the school and the police to talk to all the witnesses and explain why our son should be punished. They backed down when all fifteen witnesses including the crossing guard explained what happened just as my son had said. The child was moved out of the same classes as my son and was forced to ride the bus home along witha weeks suspension. Two months later he was epxelled for beating up a sixh grader.  This was the fourth school he was suspended from. I will have difficulty with the bullying aspect of school. I used to think the system would work but if it wasn't for our complete involvement in the investigation and follow through of the schools reaction, this bully never would have been punished. When do you step in? As a teacher this question may be easier to answer but I also don't want to overreact and make the situation worse.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 01:45, 8 August 2009 (UTC)   


I had the unfortunate experience of being bullied in school and it wasn't any fun, let me tell you.  I think because I was shy and probably a very easy target.  I don't recall every telling any teachers though, I was probably afraid of what the repercussions would be from my harasser. Bullies rarely have a good reason to pick on someone.  Usually they will pick on a person for the feeling of power that it gives them.  I think the only solution for this is that a student should be able to feel free to tell a teacher, and some severe punishment should be leveled on the individual that is doing the bullying!  The second offense should be punished more strongly.  I am worried that my sons will be bullied at school.  One day my son came home and said a boy smashed his breakfast sandwich I brought for him.  That broke my heart!  Students should go to school and feel safe, not feel like they are going to school to be tortured.

I was never a victim of bullying in my youth however, I have witnessed it on more than one occasion.  While completing my observation hours in  both the fourth grade an kindergarten I was surprised but also relieved that I did not witness any bullying in the classroom or even on the playground.  I do see what I believe is a form of bullying working as a preschool teacher.  Usually at some point in the day I hear &quot;he/she doesn't wasnt to be my friend&quot; or I hear the children telling each other they do not like them or do not want to play with them.  I also see how it effects the children.  I think teachers in the schools need to pay close attention and attempt to stop bullying before it starts.

I witnessed bullying in the elementary art classroom and it upset me greatly how they handled it! This little boy in the second grade makes it his call in life to terrorize and bother another boy in his class who is only in a few of his classes because he spends the rest of the time in a special ed classroom. During lunch, the &quot;little bully&quot; scrapped the other little boys arm with his finger nails, not enough to make it bleed but enough to make it red. The &quot;little bully&quot; was sent to the principals office and they had a little &quot;chat&quot; ... I actually heard the story from this principal who said she went and got the other boy and brought him in with the &quot;little bully&quot;, and asked him what had happened. After looking at the &quot;little bully&quot; he recanted that anything had happened. The principal laughed and said I guess he didn't want to have to deal with what that &quot;little bully&quot; would have done to him later if he told. How is this justice!? In elementary school? Really, there must have been something the teachers and principal could do to stop the injustice of the kid in special ed being tortured by a bully!

During my observation time with a 5th grade class in Virginia Beach, I was able to see a little bit of the &quot;Family Life&quot; unit covered at the end of the year. Included in this unit was the topic of peer pressure and bullying. The children saw a video (although I think it was from the 1980's) that was very informative and offered great advice. The video played out scenarios that are often seen in schools as well as some outside the classroom. This allowed the children to see how to deal with these types of situations and offered suggestions. In addition to this, the teachers paused the video and asked questions to the students. I was surprised at some of the great answers the children came up with on how to deal with a bully, how to say no to peer pressure and why these things occur. I think that 5th graders are at a great age to deal with these issues as they transition into middle school; however, I don't think you can start too young. These situations appear at every age and should be addressed in an age appropriate way. [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 14:46, 1 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002

This year our elementary school started using the Olweus Bullying Prevention program.  While it seemed like a good idea in the beginning, a lot of the teachers seemed put off by the amount of surveying the program used.  The other teacher in my department was in charge of tabulating the results and she was frustrated with the amount of paperwork.  The kids meanwhile were receptive to the assemblies and information they received.  If there was an easier way to track the data the teachers would be more receptive to the program.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 18:54, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

During my observation, I encountered many things that were new and different. I also encountered some things that were shocking, upsetting, and downright unfair. I observed chorus class at a middle school in Suffolk. All of my day was not spent in the classroom, though. The teacher that I observed had to do some lunch duties during the middle of the day- this was our time to sit and have her tell me all about the interesting, crazy, and weird students. One thing that she told me about that shocked me was the school's Anger Management program.
At this school (and, as far as I know, all other Suffolk public schools) there is an Anger Management program for all of the students who qualify. Students who are in this program obviously have severe behavioral problems. The part that shocked me was what the students were allowed to get away with. Because it is Anger &quot;Management&quot; all of the students involved are allowed to deal with their anger in any way, including yelling and screaming when they find it necessary, fighting, and throwing things. I couldn't believe it. The real world isn't like that! Why should these &quot;special&quot; students be allowed to do such things?
Behavioral problems should be dealt with on a case to case basis, but never like this. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 01:16, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

Bullying is a subject near and dear to my heart. It performs the inverse operation of warming the cockles of my heart, whatever that may be. (Freezing the cockles? Chilling Cockles? I have no idea) Yet, even with my intense need to paint myself as the victim and future champion of the downtrodden I find myself split on the subject. 
Yes, bullying is horrible. Abhorrent. The tyranny and cruelty of youth, etc. But on the same hand I think it serves as a very real learning experience in school, a place strangely devoid of such lessons. No matter what your math teacher told you being able to multiply fractions will not be of very important in your day to day life, unless you happen to serve pie at a restaurant that caters specifically to anal retentive fraction fetishists. But that ass kicking and ridicule and just dumb mean-ness that kids can radiate, like weapons grade plutonium, day after day, is a wonderful lesson in life. Being a fat, Asian kid afforded me with plenty of opportunities to experience bullying and a smidgen of good ole fashion racism in my day, and while I hate to say it, these things were probably the most useful part of my education. I learned to ignore people, to use my head to turn a clever phrase or searing insult around, and finally, that none of that was important and never will be. I learned to scope a room and figure out who my friends were, I learned for a time to hide my money inside the lining of my shoes, and that if I could make someone laugh it was unlikely that we would be enemies for long. All these things have served me better than my ability to write in cursive or classify rocks. (Although I like knowing cursive, seriously, when is the last time you used it aside from signing your name?)

Though I have not completed my observation, I can 'observe' in the outside world that bullying takes a traumatic toll on a person's life. As a future educator I would pay extra attention to this matter, because I don't want any of my students suffering the consequences of such actions. Even throughout my scholarly life, we were taught to deal with bullying and peer pressure because of the constant bullying in today's schools. When it comes to peer pressure (a usual side effect of bullying) students are forced into situations without account of their better knowledge. This can lead to disastrous events. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 17:44, 2 August 2009 (UTC) 

Bullying is a serious occurrence happening in our schools, with kids of all ages.  I have found that bullying occurs most often with middle and high school students.  Unfortunately, we do not teach specific virtues or character education in our narrowed curriculum in today’s schools.  We do not teach children how to respect diversity.  It seems still that children who do not fit the “mold” get teased and ridiculed.  It is unfortunate that this type of behavior happens so frequently and is completely overlooked.  As educators, we need to ensure the safety of all of our students.  We also need to create an environment where students feel nurtured and peaceful.  It is part of our job to make sure this kind of behavior is not ignored whenever it occurs.    [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 20:30, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;This is Dr. Kidd's sample Wiki Article. I hope it will help you to format your own. I have included the regular text of a (fake) article in black and formatting and writing tips in blue. I will remove this sample once all the articles are posted in final format so it will not become part of our final project. Remember, to create your Wiki Article you first need to login in and then go the page where your article should be. For example, if your topic is, &quot;What are philosophies of education&quot; click on the link for 2.1.1. Click on the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab to get started. I suggest opening two windows (or tabs) of your browser. In one you can open your Wiki article page; in the other you can keep this page open. That way it will be easier to cut and paste code from my sample to your article. Don't forget to hit &quot;save page&quot; after you enter text or make changes or all your hard work will be for naught. Good luck and happy posting.


Disclaimer: I am a &lt;u&gt;terrible&lt;/u&gt; typist. If you find errors on this page, you can practice your editing skills by fixing them for me. Hit &quot;edit this page&quot;, scroll down to my error and fix it. Don't forget to hit &quot;save page&quot;. Voila - your improvement will make me appear to be a competent writer. I will be eternally grateful. &lt;/font&gt;






&lt;big&gt;'''The Ubiquitous Colon: Punctuation for Today’s Titles'''&lt;/big&gt;

by Jeff Steckroth - &lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;''Dr. Steckroth is a colleague of ours here in the College of Education. He wrote this very funny paper to teach his students about APA format. He said it was okay to post it here as an example for you''.&lt;/font&gt;

----

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;I made the title big and bold like this by clicking on the editing button all the way on the right. To see the editing buttons I am talking about, click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab above.
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;I inserted this horizontal line by clicking the editing button in the center that has a straight horizontal line on it.
&lt;/font&gt;


The practice of writing and publishing has changed dramatically in the centuries since the discovery of the quill and ink, the earliest known form of writing. Early scholars were able to produce few scholarly documents for a number of reasons, most notably the fact that writing was a tedious and time-consuming process. Furthermore, life expectancy at the time when writing was invented was a fraction of what it is now (Moses, 2697 B.C.), so those scholars were unable to produce the plethora of writings that today’s erudite men and women manufacture.

There are many types of print media available to the public including books, journals, magazines, newsletters, and newspapers, all of which can be found at libraries around the world. More importantly, the written word is no longer restricted to hard copy form; today the Internet provides a home to writing from scholars and ignorant people alike. This proliferation of writing in both hard copy and electronic form has produced a new challenge for graduate students: how to avoid information overload.

In addition to having to deal with the huge volume of available resources, one of the most pressing issues that writers of literature reviews must consider is how to create a title that epitomizes the essence of the vast collection of articles contained therein. Constructing a title is both a science and an art, but on one fact all of the experts agree: the title must contain a colon (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, &amp; Starr, 2007).

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;This is the correct format for citing a source in APA. Notice that all authors are listed as this is the first time the source is cited. &lt;/font&gt;

== Historical Development of the Colon ==

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;To make this into a major heading (with the horizontal line), I highlighted the text and clicked the 5th editing button-- the one with the giant &quot;A&quot; on it.&lt;/font&gt; 
 
The colon was created in 1692 by accident in Salem, Massachusetts by a printer who was preparing posters advertising a series of witch trials scheduled for the area (Hawthorne, 1694). This unknown printer created a poster which read, “Come to the Salem Witch Trials. An exciting blend of entertainment for the entire family will be provided including dunking, exorcism, and hanging.” As fate would have it, the sign was printed poorly, and the period between sentences was double-struck, creating a symbol remarkably similar to today’s colon. Furthermore, the lines of text were divided in such a way that the sign had the following appearance:


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Come to the

Salem Witch Trials: An exciting blend of entertainment

for the entire family will be provided including

dunking, exorcism, and hanging.&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
To make a side bar like mine, hit &quot;edit this page&quot; and scroll down until you see the coding surrounding the Salem Witch Trials content. You can then copy and paste this code directly into your Wiki article and modify it in the ways I describe below. You can also copy the coding from other Wiki articles you like or check out the tutorials posted on Blackboard.


If you would like your side bar to use different colors than these, check out this website which lists the codes for a wild assortment of colors:http://www.computerhope.com/htmcolor.htm


Once you find a color you like, copy the color code and paste it over the background (or border) color code # I have listed. 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Copy this code if you would like your side bar to be a little more subdued and look like this! 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

If you would like to have a thinner (or thicker) border around your side bar, you can adjust the number in &quot;border: solid 10px&quot;. For example, change it to 1px for a very thin border.


If you would like to change the color of the text, see my note at the end of this sample article.  


I made the text in my sidebar larger than normal. You can change it back to regular size by deleting the &quot;big&quot; inside the carrots that is listed right before and after my sidebar text. 


You can decide how big to make your side bar (by changing the width percentage --mine is at 60%) and whether you want to center it or align it to the left or right (ALIGN=CENTER or ALIGN=RIGHT, etc.).


I centered the text in my sidebar by writing &quot;center&quot; inside carrots &lt;&gt; before my text.  &lt;/font&gt;





The public was so enamored with the second line of this sign that soon bumper stickers were appearing on wagons across the colonies proclaiming the message, “Salem Witch Trials: An Exciting Blend of Entertainment.” Thus the colon was born, and its rise to prominence has been well-documented (Barnum &amp; Bailey, 2001). One of the most famous colon aficionados was the thirty-fifth president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, who stated on January 21, 1961, in his inaugural address, “Ask not what your country can do for you: ask what you can do for your country” (p. 2). President Kennedy’s choice of the colon accelerated its use in the lexicon of American writing, particularly at the college level where catchy titles are highly valued (Lennon, et al., 1963).

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;In this case, &quot;Et al.&quot; is used after the furst author's names because the source was already cited once with all the authors included. All subsequent citations can use the first author and &quot;et al.&quot; . &quot;Et al&quot; can be used in place of authors names in sources that have three or more authors (if a source had two authors, you need to list both in every citation). 

As you can see, a page number is listed with the quotation from JFK. '''Page numbers''' are NOT needed for paraphrased material, but '''must be provided for a quotation.''' If a source is electronic and does not show page numbers, you can use paragraph numbers or section headings. The idea is to guide the reader to the spot the quotation came from. For more help citing electronic sources using APA go to http://www.apastyle.org/electext.html and http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/10/.

&lt;/font&gt;

== The Colon’s Place in Academic Writing ==

Graduate students are faced with exciting and challenging writing assignments in all of their graduate courses ranging from literature reviews to reflection papers. In each type of formal writing assignment students are expected to create a title page, and they are usually asked to adhere to writing standards of the American Psychological Association (APA). These style guidelines have particular requirements depending upon the type of paper being composed.

''The Literature Review''

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;To make this text appear italicized I highlighted it and clicked the 2nd editing button. You can also just put two quotation marks before and after the text you want italicized.&lt;/font&gt;

This dreaded assignment begins with a title page containing the title (duh), the author’s name, and the institutional affiliation, at a minimum. Some professors require that the course name and date of the paper be included on the title page as well, but this varies among institutions and among professors within a given institution. The most important consideration is that the title page conforms to the standards set by the professor who will grade the literature review, since ultimately nothing else matters.

''Reflection Papers''

Another important type of writing at the college level, the reflection paper is considered less formal than the literature review but still significant enough to warrant a title page (Poe, 1849). While a student at the University of Virginia, Edgar Allan Poe penned his infamous reflection paper entitled “Diary of a Drinker: My Battle with Booze,” which chronicled his addiction to alcohol and its subsequent role in his demise (Clemens, 1871). Poe struggled with the title of this paper, unable to decide between “Diary of a Drinker” and “My Battle with Booze.” The availability of the colon was instrumental in enabling Poe to merge the two short titles into one.

''Doctoral Dissertations''

Considered the most formal of all academic writing, the doctoral dissertation is another document which requires a catchy yet substantive title. Since the dissertation is bound and published in both hard copy and electronic formats, the title should be one that catches the reader’s eye and beckons “read me.” Otherwise the document will be relegated to a permanent place on the library’s bookshelf of least popular volumes.

''Mathematics education dissertation title''. One example of a well conceived title is the following:  “Technology-Enhanced Mathematics Instruction: Effects of Visualization on Student Understanding of Trigonometry” (Steckroth, 2007). The reader will notice that the pre-colon portion of the title identifies both the subject area and unique focus of the work: mathematics and technology. The post-colon portion of the title provides specific information about the type of mathematics being studied: trigonometry, as well as the technology emphasis: visualization. Clearly the title “works” because it serves to capture the reader’s attention immediately with the pre-colon title, and it hooks the reader with the post-colon elaboration on the pre-colon title. The same dissertation without colonization would read “Technology-Enhanced Mathematics Instruction and the Effects of Visualization on Student Understanding of Trigonometry,” making it nearly impossible for the reader to determine the focus of the research.

The key elements of dissertation or thesis title-writing are shown in Figure 1, which summarizes the five critical components of a good title: &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; the witty catchphrase &lt;li&gt; the ubiquitous colon &lt;li&gt; the necessary but boring stuff &lt;li&gt; a carefully-selected preposition &lt;li&gt; the obscure topic about which few people actually give a hoot.&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;If you would like to create a numbered list copy my code here. If you want to change it so there are bullets instead of numbers use &quot;ul&quot; instead of &quot;ol&quot; in the carrots &lt;&gt;. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;As you can see my image was deleted by Wikimedia. This is because the image did not have a free license -- the author still retained some of his copyrights. Therefore, this image could not be permanently posted on Wikibooks where the content is licensed to be freely copied and distributed.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Inserting a picture is a little more complicated. First you need to find a picture that is in the public domain or is licensed for full use like many of the images in Creative Commons or all the images in Wikimedia commons. Once you find a picture, you need to save it to your computer. When you save it, give it a descriptive name like &quot;Tree from Grandpas yard&quot; or in my case &quot;Your thesis title&quot;. Then, you need to upload it to Wikimedia so it will be stored on their computers and can be displayed on your Wikibook page. Do this by looking for the links on the left-hand side of the page (when you are in editing mode). Under &quot;toolbox&quot; you'll find &quot;upload file&quot;.  Click on this and follow the directions there. Then, once it is uploaded to Wikimedia's computer, you need to insert it into your article. Do this by clicking on the 6th editing button (the one with the picture on it). Insert the name if your picture file (you remember the name right?) and Voila! your picture should appear (after you hit &quot;save page&quot;). If this doesn't work check out the tutorial on Blackboard (these are great resources). Don't forget to give the author of the image and include it in your references. 

NEW NOTE: I have learned a great deal in posting my sample Wiki article. This image that I have used here is problematic. I am using it with permission from the author, but that is not the same as using images from the public domain or that are licensed for free sharing i.e. the authors have specifically granted permission for their work to be freely copied and distributed. Because Wikibooks allows all of their content to be freely copied and distributed all the tables, figures, text, images, etc. contained within it must also allow these same privileges. Wikibooks is allowing me to keep this image up for a limited time, but technically unless the author tells me that his work is published under a free license, it shouldn't be included. So, the basic rule to learn from my experience is not to use any image for which the author has retained some copyrights, even if you ask for permission to use it. Unless an image is appropriately licensed for free distribution, don't use it. 
*Instead visit Wikimedia's collection of public domain images: &lt;li&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Public_domain_image_resources
*OR Wikimedia commons, which contains over 2.3 million freely usable files:
*http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
*OR Flickr's creative commons site in which you can search for freely usable files:
*http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/
*OR, this site which contains copyright friendly and copyleft images:
*http://www.sdst.org/shs/library/cfimages.html
*As well, you can [[Wikibooks:Boilerplate request for permission|try]] to get images released under a {{plainlinks|1=http://freedomdefined.org/Definition|2=free license}}
&lt;/font&gt;
  
The key elements of dissertation or thesis title-writing are shown in Figure 1, which summarizes the five critical components of a good title: (1) the witty catchphrase, (2) the ubiquitous colon, (3) the necessary but boring stuff, (4) a carefully-selected preposition, and (5) the obscure topic about which few people actually give a hoot.

However, the APA format is correct and you can follow these examples.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;To change the font type or font color, see my code here. You can type font color=&quot;#type the six-digit code&quot; to change the color and face=&quot;Type in the name of the font here&quot;. FYI not all fonts will work. All this code needs to be inside carrots &lt;&gt;. If you don't want a font to be used for the entire paper you need to &quot;turn the font off&quot; by typing &quot;/font inside carrots &lt;&gt; when you want it to go back to normal. I suggest using normal black font for all of your text except for sidebars or other parts you might want to highlight. Don't just write your text in purple and green for fun. Our eyes would hurt!!


Wiki Code is very similar to HTML code. I found a website that provides simple instructions for code that you can use. http://www.computerhope.com/learnhtm.htm



You can use HTML code to put a table in your Wiki article (or you can use Wiki code). Check out these websites or copy my code.
 
Tips to help you &quot;decode&quot; the code:
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tr= table row
&lt;li&gt;th = table heading
&lt;li&gt;td = table data (whatever you want to put inside the cells of your data)
&lt;li&gt;/= turning off so /tr = end of table row
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;



&lt;table border=&quot;2&quot;&gt;

== Posting an article ==
&lt;li&gt;Go to the page where you want to post
&lt;li&gt;Click &quot;edit this page&quot;
&lt;li&gt;Type away.
&lt;li&gt;Play around with the editing tools above the window (putting your mouse on top of the icons will tell you what each button does)

== Posting a picture you have stored on your computer ==


'''Step 1''' 

Step 1 is to upload the picture file to Wikibooks:
&lt;li&gt;1. Under the toolbox menu on the left click on Upload file
&lt;li&gt;2. Browse to find the picture you want to use - this should appear in the Source line
&lt;li&gt;3. Name the picture and write it down exactly as you have named it - this goes in the Destination file name
&lt;li&gt;4. Select the proper copyright/license information (Remember NOT to use any images that are copyrighted. Use images you took yourself or ones that are in the public domain, the creative commons, or from other copyleft sources) - if you took the picture yourself - look for the recommended license-
&lt;li&gt;5. Hit upload file&lt;/ul&gt;

'''Step 2''' 

Step 2 is to place the image where you want it in Wikibooks
&lt;li&gt;1. Go to the page when you want to post your picture
&lt;li&gt;2. Click edit this page
&lt;li&gt;3. Click the icon of the picture in the tool box at the top of the editing window (this is the 6th button from the left - it will insert this text: bracket bracket colon example.jpg bracket bracket
&lt;li&gt;4. Replace example.jpg with the name of your picture
&lt;li&gt;5. Click &quot;save page&quot;  and see if your picture comes up
&lt;li&gt; Here is a picture of my son (click edit this page to see my code)
[[Image:Donovan1.jpg|300px|center]]
&lt;/ul&gt;

'''Step 3'''

Step 3: Make the image the size you want and place it on the left, the right or the center
&lt;li&gt;1. You can control the size of your picture by saying how many pixels you want it to be. This picture of my son is 300 pixels. To do this - add a vertical line (look on the keyboard above the enter key) then the number of pixels you want the image to be and then the abbreviation px for pixels e.g. Image:Donovan1.jpg|300px - this would be inside the double brackets
&lt;li&gt;2. You can place the image on the left, right or center. To do this add a vertical line (shift + the key above enter) and the word left, right or center e.g. Image:Donovan1.jpg|300px|right - this would be inside the double brackets
&lt;li&gt;Here is my son smaller and on the right
[[Image:Donovan1.jpg|100px|right|Donovan, age 3]]
&lt;/ul&gt;

'''Step 4'''

Step 4: You can add a caption to your picture

If you want a title to appear when you put the mouse over the image, you need to only add the title at the end of your image file  - after a vertical line and before the closing brackets (e.g. Image:Donovan1.jpg|100px|right|Donovan, age 3 - this would be inside the double brackets).
If you want an actual caption to appear I have found only two ways to do this:
&lt;li&gt;1. Make the image a thumbnail - then you can add a caption
&lt;li&gt;To do this add the word |thumb| after the image name and add a caption by typing a title before the closing bracket 
&lt;li&gt;e.g.(this would all be inside the double brackets)
Image:image name.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Donovan, age 3
&lt;li&gt;see my example below
[[Image:Donovan1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Donovan, age 3]]

&lt;li&gt;2. Put the image into a table - then you can add color, text, etc.
&lt;li&gt;You can control whether the table is centered, right aligned or left aligned (mine is centered, see the code that says ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;
&lt;li&gt;You can control the size of the table (mine is 40% of the page, WIDTH = 40%)
&lt;li&gt;You can control the color and size of the border (color = pink - FFBDBD; size = 5px)and background (cream - FFFFCC),  the width of the padding in the background (padding:1em) 
&lt;li&gt;You can control whether the caption is centered or aligned to the left or right (I have it centered - you can see I have &quot;center&quot; typed in &lt;&gt; before my title
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFCC;
border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
[[Image:Donovan1.jpg|300px]] &lt;center&gt; ''Donovan, age 3.'' &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Writing an Author Reflection ==

Each author, after posting the final version of either their Foundations article or Assessment article, should leave an &quot;Author Reflection&quot; on their article's discussion page.

An Author Reflection is a statement from the author reflecting on the content of their article.  Some example author reflections include:

*The author's opinion on the topic based on the information reported and his/her own personal experience.
*A personal experience related to the topic such as an observation from a classroom or a memory of a personal school experience.
*Questions the author was left with after researching the topic.
*Deliberations the author had about what content to include in the article or which sources to use.


== Directions for Writing an Author Reflection ==

*After posting the final version of your article, go to the &quot;discussion&quot; page for your article by clicking the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top
*Click &quot;edit this page&quot;
*Type the words &quot;Author Reflection&quot; and make it a Level 2 Headline by highlighting the text and clicking the 5th editing button from the left (the one with the large &quot;A&quot; on it)
*Type in your Author Reflection
*Sign your response with four tilde &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*Don't forget to click SAVE PAGE

== Writing a Reader Response ==

Readers of this textbook are invited to leave a response on the discussion page of any article or any user's home page.

*Reader Responses to articles are intended to create a dialog about the content of this text.
*Reader Responses to user pages are intended to promote a sense of community among the authors and readers.

A Reader Response is a reaction to the content posted on a page. It can ask a question, offer an opinion, convey a personal experience, question the content or source of the information or provide any other substantive comment on the information provided in the original posting.

== Directions for leaving a Reader Response ==

*After reading an article, click on the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top of the screen. 
*Click &quot;Edit this page&quot; 
*If it does not already appear on the page, type the words &quot;Reader Responses&quot; and make it a Level 2 Headline by highlighting the text and clicking the 5th editing button from the left (the one with the large &quot;A&quot; on it)
*Type in your Reader Response

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This is wildly out-of-date, both these hooks are [[mw:ResourceLoader/JavaScript_Deprecations|deprecated]]. Instead you use [[mw:ResourceLoader|ResourceLoader]] to load JavaScript resources which typically use jQuery to run code at the appropriate event.
(and yet some freewebhosts still only has old php, and we can only use old version of mediawiki)

==addOnloadHook()==
{{js|addOnloadHook(someFunction);}}
This hooks onto the completion of the page load, and runs the specified function. You can run an anonymous function too:
{{js|addOnloadHook(function(){
    ...
});}}
==addHandler()==
{{js|addHandler(domElement,'action',someFunction);}}
This hooks onto the action being performed on some DOM element, running the function. This can be useful for example if you want to change the user's input when submitting a form:
{{js|1=
function reallyChangeInput(){
    ...
}
function changeInput() {
    form = document.getElementById('editform');
    if (!form) return false;
    addHandler(form,'submit',reallyChangeInput);
}
addOnloadHook(changeInput);}}

== Rating the articles in our Wikibook ==

Readers are invited to rate the articles that appear in our Wikibook. Ratings may be given for Foundations Content Articles, or the Foundations author and/or editor duties. 

Each Foundations Content article will be rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high) on four criteria:

*Importance/Relevance 
*Interest
*Credibility
*Writing Skill 

The goal of our text is to provide well-written articles that are relevant and interesting to pre-service teachers (students studying education) and that are credible and current sources of information on topics related to the foundations and assessment of education.

Articles receiving the highest ratings will become part of our official textbook from which the students will be tested. These articles may also carry over to subsequent versions of the textbook.

The Foundations author and editior duties will be rated in a similar fashion, but with different criteria. 


== Instructions for ECI 301 students rating articles ==

*To rate an article, click the &quot;Rate this Article&quot; button at the end of the article.
*A new window will open and you will be prompted to enter your UIN and to select the ratings for each of the four criteria.
*You may also leave a comment.
*Please rate each article with integrity. Consider the Wiki article rubric when making your decisions.
*Ratings will be used to determine student grades and the article selected for the official textbook.</text>

== Peer Review ==

The peer review process is a CRITICAL part of our textbook writing process. It accomplishes several goals:

#It helps the students write better articles which results in better grades for them and a better overall textbook for everyone
#It gives students practice assessing each other, specifically using a rubric and giving specific meaningful feedback 

As such, doing a peer-review is a complex process which you should plan to dedicate some time to.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==URL constructors and server information==
{{js|1=
var wgScript = &quot;/w/index.php&quot;;
var wgArticlePath = &quot;/wiki/$1&quot;:
var wgServer = &quot;//en.wikibooks.org&quot;;
var wgCookiePrefix = &quot;enwikibooks&quot;;
}}
Using &lt;code&gt;wgServer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wgScript&lt;/code&gt;, you can build a valid URL for the wiki. This is most useful for diffs and other action links.

To go to a page on Wikimedia wikis, you know that http://lang.family.org/wiki/article will take you where you want to go, but not all wikis have [[mw:Short URL|short URLs]] - in that case, use &lt;code&gt;wgArticlePath&lt;/code&gt; to know how you construct an article path, or just use &lt;code&gt;wgServer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wgScript&lt;/code&gt;.

Variable &lt;code&gt;wgArticlePath&lt;/code&gt; can be used by replacing $1 by the page title: &lt;code&gt;wgArticlePath.replace(/$1/,&quot;Main Page&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.

==Page information==
{{js|1=
var wgCanonicalNamespace = &quot;&quot;;
var wgCanonicalSpecialPageName = false;
var wgNamespaceNumber = 0;
var wgPageName = &quot;MediaWiki_Developer\'s_Handbook/Add_JavaScript&quot;;
var wgTitle = &quot;MediaWiki Developer\'s Handbook/Add JavaScript&quot;;
var wgAction = &quot;view&quot;;
var wgIsArticle = true;
var wgCanonicalNamespace = &quot;Special&quot;;
var wgCanonicalSpecialPageName = &quot;Specialpages&quot;;
var wgNamespaceNumber = -1;
var wgPageName = &quot;Special:SpecialPages&quot;;
var wgTitle = &quot;SpecialPages&quot;;
}}
The canonical namespace never changes based on localization. For example, on kmwiki, their meta or project namespace has &lt;code&gt;wgCanonicalNamespace == &quot;Project&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and on [[:w:km:ជំនួយ:Editing|km:ជំនួយ:Editing]], &lt;code&gt;wgCanonicalNamespace == &quot;Help&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

As well, each namespace has a number, beginning with zero for the main namespace. These numbers are [[mw:Manual:Namespace|customizable]].

This is helpful to make scripts portable - you don't have to worry about knowing the localized name for a namespace - just use the canonical name, or the number.

Since this page is in the main namespace, &lt;code&gt;wgPageName == wgTitle&lt;/code&gt;, but on [[Wikibooks:About]], that is not the case:
{{js|1=
var wgPageName = &quot;Help:About&quot;;
var wgTitle = &quot;About&quot;;
}}
wgTitle never includes the namespace prefix, while wgPageName does. Note also that wgPageName replaces spaces with underscores.

wgAction is one of:
*view
*submit (after clicking ''Save page'', ''Show preview'', or ''Show changes'')
*history
*edit
*delete
*protect
*purge (when doing &lt;code&gt;?action=purge&lt;/code&gt; to purge the server cache, forcing the page to be re-rendered)
This exposes what the user is doing on the current page. Be careful: to the user, view, submit and purge are probably not differentiated in many cases. In some cases, you will want your script to run on all of those.

wgAction is often useful to avoid running your whole script when it isn't needed. If your script changes the page history form, then you can do
{{js|1=if ( wgAction == 'history' ) {
	addOnloadHook( changeHistoryForm() );
}
function changeHistoryForm() {
	...
}
}}

wgIsArticle tells you whether the page is an article as opposed to a [[Special:SpecialPages|special page]].

===Special Pages===
{{js|1=
var wgCanonicalNamespace = &quot;Special&quot;;
var wgCanonicalSpecialPageName = &quot;Specialpages&quot;;
var wgNamespaceNumber = -1;
var wgPageName = &quot;Special:SpecialPages&quot;;
var wgTitle = &quot;SpecialPages&quot;;
}}
For [[Special:SpecialPages|special pages]], the canonical namespace is &quot;Special&quot;, and wgCanonicalSpecialPageName is the non-[[w:CamelCase|CamelCase]] name of the special page in English. Again, the canonical form doesn't change with localization, so it's better to use that. As well, all special pages have the namespace number -1.

==User information==
{{js|1=
var wgUserName = &quot;Mike.lifeguard&quot;;
var wgUserGroups = [&quot;bureaucrat&quot;, &quot;checkuser&quot;, &quot;editor&quot;, &quot;sysop&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;autoconfirmed&quot;];
var wgGlobalGroups = [&quot;Global_rollback&quot;, &quot;steward&quot;];
}}
The user's username is set as wgUserName, and their local and global groups are in arrays. Note that the global group [[m:global rollback|global rollback]] has an underscore, not a space.

This is useful when part of a script requires that the user be in a certain user group, typically sysop:
{{js|1=
function userIsInGroup( group ) {
	// are they in a given local group?
	if ( wgUserGroups ) {
		if ( !group {{!}}{{!}} group.length == 0 ) {
			group = '*';
		}
		for(var i in wgUserGroups)
			if (wgUserGroups[i]==group) return true;
	}
	return false;
}
if ( userIsInGroup( 'sysop' ) ) {
	...
}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">''''''Pride-Pony Express''''''

'''Objectives'''
1.	 The parent(s) will learn how to use the internet as a means of communication with the teacher.
2.	The parent(s) will learn what the Pony Express is and all about.

'''Vocabulary'''
1.	Pony Express 
2.	Internet
3.	E-mail

'''Equipment'''
1.	Internet Service
2.	Computer Software (Laptop, desktop, PDA, Cell phones, Etc.)

'''Pony Express'''
The information system that I will be using is called the Pony Express.  The Pony Express is a system that is has been put into place to help teachers and parents to have an open line of communication.  The Pony Express will not only allow for the teachers and parent/guardian to communicate with each other, but it will also allow school personnel to relay important information to the parent/guardian about what is happening at the school as far as up-coming events.   In order for the parent/guardian to have access to the Pony Express there will be certain criteria for them to follow at all times.  The parent/guardian must first sign a form stating that they understand all rules and regulations that have been set forth by the school district.  After the parent/guardian has signed the form the school’s guidance department will issue a user i.d and password.
The parent/guardian will not: 
1.	Be allowed comprise the system by using bogus information.
2.	Share User I.D.’s and passwords with others.
3.	Be allowed to try and log-in to someone else’s account
If the parent/guardian notices a discrepancy they must notify the school personnel immediately that they have noticed a problem with their account.  To help protect the system there will be security procedure in place.  These procedures will allow the parent/guardian to try and log-in with their user name and password twice after trying to log-in twice the system will automatically lock the parent out.  To regain access the parent/guardian must notify the school that they have been locked out of the system, in order to regain access to the system.

Planning
The planning process will involve parents, teachers, community leaders, and school board members.  The process will begin by looking at the current information system that the district has in place to ensure that the Pony Express will be used in the most effective way.  After a careful review of the current system the new system will then be introduced to the members of the community, parents, teachers, and the school board members.  The board will then decide if the various schools within the county will benefit from what the program has to offer.  The school board will then decide if there is money in the budget to approve the Pride-Pony Express system.
The teachers, administrators, and parents of Madison County Central had a meeting concerning another way of communication besides by the telephone, and letters through the mail. After the meeting, several teachers and administration collaborated on creating a questionnaire for the several different people (community leaders, other teachers, school board members, and parents) to complete.  The questionnaire asked various questions about internet access, email accounts, if computers were available in the home, and if so how much time was spent using the computer.
The school board members asked the administrators and Central if a some type of parent meeting could be held once a month per grade level to help set up the Pride-Pony Express system ,and if the school would host fundraisers throughout the school year to help those parents who are less fortunate to purchase computers.  After all of the questionnaire forms were returned and reviewd, the administrators and staff at Central decided to move ahead with the Pride-Pony Express System.  The Pride-Pony Express System was adopted into the Madison County District School System with only Central School using it first.  The Pride-Pony Express System passed unanimously 5-0 by the school board members.
The Pride-Pony Express will not only be a means of communication for teachers, and parents on a regular basis, it will also serve as a reminder of upcoming events that are happening at the school.  The parents will also be able to check to make sure that their children are actually attending class; the parents will also be able to see what the students are learning at any given time and check grades as well.  The Pride-Pony Express System has not been put in place to by any means replace telephone conversations with the parents and teachers if only affords the parents and teachers both the another opportunity to guarantee the students are getting the best possible education.

'''Analysis''' 
What is Analysis?  In dealing with analysis this is where the parents will have the opportunity to get a better understanding of exactly what Pride-Pony Express is.  The parents will be able to actually look at all aspects of the system and get down deep and dirty with all the features it has to offer to them.  The parents will be allowed access to Pride-Pony Express from where ever there is internet access be it from their cell phone, computer, hotel room or on vacation.  The Pride-Pony Express will aloe parents the opportunity to see at all times what their students is doing and keep and hand in helping them to get the best education possible.
 

Design
The Pride-Pony Express system was designed with the parent in mind.  The system is set-up for if a parent has more than one student at a particular school that they will be allowed to use the same username and password provided that they use the child’s homeroom teacher’s name.  However, when the parent puts in all of their information correctly it will automatically pull up all the information that is needed for all of their students that are enrolled in the district.   The system will be bright and colorful, and have a tutorial page just in case the parents gets lost and needs help when ever a technician get be reached.  The main page will be designed will all of the school’s in the district on it with the name of the administrator for each school.  The main page will however be updated and changed on a regular basis.  The system was mainly designed for parents and teachers; however the school administrators and school board members have access to the main page only. This is where they can put information on the page that they would like for the parents to know about.  The main page is the school’s main website page which consists of a picture of the school, the school address and phone number, and the school motto.   Also, the names the school administrators, school board members, and the teachers with the grade that they teach are on the main page as well. The background scene is filled with the school’s colors and school’s graphics. On the left hand side of the main page, there are several links that the parents click on to get to the proper destination.  
 
'''
Implementation'''

Pride-Pony Express first came into action the summer of 2007.  After careful consideration and a trail and error period it was decided that only one school would implement the system into their every school lives.  After seeing how well Central did with the new system the entire district decided it was a system that they could benefit from greatly.  Not only did the system get more parents involved in the education of the students, but it also turned out the district had more parental involvement as a district.  The district saw an increase in grades, and a decrease in behavior referrals, as well as attendance.

Analysis What is Analysis? In dealing with analysis this is where the parents will have the opportunity to get a better understanding of exactly what Pride-Pony Express is. The parents will be able to actually look at all aspects of the system and get down deep and dirty with all the features it has to offer to them. The parents will be allowed access to Pride-Pony Express from where ever there is internet access be it from their cell phone, computer, hotel room or on vacation. The Pride-Pony Express will aloe parents the opportunity to see at all times what their students is doing and keep and hand in helping them to get the best education possible.


Design The Pride-Pony Express system was designed with the parent in mind. The system is set-up for if a parent has more than one student at a particular school that they will be allowed to use the same username and password provided that they use the child’s homeroom teacher’s name. However, when the parent puts in all of their information correctly it will automatically pull up all the information that is needed for all of their students that are enrolled in the district. The system will be bright and colorful, and have a tutorial page just in case the parents gets lost and needs help when ever a technician get be reached. The main page will be designed will all of the school’s in the district on it with the name of the administrator for each school. The main page will however be updated and changed on a regular basis. The system was mainly designed for parents and teachers; however the school administrators and school board members have access to the main page only. This is where they can put information on the page that they would like for the parents to know about. The main page is the school’s main website page which consists of a picture of the school, the school address and phone number, and the school motto. Also, the names the school administrators, school board members, and the teachers with the grade that they teach are on the main page as well. The background scene is filled with the school’s colors and school’s graphics. On the left hand side of the main page, there are several links that the parents click on to get to the proper destination.

Implementation

Pride-Pony Express first came into action the summer of 2007. After careful consideration and a trail and error period it was decided that only one school would implement the system into their every school lives. After seeing how well Central did with the new system the entire district decided it was a system that they could benefit from greatly. Not only did the system get more parents involved in the education of the students, but it also turned out the district had more parental involvement as a district. The district saw an increase in grades, and a decrease in behavior referrals, as well as attendance.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with '''electronic games''': games that employ electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video games are the most common form of electronic game today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Books include information on the cultural significance of specific electronic games, and application of electronic games as learning and education tools. Games in a series should be part of the same book. Wikibooks is not for walkthroughs and strategy guides&amp;mdash;use [[strategywiki:|StrategyWiki]] instead.

==Scope==
Object
==Purpose==
Behavioral
==Intent==
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
==Applicability==
* when an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other
* when a change to one object requires changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed
* when an object should notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are
==Structure==
[[Image:Observer.svg|center|600px]]

==Consequences==
* + modularity: subject and observers may vary independently
* + extensibility: can define and add any number of observers
* + customizability: different observers provide different views of subject
* - unexpected updates: observers don't know about each other
* - update overhead: might need hints
==Implementation==
* subject-observer mapping
* dangling references
* avoiding observer-specific update protocols: the push and pull models
* registering modifications of interest explicitly
==Related pattern==
* [[../Singleton|Singleton]], is used to make observable object unique and accessible globally.
* [[../Mediator|Mediator]], is used to encapsulate updated objects

==Description==
; Problem : In one place or many places in the application we need to be aware about a system event or an application state change. We'd like to have a standard way of subscribing to listening for system events and a standard way of notifying the interested parties. The notification should be automated after an interested party subscribed to the system event or application state change. There should be a way to unsubscribe, too.

; Forces : Observers and observables probably should be represented by objects. The observer objects will be notified by the observable objects.

; Solution :  After subscribing the listening objects will be notified by a way of method call.

; Loose coupling: When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but they have very little knowledge of each other. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* The only thing that Subject knows about an observer is that it implements a certain interface
* We can add new observers at any time
* We never need to modify the subject to add new types of observers
* We can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other
* Changes to either the subject or an observer will not affect the other

== Examples ==
The Observer pattern is used extensively in Java. E.g. in the following piece of code
* &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; is the Subject
* &lt;code&gt;MyListener&lt;/code&gt; is the Observer
* &lt;code&gt;actionPerformed()&lt;/code&gt; is the equivalent to &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 JButton button = new JButton(&quot;Click me!&quot;);
 button.addActionListener(new MyListener());
 
 class MyListener implements ActionListener {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
       ...
    }  
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Another example is the &lt;code&gt;PropertyChangeSupport&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt; class uses a &lt;code&gt;PropertyChangeSupport&lt;/code&gt; object to let  interested observers register for notification of changes in the properties of labels, panels, and other GUI components.

[[Image:Observer-PropertyChangeSupport.gif|center|800px]]

Can you find the &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Observer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt; in the above class diagram?
* &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt; is the Subject
* &lt;code&gt;PropertyChangeListener&lt;/code&gt; is the Observer
* &lt;code&gt;propertyChange()&lt;/code&gt; is the equivalent to &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt;

== Cost ==
This pattern can be tricky if you do not beware. Beware the data representing the state changes of the subject can evolve without changing the interfaces. If you only transmit a string, the pattern could become very expensive if at least one new observer needs also a state code. You should use a mediator unless you know the implementation of the subject state will never change.

=== Creation ===
This pattern has a cost to create.

=== Maintenance ===
This pattern can be expensive to maintain.

=== Removal ===
This pattern has a cost to remove too.

== Advises ==
* Put the ''subject'' and ''observer'' term in the name of the subject and the observer classes to indicate the use of the pattern to the other developers.
* To improve performances, you can only send to the observers the difference of states instead of the new state. The observers can only update following the changed part of the subject instead of all the state of the subject.

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Implementation in C#}}
==Traditional Method==
C# and the other [[.NET Framework]] languages do not typically require a full implementation of the Observer pattern using interfaces and concrete objects.  Here is an example of using them, however.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 
 
using System;
using System.Collections;

namespace Wikipedia.Patterns.Observer
{
  // IObserver --&gt; interface for the observer
  public interface IObserver
  {
    // called by the subject to update the observer of any change
    // The method parameters can be modified to fit certain criteria
    void Update(string message);
  }

  public class Subject
  {
    // use array list implementation for collection of observers
    private ArrayList observers;

    // constructor
    public Subject()
    {
      observers = new ArrayList();
    }

    public void Register(IObserver observer)
    {
      // if list does not contain observer, add
      if (!observers.Contains(observer))
      {
        observers.Add(observer);
      }
    }

    public void Unregister(IObserver observer)
    {
      // if observer is in the list, remove
      observers.Remove(observer);
    }

    public void Notify(string message)
    {
      // call update method for every observer
      foreach (IObserver observer in observers)
      {
        observer.Update(message);
      }
    }
  }

  // Observer1 --&gt; Implements the IObserver
  public class Observer1 : IObserver
  {
    public void Update(string message)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Observer1:&quot; + message);
    }
  }

  // Observer2 --&gt; Implements the IObserver
  public class Observer2 : IObserver
  {
    public void Update(string message)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Observer2:&quot; + message);
    }
  }

  // Test class
  public class ObserverTester
  {
    [STAThread]
    public static void Main()
    {
      Subject mySubject = new Subject();
      IObserver myObserver1 = new Observer1();
      IObserver myObserver2 = new Observer2();

      // register observers
      mySubject.Register(myObserver1);
      mySubject.Register(myObserver2);

      mySubject.Notify(&quot;message 1&quot;);
      mySubject.Notify(&quot;message 2&quot;);
    }
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Using Events==
The alternative to using concrete and abstract observers and publishers in C# and other [[.NET Framework]] languages, such as [[Visual Basic]], is to use events.  The event model is supported via [[Delegation (programming)|delegates]] that define the method signature that should be used to capture events.  Consequently, delegates provide the mediation otherwise provided by the abstract observer, the methods themselves provide the concrete observer, the concrete subject is the class defining the event, and the subject is the event system built into the base class library.  It is the preferred method of accomplishing the Observer pattern in .NET applications.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

// First, declare a delegate type that will be used to fire events.
//  This is the same delegate as System.EventHandler.
//  This delegate serves as the abstract observer.
//  It does not provide the implementation, but merely the contract.
public delegate void EventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e);

// Next, declare a published event.  This serves as the concrete subject.
//  Note that the abstract subject is handled implicitly by the runtime.
public class Button
{
    // The EventHandler contract is part of the event declaration.
    public event EventHandler Clicked;

    // By convention, .NET events are fired from descendant classes by a virtual method,
    //  allowing descendant classes to handle the event invocation without subscribing
    //  to the event itself.
    protected virtual void OnClicked(EventArgs e)
    {
        if (Clicked != null)
            Clicked(this, e); // implicitly calls all observers/subscribers
    }
}

// Then in an observing class, you are able to attach and detach from the events:
public class Window
{
    private Button okButton;

    public Window()
    {
        okButton = new Button();
        // This is an attach function.  Detaching is accomplished with -=.
        // Note that it is invalid to use the assignment operator - events are multicast
        //  and can have multiple observers.
        okButton.Clicked += new EventHandler(okButton_Clicked);
    }

    private void okButton_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // This method is called when Clicked(this, e) is called within the Button class
        //  unless it has been detached.
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Handy implementation ==
You can implement this pattern in [[Java Programming|Java]] like this:

 // Observer pattern -- Structural example
 // @since JDK 5.0
 import java.util.ArrayList;

 // &quot;Subject&quot;
 abstract class Subject {
    // Fields
    private ArrayList&lt;Observer&gt; observers = new ArrayList&lt;Observer&gt;();
    // Methods
    public void attach(Observer observer) {
       observers.add(observer);
    }
    public void detach(Observer observer) {
       observers.remove(observer);
    }
    public void notifyObservers() {
       for (Observer o : observers)    
          o.update();
   }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2, 6, 9&quot;&gt;
 // &quot;ConcreteSubject&quot;
 class ConcreteSubject extends Subject {
  // Fields

  // Properties
  public String getSubjectState() {
    return subjectState;
  }
  public void setSubjectState(String value) {
    subjectState = value;
  }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
 // &quot;Observer&quot;
 abstract class Observer {
   // Methods
   abstract public void update();
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2, 15&quot;&gt;
 // &quot;ConcreteObserver&quot;
 class ConcreteObserver extends Observer {
  // Fields
  private String name;
  private String observerState;
  private ConcreteSubject subject;
 
  // Constructors
  public ConcreteObserver(ConcreteSubject subject, String name) {
     this.subject = subject;
     this.name = name;
     //subject.attach(this);
  }
  // Methods
  public void update() {
     observerState = subject.getSubjectState();
     System.out.printf(&quot;Observer %s's new state is %s\n&quot;, name, observerState);
  }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 // Client test
 public class Client {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Configure Observer structure
      ConcreteSubject s = new ConcreteSubject();
      s.attach(new ConcreteObserver(s, &quot;A&quot;));
      s.attach(new ConcreteObserver(s, &quot;B&quot;));
      s.attach(new ConcreteObserver(s, &quot;C&quot;));

      // Change subject and notify observers
      s.setSubjectState(&quot;NEW&quot;);
      s.notifyObservers();
   }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Built-in support ==
The Java JDK has several implementations of this pattern: application in Graphical User Interfaces such as in the AWK toolkit, Swing etc. In Swing, whenever a user clicks a button or adjusts a slider, many objects in the application may need to react to the change. Swing refers to interested clients (observers) as &quot;listeners&quot; and lets you register as many listeners as you like to be notified of a component's events.

MVC is more M(VC) in Swing, i.e. View and Controller are tightly coupled; Swing does not divide Views from Controllers. MVC supports n-tier development, i.e. loosely coupled layers (see below) that can change independently and that may even execute on different machines.

There is also a built-in support for the Observer pattern. All one has to do is extend [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Observable.html &lt;tt&gt;java.util.Observable&lt;/tt&gt;] (the &lt;i&gt;Subject&lt;/i&gt;) and tell it when to notify the [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Observer.html &lt;tt&gt;java.util.Observer&lt;/tt&gt;]s. The API does the rest for you. You may use either push or pull style of updating your observers.

[[Image:Observer-java.jpg|center|600px]]

&lt;code&gt;java.util.Observable&lt;/code&gt; is a class while &lt;code&gt;java.util.Observer&lt;/code&gt; is an interface.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
 public void setValue(double value) {
    this.value = value;
    setChanged();
    notifyObservers();
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Note that you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to call &lt;code&gt;setChanged()&lt;/code&gt; so that the &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; code will broadcast the change.
The &lt;code&gt;notifyObservers()&lt;/code&gt; method calls the &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt; method of each registered observer. The &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt; method is a requirement for implementers of the &lt;code&gt;Observer&lt;/code&gt; Interface.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;6, 10&quot;&gt;
 // Observer pattern -- Structural example
 import java.util.Observable;
 import java.util.Observer;

 // &quot;Subject&quot;
 class ConcreteSubject extends Observable {
  // Fields
  private String subjectState;
  // Methods
  public void dataChanged() {
     setChanged();
     notifyObservers(); // use the pull method
  }
  // Properties
  public String getSubjectState() {
     return subjectState;
  }
  public void setSubjectState(String value) {
      subjectState = value;
      dataChanged();
  }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;5, 19&quot;&gt;
 // &quot;ConcreteObserver&quot;
 import java.util.Observable;
 import java.util.Observer;

 class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
   // Fields
   private String name;
   private String observerState;
   private Observable subject;
 
   // Constructors
   public ConcreteObserver(Observable subject, String name) {
     this.subject = subject;
     this.name = name;
     subject.addObserver(this);
  }

  // Methods
  public void update(Observable subject, Object arg) {
   if (subject instanceof ConcreteSubject) {
     ConcreteSubject subj = (ConcreteSubject)subject;
     observerState = subj.getSubjectState();
     System.out.printf(&quot;Observer %s's new state is %s\n&quot;, name, observerState);
   }
  }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 // Client test
 public class Client {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Configure Observer structure
      ConcreteSubject s = new ConcreteSubject();
      new ConcreteObserver(s, &quot;A&quot;);
      new ConcreteObserver(s, &quot;B&quot;);
      new ConcreteObserver(s, &quot;C&quot;);
      // Change subject and notify observers
      s.setSubjectState(&quot;NEW&quot;);
   }
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Keyboard handling ===

Below is an example written in Java that takes keyboard input and treats each input line as an event. The example is built upon the library classes &lt;code&gt;java.util.Observer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.util.Observable&lt;/code&gt;. When a string is supplied from System.in, the method &lt;code&gt;notifyObservers&lt;/code&gt; is then called, in order to notify all observers of the event's occurrence, in the form of an invocation of their 'update' methods - in our example, &lt;code&gt;ResponseHandler.update(...)&lt;/code&gt;.

The file &lt;code&gt;MyApp.java&lt;/code&gt; contains a &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method that might be used in order to run the code.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;9, 17, 18&quot;&gt;
/* Filename : EventSource.java */
package org.wikibooks.obs;

import java.util.Observable;          // Observable is here
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class EventSource extends Observable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            final InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            final BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            while (true) {
                String response = br.readLine();
                setChanged();
                notifyObservers(response);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;8, 10&quot;&gt;
/* Filename : ResponseHandler.java */

package org.wikibooks.obs;

import java.util.Observable;
import java.util.Observer;  /* this is Event Handler */

public class ResponseHandler implements Observer {
    private String resp;
    public void update(Observable obj, Object arg) {
        if (arg instanceof String) {
            resp = (String) arg;
            System.out.println(&quot;\nReceived Response: &quot; + resp );
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
/* Filename : MyApp.java */
/* This is the main program */

package org.wikibooks.obs;

public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Enter Text &gt;&quot;);

        // create an event source - reads from stdin
        final EventSource eventSource = new EventSource();

        // create an observer
        final ResponseHandler responseHandler = new ResponseHandler();

        // subscribe the observer to the event source
        eventSource.addObserver(responseHandler);

        // starts the event thread
        Thread thread = new Thread(eventSource);
        thread.start();
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The Java implementation of the Observer pattern has pros and cons:

'''Pros'''
* It hides many of the details of the Observer pattern
* It can be used both pull and push ways.

'''Cons'''
* Because &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; is a class, you have to subclass it; you can’t add on the &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt; behavior to an existing class that subclasses another superclass (fails the programming to interfaces principle). If you can’t subclass &lt;code&gt;Observable&lt;/code&gt;, then use delegation, i.e. provide your class with an Observable object and have your class forward key method calls to it.
* Because &lt;code&gt;setChanged()&lt;/code&gt; is protected, you can’t favour composition over inheritance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Previously, our mathematical models of simple harmonic motion have assumed that the energy stored by a simple harmonic oscillator is constant. In reality, of course, resistive forces slow an oscillator down, transferring its energy to its surroundings. A pendulum will lose energy by moving the air. In addition to this, the motion of a mass on a spring will cause the spring to heat up, 'losing' the energy. This process is known as damping.

The principal effect of damping is to reduce the amplitude of an oscillation, not to change its frequency. So, the graph of the amplitude of a normal damped oscillation might look like the following:

[[Image:Exponential_loss_blue.svg]]

==Critical Damping==
Critical damping occurs when a system is designed to return an oscillator to its equilibrium position in the least time possible. A critically damped oscillator, when damped, ceases to oscillate, and returns to its equilibrium position, where it stops moving. An example is the door closer. Normally, the door would swing back and forth, being damped by friction in the hinges, and air resistance. The door closer forces the door to stop swinging, and shut immediately. When closed, the door is in its equilibrium position.

==Questions==

1. Draw a graph of displacement for a critically damped oscillation.

2. How would you critically damp an oscillating pendulum?

3. How would you damp an oscillating pendulum using only a weighted polystyrene block?

4. What would the displacement graph look like for this oscillation, before and after damping began?

5. The graph above is an exponentially damped oscillation. If the displacement of the undamped oscillation is given by sin &amp;omega;t, what is an approximate equation for the damped oscillation, in terms of a constant k which describes the degree to which the oscillation is damped?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. Draw a graph of displacement for a critically damped oscillation.'''

[[Image:Critical_damping_graph.svg]]

'''2. How would you critically damp an oscillating pendulum?'''

Grab the weight, move it to its equilibrium position, and stop it moving.

'''3. How would you damp an oscillating pendulum using only a weighted polystyrene block?'''

Put the block in the path of the pendulum, which will bounce off the weight, losing a bot of energy each oscillation.

'''4. What would the displacement graph look like for this oscillation, before and after damping began?'''

[[Image:Damping_block_graph.svg]]

'''5. The graph above is an exponentially damped oscillation. If the displacement of the undamped oscillation is given by sin &amp;omega;t, what is an approximate equation for the damped oscillation, in terms of a constant k which describes the degree to which the oscillation is damped?'''

&lt;math&gt;x = e^{-k\omega t}\sin{\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

If k doubles, the e&lt;sup&gt;-kt&lt;/sup&gt; will be squashed to half its size along the t-axis, so as k increases, the rate of damping increases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bosons are particles with an integer spin, such as 1, 2 etc and mediate a specific force. All interactions can be described by one of the four forces, gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong which are caused by the release of a corresponding boson.

==Feynman Diagrams==
One way of representing these interactions is the Feynman diagram. This is a graph with time on the vertical axis, and space on the horizontal axis showing the paths of particles through space and time as lines. So, a stationary electron looks like this:

[[Image:Feynman_stationary_electron.svg|200px]]

It is often useful to define our units of space and time in such a way that, if something is travelling at the speed of light, it makes a 45° angle. Bosons are virtual particles, so they are given wavy lines. So, a photon travelling at the speed of light from A to B looks like the following:

[[Image:Feynman_photon_c.svg|200px]]

Different particles can, of course, interact with each other. These interactions must take place at a definite point in space-time. They can be represented by a certain point on a Feynman diagram, with lines coming in and out of the point representing the velocities of particles which take part in the interaction.

==Photons==
Photons are massless, have a spin of +1, neutral charge and carry the electromagnetic force. They are 'given off' by one particle, causing it to change its velocity. They are then 'received' by another particle, causing it too to change its velocity. This can be represented on a Feynman diagram in the following way:

[[Image:Feynmandiagram.svg|200px]]

==W and Z Bosons==
W and Z bosons carry the weak nuclear force between particles. This occurs, for example, in &amp;beta; decay, which actually takes place in two stages. First, a proton turns into a neutron (or vice versa), emitting a W boson. Then, the W boson 'turns into' an electron / positron and an (anti-) neutrino. This is shown in the following Feynman diagram:

[[Image:Beta_Negative_Decay.svg|200px]]

==Gluons==
Gluons carry the colour force between quarks, holding them together. Quarks have a property known as 'colour', as do gluons. The gluons carry colour between the quarks, mediating the colour force. The strong force is the residual colour force that holds hadrons together. You probably won't be asked about gluons in the exam.

==Questions==

1. A stationary light source emits single photons at regular intervals. Draw a Feynman diagram to represent this.

2. Write two equations (including a W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; boson) which describe positron emission.

3. What is the charge on a W&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; boson?

4. Read Richard Feynman's excellent book, &quot;QED - the Strange Theory of Light and Matter&quot;, ISBN 978-0-140-12505-4.

&lt;math&gt;p \to n + W^{+}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;W^{+} \to \nu + e^{+}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. What is the charge on a W&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; boson?'''

-1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C, since it has to balance the charge on a proton.

Don't look here. I can't read a book for you. Visit your library, bookshop, or whatever.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==

* For 1 kg of all-purpose flour
* 50 ml (4 tbsp) of oil
* 300 to 400 ml (1 2/3 - 2 cups) of hot water

==Procedure==

# Mix all the ingredients with a [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] with [[Cookbook:Dough_Hook|dough hooks]] or with your hands. Remember to use hot water, e.g., hottest from the tap. Mix until you get a smooth, elastic but not sticking dough.
# Let it rest for some hours, preferably in the fridge wrapped in plastic.
# Cut into small amounts. Flatten them using a [[Cookbook:Pasta_Maker|pasta maker]]. Follow the same procedure of your machine as for pasta: pass it several times in the machine size 1, folding, it in two until you get a nicely shaped dough. Then increment each time the size on the machine until you reached the desired size.
# You can alternatively use a  [[Cookbook:Rolling_Pin|rolling pin]] with a lot of courage.

==Variations==
The phyllo dough is used in several countries. It would be certainly hard to find the perfect recipe for all applications. You might want to adjust the quantity of oil (from 1 cl to 1 dl). One might also add lemon juice, vinegar, spirit, salt or even white of eggs.</text>

== Education as a Profession ==

'''&lt;big&gt;The Scoop From Someone Who Knows&lt;/big&gt;'''

By Jill Newhart-Fortner

'''&lt;u&gt;Learning Target&lt;/u&gt;'''

''Students will be able to identify the reasons why teachers teach.''

''Students will be able to identify the requirements of education professionals, as set forth in No Child Left Behind.''

''After reading the interview from the expert, students will be able to identify how she believes teachers should impact their students.''

''Students will be able to identify the goal of teaching.''


                                            [[File:teacher.jpg|500px|Center]]


'''&lt;u&gt;Background of Topic&lt;/u&gt;'''  

The term &quot;profession&quot; is defined in Webster's Dictionary as &quot;a calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive academic preparation (profession, 2009).&quot; Students understand that at the end of their college career the end goal will be their desired profession. If becoming an educator is that goal, there are characteristics that educators must possess. Many educators feel that teaching is a calling and there is a reason why they have the urge to teach.  In a hearing before the United States House Committee on Education and Labor a teacher, Valdine McLean,  from Lovelock, Nevada reiterated this point; “Aspiring teachers rarely go into teaching for the money (Representatives, 2007, p. 22).”

In a lecture given by Professor Seth Lerer at Stanford University, he describes the exploration of education and literature and compares the view of some people in society when they describe teaching. Lerer gives many examples of characteristics that teachers should adapt in their profession using literature to describe teachers. &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCC7F7;border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Listen to Dr. Lerer's Lecture at Stanford Univerity''' [http://ctl.stanford.edu/AWT/Lerer_03.html Dr. Lerer Lecture about Teaching]. 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Professor Lerer proposed that there are stereotypes of teachers. These stereotypes describe the adage that &quot;those who can't teach (Lerer, 2003).&quot;  This quote actually is adapted by a film by Woodie Allen called Annie Hall in 1977. The quote was &quot;those who can't do teach, those who can't teach, teach gym (Allen, 1977).&quot;  This describes how some people in society view teachers and is the main reason why it is necessary for educators to be positive role models, continue to pursue further training, and use themselves as the examples that educators are professional.





'''&lt;u&gt;Introduction of the Expert&lt;/u&gt;'''

Barbara Fortner is an experienced teacher and is currently a principal at Sparrow Road Intermediate in Chesapeake, VA. She completed her Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education from Longwood College (now University) in May, 1988.  Barbara received an early contract to teach in Chesapeake through the career commitment program and began her employment with Chesapeake Public Schools in August, 1988.  In May, 1994 she received her Master of Arts in Urban Education and Administration from Norfolk State University.  After teaching for 11 years (3rd and 4th grades), Barbara was appointed to Assistant Principal of Deep Creek Central Elementary where she worked for 8 years.  This is her 2nd year as Principal of Sparrow Road Intermediate.  Based on her knowledge and educational experience, she would be considered an expert in education.

'''&lt;u&gt;Interview&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''Give your thoughts why someone would discount education as a profession.'''

For as long as I can remember, education has always been given a bad rap.  In the capitalistic world in which we live, money is viewed as the key to success and unfortunately those looking to get ahead financially look to higher paying jobs to climb that ladder.  As a result, many do not enter the field of education.   Ignorant people assume that because the salary is not enticing that those interested in the field must be lower achievers.  Ironically, it is the educators that help mold and shape the individuals into the successful professionals that they are.

'''What do you think makes an educator more credible as a professional?'''

True teachers, like preachers, are called to the profession.  They are teachers because they want to make a difference ~ shaping and preparing individuals ~ for the future!   For the very same reason as I stated above, educators are not in the field for the money.  They truly want to help students grow academically, socially and emotionally so that they may become productive citizens and lifelong learners.  In this day and time, they are needed more than ever and represent more than just a student’s teacher.  They are a counselor, nurse, police officer, friend, pseudo-parent, encourager, supporter just to name a few.  

'''What has been your experience going from a teacher to an administrator?  Has that changed your perspective on education?''' 

As an administrator, I have become the instructional leader and manager of the school and have less direct personal contact with students.  That is the hardest transition for me.  I miss that connection with “my” students!  I miss the impact that I made as a teacher but know that I am creating an instructional environment conducive for learning and I am helping 500 students rather than just 20 while leading 100 staff members to continue to strive for success while giving their best.
Seeing the bigger picture from administration has changed my perspective on education a bit.  The paperwork and politics can blur anyone’s vision; but watching the students learn and share their enlightenments reminds me every day of our purpose, educating all of the children of all of the people, and that keeps me focused.

'''How would you encourage future students to choose education as a profession?'''

As I stated earlier, education is a work of heart!  Teachers are born, not made!  It is my hope that we continue to hire exceptional teachers who will leave a mark not just on students’ minds but on their hearts.   They will touch, figuratively speaking, students in such a way that they will want to be able to share those same experiences with the next generation.  It is truly that simple.  Thirty six years ago, one such teacher did just that and changed my life forever!

They are a counselor, nurse, police officer, friend, pseudo-parent, encourager, supporter just to name a few.&quot; 
Principal Barbara Fortner''' &lt;/big&gt; 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Commentary&lt;/u&gt;

The expert has provided many insights that are in keeping with the idea that educators are not viewed or valued for the level of education they possess.  It is important to note that Principal Fortner pointed out that academic preparation is a part of the characteristics that make educators professional.  She described that there was an understanding that educators also needed to aid students emotionally and socially.   The inclusive education that students receive in college understands that necessity to prepare students as a whole and not only academically.  In the curriculum for teacher preparation it is required that a teacher receives instruction in child development to better understand the emotional and physical changes that are occurring in growing students (College of Arts &amp; Letters: Teacher Prep, 2009).   Consequently, there must be the consideration that there are also environmental factors that contribute to the role of educators.  Students that have the greatest need are often grouped together in areas of poverty and low-income.  A teacher may continually have to deal with lack of parent participation, unstable home environments and other important factors that contribute to security and will have an effect on their students.  

According to the No Child Left Behind Act, there are requirements for schools that have high percentages of low-income students that receive Federal assistance designated as Title I. The law ensures that all teachers in those schools are highly qualified, have to pass a rigorous State Assessment and must use some of the funds that they receive from the government to provide professional development to teachers, principals and other staff members (Bush, 2006, p. 11).  The expert has also pointed out the discrepancy in the pay for educators in comparison to other professionals have contributed to negative connotations about teaching.  In that aspect it is difficult to understand why the academic preparation of a teacher could be any less rewarded than the academic preparation of an engineer.  

The establishment of teaching as a profession relies heavily on the definition of academic preparation. Many schools are using the term &quot;accreditation&quot; when describing their curriculum. According to an article in the Journal of Teacher Education, &quot;Each accrediting body sets rigorous standards for its profession and holds the school it accredits accountable for meeting these rigorous standards (Wise, 2005; vol 56:, p. 320).&quot;  It is necessary to associate the &quot;rigorous standards&quot; to include the education and training that is given to educators. If educators must receive their education and training from an accredited school and meet the requirements adapted by that school to receive their degree, they have completed the rigorous training and are professional educators. Even though the degree has been earned, there are other factors that prevent educators from being viewed as professionals. The enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act set forth new criteria for teachers (Bush, 2006). It not only required teachers to hold at least a bachelor's degree, it also required teachers to be licensed or certified by the State and pass a rigorous State test on subject knowledge and teaching skills (Bush, 2006). 

Although there have been some negative connotations to the NCLB law, there has been positive reform when it comes to the recognition that teachers should meet stringent criteria. There was a requirement in the NCLB law that challenged each state to have all teachers meet the criteria by 2005-2006 school year. According to a hearing in U.S. House of Representatives in 2007, that deadline has been extended based on the failure of all states to meet the criteria (Representatives, 2007, p. 2).  States have guidelines for teacher licensure, as well as guidelines for licensure for other occupations. Professional licensure gives merit to the educational and testing requirements that are mandatory for many professions. Educational professionals can gain the acceptance and distinction of those professions by adhering to the standards of licensure set forth by their state.  &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCC7F7;border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Want to Teach in Virginia?  Here are the steps!''' [http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/newvdoe/licroute.pdf State of Virginia Routes to Teacher Licensure]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;





Educators are professionals, they meet the definition in every way.  The interview with the expert again referred to teaching as a calling, which was the term in the definition of profession.  It takes extensive academic preparation and specialized knowledge to be a professional educator.  Those standards are the reason that other professionals have received the foundations they have acquired to succeed in their fields.  Public opinion needs to be re-evaluated to include the requirements that were enacted with NCLB.  The more that society understands the intensive training and continued commitment to education that is demonstrated by teachers every day; the easier it will be for educators to be respected and viewed as professionals.

      <comment>'''SoH''': There is no small '''s''' in Klingon, only capital '''S'''.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Pronouns are words such as &quot;I, we, you, it&quot; etc.

==Vocabulary==

Verbs:
*'''tul''': ''to hope''
*'''Qap''': ''to succeed''

Noun:
*'''ghom''': ''group''

==Prefixes==

The speaker most commonly encounters &quot;pronouns&quot; when using Klingon's pronominal prefixes. The verb prefixes conjugate the verb that they are prefixed to. In English, one conjugates verbs in many ways, depending on such things as the number of the subject and object, tense, etc. In Klingon, one conjugates using the prefixes depending on the &quot;type&quot; of the subject and object; that is, the type of pronouns that the subject and object can respectively be replaced with. Each prefix represents the type of subject and the type of object.

In the sentence '''vIlegh''', meaning &quot;I see he/she/it&quot;, the speaker uses the prefix '''vI''' to indicate that the subject is &quot;I&quot; and the object is &quot;he/she/it&quot;. Using simple pronouns to disambiguate, the speaker could say '''&lt;nowiki&gt;Duj vIlegh jIH&lt;/nowiki&gt;''', &quot;I see the ship&quot;, with '''jIH''' &quot;''I''&quot; as the subject and '''&lt;nowiki&gt;Duj&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' &quot;''ship''&quot; as the object. As the noun ''ship'' belongs to the category of ''it'', the speaker uses '''vI''' (subject ''I'', object ''he/she/it'').

==Simple Pronouns==

Just about all English pronouns have Klingon equivalents, though Klingon does not differentiate pronouns depending on whether the speaker uses the pronoun as a subject or an object. To clarify: In English two words mean &quot;myself&quot;: ''I'' and ''me''. One uses &quot;I&quot; only as a subject, and one uses &quot;me&quot; only as an object. In Klingon, the pronoun '''jIH''', meaning &quot;''I''/''me''&quot; serves the same purpose that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; do, and the speaker can use it as a subject or an object.

The prefix in front of each verb in a Klingon sentence denotes both the object and the subject of the sentence, but one can use the pronoun words in Klingon to supplement the prefixes, especially to rectify ambiguities produced by some of the prefixes that denote different objects and subjects depending on context. (see [[#Prefixes]] for an example of that)

===Pronouns===

*'''bIH''': ''they'', ''them'' (for use with nonsentient objects)
*'''chaH''': ''they'', ''them'' (for use with beings who can speak)
*''' 'e&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''': ''that'' (referring to previous part of sentence, see below)
*'''ghaH''': ''he''/''she'', ''him''/''her''
*'''jIH''': ''I'', ''me''
*'''maH''': ''we'', ''us''
*'''net''': ''that'' (similar to 'e'; ''also'': see below)
*''' 'oH''': ''it''
*'''SoH''': ''you'' (singular)
*'''tlhIH''': ''you'' (plural)


==='''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;e&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' and '''net'''===

Klingon uses ''' 'e' ''' to refer to the previous part of the sentence (see [[Klingon/Grammar/Subject-Object-Verb|Subject-Object-Verb]]), i.e., in the English sentence &quot;He hopes that his team will win,&quot; one makes ''his team will win'' into the object of the sentence, by the use of &quot;that&quot;. &quot;that&quot; is used in the same way that one uses ''' 'e' ''' in a Klingon sentence.

Example:

'''Qap ghomDaj 'e' tul ghaH''':  ''He hopes that his group succeeds''
:'''Qap ghomDaj''', ''his group succeeds''; '''tul ghaH''', ''he hopes''


'''net''' is synonymous with 'e', but is used only when the verb of the sentence to be used as an object has no prefix, and the subject intended by the speaker is ''one'' or ''someone'', rather than ''he'', ''she'', ''it'', or ''they'' that is normally intended to be the subject when the verb has no prefix.

===As &quot;to be&quot;===

When the speaker wishes to describe a state of &quot;being&quot; between a pronoun and something else (&quot;''She is an engineer''&quot;), the speaker uses the pronoun as if it were a verb, as Klingon has no word meaning &quot;to be&quot;. The pronoun, accepts verb suffixes.

Ex:

'''jo'wI' ghaHbej''' ''She is definitely an engineer''

'''jo'wI' ''', ''engineer''; '''ghaHbej''', &quot;''She is definitely''&quot;

== Wikibook Article Descriptions ==
&lt;/center&gt;

There are two main types of Wikibook articles: Content Articles and Special Feature Articles

Content Articles cover a specific topic within a chapter, for example Charter Schools.

Special Feature Articles are just what they sound like, special features that are supplemental to the core content of a chapter. There are four types of Special Feature Articles:

*Experts Take Sides
*In the News
*Chapter FAQ
*The Scoop from Someone Who Knows

Each chapter will contain 6-10 Content Articles and 4 Special Feature Articles. Several students may write a version of each of these articles; the mostly highly rated version will become part of the official textbook.


== Brief Descriptions of the Special Feature Articles ==


'''Experts Take Sides'''

These articles consider two or more expert viewpoints on a controversial topic. They include background information on a topic, reviews and links to expert-written articles with differing perspectives, and a synthesis of the debate on the topic.

'''In the News'''

These articles report current events related to the chapter topic and may include links to articles in the popular media.

'''Chapter FAQ'''

These articles include Frequently Asked Questions which provide definitions, descriptions and examples of key terms and concepts in a chapter.

'''The Scoop from Someone Who Knows'''

These articles contain interviews with experts (e.g. teachers,administrators, parents, and even students) on a given topic.</text>

Correct me if I am wrong, I think Manchu marks 'aspects' instead of 'tense'. It may be inaccurate to provide 'English counterparts' for Manchu aspects. [[User:Chaakming|Chaakming]] ([[User talk:Chaakming|talk]]) 20:04, 12 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''DNA Damage Response'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Please see the  page for more information
*It is estimated that mammalian cells experience &gt;100,000 [[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Damage|DNA lesions]] per day. The result from replication errors, chemical decay of bases, reactive oxygen species damage, and ionizing radiation
*Cells have developed DNA repair pathways that are specific for each type of damage, and may depend on which part of cell cycle the damage happens
*DNA damage is initially recognized by sensor proteins MRN and/or Ku70/80
*These activate effector molecules, primarily ATM for double strand damage, or in its absence DNA-PKcs. ATR is activated for single strand damage
*ATM coordinates the DNA damage response (DDR) by several steps
**Histone H2AX damage foci formation
**DNA repair machinery activation (NHEJ or HR)
**Cell cycle checkpoint activation
**Initiation of apoptosis


==Double Strand Damage Sensing==
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Damage|DNA damage]], particularly in the form of double strand breaks (DSBs) appears to play a key role in radiation-induced cell death. However, it is important to keep in mind that DSBs also occur as part of normal cell process (e.g. DNA replication / fork stalling, programmed rearrangements V(D)J, meiosis), and therefore that mechanisms exists for their repair
*After radiation exposure, damage-response proteins initiate DNA repair within minutes by localizing to sites of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). The exact sequence has not yet been well established, however, there appear to be 3 pairs of sensors belonging to the PIKK kinase family, which effect &gt;700 proteins
**MRN -&gt; ATM
**Ku70-Ku80 -&gt; DNA-PKcs
**ATRIP -&gt; ATR
*Several lines of evidence suggest that [[w:Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1|Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex]] (MRN) is one of the primary proteins able to sense DSB and begin processing it for repair 
**It appears that short single-strand DNA oligonucleotides are produced as part of the process, via endo- and exonuclease activity
**Accumulation of these ssDNA oligos appears to constitute a signal of ongoing DSB repair, and induce ATM activity. However, presence of ssDNA oligos alone does not seem sufficient to activate ATM; presence of dsDNA end may be required for ATM activation 
**ATM is detectable at sites of DNA damage within 60 seconds after damage, and persists for up to 4 hours
*ATM ([[w:Ataxia_telangiectasia_mutated|Ataxia-Telangiectaia-Mutated]]) is a kinase with multiple downstream actions effected via phosphorylation
**ATM activation is radiation dose dependent, in response to increasing level of radiation-induced DNA damage. Dose &lt;0.3 Gy induces ATM only weakly, while dose &gt;0.5 Gy produces maximal ATM activation
**As a first step, ATM autophosphorylates to form the active monomeric form
**Activated ATM impacts multiple targets (&gt;30) involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control (G1/S, S/G2, G2/M), and apoptosis
**When NBS1 (part of MRN) is mutated (i.e. in [[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Nijmegen_Breakage_Syndrome|
Nijmegen breakage syndrome)]], ATM is unable to initiate damage response
**Hereditary Syndrome: [[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes/Ataxia-Telangiectasia|Ataxia-Telangiectasia (AT)]]
*In cells that lack ATM, DNA sensing and phosphorylation of H2AX can occur via the DNA-PKcs pathway
**This pathway is inactive in cells with ATM present (whether it functions or not)
**DNA-PKcs becomes activated by Ku70-Ku80 complex, which directly binds to DSB
**Normal function for DNA-PKcs is in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
*Finally, [[w:Ataxia_telangiectasia_and_Rad3_related|ATR]] plays a role in the repair process as well
**ATR normally recognizes single-strand breaks and other damage during DNA replication. It may also recognize DNA damage that is unrepaired (alpha component) after DSB
**However, ATR can become activated after the MRN-ATM complex begins DSB processing
**Hereditary Syndrome: None because ATR is an essential protein for cell survival


==ATM==
*Member of PIKK family (ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, mTOR)
*Exists as an inactive dimer
*Autophosphorylates on recognition of DNA damage
*When activated, exists as a monomer
*It then phosphorylates multiple targets 
**DNA repair: H2AX, NBS1/MRE11 (part of MRN), BRCA1, FANCD2, SMC1 (structural maintenance of chromosome)
**Cell cycle arrest: p53 (G1 checkpoint), Chk1/2 (S and Early G2 checkpoints), MDC1 (co-localizes with H2AX)
**Apoptosis: p53, SMAC

==H2AX Activation==
*All three effectors (ATM, DNA-PKcs, and ATR) are able to activate histone H2AX to amplify and mark chromatin territory affected by DNA damage
**This event is regulated by protein [[w:MDC1|MDC1]], which spreads H2AX phosphorylation in both directions away from the break. MDC1 also plays a role in activating Chk1 and further S-phase and G2/M phase check points
**H2AX phosphorylation is thought to alter the chromatin structure, allow access for DNA repair machinery, and act as a docking site for the repair proteins

==Cell Cycle Checkpoints==
*There are 4 distinct cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage
*Mutations in genes responsible for G1, S, and Early G2 checkpoints do not appear to increase radiation sensitivity to single fraction (but may due to delays and reassortment impact multifraction sensitivity)
*Mutations in genes responsible for Late G2 appear to cause radiosensitization, perhaps by allowing entry into mitosis and resulting in mitotic death
*There is a dose-rate effect, such that at very low dose rates (&lt;0.01 G/min) there is minimal checkpoint activation, probably due to minimal ATM activation. At ~1 Gy/hr, only Late G2 checkpoint is triggered, leading to reassortment of cells at the G2/M interface (and resulting in the inverse dose rate effect). At higher dose rates, cell cycle progression is inhibited at all checkpoints

===G1 checkpoint===
*Decision of the cell to initiate cell division
*In cycling cells, controlled by activation of E2F transcription factor
*In G0/G1, E2F is bound and inactivated by Rb protein
*DNA damage activates ATM, which subsequently activates p53 by phosphorylating it and dissociating it from MDM2
*p53 in turn upregulates p21
*p21 inhibits cyclinD-CDK4/6 and cyclinE-CDK2
*These cyclins therefore do not phosphorylate Rb protein, which remains bound to E2F, thus inactivating it
*When a cell decides to enter into cell cycle, cyclinsD/E phosphorylate Rb, which then dissociates from E2F 
*E2F is a DNA transcription factor, which triggers entry into S phase
*Does not increase radiation sensitivity
*Summary: damage - ATM up - p53 up - p21 up - CDK4/6 and CDK2 down - Rb down - E2F down - no entry to S phase



===S checkpoint===
*The importance of this checkpoint is to prevent replication forks from replicating through DNA strand breaks
*CDK2 kinase must remain dephosphorylated for S phase to progress
*DNA damage activates ATM, which subsequently activates Chk2 kinase (and to lesser degree Chk1)
*The Chk1/2 kinases then phosphorylate CDC25A, leading to its degradation
*This increases levels of phosphorylated CDK2 kinase, and slowed progression through S-phase by failure to load CDC45 onto chromatin
*Lack of CDC 45 prevents recruitment of DNA polymerase α and subsequent replication
*There also appears to be a pathway from ATM via NBS1 to CDC45, and BRCA1/BRCA2 and FANC-D2 also play some role in this process
*Does not increase radiation sensitivity
*Summary: damage - ATM up - Chk2 up - CDC25A down - CDK2 phosphorylated - CDC45 down - slow S phase progression


===Early G2 checkpoint===
*Activated by low doses (&lt;1 Gy) of radiation
*CDK1 kinase must remain dephosphorylated for G2 to continue
*DNA damage activates ATM and ATR, which activate Chk1 and Chk2 kinases. There is also a pathway from ATR via BRCA1 to Chk1
*The Chk1/2 kinases then phosphorylate CDC25C, leading to its destruction. The 14-3-3 protein plays a role in this process
*Destruction of CDC25C leads to increased levels of phosphorylated CyclinB/CDK1 kinase, which blocks cell in G2. CyclinB/CDK1 kinase must be dephosphorylated to enter mitosis
*Does not increase radiation sensitivity
*Summary: damage - ATM up - Chk1/Chk2 up - CDC25C down - CDK1 phosphorylated - no mitosis


===Late G2 checkpoint===
*Most regulated of all checkpoints
*Strongly radiation dose-dependent, and effect may last for many hours
*Independent of ATM, triggered by ATR
**Different trigger suggests that a different type of DNA damage is checked than double strand break monitored by ATM. It is probably residual DNA damage after repair has been attempted
*DNA damage activates ATR, which activates Chk1 kinase
*The Chk1/2 kinases then phosphorylate CDC25C, leading to its destruction. The 14-3-3 protein plays a role in this process
*Destruction of CDC25C leads to increased levels of phosphorylated CyclinB/CDK1 kinase, which blocks cell in G2. CyclinB/CDK1 kinase must be dephosphorylated to enter mitosis
*Increases radiation sensitivity, partly due to cells that cannot repair all of their damaged DNA prior to cell division will experience a higher rate of mitotic death

==p53==
*p53 is normally degraded via [[w:MDM2|MDM2]] ubiqiutin pathway as soon as it is produced
*In times of cellular stress or DNA damage, p53 becomes activated (phosphorylation and acetylation) and is protected from degradation
**Cellular stress via [[w:MAPK|MAPK]] kinases 
**DNA damage via [[w:Ataxia_telangiectasia_mutated|ATM]], [[w:Ataxia_telangiectasia_and_Rad3_related|ATR]], [[w:CHK1|CHK1]]/[[w:CHK2|CHK2]], DNA-PKcs as above 
**p53 can also be activated after suppression of MDM2 by p19ARF -&gt; increased p53 levels
*Activated p53, as the &quot;guardian of the genome&quot;, has several roles:
**Arrests cells at [[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/Cell_Cycle|G1 checkpoint]] via p21 (see above)
**Potentiates the [[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Repair|DNA repair]] machinery via GADD45 and XP genes
**Activates the [[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/Cell_Death|apoptotic pathway]] via members of the bcl-2 family (Bax, Bak, Bim, Puma) and the intrinsic apoptosis pathway
**Increases levels of MDM2 for a negative feedback loop
*The p53 choice between cell cycle arrest + DNA damage repair vs apoptosis is not well understood

'''About Me'''

Welcome! My name is Anakristen Brittany Fetters and I am 22 years old. I currently reside in Winchester, VA and am fairly new to the area. I have lived in northern VA for thirteen years, however I just moved to Winchester in April. I live with my sister and brother-in-law. We have six dogs and one cat, so there is never a dull moment in our house! I am still learning my way around, but am enjoying the area so far! 

After graduating High School, I started a career in banking and worked at a local community bank for three years. I started as a teller and advanced to Branch Manager. Although this was a great opportunity, it was not my dream and I recently left to attend school full time. I realized halfway through my banking career that children are my inspiration and to teaching is my goal. My dream is to become an elementary school teacher, and although teaching any grade would be great, my ideal grade(s)would be third, fourth, or fifth. I have about two years of school left and I am greatly looking forward to obtaining my teaching certificate. 

I enjoy working with children and teach Sunday School for fourth and fifth graders at my church. Some other activities I enjoy are reading, singing, working out at the gym, hiking and any outdoor activity.

'''My Education Philosphy'''

There are many positive qualities that make a great teacher. All great teachers exhiibit kindness, patience, and inner strength. They have the motivation and determination to make the world a better place for each and every one of their students. Most importantly, all great teachers know and understand their influential role in the lives of their students. 

Great teachers know how to handle diversity in the classroom. Students with special needs should be given the attention they deserve, which could require special attention outside of the classroom. Boys and girls should not be taught differently and should be given equal opportunities. Students should not be grouped by ability, but should be grouped diversely so that each student can build off of another's strength. I believe that English should be the only language taught in the classroom, however, teachers should be sensitive to the needs of their bilingual students. Depending on the situation, &quot;at-risk&quot; students may require more attention in the classroom than the average student.

Good instructional strategies are key in the classroom of a great teacher. Great teachers use a variety of instructional strategies that include both lecture and group assignments. Lessons that begin with a lecture and then move to a group activitiy can greatly assist in the reinforcement of the subject matter. All students, excluding those with special needs,  should have the same requirements and be treated equally. 

A positive classroom environment is critical for both the teacher and the students. I picture my future classroom to be a place where student interaction and student-teacher interaction is embraced. I believe parental involvement is also very important in the lives of the students so that parents know the objectives and requirements of their children. Great teachers will collaborate with other teachers for lessons plans and ideas, and it is always a main focus of the teacher to engage the student and capture their attention in every lesson. An effective classroom management technique is to assign both single and group activities, and to constantly walk around the classroom to monitor behavior and the levels of student contribution. 

These are my ideas as to what makes a great teacher and education philosophy, and I look forward to adding to and elaborating on these ideas throughout this course![[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 14:34, 4 December 2009 (UTC)

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#660066&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra&quot;&gt;What is Poverty and Glocalization?&lt;/big&gt;'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#990 OFF&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra&quot;&gt;Not having a roof over your head or food on the table is not the only poverty in the nation. Poverty also plays a huge role in education. The Merriam â Webster Dictionary defines poverty as the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions.  Education and poverty go hand in hand especially throughout different regions of the United States. âGlocalization is a term that was invented in order to emphasize that the globalization of a product is more likely to succeed when the product or service is adapted specifically to each locality or culture it is marketed in (Language Translation, 2006.)â Some parts of the United States of America have better education than other regions because of their location and their poverty level. In the wealthier places, they can get the resources that they need to be able to teach; as for the non-wealthier places it is harder for them to get the same resources to teach effectively and up to date.

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;#660066&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra&quot;&gt;Poverty in America'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#990 OFF&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra&quot;&gt;In 2007, the statistics of people in poverty in the United States was 37.3 million. According to LexisNexis Academics the number of the poor was 9.5% in the Midwest region of the United States and 12.5% in the South region of the United States during the year 2000. The southâs poverty rate was at the lowest it has ever been.  The United States Census Bureau states that the poverty rate during the year 2007 was the lowest rate ever since the year 1959 and those rates of 2007 were the highest than during the year 2000 rates. The percent of poverty for children under the age of 18 was at 18.0% in the year 2007. Robert E. Rector and Kirk A. Johnson, Ph.D stated in Understanding Poverty in America, that the two main reasons why children are poor are because their parents do not work enough or they live in a single family home. They say that only sixteen hours of work a week is the amount that their parents work, which adds up to eight hundred a year. Two-thirds of children are children that are living in single family homes, it is stated that if the parents werenât single then the children would be lifted out of the poverty level (Heritage.Org).

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;#660066&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra&quot;&gt;No Child Left Behind Policy'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#990 OFF&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra&quot;&gt;In January 8, 2002, George W. Bush signed No Child Left Behind into the law. âIt redefines the federal role in K-12 education and will help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged and minority students and their peers. It is based on four basic principles: stronger accountability for results, increased flexibility and local control, expanded options for parents and an emphasis on teaching methods that have been proven to work (ed.gov)â The funding for NCLB is an issue for the schools in the states. Some states have different funding to buy certain materials and even to hire high quality teachers. Most people criticize the funding aspect on NCLB. Susan B. Neuman states her concern with the policy, âIn [the most disadvantaged schools] in America, even the most earnest teacher has often given up because they lack every available resource that could possibly make a difference. . . . When we say all children can achieve and then not give them the additional resources â¦ we are creating a fantasyâ (Wikipedia). Susan B. Neuman is absolutely correct about not given additional resources. Most school districts throughout the nation are not on the same page with additional resources. Even in the same school districts some of their own schools are not even on the same page with resources. 

As a substitute for the City of Virginia Beach, I have experienced it right before my eyes. For example, the funds are low when it comes to textbooks. I went Salem Middle, a school in the Virginia Beach Public School District that issued every student a textbook for the year but when I substituted at Bayside Middle another Virginia Beach Public School, the students informed me that they there are not enough textbooks to issue to each student. Salem Middle School is in a middle class area of Virginia Beach while Bayside Middle School is in a lower area where the is much of section eight housing. So how could the No Child Left Behind Policy work for all the schools in the nation if they are not even on the same page for funding? Some schools cannot even purchase enough textbooks. Glocalization is not effective for the NCLB policy and the education system.

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;#660 066&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra&quot;&gt; In My Own Opinion'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#990 OFF&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra&quot;&gt;I believe that every school in the United States of America should be on the same page. All of the schools need to have the same resources to teach the students. It is not fair for some students to have a better education than others. Each state should have the same funding no matter if it is a wealthy area or non-wealthy area. When every school has a different funding towards resources and curriculum it is not fair to the student. An example, a student lives in an area that the funding is better towards the material but then has to move to a district in which the funding is horrible. The student has to readjust to that districts material and resources for the studentâs learning environment.  Now the student has to lower their learning standards to meet with the new district. No matter if youâre rich or poor everyone is still entitled to the same education and should get the same education.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''WHAT IS POVERTY?'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

There are innumerable definitions of the word poverty.  Merriam Webster Dictionary (2008) defines poverty as, &quot;the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions.&quot;  The World Bank (2008) elaborately states, &quot;Poverty is hunger.  Poverty is lack of shelter.  Poverty is being sick and not being able to see a doctor.  Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read...&quot;  Both definitions offer a very broad sense of the word poverty, but fail to address specific financial requirements that make one impoverished.  The United States Census Bureau (2008) however, uses very clear &quot;income thresholds&quot; to determine which U.S. citizens live below the poverty line.  &quot;Income thresholds&quot; are simply minimum earned income requirements that increase as family size increases (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008).  Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned âincome thresholds:&quot;

[[Image:Mip07_fig1.jpg|frame|&lt;big&gt;'''FIGURE 1'''&lt;/big&gt;, Note. From National Center for Children in Poverty, 2008 ]]

The U.S. Census Bureau (2008), using the data found in Figure 1, declares those families whose income lies below their respective &quot;income threshold,&quot; as living below the poverty line.  Poverty continues to be an increasing concern in the United States.  As of 2007, the United States had a poverty rate of 12.5 percent, up from 12.3 percent in 2006 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008).  Nearly 37.3 million people fell below the poverty level, up from 36.5 million in 2006 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008).   The most sobering statistic however must be an overall increase in poverty among children under the age of 18, from 17.4 percent in 2006 to 18.0 percent in 2008 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008).  The state of Virginia specifically, had a 13 percent child poverty rate, ranking 40th overall in 2007 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008).

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''EDUCATIONAL DISADVANTAGES OF CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

According to Bjorn Nordtveit (2008), contributor to the ''International Journal of Educational Development'', and professor at the University of Hong Kong, many children fall into &quot;so-called poverty âtrapsâ which narrow the schooling opportunities of children from poor families&quot; (p. 411).  He argues that poor students may not perform as well in class as their wealthier contemporaries due to malnutrition, inadequate parental support for education, and a lack of proper school supplies (Nordtveit, p. 411).  Poor calorie intake paired with inadequate parental support, &quot;compromises [students'] learning abilities from the start,&quot; and ultimately makes poor children greater &quot;candidates for early drop-out and low retention of skills learned during the time they attend school&quot; (Nordtveit, p. 411).  Nordtveit (2008) also makes the connection that poor children, &quot;tend to socialize with other children and young people who are in the same situation,&quot; (p. 411) creating a social permanence to the idea that academic and financial improvement is improbable.

Nordtveit's concerns seem to be echoed by Ms. Wendy Kopp, author of ''Building the Movement to End Educational Inequity'' as she writes, &quot;the stark reality in our nation today is that the 13 million children growing up below the poverty line are already three grade levels behind children
in high-income communities by the time they are 9 years old&quot; (p. 734).  Kopp (2008) even recognizes that nearly half of those students that manage to graduate high school, &quot;are performing, on average, at the level of eighth-graders who live in affluent communities&quot; (p. 734).  Nordtveit and Kopp seem to argue that there is an unmistakable connection between poverty and academic success.  Considering that 18.0 percent of U.S. citizens under the age of 18 live below the poverty line, modern teachers are becoming more readily aware of this connection, utilizing government education initiatives to help disadvantaged children.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;










In January of 2002, U.S. lawmakers passed the No Child Left Behind Act, attempting to, &quot;ensure that all children have
a fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging
state academic achievement standards and state academic assessments&quot; (Public Law 107-110, SECT 1001 2002).  Lawmakers specifically focused on, &quot;closing the achievement gaps... between minority and nonminority students, and between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers&quot; (Public Law 107-110, A3, 2002).  The U.S. government therefore allocated significant monies to state governments intended for the school districts and families most in need of educational and financial assistance. (Public Law 107-110, 2002)  Figure 2 below shows the specific amounts the federal government disseminated yearly.

'''FIGURE 2:'''&lt;/big&gt;


'''$13,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2002

'''$16,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2003'''

'''$18,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2004'''

'''$20,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2005'''

'''$22,750,000,000 for fiscal year 2006'''

'''$25,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2007'''


'''(Note. From PUBLIC LAW 107â110âJAN. 8, 2002)'''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Under the No Child Left Behind Act, state governments are required to follow strict federal guidelines in order to become eligible for financial assistance (Public Law 107-110, 2002).  One such requirement was the consolidation of testing, such that each state demonstrated that its schools had uniformly, &quot;implemented a set of high quality, yearly student academic assessments that include, at a minimum, academic assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and science[s]&quot;  (Public Law 107-110, 2002).  The results of the yearly academic assessments ultimately help the federal government determine the overall academic and fiscal needs of specific states and their school districts.  The No Child Left Behind Act also regulates the professional qualifications of educators in the United States.  Before a state can become eligible for benefits, it must report all relevant professional and educational achievements of their educators to the Federal Government.  The federal government requests to know if each &quot;teacher has met state qualification and licensing criteria for the grade levels and subject areas in which the teacher provides instruction&quot; (Public Law 107-110, 2002).  It requests to know if, &quot;the teacher is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which state qualifications or licensing criteria have been waived&quot; (Public Law 107-110, 2002).  It requires information regarding &quot;the baccalaureate degree major of the teacher and any other graduate certification[s] or degree[s] held&quot; (Public  Law 107-110, 2002).  Ultimately, the federal government's research determines each school district's need for degreed/licensed teachers and/or funding.


The No Child Left Behind Act establishes strict requirements on states to regulate the quality of their schools and educators, however, it has not existed without controversy.  Many scholars believe that the No Child Left Behind Act contains, &quot;special interest pleading and ideological agendas&quot; (Wood, p. ix).  George Wood (2004), author of &lt;u&gt;Many Children Left Behind: How The No Child Left Behind Act Is Damaging Our Children And Our Schools&lt;/u&gt;, argues that it is inappropriate for the federal government to require schools, &quot;to turn over student contact information to the military for recruiting purposes&quot; (p. ix) as the No Child Left Behind Act does.  Wood (2004) also finds it troubling that the No Child Left Behind Act requires school districts to prove &quot;that no policy prevents the participation in &quot;constitutionally protected prayer in public schools&quot;&quot; (p. ix) before federal funding can be approved. 


Wood (2004), like many scholars, also finds flaws with the fiscal layout of the No Child Left Behind Act.  He believes that the federal government has grossly underestimated the funding needs of school districts in order to implement the high standards of the law (Wood, 2004).  He writes, &quot;by some estimates the current requests for funding NCLB [No Child Left Behind] from the administration fall as much as $12.5 billion dollars short of the requirements of the legislation&quot; (Wood, p. ix).  The No Child Left Behind Act is currently under congressional scrutiny for revision (Wood, 2004).

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;

Considering that 18 percent of the youth of the United States fall below the government's definition of the poverty line, it seems imperative that educators understand the academic disadvantages caused by the unknown medical needs, inadequate parental support, and unhealthy eating habits of impoverished lifestyles.  Educators must also fully understand the benefits and flaws of the No Child Left Behind Act, so that its benefits can be applied to the children most in need of its aid.

&lt;center&gt;Students should be able to...&lt;/center&gt;


1. Understand what learned helplessness means for students

2. Understand the traits related to learned helplessness

3. Implement some strategies to help with learned helplessness in the classroom








&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; font color=&quot;FF3366&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Is Learned Helplessness?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


The bell rang and students began pouring into the classroom, slowly they put away their backpacks and began trickling to their desks amongst all the chatter. Now that they were all seated, we were ready for our morning brain warm ups! Math worksheets were handed out and a sea of whining filled the classroom. âI canât do this,â âThese are all hard problems,â âI give up,â âHow do you do these? I donât know how!â 


Before students even have a chance to see what they were working on they feel defeated. This is known as learned helplessness or a psychological condition in which a student âhas learned to act or behave helpless in a particular situation, even when they have the power to change their unpleasant or even harmful circumstance&quot; (Seligman, 1975). 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;65%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF3366;border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

'''&lt;center&gt;âStudents who are repeatedly exposed to school failure are particularly at risk for the development of learned helplessnessâ (Sutherland and Singh, 2004, pg. 172). &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



Learned helplessness âexists when individuals believe that their own behavior has no influence on consequent eventsâ (Seligman, 1975). Seligman believes this phenomenon is comprised of three different parts â(a) an undermining of oneâs motivation to respond; (b) a retardation of oneâs ability to learn that responding works; and (c) an emotional disturbance, usually depression or anxiety.â


For students this becomes a vicous cycle since one component can directly affect another and rapidly create a snowball pattern. Typically students are depressed about past failures and âbegin to doubt their intellectual abilities, and this leads them to doubt that they can do anything to help overcome their difficulties. They then lessen their achievement efforts, particularly when faced with difficult material, and this leads in turn to continued failureâ (Sutherland and Singh, 2004, pg. 172). Obviously, students who are wrapped up in this snowball effect get the overwhelming feeling that they will never get problems correct. This becomes a difficult task for students to overcome.

&lt;center&gt;Student Behavior Checklist (Fincham et al. 1989)&lt;center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;












































&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; font color=&quot;56A5EC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does learned helplessness affect my students?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


When students are feeling as though they cannot âcontrolâ their failure, they do show some symptoms. The most common signs of learned helplessness are those of âshared depression symptoms such as passivity, interjected hostility, weight loss, appetite loss, and social deficits. In addition to these familiar signs, learned helplessness also has some diagnostic symptoms including depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal ideationâ (Wikipedia, 2008). This is a lot for a child to have to deal with in addition to learning the information being presented.


These depression like symptoms affect students in their educational learning.  Fincham, Hokoda, Sanders asserts that if a child finds new material particularly difficult he/she falls into a defensive pattern, learned helplessness, which increases obstacles in learning (1989, pg. 138). 


This psychological condition can greatly affect academics because of the snowball effect. Academic failures of the past lead to flawed deductive reasoning in children, the conclusion of which is that failure is the norm. This vicious cycle of failure, doubt and failure again can manifest in both academic achievement and social development. Thus learned helplessness is not only an additional learning barrier but also a comforting internal excuse (Wikipedia, 2008). 


Once behind in academic skills, students feel hopeless and lose interest in even trying. Since we know this condition can cripple our studentsâ education, how do we prevent this from entering our classrooms?

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; font color=&quot;FF3366&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can I teach these students?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


What we do know is that students with learned helplessness exhibit symptoms similar to depression. As teachers we do have tricks up our sleeves to help eliminate learned helplessness behaviors in our classrooms. Sutherland and Singh believe âacademic failure may result in studentsâ receiving little positive reinforcementâ ( 2004, pg.169). The first thing we can attempt with these students is forms of positive reinforcement. When good performance is achieved; perhaps positive verbal feedback, tokens, stickers or some type of reward for a job well done; anything that will give these students a pat on the back and make them feel worthy.


This, over time, will hopefully build the studentsâ confidence and begin to break down those depressive behaviors. Additionally, studies have shown that the teacher-student dynamic is contributing to the development and maintenance of learned helplessness. It is not that teachers actively reinforce learned helplessness behaviors but rather because of student disposition, positive reinforcement occurs so seldom between teachers and students that students are unfamiliar with the positive reinforcement dynamic (Sutherland and Singh, 2004, pg. 171). 


For this method to be effective it needs to occur over time and it needs to be consistent so the student learns the connection between the performance and the praise. In addition to the positive praise we give students, we also need to be aware of the type of critical response we give. Criticisms directed towards students like &quot;I'm very disappointed in you&quot; are often received as personal attacks and further reinforce the underlying depressive emotions of learned helplessness that are represented as &quot;I'm no good, I'm a failure.&quot; However, process criticism like &quot;Maybe you can think of another way to do it?&quot; leads to a healthier academic attitude. This paradigm is mirrored in the person versus process praise dynamic as well. Person praise such as &quot;I'm very proud of you&quot; leads to student centered outcomes such as &quot;I'm a success, I'm a failure;&quot; whereas process praise like &quot;You must have tried really hard&quot; leades to challenge centered outcomes such as &quot;I can do this&quot; (Sutherland and Singh, 2004, pg. 175). 


As teachers we have to be conscious to make our criticisms and praise about the process of the problem not the person so that the failure can be attributed to the actual work not an intelligence factor. Since we know positive reinforcement is helpful over time it is necessary to make process praise a part of our everyday curriculum. 


But how can we aide these students with academic performance? Tests of course!! Research shows that with learned helplessness âstudents who had hard questions before the easy questions would tend to give up on the easy questions due to frustrationâ¦the perceived failure alone was sufficient to make students feel helpless and give up on the testâ (Firman et al., 2004, pg. 692). What does this mean for us?


To avoid this test anxiety we can alter our tests so that all students can feel successful while taking them. âFor decades, teachers and test developers have been advised to arrange the test items in the ascending order of difficulty so that the test takers would be motivated by the early successful experience and continue the testâ (Firman et al., 2004, pg. 692). This method will hopefully motivate your students and build confidence so that over time (and throughout the test) they may begin attributing their success in the beginning questions with intellectual ability rather than external occurrences. 


&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; font color=&quot;56A5EC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


In todayâs society, our students have additional pressure for high academic performance from their parents, school systems, and state tests. This additional anxiety often leads to learned helplessness behaviors that we see in the classroom more and more. Although these behaviors are difficult to handle in our classroom management, it is our duty to try different methods to combat this condition. 


Evidence shows that âteachers provide less academic instruction to students who exhibit problem behaviorâ (Sutherland and Singh, 2004, pg. 169). We need to make conscious efforts to give special attention to these students so that they may succeed in their academic career. 


In addition to the one on one time, we have to remember to stay positive and model positive behavior in our classroom. For these students a âlack of positive reinforcement leads to a lack of confidence, a developmental increase in the need for external approval, a perception that one has little control over outcomes in oneâs life, and ultimately a decrease in motivationâ (Sutherland and Singh, 2004, pg. 173). This is often a difficult task to accomplish all year long, but keep it simple: praise, praise, praise on procedure and model the positive behaviors in your classroom.

&lt;center&gt;Students should be able to...&lt;/center&gt;

1. Understand what Learned Helplessness is in today's classroom.

2. Recognize signs and symptoms of students expressing Learned Helplessness.

3. Gain new skills and ideas in order to combat Learned Helplessness in the classroom.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Calibri&quot; font color=&quot;FF3366&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learned Helplessness: What's That?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

My younger sister,  Jacqueline, is a typical 7th grade preteen. While she enjoys making good use of the middle school girlsâ school day with girlish chatter in class and passing notes to her friends, she is also very sensitive and conscious of how she performs in her academics.  One afternoon as she was beginning her Algebra I homework, the kitchen quickly became filled with cries of âI canât!â, âThis is too hard!â, and âIâll never be able to do this!â. These outbursts were then followed by a stomping of feet up the stairs, a slamming of the bedroom door, and crying. My heart went out to my little sister, so I went to get her homework and help her. But when I saw the worksheet, I noticed that it was completely blank. No work had even been attempted. My smart, capable, sister had given up in a fury of self-insufficiency before she had even begunâ¦


This anecdote is a prime example of a condition in todayâs academic society called Learned Helplessness.  This psychological, internalization of self-doubt creates a mindset in which a student âbehave[s] helpless in a particular situation, even when they have the power to change their unpleasant or even harmful circumstance&quot; (Seligman, 1975). When students feel as if nothing they can do as an individual will affect their achievement level, they are experiencing learned helplessness (Seligman, 1975).


According to Seligman, learned helplessness is composed of three unique, but intertwined factorsâ¦
1. âAn undermining of oneâs motivation to respond.â  This means that studentsâ motivation to complete an assessment is usually internally depleted before the assessment is even attempted.
2. âA retardation of oneâs ability to learn that responding works.â In other words, students are hesitant to respond to assessment because they  feel like it wonât matter whether they do or donât.
3. âAn emotional disturbance, usually depression or anxiety.â The student is emotionally affected by his or her psychological, defeatist mindset (Seligman, 1975).


These three factors undoubtedly work in a destructive, interconnected cycle as students lacking in personal motivation due to a misunderstanding of the value of the assessment and of negative self-worth because of past academic failures often become more depressed over time. As a result, an ever-expanding snowball of learned helplessness is formed, and continues to form throughout studentsâ academic careers.

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Calibri&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;âLearned helplessness is the giving-up reaction, the quitting response that follows from the belief that whatever you do doesn't matter.â- Arnold Schwarzenegger (Schwarzenegger, 2006)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Calibri&quot; font color=&quot;FF3366&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Does Learned Helplessness in Today's Schools Look Like?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Because learned helplessness and depression are so closely linked in characteristic behaviors, the signs and symptoms for human depression are very similar to those of learned helplessness (Wikipedia, 2009). Students who experience learned helplessness often exude depression-like signs such as hostility, passivity, weight loss, depressed mood, and feelings of worthlessness (Wikipedia, 2009). Students who attribute these symptoms and feelings towards academic failure fall into a cycle of deficeincy and depression, which ultimately leads to students leaning on their &quot;helplessness&quot; as a crutch to qualify failure in other aspects of their lives, such as the social (Wikipedia, 2009).

Key phrases of students in the classroom experiencing learned helplessness include:

1. &quot;These problems are too hard to do!&quot;

2. &quot;I'll never be able to understand this!&quot;

3. &quot;I'm not smart enough to know how to do this!&quot;

4. &quot;I can't!&quot;

5. &quot;I give up!&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

As students fall into the learned helplessness cycle, they continue to verbally express their resistance to assessments which seem too difficult to handle. However, learned helplessness is not a surface condition. It is rooted much deeper, in the human psyche; therefore, many students' words of self-defeat are rooted much deeper as well.

If learned helplessness is such a serious matter in today's schools, what in the world can educator's do to help?



&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Calibri&quot; font color=&quot;FF3366&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Can Teachers Help to Minimize Learned Helplessness in the Classroom?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

As students' main source of guidance in the classroom, everything that teachers do plays a vital role in the creation and molding of his or her pupils' educational outlook. Furthermore, just because students appear &quot;helpless,&quot; does not mean that teachers have to be! Just as learned helplessness is formed, it can be reformed. And there are a few specific tricks of the trade that teachers can use to fight back against learned helplessness in the classroom.

&lt;b&gt;Feedback &lt;/b&gt;

Good feedback is one of the most powerful tools a teacher can use to improve studentsâ classroom experience (Grimes, 1981).  Positive, beneficial feedback has the ability to shape and reshape the way a student views his or herself.  Feedback that relates to goals and objectives, focuses on work and progress, and describes rather than judges can produce positive results in students to counteract learned helplessness (Grimes, 1981). Good feedback should provide praise to students for overcoming a challenge and motivation for them to strive to challenge themselves even further.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;35%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #00FF66;border: solid 5px #FF3366; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Calibri&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt; Ten Examples of Positive Verbal Feedback&lt;/center&gt;

1. &quot;Act as if you can.&quot;

2. &quot;Let me demonstrate for you.&quot;

3. &quot;You must have worked really hard.&quot;

4. &quot;Can you think of any alternative ways to do that?&quot;

5. &quot;Take a risk and see if you can do it!&quot;

6. &quot;What possibilities do you see?&quot;

7. &quot;Sounds like you have a problem. What have you thought of so far?&quot;

8. &quot;Ask me if you need any help.&quot;

9. &quot;This must have taken a lot of effort!&quot;

10. &quot;What improvements can you come up with for this?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Assessment&lt;/b&gt;

How teachers assess their students can make a huge impact on how students regard their own achievement and personal motivation. One of the most important goals of assessment is to give students an opportunity to use and learn what they know. 

One simple trick to reducing learned helplessness is to create tests in an ego-boosting format, in which questions begin at the simplist level and get progressively more difficult (Firman et al., 2004). Firman's research notes that students experiencing learned helplessness who took tests in which questions were placed with the hardest questions first &quot;tend to give up on the easy questions due to frustration,&quot; (Firman et al., 2004). Furthermore, his study showed that the majority of those same students became so disenchanted and discouraged they gave up on the assessment altogether (Firman et al., 2004).

By placing the easy questions at the beginning of tests, students have a chance to build self-confidence, and are more likely to continue on with the test with determination, instead of defeat.

&lt;b&gt;Cognitive Behavior Modification Strategies&lt;/b&gt;

Cognitive behavior strategies help reinforce and link the ideas of cause and effect with &quot;tackle and task&quot; in students' minds (Grimes, 1981). Through research, it has been shown that students become for proficient problem solvers through discovering that &quot;response and outcome are related though personal effort,&quot; (Grimes, 1981). Through behavior modification strategies, students are more likely to have a positive view of themselves and their capabilities by being shown that they have an immediate effect on their own environment.

Some examples of behavior modification methods include tokens/play-money, positive verbal feedback, stamps, and special positions (such as teacher's helper)(Grimes, 1981). There is really no limit to what teachers can come up with to use as behavior modifiers- as long as it promotes a &quot;job well done&quot; way of thinking to the student.

The vital aspect of this strategy is for students to grasp the connection between behavior and praise. Over an extended period of time, this method can help students see beyond the external locus of control as the cause of their level of achievement, and look towards their internal locus of control as the attributor to their success (Grimes, 1981). The more students can associate positive types of feedback as a direct result of their own positive actions, the less likely they are to get swept up in the tornado of learned helplessness.


&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Calibri&quot; font color=&quot;FF3366&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Conclusion...&lt;b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

Although we may sometimes envy the seemingly simplistic lives of children, to students, their lives can be just as hectic and stressful as ours seem to be. Students in school face enormous amounts of pressure to perform exceedingly well from parents, educators, classmates, school board members, and even politicians. And as we may forget, sometimes the largest amount of pressure to succeed comes from within the student. As learned helplessness becomes more and more prevalent in today's classrooms, teachers must remember to be open to new ways of modifying behavior and to take each individual student into consideration as just that- an individual.

Most importantly, teachers must amplify optimism and the neverending opportunity for student succuss in the classroom. If learned helplessness is on the incline in today's schools, then teacher positivity and motivation must also be on the incline. The more we model positive behavior and thinking, the more our students will absorb it and hopefully use it within themselves. Every student of every kind is more than capable of greatness, and it is a teacher's duty to instill that fact in each and every one of his or her students.

1. The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others.

=='''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;FF0033&quot; face=&quot;papyrus&quot;&gt;A Dissection of Racism&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''  ==
&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
Racism has been around for hundreds of years dating back to the Enlightenment. Most scientists in the nineteenth century compared females to the lower race, which was mainly made up of blacks(Goldberg, 1990). Females and blacks were also compared to apes. As such, the research the scientists conducted was that of weighing the brains between females and those of lower races, and made the connection that the two were similar. For example, the white males were superior to the white females and the blacks. Because of their similarity, &quot;women and lower races were called innately impulsive, emotional, imitative rather than original, and incapable of the abstract reasoning found in white men&quot;(Goldberg, 1990). A white male's brain processes and hormones were different from the females, so in return, the females were considered a different 'species'(Goldberg, 1990). As the years went by, racism became dependent on the outcome of people's behaviors. For example, under certain circumstances &quot;...belief, intention, act, consequence, principle, rule, or institution can be racist&quot;(Goldberg, 1990). In isolation, expressions such as slurs and epithets can and will be considered racist(Goldberg, 1990).
&lt;/big&gt;

=='''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;FF0033&quot; face=&quot;papyrus&quot;&gt;Sociology of Racism&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''  ==
&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
According to David Mason, race is a legitimate concept for sociological analysis and remains a pivotal concept in sociology(Mason, 1994). Racism and race can be analytically eminent from one another by &quot;the separation of human populations according to a notion of human stock difference, the characteristic mark of construct of race, need not to posit a hierarchy of groups&quot;(Mason, 1994). However, racism should not be limited in situations with discourses and practices that are associated with biogenetic differences(Mason, 1994). In general, the categories of personal, social cultural competences should not coincide with the concept of race. Race, as Mason states, is a social relationship. For example, populations generally are separated by genetic makeup and not by race. Racism also has negative stereotypes and evaluations of groups. These stereotypes and evaluations represent a kind of symbolic resource such as power for example(Mason, 1994). As such, &quot;power is both relational and situational&quot;(Mason, 1994).    
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
&quot;Positionality: the idea that peoples' backgrounds and identities, often seen as fixed in racial and gendered categories, are relational, contextual, and subject to change over time&quot;(Maher, 2008). According to Frinde Maher, gender, race and class are shifting proportions not predetermined categories of identity(Maher, 2008).

Critical Race Theory(CRT) is oppositional and resists single-truth claims(Masko, 2008). CRT is based on six tenets: &quot;1.racism is ordinary; 2.the current system of White-over-color ascendancy serves important purposes; 3.race and races are products of social thought and relations; 4.the dominant society racializes different minority groups at different times; 5.intersectionality and antiessentialism are present, whereas everyone has overlapping, conflicting identities and loyalties; and 6.there is a shared minority experience that people of color communicate about race and racism that White people are unlikely to know is present&quot;(Masko, 2008).

Some schools find resistance within their faculty, staff, and students. In a study done in a Mid-western state, resistance was found in the administration in adherence to the current curriculum and within the school's student body(Masko, 2008). The most common resistance in the administration was the teacher's frustration(Masko, 2008). However, the students resisted &quot;societal expectations of low achievement for students of color, and...multicultural curriculum&quot;(Masko, 2008). For example, one of the administrators gave a motivational speech to the student body that &quot;teeters between chastising poor behavior and inspiring higher achievement&quot;(Masko, 2008) as a form of resisting societal expectations of the students.

In addition, schools can also get in trouble for putting too many kids of one race in a certain program. For example, &quot;black students are more likely than white youth to be labeled as 'mentally or educationally retarded' and assigned to special education&quot;(Hill, 2004). In addition, a high amount of foster care students receive special education(between 30% and 41%) (Hill, 2004). However, racism can also be applied to teachers. &quot;Black teachers who subscribe to stereotypes about blacks may also exhibit aversively racist behavior that results in 'double standards' in the differential treatment of black and white students&quot;(Hill, 2004).
&lt;/big&gt;

=='''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;FF0033&quot; face=&quot;papyrus&quot;&gt;Institutional Racism&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''  ==
&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
Normally, black families have multiple risk factors such as unemployment and poverty, that cause the majority of children to become abused and neglected. Abuse and neglect is highly strenuous among the poor(Hill, 2004). As such, blacks tend to be overrepresented in child welfare because of the family's class status, not race. Because of this, &quot;institutional racism influences the operation of child welfare&quot;(Hill, 2004). Hill states in a statistic, that black children comprise about one of five children in the nation's population and account for more than two out of five of the 600,000 children who are placed in foster care(Hill, 2004).

Blacks are highly represented in child welfare because of their poverty status. Consequently, the definition of institutional racism is &quot;the systematic oppression, subjugation and control of one racial group by another dominant or more powerful racial groups, made possible by the manner in which the society is structured&quot;(Hill, 2004). For instance, some characteristics of institutional racism are that it can be covert or overt, unconscious or conscious and unintentional or intentional. However, racism does not necessarily occur in groups of people who meet and conspire. Even by internalizing the norms and values of an agency, institution or society can be called racism(Hill, 2004). Unfortunately, racism can occur without the person even knowing what he or she is doing.

In addition, institutional racism is also interconnected with sexism and classism(Hill, 2004). The most serious of this type of racism is commonly found among poor families headed by women who are of racial minority(Hill, 2004).


&lt;/big&gt;

=='''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;FF0033&quot; face=&quot;papyrus&quot;&gt;The personal opinion...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''  ==
&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
Unfortunately, racism occurs everywhere. With experience from a racially diverse high school and a diverse high school sociology class, racism was a strong subject as to who it applies to and what is acceptable to each race. As such, in a discussion on derogatory words, one student made a comment that she did not understand why people were getting so worked up over the subject. This caused myself to interject and speak my opinion. Some black teens in my class mentioned that it was okay for themselves to call each other a &quot;nigga&quot; as long as it was not &quot;nigger&quot;. I however made the suggestion of what if a white person came up to you in the hallway and called you by the first term that ends with the 'a'? The student who responded said that they would be offended. Why would one be offended when a white person calls them that, but not a fellow black? Racism. Some people tend to judge before they get to know the other. Sometimes to judge is to be prejudice or racist. Naturally, to judge is something almost everyone tends to do at one point in their life. However, I tend to stray away from it. I'm not friends with just white people. Some of my closest friends were black and in that sociology class. I was the quiet girl who never spoke unless she was called upon. That one day in class, everything changed. Not one person in that class looked at me the same because I voiced my opinion about racism. You could be green, purple, orange, yellow or red and I would still want to be your friend. I do not judge often and when I do, I am usually wrong about that person.

Everyone deserves a chance to become a friend. You never know who you will be friends with until you try. Race should not be apart of that decision. 
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #FF00FF;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;History of Desegregation&lt;/big&gt;'''
----
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;If one takes a glimpse at American history, one may notice a huge stain concerning race relations. Africans were sold as slaves to their white counterparts. The institution of slavery reduced blacks to property, chattel, and things. Blacks were deprived of their humanity or at least their essential humanity (Cook, 2005). As history progressed African Americans started to gain status , by not being labeled as property, but as people, 3/5 to be exact., which is stated in the 3/5ths Compromise. &quot;Significantly, both the South and the North, in the 3/5 Compromise, used and exploited slaves to increase their power, advantage, and regional self-interest: the South in terms of representation and the North in terms of taxation. Slaves, of course, were completely excluded from voting and other forms of participation in the political process. They were not persons, but things; not subjects but objects, not moral and political agents but helpless, exploited victims deprived of all constitutional protection and all human rights and civil liberties&quot; (Cook, 2005). In other words, African Americans were labeled as 3/5 as a person for representation in the south and taxation in the north, yet they were not given basic rights of humans , even though they were considered 3/5ths of one. 


&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Fast forwarding through history, the lack of rights of African Americans were examined through cases such as the Dred Scott decision and events such as the Civil War. One court case however was very pivotal concerning the rights of African Americans. &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896, involved segregation in transportation. It was a historic, landmark case which established and affected patterns of race relations and human relations over the total institutional and social landscape of the South for generations. The Supreme Court declared, in Plessy v. Ferguson, that racial segregation did not violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Separate but equal facilities were constitutionally permissible for blacks and whites. The key, of course, was &quot;separate.&quot; The &quot;equal&quot; was never enforced or taken seriously. No standard of equality was even considered across racial lines&quot; (Cook, 2005). This court case was pivotal because it acknowledged the rights of African Americans besides human rights. It acknowledged the rights to common utilities used by whites, meaning the same restaurants, bathrooms, and even schools. The only downturn was that facilities had to be separate and equal was at the discretion of others. As Cook stated equal was not taken seriously, therefore the quality of bathrooms, water fountains and schools didnât really matter, as long as it was separate. Schools were definitely subject to the ruling of Plessy vs Furguson. White children had the advantage of new textbooks, better classrooms, thus a better education, while minority children were at a disadvantage of older, used textbooks and less than stellar classrooms, thus a substandard education. 


&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;On May 17, 1954, the barrier of segregation within the school system was broken . According to the National Archives and Records Administration, âOn May 17, 1954, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren delivered the unanimous ruling in the landmark civil rights case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. State-sanctioned segregation of public schools was a violation of the 14th amendment and was therefore unconstitutional. This historic decision marked the end of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; precedent set by the Supreme Court nearly 60 years earlier in Plessy v. Ferguson and served as a catalyst for the expanding civil rights movement during the decade of the 1950sâ.  In other words, this court case set the precedent for school desegregation. This court case finally broke the barrier concerning &quot;separate but equal&quot; within the American school system. Busing was a major way to ensure desegregation within the American school system.
----
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #FF00FF;&quot;&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Impacts&lt;/big&gt;'''
----
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The concept of race and education is still a prevalent issue, even today. Now that Brown vs Board of Education set the precedent of desegregation in the school system, what about other questions concerning race relations and the school system. Questions such as âCan race be a factor, concerning college admissions?â âCan there be a quota set for minorities within public schools and colleges?â


&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The most recent court case dealing with questions like these is the University of Michigan case. According to  the Cornell University Law School Supreme Court Collection, âWhen the Law School denied admission to petitioner Grutter, a white Michigan resident with a 3.8 GPA and 161 LSAT score, she filed this suit, alleging that respondents had discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1981; that she was rejected because the Law School uses race as a âpredominantâ factor, giving applicants belonging to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups; and that respondents had no compelling interest to justify that use of race. The District Court found the Law Schoolâs use of race as an admissions factor unlawfulâ. In other words, race cannot be used as a factor concerning college admissions, which I agree with because if one is not qualified to enter a university, then one is not qualified to enter regardless of their race. 


&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; We have come a long way concerning race and public schools. As of 2006, 41% of elementary and high school students were minorities (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008). As time progresses we are more accepting of our differences and agree that every child deserves a great education. However, there are still some schools that are predominately black and predominately white, but there are not as much as it was 50 years ago. We are eventually learning the mistakes of the past and preparing for a better future for future generations. &quot;Statistics have proven that children who learn together also learn to live together&quot; (Smith, 2008). I agree with this quote because with this ever changing world, we all need to learn how to live together even it means learning with each other.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;7&quot;&gt;How Schools and Teachers Can Create &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safe Schools and Eliminate Bullying&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

Wiki Article by Amanda M. Artzer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
==&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Learning Target&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;==

This articleâs learning targets are designed to help future teachers. Outside links are provided to help readers even further. The article is broken down into many sections for easy understanding.&lt;br&gt;

The point of this article is to enable readers to gain control of their classroom.  It focuses on bullying, and how to identify bullies.&lt;br&gt;

Readers should be able to recognize some of the signs of school bullying.&lt;br&gt;

Ideas and ways of preventing bullying will be suggested to help future teachers eliminate violence in schools. Readers will have a grasp of what to do about bullying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


==&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Bullying&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;==



Children are more often the target of violence, rather than the cause.  Schools should be a safe place for all students.  (U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences , 2007)&lt;br&gt;

For statistics visit http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/crimeindicators2007/. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Bullying is a form of violence.  What is bullying?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
From 1994-1999, 253 deaths were associated with violent events.  Of these, 74.5% were caused by guns.&lt;br&gt;

âIn 1998-99 academic year, 3,523 students were expelled for bringing a firearm to school.â&lt;br&gt;

âNearly 8% of adolescents in urban junior and senior high schools miss at least one day of school each month because they are afraid to attend.â&lt;br&gt;

(National Education Association Health Information Network, 2005)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




Bullying can be physical, threats, teasing, and exclusion. The bully will often blame their target for their actions.  (StopBullyingNow )&lt;br&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Why are people bullied? Here are some examples&lt;/font&gt; (Teens health, 2007).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
â¢	They are shy&lt;br&gt;
â¢	They look different&lt;br&gt;
â¢	They do not fit in&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Race&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Sexual orientation&lt;br&gt;
â¢	They are an easy target&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Social status&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Types of Bullying&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
â¢	Physical &lt;br&gt;
o	Punching, kicking, sexual assault, showing, tripping, etc.&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Psychological&lt;br&gt;
o	An example of this gossip, and spreading rumors about a person.&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Verbal&lt;br&gt;
o	Such as teasing and taunting a person.&lt;br&gt;
â¢	A newer one is Cyber bullying&lt;br&gt;
o	Cruelty through instant messages, web pages, emails, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Who bullies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
They are people who feel the need to dominate others.  They can think of themselves as the greatest, or be very insecure. Others have personality disorders (Teens health, 2007).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
What is bullying?&lt;br&gt;

âPhysical aggression: hitting, kicking, pushing, choking, punching&lt;br&gt;
â¢  Verbal aggression: threatening, taunting, teasing, starting rumors, hate speech.&lt;br&gt;
â¢  Exclusion from activities: This does not mean that a student should have to be friends with every other student; it does mean that children should not be allowed to systematically exclude others: &quot;No one play with Mary;&quot; &quot;No one wants to play with him;&quot; &quot;Don't be her friend.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

(StopBullyingNow)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Examples of Bullying&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;The McKinney North High School and The Texas Cheerleading Scandal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Five cheerleaders at McKinney high school in Dallas, Texas were at the heart of a huge scandal.  They did not just bully students, but they bullied teachers as well.  The girls called themselves the âFab Fiveâ and were the top social clique at their school.  The âringleaderâ of the group was the daughter of the principal, Linda Theret.  
On homecoming night, some of the girls arrived to the dance already drunk.âWhen one teacher told a squad member to quit chatting on her cell phone in class, the girl replied, &quot;Shut up, I'm talking to my Mom.&quot; When another teacher, on a separate occasion, was disciplining her, the girl replied, âPull your panties out of a wad.â  The girls drove five cheerleading coaches to quit in three years.  &lt;br&gt;

The last coach the girls dealt with, Michaela Ward, was bullied by the girls as well. 
âAmong the pranks they allegedly pulled on Ward: giving her what the report described as a &quot;chocolate tampon&quot; and sending racy text messages from her cell phone to her husband and another coach.â
When pictures of the girls surfaced on the internet of them in Condom shops, and drinking; the girls were suspended from the cheerleading squad.  When they were told they would be kicked off if another incident occurred a girl replied, âGood luck with that.â
Ward is the one who took action.  She resigned from the school, and went to the media ( Kovach, Campo-Flores , 2007).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Reducing Violence&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;==



&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Why is it important to rid schools of violence? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If violence is addressed in a school, before the students reach adulthood, it can help eliminate violence and crime in communities  (SafeYouth ).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;How can schools reduce violence?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In order to effectively address the problem, schools must have a plan and not act blindly. According to the 2000 Safeguarding Our Children:An Action Guide, from the Departments of Education and Justice and the American Institutes of Research, studies have found plans need three separate criteria:&lt;br&gt;

1. Positive behavior must be addressed and supported. This does not just include discipline, but extends to academics as well. Teachers must provide a âcaring school environment,â and engage students to participate and excel. Love and support should be shown to all students, and not just negative behavior should be noticed.&lt;br&gt;

2. Students who have ââ¦severe academic or behavioral difficulties early onâ¦â should be recognized and helped immediately. This should begin early on, before problems can escalate and become overwhelming challenges. Services, such as tutoring and counseling, should be provided.&lt;br&gt;

3. Students who are ââ¦experiencing significant emotional and behavioral problemsâ¦â should have intervention from schools. Schools needs to collaborate with outside sources, such as ââ¦social services, mental health providers, and law enforcement and juvenile justice authorities.â&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;How can teachers prevent violence in their classrooms?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

How will you, a future teacher, recognize gang members? Schools must work with their teachers. General staff meetings are routinely held at schools to help teachers understand the specific threats of violence in their schoolâs community. An example of this would be possible gang activities, and ways to identify members of a nearby gang. Administrators also listen to teachers, because teachers may have prior knowledge through interaction with students (Schwartz, 1996).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;How do you prevent students from being involved in gangs? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Positive attention is the best way to prevent violence before it happens. Teachers often identify problems before administrators, because of their close contact with students. Teachers should offer help with schoolwork, let administrators know of possible concerns with a student, ââ¦or even just [be] a sympathetic ear.â If you notice any at risk student, or a student being bullied, let the administrators of your school know. Do not ignore your concerns (Schwartz, 1996).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;But, how can schools further help future teachers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Possible future and further help for teachers would be training how to prevent violence. Many bus drivers already go through similar training. This will help teachers feel more secure, and ââ¦to deal safety with violence should it erupt.â Programs must include identifying risks and what to do in situations (Schwartz, 1996). Unfortunately, not all schools provide these services. If your school does not, provided below are a few links for help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/teachers/wr/article/0,27972,1859590,00.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Above is mentioned that a teacher must have the right environment. But, how do you create a nurturing classroom? What are some things a teacher SHOULD NOT do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In order for children to gain your trust, and have a nurturing classroom, do not sit back behind a desk while students do exercises at their desks. Let them know you are there to help. Walk around and make sure no one has questions.&lt;br&gt;
Do not verbalize frustration, or âpick onâ students.  Be very mindful of comments that can be hurtful, or considered negative reinforcement. Never yell or scream at a student. Make sure that you, the teacher, do not become a bully (StopBullyingNow).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;

âT.E.A.C.H.&lt;br&gt;
T â             Tailor for diversity. Make it a point to know as much as possible about your students, including their diverse cultural, ethnic, behavioral, and learning characteristics, along with stressors they may experience outside of school. &lt;br&gt;
E â             Encourage positive behavior. Aim for a 4:1 ratio of positive comments to negative corrections for all the students. &lt;br&gt;
A â             Arrange the environment for success.  Teach your behavioral expectations directly and immediately through collaboratively-established classroom rules and well designed classroom routines. &lt;br&gt;
C â             Consult your peers. Seek collaboration with experienced teachers and specialists before difficult problems start to become entrenched. &lt;br&gt;
H â             Hug yourself. Prevent stress and burnout by focusing each day on what you are accomplishing and not just on what is frustrating.â &lt;br&gt;
(The Melissa Institute for Violence Prevention and Treatment)



&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


==&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Look for at Risk Students&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;How do I identify these students?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Students who are not attending class, and are disruptive are an example. Other factors are listed on the TeachSafeSchools website.   It is important to catch them early (The Melissa Institute for Violence Prevention and Treatment).&lt;br&gt;
 

Look for disruptive behavior, and wonder why a student is acting that way. Try to understand students as best as possible.  Enforce behavior in September to establish authority. Sit disruptive children near the teaching area.  For more ways to intervene, go to  http://www. teachsafeschools. org/bully_menu5. html#5b .&lt;br&gt;

Some of the examples listed are: &lt;br&gt;
âNever use victimâs names with the bulling student so as to reduce retaliation possibilities.â(The Melissa Institute for Violence Prevention and Treatment)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Personal Analysis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;==

Teachers are not just responsible for teaching, but also need to look out for students.  They have a responsibility to students to try to help them out as much as possible.  Teachers should make students feel safe and comfortable to learn in their classroom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The Overall Summary of this Article&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
1. Do not be afraid to tell administrators your concerns.&lt;br&gt;
2. Positive reinforcement allows for a better classroom environment. &lt;br&gt;
3. Stop problems before they become problems.&lt;br&gt;
4. Collaborating allows for more effective problem solving.&lt;br&gt;
5.  Teaching is not the only responsibility of teachers in the classroom.&lt;br&gt;

Written by Meredith A. Hamilton

=='''School Violence...Where Are We Now?'''==

School violence is a phrase that will most likely fill your head with images of the massacres at Columbine High School, Virginia Tech, and Northern Illinois University. While not all violent episodes involve weapons or death, aggression in schools is an unfortunate reality that frightens parents, teachers, and students, especially in the wake of a nationally publicized school tragedy. While school violence remains a pertinent issue, data suggests that teens have become significantly less violent since 1994 (Cornell). In fact, in 1994, there were forty-two victims of student-homicide at school. In 2003, the number of student-homicides decreased to four (Cornell). Research also suggests that since 1998, violent school assaults have decreased by half (Dedman, 2007). It seems that school violence is decreasing significantly, however, as long as there is one victim of school violence, there is still work to be done.

=='''School Violence Prevention'''==

Although school violence is decreasing, prevention must remain a priority in the school as well as the community in order for the trend to continue. There is not one magic method that will create a safe school (Pollack &amp; Sundermann, 2001). Instead, schools need to implement prevention programs in order to create a safe learning environment. Some of these components are:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;âCreating schoolwide prevention and intervention strategies
&lt;li&gt;Developing emergency response planning
&lt;li&gt;Creating a positive school climate and culture
&lt;li&gt;Implementing ongoing staff development
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring quality facilities and technology
&lt;li&gt;Fostering partnerships between the school and community law enforcement
&lt;li&gt;Fostering family and community involvement
&lt;li&gt;Developing a relationship with mental health and social service organizationsâ&lt;/ul&gt; (Pollack &amp; Sundermann, 2001)

===Administrators Role in School Violence Prevention'''===

Administrators need to take a âwhole-schoolâ approach when confronting the issue of school violence (Larson, 2008). This approach recognizes that everyone in the school building (custodians, office staff, teachers, students, administrators) takes part in violence prevention. Another measure that will likely decrease violence in schools is to reduce overcrowding in the classrooms, hallways, and cafeteria, as more students in a limited space will likely increase the chances that a violent encounter will occur (Larson, 2008).


Positive reinforcement is another tactic that administration could use to help prevent violence in school.  According to Hema Sareen, the project director for Vera Institute of Justice, âPositive reinforcement has more lasting effects on behavior than punishment.  Punishment tells individuals what they are doing wrong but gives no direction for what they should do instead.  Punishment usually has a temporary result to wrong behavior, where as positive reinforcement may result in better behavior by making students feel more confident.   All around the country, different types of positive reinforcement programs are being implemented into schools.  For example, Sareen examines a learning center in Oregon, which specializes in behavior issues in students.  This learning center has created an intervention called, âLinking the Interests of Families and Teachers (LIFT)&quot;(Sareen 2001).  Different schools in the area took part in this intervention.  Giving the students praise for good behavior, and offering them something to signify the good behavior helped significantly lower aggressive behavior.  Administration could research different ideas to make positive reinforcement an effective tool to help prevent school violence.     


Schools also need to develop a system of communication among feeder schools. Violent behavior does not happen overnight so a studentâs previous school may be able to provide insight as to the studentâs home situation, past behavior, and offer suggestions for preventing this behavior (Larson, 2008). When schools take advantage of the resources in the community, their level of success will improve (Pollack &amp; Sundermann, 2001).

With the creation of No Child Left Behind and AYP standards, schools are under tremendous pressure to keep the number of discipline infractions down. In other words, schools are evaluated on the number of suspensions imposed by administrators and in order to make AYP, schools must meet strict criteria. Because of this, some administrators fear imposing certain consequences to students. When this happens, teachers feel a lack of administrative support and many students feel that inappropriate behaviors, such as bullying (verbal and physical) will be tolerated. Other students see bullies getting away with the behavior so they fear they are not going to be protected. This causes a major problem within a school because expectations become unclear and consequences become questionable. Administrators need to make the safety of the students and staff the priority over everything else, including federal standards. When the students and staff feel safe, many positive outcomes occur. Specifically, academics improve, the number of discipline referrals and suspensions are reduced, staff morale increases, and a school climate that is conducive to learning is formed (Pollack &amp; Sundermann, 2001).

==='''Students' Role in School Violence Prevention'''===

Students also need to know how to handle and prevent aggressive encounters in school.  Most importantly, students need to understand the importance of taking threats and warnings seriously. For example, nearly 50 percent of school shooters gave some type of warning prior to the violent event. Had students known to take these warnings seriously, the tragic shootings may not have occurred (Center for Disease Control, 2008). Students also need to understand the seriousness of bullying. In order for students to be aware of this, parents and schools need to address the issue of bullying. Students need to feel comfortable talking to an adult about this issue so they can report the bullying without feeling like a âtattle-taleâ (Peckham, 2007). Students need to see that teachers, administrators, and other staff members take bullying seriously. In order to show that bullying will not be tolerated, bullies need to be given firm consequences, as well as, individual counseling as bullies are often involved in other forms of victimization outside of the school setting (Peckham, 2007).

==='''Parents' Role in School Violence Prevention'''===

Parents need to take an active role in preventing violence wherever their children are concerned.  âAccording to the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center, two-thirds of the 41 students involved in 37 school-shooting incidents since 1974 got their guns from their own home or that of a relative.â(October 11, 2006)  It is important that anyone who owns a gun properly stores it and makes sure it is not easily accessible to children.  Parents need to work together with other parents to make sure their children are not being exposed to guns and other weapons when they are at friendâs homes.  Knowing your childâs friends and their parents allows you to make sure the influences they have are positive.  

Being a good role model for your children is also a way to prevent school violence.  Parents need to teach their children how to deal with their emotions.  Teaching children how to understand and deal with their emotions with help prevent them from making quick decisions that may lead to violence in the heat of the moment.  Good communication between parents and children can reduce the risk of school violence as well.  âChildren who have good communication with their parents are more likely to ask for their advice than turn to peers.â(2003) Teaching children to respect themselves and others can help by teaching them that they can stand up for themselves without putting themselves in danger and that there are many ways to solve problems other than fighting.  There are many ways parents can teach their children to get results without fighting such as: compromise, avoidance, and talking clearly/calmly.  It is important to teach children the importance of not being a bully but it is also important that they know not to become a victim as well.  These can both be accomplished by making sure children know that violence is unacceptable, helping them find tactics to deal with anger management and conflict resolution, inspiring self-confidence, and teaching good social skills.  Last but not least, it is important for parents to limit their childâs exposure to violence and make sure that children know that media violence is not real.

=='''Conclusion'''==

Students are bombarded with violent images on a regular basis. Now more than ever before, violent images are available on the internet, television, and video games. In order for teens to resist violence, schools, parents, and the local communities must stay proactive. In order to do this, schools must have strategies for identifying and intervening with targeted violence, as it is extremely difficult to predict violent episodes (Farmer et al., 2007). Schools and communities that develop a clear strategy for reducing and preventing violence will be better prepared to handle violent students and deter violent behavior. Finally, when behavioral expectations and consequences are clear and consistently enforced, students and staff will feel safe, and a school environment conducive to learning will be formed.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; Introduction to Sexual Education &lt;/font&gt;==

Sexual education is a very controversial topic in our public education system. It has been called by many names including, sex ed, family life, and family planning. The goal of this program is to educate today's youth with the facts about sexual health. From the statistics on the right, posted by SADD in 2007, it is easy to see that teenagers are more sexually active than ever before. Children and teens are exposed to sex everyday in the form of movies, television, advertisements, magazines, and the internet. With this large scale exposure it is easy to understand the statistics. Teens feel pressured to become sexually active at a much earlier age, and pregnancy rates and STDs are on the rise. The need for education of today's youth is apparent, but the question is who should be teaching our children about sex? Should it be the parents, the childâs religious organization, or the schools? Each person will probably answer this question in a different way, but most people seem to agree that sexual education should be taught in school. &quot;A 1999 survey conducted by Hickman-Brown Research Inc. found that 93 percent of all Americans believe sex education should be taught in high schools, and 84 percent believe it should be taught in middle or junior high schools (Masland, 2008). So why is it so controversial if 93 percent believe that it should be taught? The answer to that question isn't if it should be taught, but what type of sexual education should be taught.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; A Brief History of Sexual Education &lt;/font&gt;==

The idea of sexual education is not new. The National Education Association (NEA) began calling for teacher training in sexual education as early as 1912, but the first step was the introduction of a family life program in 1953(Pardini, 1998). This was followed by the production of five pamphlets called the &quot;sex education series,&quot; which was published as a joint effort between the NEA and the American Medical Association, in 1955 (Pardini, 1998). These programs and pamphlets continued through the 1980's despite growing opposition from religious organizations and others. Up until the 1980's, sexual education classes were taught in a more comprehensive manner. In 1986, due to a recognized AIDS epidemic, &quot;U.S. Surgeon General C Everet Koop issued a report calling for comprehensive AIDS and sexuality education in public schools, beginning as early as the third grade&quot; (Pardini, 1998). This spiked some of the most highly debated issues concerning sexual education. The same groups that had opposed these classes through the 60's and 70's claimed that teenagers would be more sexually active if they were given more knowledge about birth control methods, and this comprehensive style of learning would serve as more of an encouragement than a deterrent. The push began for an abstinence-only program. There are no federal laws that require sexual education to be taught in public schools. It is left up to the state to decide if and what kind of program will be offered, however in 1996, &quot;Title V, Â§ 510(b) of the Social Security Act (now codified as 42 U.S.C. Â§ 710b), commonly known as Title V&quot; was provisioned by the federal government (Wikipedia, 2008). This was a welfare reform law that guaranteed federal funding to states who were willing to teach abstinence-only programs in their schools. This gave states the option to participate to receive the funding or they could choose to continue with comprehensive education and receive no funding. Title V has been extended repeatedly, but there has been a strong push for something new. The Responsible Education About Life (REAL) Act has been proposed which will offer federal funding for programs that teach not only abstinence but comprehensive information about birth control (Wikipedia, 2008). To locate state specific laws please visit The Education Commission of the States, Sex Education Laws in the States at [http://www.ecs.org/html/Document.asp?chouseid=7309]

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; Abstinence-Only Sexual Education &lt;/font&gt;==

Abstinence-only sex ed, is centered around the idea that teens should not engage in any sexual activity outside of marriage. &quot;Critics [of this program] say some of the most popular of these programs rely on scare tactics to get their message across and sometimes include inadequate and inaccurate medical information (Pardini, 1998). It has been said by many that abstinence-only programs only focus on the failure rates of birth control methods in an attempt to scare teens into refraining from sexual intercourse. This type of program does not provide birth control, such as condoms, to the students, or provide any information about how to properly use birth control methods. Abstinence is seen as the only sure fire way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases from occurring in teenagers. This has been the preferred method by many states since the early 1980's, and is also backed by federal funding.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; Comprehensive Sexual Education &lt;/font&gt;==

Comprehensive, or abstinence-plus sexual education, provides information about the different forms of birth control available in attempt to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. This is done in addition to teaching that abstinence is the only way to be one hundred percent protected. Comprehensive sex ed also covers topics such as sexuality, masturbation, and homosexuality. &quot;Critics [of this program] say such curricula increase teen sexual activity, although studies show otherwise&quot; (Pardini, 1998).

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; Elementary School Sexual Education &lt;/font&gt;==
One aspect of sexual education, that is often overlooked, is the elementary years. Many states include sex ed or family life for elementary aged children. These programs usually cover such topics as good touches and bad touches, reproductive anatomy, correct terminology, puberty and menstruation, and similar information. Many states offer the option for parents to opt their children out of thess sensitive classes. It is important to recognize that sexual education does not only refer to secondary schools.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; Controversy Concerning Sexual Education &lt;/font&gt;==

Controversy still surrounds sexual education, although it is widely accepted that this is a needed curriculum in today's schools. &quot;Ninety-three percent of public school teachers in five specialties-biology, health education, home economics, physical education, and school nursing--who teach grades 7-12 report that their schools offer sex education or AIDS education in some form (FAM,1989.) It is safe to assume that that number has grown over time. Educators have been effective in implementing and maintaining a sexual education program, but the question still remains which program is the most effective? Some argue that abstinence-only is the most effective program. It encourages today's youth to refrain from sexual activities, and withholds information about effective birth control methods. It is thought by many that this will scare teens into abstaining from sex. Those for abstinence-only argue that giving more information about birth control and proving that methods other than abstinence are effective, will only make teens more sexually active. Those in support of comprehensive education have proven that teens make more responsible choices when presented with the correct knowledge about what forms of birth control are available to them. This has resulted in a decrease in teen pregnancies and STDs in schools using a comprehensive program. Supporters of the comprehensive style of sex ed have often argued that teens will have sex anyway, and by not providing them with the proper knowledge, educators are putting them at a greater risk for becoming pregnant or contracting an STD.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; The Future of Sexual Education and Today's Teachers &lt;/font&gt;==

What is the future of sexual education? The United Stated is, once again, beginning to lean more towards the comprehensive style of sex ed. The proposed REAL Act would allow for federal funding of new comprehensive programs too. Even as early as 1989, &quot;virtually all the teachers [said] that school sex education should cover sexual decision-making, abstinence and birth control methods&quot; (Forrest, 1989). Until the 1980s a comprehensive program was the norm. A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various sexuality programs on groups of students compared to control groups. In discussing the results the following was said of the comprehensive program, &quot;Young people throughout the country tend to become more permissive toward premarital sex as they grow older. While the control groups became more permissive, the sexuality students in the longer, more comprehensive programs did not. This suggests the programs had a conservative effect on their attitudes&quot; (Kirby, 1984). That was 1984, before the internet and the great technology boom. These growing influences, and the general acceptance of sex in society, have had an even greater effect on students. Technology gives them access to any kind of information they want. It is the school's responsibility to make sure they are getting correct and responsible information from qualified teachers. As educators we must recognize that times have changed, and be willing to embrace changes in curriculum that might arise from the new proposed act. States that once found themselves teaching abstinence-only programs may be quickly introduced to a more comprehensive plan. By keeping ourselves educated and up to date, we are helping our students. Sexuality is a natural part of every human being. The reality is most teens will not stop having sex, getting pregnant, or contracting STDs, but we can help combat these problems by providing today's students with the most effective programs available and helping them make better choices. Typically sex ed is taught by a health instructor, school nurse, or other specialized teacher in secondary schools, but even an elementary school teacher may find themselves covering early sex ed topics in their lesson plans. As educators, it is important to understand the history, facts, and the future of sexual education in today's schools.

Sex education is the instruction about sex and human sexuality. In 1913, sex education programs were first introduced to public school systems. With teenage pregnancy rates higher than ever and the serious threat of the contraction of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as HIV, the role of sex education in the school is of greater importance now than ever before. Children are now faced with problems at a much earlier age than in the past. There must be a way to reach the children before they are in such need of help because they are clueless about the devastating problems around them (Sex education, 2007). &lt;br&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;rockwell&gt;''Purpose'' &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;rockwell&quot;&gt;''Four main goals of school-based sex education programs are; 
1.	To provide accurate information about human sexuality&lt;br&gt;
2.	To provide an opportunity for young people to develop and understand their values, attitudes, and beliefs about sexuality&lt;br&gt;
3.	To help young people develop relationships and interpersonal skills&lt;br&gt;
4.	To help young people exercise responsibility regarding sexual relationships, including addressing abstinence, pressures to become prematurely involved in sexual intercourse and the use of contraception and other sexual health measures (Sex Education in Public Schools, 2007). 
''&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The primary purpose of school-based sex education is to help young people build a foundation as they mature into sexually healthy adults. Such programs respect the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community (Sex education in Schools, 2006). Sex education seeks to assist young people in understanding a positive view of sexuality, provide them with information and skills about taking care of their sexual health, and help them make sound decisions now and in the future.&lt;br&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;rockwell&gt;''The Controversy'' &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ==
Since the introduction of sex education in the public school system there has been an on going debate over sex education within our society. There is no federal law or policy requiring sex or HIV education. Currently, 18 states and the District of Columbia require schools to teach sex education, but 32 have not made sex education an essential part of the educational curriculum (Issues and Answers, 2004). The reason such debate arose over the years is because there are many diverse opinions about the topic.
Both sides agree that some form of sex education is needed. Children these days do not understand the results their actions may bring upon them. Over the past few years the U.S has had more than double the teenage pregnancy rate of any western industrialized country, with more than a million teenagers becoming pregnant each year (Sex Education, 2007). Teenagers have the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDâs) of any age group, with one in four young people contracting an STD by the age of 21. In 1994, 417 new AIDS cases were diagnosed among 13-19 year olds, and 2,684 new cases among 20-24 year olds. Since infection may occur up to 10 years before an AIDS diagnosis, most of those people were infected with HIV either as adolescents or pre-adolescents (Sex Education in Public Schools, 2007). Studies have shown that sex education begun before youth are sexually active helps young people stay abstinent and use protection when they do become sexually active. ''It is apparent that it is needed, but who should teach it?''&lt;br&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;rockwell&gt;''Parents'' &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ==
The eleven percent of our country against sex education in public schools is concerned with the innocence of our children. These Americans think that sex education should be taught at home by the children's parents. Their argument is that educating children about sex and other sexual activities is inappropriate because it robs them of their childhood (Sex and Relationship Education, 2007). Some parents also do not agree with what the children are taught. If the parents have the privilege to teach their children and the choice about what to teach them, they can do it when they feel as if it is appropriate. &lt;br&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;rockwell&gt;''Public Schools'' &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ==
It is easy to understand why eighty-nine percent of America supports sex education in public schools. Some children feel uncomfortable approaching their parents about sexual issues and by providing sex education in the classroom it eliminates the awkwardness between children and their parents (What Children are Taught About Sex, 2003). If we left it up to all parents to provide their children with sex education, the education is not guaranteed like it is at school. Those parents who feel that sex education encourages children to engage in sexual activities are wrong because it has been proven that sex education does not increase the sexual activity among students.&lt;br&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;rockwell&gt;''The Argument'' &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ==
Unlike homes, schools do not burden children with moral restrictions. Schools can resolve the &quot;conflict between morality and reality&quot; by offering unbiased statements of fact. Parents only offer their children information based on their beliefs where as a teacher is there to educate the children about everything, not just what he or she believes in.  Without the biased opinions of the parents, young people are given the chance to explore gender differences and how ethnicity and sexuality can influence people's feelings and options. They are also able to decide for themselves what the positive qualities of relationships are. Effective sex education in the classroom also provides young people with an opportunity to explore the reasons why people have sex, and to think about how it involves emotions, respect for one self and other people and their feelings, decisions and bodies (Issues and Answers, 2004). Parents do not always offer all possibilities of sex. Most parents just instruct their children as abstinence being the only choice. With sex education, not only are teens being taught the seriousness and responsibilities of parenthood, but also ways to prevent pregnancy. Abstinence is taught as the best choice, but methods of birth control and other contraceptives are explained. Since sex education has been required in some schools the pregnancy rate in the US has been at a steady decline due to highly effective and long-acting contraceptive methods among sexually experienced teenagers (Sex Education in Schools, 2006).  Being such a disgusting topic, many parents do not inform their children of STDs. With more knowledge of the dangers of STDs and how nasty they are (which is taught during sex education in public schools), young people will be less likely to have numerous partners. Sex education stresses that condoms are not completely effective against HIV/AIDS or that there is a cure for AIDS (Issues and Answers, 2004).&lt;br&gt;

==&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;rockwell&gt;''The Compromise'' &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ==
Since some parents are so set on the idea of educating their children about sex the education system themselves and the government has given these parents the right to withdraw their children from sex education. This law for the right to withdraw has been in affect since 2002. With this option, it gives the parents who feel as if they will do a better job educating their children to do so. It also allows the supporters of sex education to have their children sexually educated. With this compromise, it allows both sides of the argument to get what they want. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not only are parents allowed to withdraw their children, school boards also allow parents to help plan the curriculum of sex education. By critiquing the curriculum to better correspond to a childâs age; this may help the way some parents feel. For example, in primary school children begin to experience both the birth and death of family members. During sex education, for this age, children should be taught that &quot;humans can produce offspring&quot; and about lifecycles of birth and death. By coordinating the curriculum to the childâs age, the opposing party no longer feels that the children are being robbed of their innocence. Also, this will pleases supporters of sex education because the children will still be getting the education that they need to live a healthy life (Sex Education in Schools, 2006).

===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/font&gt;===

Middle school and high school years are filled with activities. Students can engage in sports, clubs, and perhaps, the year book staff or the school news paper. Unfortunately, many students do not. They face greater challenges than the debate team. They face and fall short against peer pressure. Peer pressure can have both a positive and negative effect on a student.  Adolescents base much of their behavior (positive or negative) on either attempting to fit in with a peer group or because they are excluded or rejected by a peer group (usually results in negative behavior).  Middle and High school is a time when students are forming their self-image and feelings of ridicule and rejection towards them from other students can lead to feeling of isolation and loneliness.  In order to compensate for these feelings students will attempt to find an outlet for their frustration (Lashbrook, 2000).  Three common outlets are the proverbial &quot;sex, drugs, and rock and roll&quot;.  They are compelled to consume alcohol and 
other drugs; have intercourse at an early age; even reenact the lyrics in their music. Ultimately, conforming to their social culture, many teens succumb to âwhat their friends are doingâ. Their school is where they come to learn. They learn about mathematics, science, English and geography, but they should also learn the facts on drugs, sex and their prevention. As teachers, it is our duty to educate the youth of America. Yet, we can also strive to understand, relate to and reassure the students. All of us have been there before. We bring to the classroom wisdom and experience that students have yet to learn. We can support our pupils and help them conquer the stress that they face daily. First, we must educate ourselves and the students. This will be a prime arsenal needed in this battle of temptation.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;Drugs in the school:&lt;/font&gt;===

The use of drugs in the public school system is growing at an alarming rate. According to a survey conducted by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, 51% of high school students and 20% of middle school students, said that drugs are used, sold, and kept in their school (Loesevitz, 2008). This not only increases the likelihood that students will engage in substance abuse, but also the probability that students will have a âdisrupted educational processâ (Loesevitz,2007 paragraph 4). Consequently, this will lead to lower grades, increased failure, and ultimately dropping out of school, which leads to future problems in the road ahead of them. Requiring the schools and teachers to be proactive on this regards, and encourage their students to âbe above the influence&quot; before they are introduced to that lifestyle, will have a profound impact on adolescence drug and alcohol use (abovetheinfluence.com). Project Northland, a study done in Minnesota, concluded that intervention, social behavior curricula, peer leadership, and parental involvement, beginning in the sixth grade, reduced the number of students in high school abusing drugs (Perry,''et al.'', 1996). Seventy-five percent of our nationâs schools offer Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) programs, but that education focuses on younger students (http://dare.com/home/about_dare.asp). The students who face peer pressure to consume alcohol and other drugs do not have such opportunities (Cook, 2007). Legislators are beginning to get involved, and asking schools to start school-based drug programs in their district (Tobler,''et al.'', 2000). A great way to get the truth about drugs across to teens could be as simple as a mandatory âafterschool special.&quot; There the students will learn ways to say no to drugs, taught threw a skit or reenactment of a collaborative student created script. Here the kids would also find support, which will help them face their biggest obstacle, each other. However, there is help for those that, despite intervention attempts, fall victim to drug and alcohol abuse. Teen Help is a website available to teens that will guide them away from the downward spiral of alcohol and substance abuse. Also, the shoulder of a caring teacher or counselor can also have an enormous impact on students desperately in need of guidance.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Authors Lizabeth Crawford from Bradley University in IL, and Katherine Novak from Butler University IN, concluded in an article featured in the February issue of The Family Journal that students from broken homes are more likely to engage in substance abuse. These young adults do not receive the support they need at home so they turn to their peers. They get that sense of a family with their friends, this relationship is a double edge sword; where one influences the other (Pope self experience). Substance and alcohol abuse are not the only subjects of peer pressure, but sex as well.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;Sex in the classroom&lt;/font&gt;===

Spin the bottle, an innocent game of kissing is just one example of how kids encourage each other's sexual behavior (Jaccard, 2005). Where do kids learn such games: their older siblings or parents? Where do they learn anything on the subject of sex? Schools have implemented a morsel of sex education in to the curriculum, but many questions go unanswered. Teens will turn to each other or pornography for their answers (http;//focusas.com /sexual behavior.html), two sources that will give distorted answers. In primary school, children often learn about puberty (parent willing) in the classroom. When they arrive in middle school, they learn about reproductive health. That is the extent of public school's sex education (Pope self experience). There are not any classes on how to say no to early intercourse, or what to do if you become pregnant. Kids need to know the following facts about sex and its risks.
âAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 25% of sexually active teenagers get a sexually transmitted disease (STD) every year, and 80% of infected teens donât even know they have an STD, passing the diseases along to unsuspecting partners. When it comes to AIDS, the data is even more chilling -- of the new HIV infections each year, about 50% occur in people under the age of 25.â (http;//focusas.com /sexual behavior.html)
âEach year, almost 750,000 teenage women aged 15-19 become pregnant.â(http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/2006/09/12/USTPstats.pdf)
âThe abortion rate among teen's ages 15-17 are 14.5 abortions per 1,000 females in 2000â¦More than one-third of all teenage pregnancies end in abortion. (http://www.childtrendsdatabank.org/indicators/27TeenAbortions.cfm)
Teens will develop their own cultural normality on sexual behavior, thus teaching them the right way to say no will benefit their well being. Is it the lack of sexual knowledge coupled with a curiosity for sex that urges them to have intercourse? Or is it the music they are listening to?

===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;It is in the Music&lt;/font&gt;===

In the digital age of the twenty-first century, there is no problem getting a hold of popular music. In fact, the average teen listens to 1.5 to 2.5 hours of it daily. Music is important to a growing teenâs identity (http://prdiatrics.aappublications.org). Many social groups are formed around the genre of music its members listen to. However different the music, they all have a common thread: similar themes, like sex run threw them all. So, this question arises: does exposure to sexual lyrics prompt a listener to engage in sexual behavior (Dunbar, 2008)? A national survey done by the American Academy of Pediatrics, on 1461 teenagers found that, when teens listen to music with âdegrading sexual lyricsâ they are more prone to engage in a range of sexual activities; they also found that reducing the amount of exposure to music with this type of content could help delay the onset of sexual behaviorâ (http://prdiatrics.aappublications.org). Music has evolved within the past four decades. There are new genre like âgangsta rapâ, and âheavy metal,&quot; both groups that offer very explicit lyrics to its listener. An alarming conclusion, to a study preformed in Sweden, stated that adolescents that begin to listen to rock music at an early age were more likely to be influenced by their peers (http://prdiatrics.aappublications.org). Like the old saying goes âif you hang out with ducks, youâre bound to get in the water.â The American Academy of Pediatrics urges adults to stress the importance of music and lyric selection in young teenâs music. Music, to the adolescent, helps them deal with many issues they are facing like, friendship, growing up, having fun and struggling (Dunbar, 2008). There are no laws to censor the air waves; only designation of explicit lyrics on the cover of CDs. Teachers can do their part by not allowing it in the classroom, a standard rule in most schools, yet a commonly broken rule. They can also, influence the students to be more selective in their musical choices.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#C48793&quot; face=&quot;hurry up&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;===

Not all students will rely on their peers for support. Many find guidance and help at home. For the children that are not as fortunate, we as the extended family can have a great impact on their teenage lives, as well as their future. Heading these kids off at the curb and nipping any problems in the bud, will have an enormous impact on their future. I decided to write this article because I was a troubled teen. After my mother remarried and my little brother was born, I did not receive the supervision I needed. Consequently, I ran to my friends for comfort. I abused drugs and cut class. At the end of my high school years, I did graduate, but I was six months pregnant. I donât think I would have made it to graduation at all if it had not been for the influence of caring teachers. They encouraged me while in class, as well as to continue with my education. Now, nearly ten years later, I have an associate degree and I am currently working on a bachelorâs degree. Someday I will be that caring teacher that will change someoneâs life. A new trend among students is forming because of devoted teachers. They are reassessing their music selection and the risks and dangers of sex and drugs. With continued education and mentoring programs, students will be prepared not only for their graduation day, but also to say no to negative influences, and possibly help a friend.

==&lt;font color= &quot;#FFCC66&quot;&gt; '''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

For many years popular culture has had such a strong influence on children.  The music that children listen to, the movies they watch, and most importantly their peers, all of which have influenced children in ways that parents could not imagine.  It has become a growing concern for many parents especially in modern society to know where their children are going for security and guidance if they are not going to the parents or family members.  With all the teen pregnancies occurring, children having access to drugs, it is extremely important for parents to know what and who are getting into the minds of their children.  

School is supposed to be a safe place for children to learn history, math, English, art, and reading, not a place to learn about the different kinds of drugs people can get a hold of, how much alcohol they are able to consume, or why they should have sex now instead of later from their peers. It has been reported statistically that, â32.2% of adolescents had their first alcoholic drink by the age of 13 and 50% of teens feel pressured in sex and relationshipsâ (http://teens.lovetoknow.com/Statistics_on_Peer_Pressure, 2009). But school is also suppose to be a safe place where children are able to grow socially with their peers. Now where does that leave the children?   As society is growing and changing, parents are still trying to figure out how and why their children are being influenced so greatly by their peers and popular culture.  Letâs take a look at sex, drugs, and popular music in and out of the school setting.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#FFCC00&quot;&gt; '''Sex, sex, it's all about S E X'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Sex education in schools has become a very controversial topic.  Some believe that when sex education is being taught, the information given is the cause for more sexual interactions among children, because they are being educated on all aspects of sex.  Others believe that if sex education should be taught, teachers should only educate the students about abstinence.  If abstinence is the only topic being spoken about, the belief is that there will be a decrease in pregnancy rates and STD rates.  Due to the fact that most students by time they reach a sex education class, they have already had intercourse, the abstinence education seems non-effective, but some schools have implemented a program where they still teach abstinence and how to safely protect themselves if they are sexually active or plan to become sexually active.  To see which states require sex education, or abstinence education or both, can be located at this website: http://www.teen-aid.org/State_Resourses/State_Sex_Education_Laws.htm.  

One of the main influences on children are their peers.  If his or her peers are engaging in sexual activity, it is then âcoolâ for everyone else to be engaged in sexual activity including your child.  Usually those children that are very involved with their friends, tend to begin dating much sooner and end up in romantic relationships (Jayson, 2008). 

According to Health Care Industry,  âadolescents who initiate sexual activity at young ages tend to have more sexual partners and use condoms less than those who initiate sex laterâ¦â (Sieving, 2006). This explains the high pregnancy rates among youth in America. 

During these middle school and high school years children look to their friends before anyone else, for the simple reason that their friends understand how they are feeling and what they are going through better than any parent or adult can.  Moreover, children look to their peers for acceptance and oneâs perception of his or hers behaviors and attitudes (Sieving, 2006).  

Not only do peers have an influence on children, but the media also has a huge impact.  After a phone survey was done on 1000 teens, it was recorded that girlâs ages 14-19 who listened to pop music, hip hop music, or read woman magazines, were associated with having had sex (AACAP, 2004). This survey and many other studies show the effects that media has had on teens and sex.  It has also been suggested that due to the provocative lyrics, the sexual content on how girls should act, and what feelings boys should have lead to sexual intercourse the many STDâs and pregnancies among teens. Media seems to play a big role in the lives of many adolescents.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 30.2% of young adults are given, offered, or sold drugs in high school and middle school.&lt;p&gt;Among recent inhalant initiates, 19.4% used inhalants on 13 or more days in the past year (NSDUH, 2006)  &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

 
Drugs are defined as âany chemical substance that, when absorbed into the body of a living organism, alters normal bodily function.â (wikipedia, 2009)  In any health education class, children learn this basic definition, what the different drugs are and their effects on the body.  What seems to be the best teaching tool for drugs in the school is the well-known D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program.  This curriculum is mostly geared towards elementary students, and teaches them to stay away from all drugs that are harmful.  According to researchers, students who have participated in the DARE program, are 5 times less likely to engage in drug related activities as they get older. (D.A.R.E, 2008)   
&lt;p&gt;
Along with the DARE program, school districts follow the âzero toleranceâ act. With this act, any students caught with any drugs, alcohol, weapons, or anything tobacco related, regardless of how little it may seem, are punished.  The question in this case is, will punishing students actually have an effect on drug usage among adolescents? Well many school districts feel as though it is important and will help get rid of the disruptive students in the classroom settings, which will lead to less drugs and alcohol in the schools.  (Skiba, 1999) 
&lt;p&gt;
Most children that are involved with drugs are usually said to be: depressed, have a family background of drug use and feel as though drug use is normal, has a need to fit in with their peers, or they have low self-esteem.  During these adolescent years a lot of experimentation with drugs happens, simply because they are at that age where they think they are indestructible from any consequences.  (AACAP, 2008) One of the more popular drugs in recent years that have been experimented with are inhalants.  Inhalants being the 3rd widely most used drugs among adolescents are very easy to get a hold of.  
&lt;p&gt;
Adolescents are using the most common everyday items to inhale such as glue, shoe polisher, cleaners, lighter fluid, and degreasers, all of which are usually found in the home, or could be bought in any store.  It has also been reported that most adolescents that have tried inhalants, have already experienced drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, and smoking cigarettes.(NSDUH, 2006) But its these moments of experimentation that may hinder an adolescents growth socially, or could be a one time event for self knowledge. It's always up to the adolescent what they learn and do from their experimenting.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#FFCC00&quot;&gt; '''Whatâs that youâre singing?'''&lt;/font&gt;==

âLetâs talk about sex baby, letâs talk about me and you, letâs talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be, letâs talk about sexâ¦â These are lines from a very popular hip-hop song done by Salt and Pepper in the early 90âs.  As sex was beginning to become an issue in the early 90âs, many realized that adolescents were paying close attention to music lyrics.  That is why this song by Salt nâ Pepper was so significant at that time.  The song basically said, to talk about everything before making such a big step in oneâs life; make sure you both know everything good and bad, benefits and consequences about sex and each other. Not too many songs in any genre that are promoting no sex or safe sex.  
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand adolescents are hearing lyrics like âWhen it comes to sex donât test my skills, cause my head game will have you head over heels. Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring. Iâll do it anywhere, anyhow; Iâm down for anythingâ¦â this coming from a female rap start, many know as Lil Kim.  With such a message, many adolescent would not loose the idea of having sex.  Many songs sound like this one and they give adolescents more reason to engage in sexual intercourse. According to one research team, they found that with the explicit lyrics, there was an increase in sexual interactions among adolescents (Martino, 2006). 
&lt;p&gt;
Because music is more accessible in todayâs society, there are many more music options that adolescents can get a hold of.  It is seen everyday in the schools how much of an impact rap music in particular has on adolescents.  Much rap and hip hop songs focus mostly on wealth, which is attained by the âthug lifeâ.  Thug life is basically gangs, drug dealing and larceny (Duncan, 2009). These images are also glamorized through music videos.  Adolescents are able to view a number of things such as: graphic violence, sex that focuses on devaluing women, violence toward women, lyrics showing suicide as an alternative solution (AACAP, 2004). Along with that when there are artist who believe &quot;What else can you rap about but money, sex, murder or pimping? There isnât a whole lot else going on in our world. Rapper Ja Rule&quot;(Strasburger, 2004). With all this in the hands of adolescents, it is important for parents to try and pay close attention to what their children are listening to.  Although it seems as though popular music has a strong hold on children, parents and their peers have just as much of an impact on them.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#FFCC66&quot;&gt; '''Conclusion'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;45%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFCC66;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Being in middle school and high school, those are the years that are easily swayed by parents, peers, and popular culture. It is all about what aspects are helping sway adolescents and in what direction.  Popular culture and peers have the largest impact on adolescents, because they are at that age where they feel as though they will be better identified in society, they will fit in with all that is going on around them (Skiba, 1999).  The facts that they learn in school and from parents sometimes are not enough.

As someone who has already been down that road, the best influence in an adolescentâs life is their parents and peers. I feel as though it is up to the parents to take control of what their children are exposed to and how they handle that exposure.  As for their peers, with the guidance of their parents adolescents should be able to figure out who would have a better impact on them, be able to weed out the bad friends and stick with the friends that will continue to help them grow socially in a positive direction.  Unfortunately, even though some adolescents have this structure, they are still swayed very strongly by popular culture.  Also, I feel as though for the education that is taught on sex and drugs, it is up to adolescents to take that information in and use it for their benefits.  But many shrug off the facts and go about their ways.  So no matter how hard the schools try the enforce no sex and staying away from drugs most students will do what their peers are doing, and what popular culture says is âcool.â

&quot;&lt;b&gt;Student mobility&lt;/b&gt; refers to the phenomenon of students changing schools for reasons other than grade promotion&quot; (Hartman, 2002)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;FONT COLOR = &quot;8B0000&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt; &lt;i&gt;Learning Targets&lt;i&gt; ==
Students will be able to:

* Define Student Mobility

* Describe in detail the effects of Student Mobility on a student's productivity

* Identify common trends on Student Mobility

* Identify effective practices which can lower the adverse emotional effects on those students who are &quot;mobile&quot;
&lt;/big&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt; ==

As a teacher, one might begin each year by asking themselves questions such as: 'What subjects am I teaching? Where will I be teaching? How will I go about teaching?' and of course, 'Who am I teaching?' Unfortunately, due to student mobility, answering this last question could turn out as a difficult concern. As the economy changes, so might a student's financial situation, living environments, and basic needs might change as well which could lead to a student having to move from home to home, city to city, or even just school to school. Even in some instances, even a student attending a Private school might have to switch to public schooling due to lack of funds or problems in the home or current classroom.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCCCCC;
border: solid 2.5px #336633; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
 
&quot;A national longitudinal survey . . . found that 31 percent of eighth graders had changed schools two or more times between the first and eighth graders and 10 percent changed schools two or more times between the eighth grade and twelfth grades, not counting regular promotions between elementary, middle and high schools&quot; (Rumberger &amp; Larson, 1998 p.2).
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;&lt;i&gt; How Might Student Mobility Effect The Student? &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ==

A student's move within a school district, state, country, what have you, can be due to a myriad of reasons. This move might not always be a physical move, but could also be an extremely emotional and unavoidable relocation altogether. Some students who are moving short distances have the possible chance of less immediate change in their lifestyle. Contrary to short moves, a student who is making a further move may be leaving close friends, family members, or possibly just a familiar environment, which ultimately could adversely effect their emotional status. Some effects on students losing these familiarities might feel insignificant, lost, displaced, or even &quot;home-sick&quot; regardless if moving with their nuclear family or not. The bonds this child might have made prior to one, or multiple move(s) have either just been severed or compromised.

This switch in emotional states could lead to distraction from their studies and their involvement in their new educational domain. As North Central Regional Educational Laboratory (NCREL) states, &quot;Student mobility has a negative impact on educational achievement for students and schools, creating an achievement gap between mobile and nonmobile students. Frequent relocation interrupts regular attendance, continuity of lesson content, and the development of relationships with teachers and peers. In addition, high student mobility has a slowing effect on basic skills acquisition, creating a long-term risk of school failure and dropout. Another risk, because academic records are not always available, is inappropriate placement in a new school. . . &quot; (Paik &amp; Phillips, 2002). I feel that this statement is extremely relevant and gives good examples concerning what to look out for as an educator. Signs such as self-displacement or removal from peers, sadness, dropping grades, or less attendance and participation might indicate to an educator that this child could be in need of therapy. I use the term therapy loosely; I don't believe that every child's problem should be resolved by medication or a psychiatrist, however, peer study groups, meetings with family members, and special attention to this student could give them the self-worth needed to progress in this new environment.

==&lt;i&gt;&lt;big&gt;Student Mobility's Effect On The Classroom&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/i&gt;==

In the classroom, student mobility adds to the tension of not only those students who are dealing with a new environment, but assuredly so those students who are coping with the addition of a new classmate as well. Thinking back to elementary and middle school it would be safe to assume there were the typical archetypes one could expect to encounter in the classroom' such as; the quiet one, the bully, the crier, the clown, and the nerd (amongst others). Imagine learning your peers' traits and characteristics, the process of self-discovery and creating a level of comfort in your surroundings. Now remove yourself from that comfortable environment and move yourself to a completely new school and having to undergo the process all over. Not only are you conforming yourself to learn characteristics of those surrounding you, finding a lunch buddy, surviving dodge ball, you are also the &quot;new kid&quot;. All that was previously mentioned could possibly be a huge distraction and a lot to cope with. These stresses along with whatever the reasoning behind the student's move ultimately could be detrimental to a student's productivity in the classroom. Due to Student Mobility such distractions and in-classroom tensions can result in &quot;lower achievement levels due to discontinuity of curriculum between schools, behavioral problems, difficulty developing peer relationships, and a greater risk for dropping out&quot; (Hartman, 2002).

==&lt;i&gt;&lt;big&gt;The Who of Mobility&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/i&gt;==

Most studies done on Student Mobility lead to a general consensus as to who undergoes a higher level of mobility and those who do not. In an article posted on EdWeek.org, a website run by Editorial Projects in Education, Inc., the three groups of which had the highest level of mobility where children of migrant workers, homeless children, and low-income children (Student Mobility, 2008). These children are at risk of higher mobility due to migration of family from one location to another location either due to location and availability of work. Unfortunately, this type of move is usually unavoidable and leaves the student feeling insecure or with a lack of a sense of home. Educators who observe these types of moves typically live in areas which undergo crop rotations or are near a border of another country. This being said, educators in those areas would be well off to try and establish in the classroom a type of familiarity with the student to aide their attention levels and learning while in that classroom. This would also help the student comfortable which might allow the formation of bonds with the teacher and those around him or her.

These statistics, as with many other researches, do not include military families in their research. Reasoning for this particular omission would be the special circumstances that the departments of the Military and Department of Defense consider and implement to reduce to the effects of mobility on their students and children. &quot;Approximately 13 percent of these students attend schools run by the Department of Defense. Due to targeted programs aimed at reducing the negative affects of mobility, DOD students tend to have high academic achievement&quot; (Student Mobility, 2008). Reasoning behind this would be the level of study done on family members of extremely mobile federally dictated families. Families who are moved by the government are usually around other families who have to move around - strangely enough giving them a bonding point. Along with being surrounded by others who must move, private schools on military bases are much smaller and allow the students to grow and connect with each other and their teacher in a way that crammed public schools might not be able to.

==&lt;i&gt;&lt;big&gt;How to Fight the Effects of Mobility&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Glori Chaika graciously offers a few examples of what can be done in the classroom to attempt reversing the effects of Mobility on younger students. Chaika suggests:

* &quot;A class could throw a party at the end of the last day for a child who is moving. At the party, each child in the class could say one thing he or she will miss or one thing he or she appreciates about the child who is leaving.

* A class could give a child who is moving a going-away gift. A nice remembrance is a good-bye book with photos of classmates and notes from them. Or children can draw pictures of themselves and use talk bubbles in which to say a farewell to their classmate. A card, an autograph book, a T-shirt signed by each classmate, or an address book with the address of everyone in the class are other gifts the class could give a child who is moving.

* A teacher could send letters from a child's classmates to the child's new school to greet the child when she or he gets there.&quot;


By utilizing these suggestions, teachers are giving the student a small type of buffer that would aide the student with coping with a move. Where these will not completely remedy the hindrance at hand, it alleviates a degree of post- or pre-move stress and tensions the child might be undergoing.

General Henry Shelton shared that quote from his son who was responding to a question asked by his elementary teacher at a speech to educators in October, 1998. General Shelton and his family moved 26 times in his 36 year Army career.

== BACKGROUND ==

----


Mobility has become a way of life in today's society. It is a rare occurrence for a child to attend school from kindergarten to graduation in the same hometown. Military families move every two to three years depending on branch of service and the job that the active-duty parent has. The typical Navy officer, who is in aviation, has children that were born in either Norfolk, VA or Lemoore, CA. They have lived overseas at least once, and attended schools on both coasts. 


Children of the military have unique opportunities that their peers don't. They are able to live in or near places that are usually just read about in American and World History textbooks. They are able to interact with people from other countries and cultures. They gain a global perspective that many of today's youth don't have(Keller and Decoteau 2000).  


Along with these advantages are disadvantages, coming into a new school in the middle of the year,  missing tryouts for sports teams or drama productions, playing catch up with a new curriculum or adjusting to one that is not as challenging as the previous school. Along with those challenges is the fact that usually after a move the active duty family member will deploy for anytime from 6 months to one year. Just as understanding the challenges faced by these children will aid in promoting their social and emotional resiliency and academic progress, indifference will have a detrimental effect.

== CHALLENGES ==

Mobility is a fact of life for many American families. Not only does it affect individuals, but also the institutions that serve them. How well a school accommodates the mobile student has much to do with how the student fares (Keller 2000). This issue is usually presented in terms of academic performance but social and emotional factors are also in play. 


Current educational standards assume a stable population. Every state has a different requirement for state history, if you are in Texas in 9th grade, you'll take Texas History, if you live in Washington State, you take Pacific Northwest History. And every state has their own standardized tests for each class. However if you are a military child and move from 
Texas to Washington in your junior year, you still have to take Pacific Northwest History, because of the state requirement.
 

The other challenges faced by the mobile military child include not only differences in curriculum, but also grading system differences, for example, Chesapeake Public Schools use a seven point scale instead of the standard ten point scale. There are also credit variances due to different schedule types, i.e. block schedules versus seven class all year. Also states have different requirements for graduation. 


Lauren Gipson, guidance counselor, at Hickory High School says that it is difficult when a student transfers from a year long schedule to a 4x4 block schedule. A lot of the options are dependent on when the student transfers. If they come in during the first semester the student will be placed in a class they can catch up in, also available are instructional labs to help them get caught up in certain subjects. Unfortunately, if a student transfers in during the second semester the school places them in classes that they had been taking already and they lose three credits. 


The school will accept credits transferred from the other school. However as state tests are not yet reciprocal a student will have to take SOLs for any courses already completed.


Jessica Ruddick, an English teacher at Hickory High School in Chesapeake, says that in an ideal situation she tries to provide supplemental material so that a new student is challenged and not bored. For example, if the class is studying Shakespeare, she will assign a different play than the one the class is reading. If a student is behind she will work with them one on one to get them caught up to the rest of the class. The student has to take some initiative as well as they have to work at a fast pace to catch up with the rest of the class. Ideally, teachers should always strive to customize the curriculum to suit every student's needs, not just transferring students.

Of course, that is not always possible due to the demands on a teacher with thirty students in a class. When a student is behind they have to get them up to speed. Ms. Ruddick usually gives the student material to work on and then consults with them to make sure everything is clear and answers any questions that the student has. If a student is ahead she is able to give them other material that would be a challenge, but sometimes the student opts to do the same material again because it is an easy &quot;A&quot; for them. That is not ideal because they are not learning as much as they could. 

Also Honors English in Chesapeake follows the English 12 SOLs, other Virginia schools don't do this.


== FACING THE CHALLENGES ==
In order to address some of the challenges the United States Army Community and Family Support Center asked the Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC) to conduct a study on the impact of high school transitions for the military connected child. The recommendations they made are divided into three categories: 
*Technical and Procedural Categories which addresses issues such as records transfers, school calendars, and schedules.
*Policy, Standards, and Opportunities, which puts some onus on the parents to make sure that they take responsibility, ask questions, and become informed about graduation requirements and state testing. They also address the issues of extracurricular activities, sports teams, clubs. 
*Support System, realizing that children, no matter what age, need caring adults and that they are all unique.

The authors of the study made various recommendation in each category. In the first category they stress the importance of communications and the hand carrying of records to the next school so that at least the receiving school has an idea of placement. However, most schools do not consider hand carried records official. MCEC, in conjunction with the Killeen(TX) Independent School District created a virtual student &quot;Larry Longhorn&quot; to test the feasibility of electronic records transfers. It has not been very successful. Mary Keller commented in frustration, &quot;It is amazing. We can move billions of dollars in the banking system around the country, but we have trouble getting Larry from Texas to Missouri.&quot;(Keller, 2000).

The recommendations in the second category were to make sure that parents are informed about state requirements, and that academic planning is essential. They also recommend that schools make sure that information about clubs and activities is available year round, not just at the beginning of the school year. It was also a recommendation that schools consider options and opportunities for students to try out for sports teams. Matt Puryear, the athletic director at Grassfield High School, told me that if a student wants to go out for the football team and he has missed the beginning weeks of practice, that as long as he follows VHSL guidelines, i.e. 5 days with no pads, etc. that he is welcome to try out for the team. Teddy Evans, the wrestling coach at Hickory High School, said that if a new student is willing to work hard that he is welcome in the wrestling room and will have an opportunity to challenge and wrestle off for a starting spot.

The recommendations that the study made in the support category are relatively easy to enact for a caring school. They suggest that the school have an organized method for orientation to the campus and follow up. The schools should have a system in place that &quot;checks on&quot; new students while being sensitive that these processes are not further singling out the &quot;new kid&quot;.

== LEGISLATION ==


In hopes of eventually easing some of these issues the Council of State Governments (CSG) in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense Office of Personnel and Readiness, has drafted an interstate compact that deals with the educational transition issues of children of military personnel(Interstate Compact on Education Opportunity for Military Children). The Compact deals with issues such as graduation requirements, transfer of records, immunizations, age of enrollment and course completion. This compact will activate once ten states have adopted it. It came in front of the Virginia State Legislature in the last legislative session, but it stalled in the Senate(The Virginian-Pilot, 11 October, 2008). The compact must be passed by ten states before its language takes effect. The compact is currently in front of the Washington State Legislature (http://blogs.thenewstribune.com/military/2009/01/21/supporters_of_education_compact_find_all). The Senate version faced no opposition and they are currently looking at the legal impacts of giving an outside organization part of their K-12 authority


== LEGISLATIVE UPDATE ==
In its 2009 session the Virginia General Assembly has passed HB1727, otherwise known as the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children. The bill was sent to Governor Kaine 9 March, 2009. http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?091+sum+HB1727 As of this date the compact has been passed by ten states and is now active. http://www.csg.org/programs/ncic/EducatingMilitaryChildrenCompact.aspx

== RESOURCES AND CONCLUSION ==

Not all of the burden of easing a transition should be placed on the schools. Parents also bear some responsibility. The Military Child Education Coalition based in Harker Heights, TX offers resources for military parents and children in keeping up to date records of classes taken and has different publications available. Their website is http://www.militarychild.org

The life of a military child is filled with new adventures and interesting places to live, but there are also challenges involved with every new journey. Caring educators and parents that want the best for their children can help in easing the journey through the military child's school career.

If we were TV sets, some of us would only get five channels. Others are wired for cable (the general population) and some of us (the gifted) are hooked up to a satellite dish. That makes these gifted children capable of making connections that others don't even know exist! Teaching those types of voracious minds in a regular classroom without enhancement is like feeding an elephant one blade of grass at time. You'll starve them. â Elizabeth Meckstroth 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

When one hears the phrase &quot;special education,&quot; thoughts turn to students with learning disabilities or students who cannot keep up with the pace of the classroom. However, a certain group of special education students is often overlooked. These children are indeed in need of special education but not in the manner to which we are accustomed. These are the gifted students, who, since they do not show traditional signs of academic distress, can be overlooked. Although they are often thought to be relatively self-sustaining in the classroom, gifted students deserve special education to meet their individual needs.


'''&lt;font color=&quot;#736AFF&quot; face=&quot;Segoe Print&quot;&gt;Recognizing Gifted Students in a Classroom&lt;/font&gt;'''

Over the years, as the issue of gifted students in the classroom has earned increased attention, the definition of a gifted student has evolved. As author Sandra Manning investigates, in her article &quot;Recognizing Gifted Students: A Practical Guide for Teachers,&quot; in the past, the definition of a gifted student has focused on everything from a student's high IQ test scores to a student's exceptional performance in life situations (Manning, Sandra 2006). Now, the popular use of the title &quot;gifted&quot; is for students with a high academic or intellectual ability (Manning 2006). Although Manning admits that definitions of the word &quot;gifted&quot; carry much ambiguity, she asserts that these gifted students exhibit certain characteristics that can be identified by instructors in the classrooms (Manning 2006). 

The first group of characteristics that the author examines is the set of &quot;cognitive characteristics of intellectually gifted children,&quot; characteristics in how the students think and learn (Manning 2006). According to Manning, gifted students often exhibit strengths in reception, processing, and retention of information (Manning 2006). They possess the ability to comprehend materials at higher levels, and their abstract thinking skills are usually more developed than those of their peers (Manning 2006). Gifted students not only possess stronger abilities to take in information, but they also have the desire to pursue studies in specific areas that interest them (Manning 2006). These students can see connections and relationships between ideas and are creative in their ideas and problem-solving techniques (Manning 2006). Gifted students tend to be high-energy learners, who can focus longer and investigate deeper into a project (Manning 2006). 

Manning goes on to address a second aspect of recognizing gifted students in a classroom: the &quot;affective characteristics of intellectually gifted children,&quot; behavioral characteristics of the students (Manning 2006). She explains how gifted students often possess a strong desire to share their knowledge with other students (Manning 2006). They tend to be more conscious of the emotions of others, have an unusual sense of humor, and have a stronger sense of self-awareness (Manning 2006). These students also exhibit advanced emotional depth, moral judgment, and ideas of justice (Manning 2006). All of these characteristics are common in gifted students, but that is not to say that every gifted student will exhibit all of these characteristics. 

The last group of characteristics that Manning discusses is &quot;characteristics of atypical gifted students&quot;, or students who are gifted but whose talents for some reason have not emerged in the traditional manner (Manning 2006). Characteristics of atypical gifted students include logic skills and an ability to understand and utilize analogies, as well as an easily overlooked ability to manipulate a symbol system (Manning 2006). Atypical gifted students can display their abilities in a broader array of subjects, such as creative arts (Manning 2006). Also, these students tend to be adaptive in their families, be capable of taking on leadership or parenting roles in a troubled family, and possess a strong sense of self-worth and pride (Manning 2006).


'''&lt;font color=&quot;#736AFF&quot; face=&quot;Segoe Print&quot;&gt;Special Needs of Gifted Students&lt;/font&gt;'''

Gifted students may ace the tests and boost up the class average on standardized tests, but are their scores true indicators of their academic success and fulfillment of their learning desires? Although their test scores may be high, gifted students have special needs of their own that possibly cannot be met by the day to day runnings of a classroom. In her article, author Karen B. Rogers introduces five &quot;lessons&quot; about the needs of gifted students (Rogers, Karen B. 2007). First, she explains that in order for gifted students' talents to flourish and grow, they need to be presented with a daily challenge that will enhance their particular strength (Rogers 2007). With progressively more difficult challenges, the students will grow intellectually in their areas of strength and will learn to connect old and new ideas (Rogers 2007). Rogers goes on to assert that gifted students need opportunities for independent work pursuing their specific areas of interest (Rogers 2007). Opportunities like that are not easy to create in the structure of a traditional classroom, depriving gifted students of that need. Another great need of gifted students is advanced instruction in a subject area in which they are exceeding (Rogers 2007). They need the opportunity to learn at their own levels; how can a fifth grader who is reading on an eleventh grade level be appropriately challenged in her fifth grade class? In addition to academic needs, Rogers explains that gifted students need opportunities to spend time with other students with abilities similar to theirs (Rogers 2007). This gives the students an opportunity to work with their peers and spend time with students who think how they do. Gifted students sometimes feel isolated because they are different from the other students in the classroom; this gives them a chance to work with students who are similar to them. Lastly, gifted students need to learn at their own pace. Just like any other students, in order to be academically challenged, they need to work at a pace that matches their learning styles and abilities (Rogers 2007). Gifted children tend to learn and retain information at a much quicker rate. If they experience too much down time while the rest of the class is reviewing, they will become bored and lose focus. They too need to learn at their own rate in order to maximize their learning abilities (Rogers 2007). School systems have many different ways of dealing with their gifted students. One of the most popular ways is grade skipping. Sometimes parents think this is appropriate because their child is smart enough to be moved up a grade or two. Other times itâs the school system that feels grade skipping will benefit the child but is this true? Davis and Rimm identify the two major concerns for grade skipping in their Education of the Gifted and Talented book. The first concern is missing critical basic skills. For example âmany teachers feel that if a child is not taught an important math or reading skill, he or she will be at a great disadvantage in later gradesâ(p.125) The second problem is social adjustment. It is a myth that gifted children are more adjusted socially and emotionally than average students. The truth is gifted students have a harder time adjusting because others do not relate to them.

In the article Differentiation: Asset or Liability for Gifted Education?, Sandra N. Kaplan examines what she sees as the ubiquitous classification of differentiated learning.  Kaplan suggests that a rather broad definition and assignment of the term differentiation has posed a potential problem for gifted education.  The author implies that because the definitive idea of differentiated learning has âlost its vitality,â its significance to gifted instruction has consequently waned.

Kaplan states that gifted education programs, falling under the scope of differentiated learning, require explicit and unique curriculums that distinguish them from general education studies.  She claims that constantly shifting educational practices and their overreaching classification and application of âdifferentiatedâ have resulted in the failure to adequately define unique instruction that specifically addresses the needs of the gifted learner.   Says Kaplan, âWhen differentiation is used to justify educational practices that alter the ends or goals of learning rather than the means to these ends, it has the potential to become a deterrent rather than a facilitator to the education of gifted students.â  Problems arise, as Kaplan views it, when teachers categorically allot set tasks for the whole of an identified group without the flexibility and options of projects that assist the abilities and weaknesses of the individual student

'''&lt;font color=&quot;#736AFF&quot; face=&quot;Segoe Print&quot;&gt;The Effects of NCLB on the Gifted&lt;/font&gt;'''
Differentiation is strongly emphasized in the educational system, but the gifted student is often overlooked.  These students could be the ones that make that marked invention that changes society and need to be challenged to reach their maximum potential.  One problem on the horizon is the No Child Left Behind act.  Now teachers are so focused on bringing up scores and differentiating to accommodate the struggling child that the gifted student faces no challenges in his environment.  School systems are happy with their scores and feel no need to stretch their abilities further.  According to an article by Henley, McBride, Milligan and Nichols, there are three significant problems associated with NCLB and the gifted student.  First, the gifted students that had little or no attention before are ignored now; secondly, teachers are being taught that they need to focus on bringing the low end students to proficiency and the average to advanced; therefore, the gifted are not even in the consideration.  Thirdly, students that had been receiving gifted services were being retained in the classroom for test preparation and basically eliminating any special services they had been given.  It is a great concern for the advanced students to receive little or no formal services due to the emphasis on the lower end child.



'''&lt;font color=&quot;#736AFF&quot; face=&quot;Segoe Print&quot;&gt;Twice Exceptional Students&lt;/font&gt;'''

Some gifted students have additional issues that impede their success. They may be rapid learners who need very little repetition while at the same time they may have a learning disability or physical challenge. These types of learners are known as Twice Exceptional because they sit on both sides of the normal bell curve of students. And it can be a challenge to meet their needs. Educators need to know that these students exist and they must be identified early in order for them to be successful and reach their potential.
A young man I know did not learn to read fluently until he was ten years old, in the fourth grade. He said that the letters and words moved around on the page and would not sit still as he tried to read them. He had known all of his letter sounds by the time he entered kindergarten because he was a speech student due to a genetic tongue thrust that caused a mild lisp. Because of this, and the fact that he could remember and recite poems the first time he heard them (a skill that is one of the markers for a reading disability), his learning disability was compensated for by his strengths until he was in the second grade. That was when he was finally identified as having a form of dyslexia, or as stated on his IEP, a nonspecific learning disorder. It is not politically correct to use the term dyslexia on IEPs in the state of California, which is where he was identified. He was and is an excellent listener and could correctly answer all the teacherâs questions during group discussions. But he could not read the tests, they had to be read to him by the resource teacher, and he was placed in a pullout program for reading. His IEP has been modified as necessary through the years as his needs have changed. He has progressed from one on one testing assistance to small group testing to full inclusion. He earned a perfect score on his Earth Science SOL as an eighth grade advanced science student. According to Jean Stropp, this young man may be successful because he had support consistently and early in his school career (Stropp, 2002).
This young man is now a 16 year old gifted vocalist and musician currently taking 8 high school classes as a dual strand sophomore in a Performing Arts Academy Program in Virginia Beach. Some of his classes are  Algebra II/Trig, Chemistry, Academy Orchestra, Comprehensive Musicianship and the advanced academy chorus, Vox Harmonia. According to Stropp, twice exceptional students face many obstacles to success caused by being gifted and having challenges (2002). With early identification, intervention, guidance, and support, these students can become successful and thrive in a high expectations educational environment.

After outlining some of the major concerns regarding educating gifted students, the question arises of how these issues can be addressed. After outlining some of the major concerns regarding educating gifted students, the question arises of how these issues can be addressed. There are some who will suggest that the best solution is advancing the child ahead in grade level, while those who oppose claim that the student will not necessarily be emotionally and developmentally ready for this advance. Others promote grouping students within the grade level by their academic ability, so they will be in classes with their academic peers. The gifted students will be able to cover the standard material more rapidly and have time to further investigate topics of interest to the students. At the same time, the slower learners will be able to take the material at their own pace, avoiding the stress of not keeping up, and students of all levels will have the comfort of a classroom environment with other students at their own levels. Opponents to this idea fear that the slower and average students will feel bad for not being in the gifted class. A third option is to have an extra program in addition to the normal school day for the gifted students. However, this type of program would not be able to meet frequently, being limited to either during the school day, causing the students to miss instructional time, or after school, which eliminates students who do not have transportation. Some schools unfortunately do not offer any type of gifted education program. However, it is doubtful that any school would be permitted to operate without a Special Education program. In conclusion, due to the specific needs of gifted students, it is up to every school system to make proper accommodations for these students to make sure that they, like every other student, reach their full academic and developmental potential.

'''&lt;font color=&quot;#736AFF&quot; face=&quot;Segoe Print&quot;&gt;Mini-Quiz: Can you recognize your gifted students?&lt;/font&gt;'''


Clues that a student in your classroom is gifted can emerge in a variety of ways. Choose whether in the following scenarios the student is displaying cognitive, affective, or atypical characteristics of gifted students.


1.   Tommy is in fifth grade. He comes from a broken family, living with his father, who works two jobs, and his three younger sisters. He acts as a second parent in the family, getting his sisters ready for school, making breakfast, and taking care of baths and bedtime. He is a strong leader in the classroom, eager to take on classroom chores, and automatically takes on a leadership role in group projects. Tommy's characteristics are:

     A: Cognitive
     B: Affective
     C: Atypical

2.   Michael, a third grader, has a hard time paying attention to his teacher during class. He is rarely disruptive, but he can hardly bring himself to put down his books about outer space. On library days, he heads straight to the science section, and always chooses a book about the planets, stars, or universe, usually well above his grade level. Michael's characteristics are:

     A: Cognitive
     B: Affective
     C: Atypical

3.   A first grader named Emily is very sensitive to the feelings of the other students in her class. She has an unusual ability to think about others' feelings before her own, and is understanding and kind to everyone. She has a quirky sense of humor, and displays her emotions in a very mature way. Emily's characteristics are:

     A: Cognitive
     B: Affective
     C: Atypical

4.   Rachel is a confident, excited fourth grade student. She always brings her su-do-ku books and logic puzzles to school, solving them rapidly during lunch and recess. She is proud of her work, and confident in her own abilities. Rachel's characteristics are:

     A: Cognitive
     B: Affective
     C: Atypical

5.   Suzanne is in fifth grade, but she can understand her eighth grade sister's math homework. She has abstract thinking skills that far surpass those of her classmates. She learns her classroom material as soon as she sees or hears it and absorbs information like a sponge. Suzanne's characteristics are:

     A: Cognitive
     B: Affective
     C: Atypical

'''Learning Targets'''

*The reader should be able to describe strategies used to provide for the needs of gifted students
*The reader should be able to identify indicators of gifted students
*The reader should be able to name three obstacles that can interfere with accommodating gifted students


=Introduction=

It's easy to neglect the gifted student.  In a classroom of students, battling against learning disorders, behavioral disorders, and even personality disorders, it's easy to forget the gifted one.  He meets his benchmarks, turns in all his work, entertains himself when he's finished his work without disturbing the others.  And then there are those others.  A raging unending war.  All your energy and emotions gone, and almost no difference whatsoever.  Johnny knows not to throw his green crayon at Susy again at least.  Only 63 colors to go.  It's easy to forget the gifted student.  And yet, although he's not crying out desperately for attention, you notice him over the course of a month, maybe just in the back of your mind. He reminds you of something.  The way he slouches lower in his chair each day, looking a little more lifeless as the time passes.  Aha!  The house plants you used to have! That's it!  The ones that you bought the week before you began teaching and haven't had time to water.  Well, no matter, you'll water them in about a month or two, or whenever.  You'll get around to it.


Assuming that gifted students will care for themselves can be a big mistake.  The temptation as a teacher is to put your efforts where they are most obviously needed.  But gifted students, though quiet and unobtrusive, have needs as well.  By failing to understand and meet these needs, teachers not only rob the gifted student of fair treatment, but the class and themselves of the potential motivation and energy that incorporating that child could bring.  But is it fair that he receives special attention when he's doing so well?  How is he different from his peers?  What needs does he have that one can reasonably accommodate?  Hopefully, by looking deeper into these questions, a foundation can be laid for the uniqueness and importance of the gifted child within today's classroom.

=Understanding Giftedness=

The first step in discussing the needs of gifted children is providing a basis for giftedness.  To do this, one must understand that there is a limited understanding of what is considered gifted, that there is a foundation for enabling giftedness to stand out, and there are specific limits for those concepts.


Giftedness is a term that lends itself to broad personal interpretation.  And within this ambiguity, many are temped to call everyone gifted, thereby enabling those who posses extraordinary potential to be swept under the rug of uniformity.  The problem arises because giftedness is not a black and white issue.  It is easy to recognize that many brilliant and talented individuals fail to meet their capacity to achieve. Are they still gifted?  What about the people who have little natural ability, but because of their efforts and perseverance become far more than anyone could have imagined?  What about the person who excels far above his peers in art, but fails to do so in math or English?  Against what standard is a person measured, and how should they be measured?  No test could possibly be so accurate as to identify giftedness with no room for doubt.  But simply because there is no perfect way to establish giftedness does not mean that we should declare all people equally capable.  The purpose of establishing a limited understanding of giftedness is to enable us to study and accommodate the needs of individuals within that group.


A compromise is reached within these difficulties where giftedness is determined by how an individual does as compared to his peers in individual areas, either in testing or by the observations of those above them.  By identifying giftedness in this way, it provides some objectivity, taking into account both effort and potential, and allowing for excellence both broadly and narrowly.  The observations of those above them helps to catch individuals that posses talent but have not or are not able to apply it in common assessments.


After identifying these individuals, it often becomes questionable as to whether they should receive accommodations within their education beyond that of any other child.  But just as a child who possesses certain disabilities needs special accommodations to reach his full potential as a member of society, gifted children also need to be enabled so that they can fulfill their part within the community.  By doing this, society does not have to hold back the peers of the gifted, but rather has the opportunity to provide an environment where excellence is held high and all are encouraged to push themselves to the limit of what they can become.


However, conceding that some are gifted and should be accommodated, there are some important points to make so that these ideas are not abused.  Gifted students should not be accommodated to an extent that their benefits come at the expense of the students as a whole.  Providing for the needs of gifted students is not based on the idea that they are more important than other students, but rather that they share equal importance.  And though there is a limited group specifically identified as gifted, it does not mean that other students should be clumped into a group lacking the ability to excel.  The instructor should recognize what strategies would benefit each student, gifted or not, and apply them in such a way to help them reach their maximum potential.  To reemphasize this important point, this article is written in such a way as to put a magnifying glass upon the gifted child.  This should not be taken to mean that that child is a superior human being or more important than his peers, but simply that that child has special needs that differ from his peers.  This article is written so that these needs may be understood and accommodated.

Some cases of giftedness will be obvious.  The student will do well on tests, show good behavior in class, and excel when given the chance.  But other gifted students won't be identified by most people.  They possess potential, but for a variety of reasons have turned it towards being disruptive or have given up trying within the classroom setting.  The first type of student does not need to be examined as closely for one to see that he's gifted.  But the second type takes an observant and unbiased eye.  Why recognize and help the second type of student?  Shouldn't his behavior be worked on first?  When trying to address the behavior issue without addressing one of the root causes of the behavior, the instructor will find the passion and determination of a gifted student fighting against him.  But if instead the instructor chooses to help that student focus his energies towards fulfilling his potential, he will find less resistance in accomplishing his other goal with regard to behavior.  Therefore, learning to identify gifted children is important not only for the sake of the student, but also for the teacher and the classroom as a whole (Heward, 2003).


==Identification and Assessment of Giftedness==

Depending of the state and institution educators work within, there will probably be a process set up for identifying gifted individuals.  It is important to be familiar with this system, but educators can also benefit by going beyond it and realizing that not all giftedness will be recognized by a mainstreamed system.  These processes often include group and individualized tests, achievement tests, a portfolio containing the student's work, nominations by various individuals, and a record of extracurricular and leisure activities.  Once there is a reasonable amount of evidence that the student could be gifted, a case study may be done, which could include special testing, interview sessions, and observations among other things.  If a student is deemed gifted, an IEP is developed to accommodate his special needs (Heward, 2003).


Seeing that it is an important task, how can one learn to identify the more difficult of these students?  One of the first steps is to try and examine the child without bias.  Apart from negative behavior, does he exhibit signs of above normal intelligence?  When he is confronted with a task that is interesting to him, does he perform in a gifted capacity?  Does his speech often exhibit original thought or creative use of vocabulary?  These are just a few questions to ask oneself.  But by creating questions and asking them objectively, one can help account for biases and identify these students.  The next step is to identify the student's areas of strength and weaknesses.  Sometimes students do poorly in a subject area that holds them back from excelling in the ones they are capable in.  A student could do poorly in English and not be able to read the tests well, thereby failing all his other subjects.  Then, identify any social or cultural issues that may be causing the student to underachieve.  Once there is an understanding of the conditions surrounding a student, an instructor can begin taking steps to help correct negative influences so as to put the child back on to the path of fulfilling his potential (Heward, 2003).


=The Special Needs of Gifted Children=

[[Image:CinquiÃ¨mes_fÃ©vrier_2008.jpg|center|500px]]

==Strategies at the Instructor Level==


It is common for gifted students to be taken for granted.  Because they excel, they are seen as less needing of special efforts to motivate them to do more.  As a result, gifted students are forced to accept what is left over after other students have had their fill.  This problem has only been accentuated by the No Child Left Behind program.  The neglect of the needs of gifted children flows mostly out of the misconception that by helping them the teacher would be required to take time from the instruction of other students.  In reality, if done well, time spent on specialized instruction for the gifted will enhance the classroom as a whole and in some cases even help to reduce the overall load on the teacher.  Experiencing a successful and energetic class excited about learning also has a profound effect upon the instructor's moral.  The short and long term benefits of providing for the need of gifted children, though often overlooked, far outweighs the initial effort required by educators.  Compiled below are strategies and concepts that other educators have found helpful in changing the shape of their classrooms.


===Instructional Strategies===

'''Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation in Gifted Students'''

Gifted students can be broken into 2 main groups, those that are mostly intrinsically motivated and those that are extrinsically motivated.  Intrinsically motivated gifted students are driven by an internal motivation and enjoy learning for the personal satisfaction that it brings.  They often exhibit independence, non-competitiveness, and prefer self-directed learning  (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006).  Extrinsically motivated gifted students are motivated by external motivations and learn because they will be rewarded or punished.  They often exhibit competitiveness, dependence upon other students, and prefer teacher directed learning.  It is important to recognize these traits and take them into account when deciding how best to motivate gifted students. (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006)


'''Goal Oriented Learning'''

Gifted students need a sense that their learning has purpose .  Introducing course materials within a framework of its importance to future concepts and real-life applications gives significance to the material (Cleaver, 2008).  And on an individual basis, by counseling gifted students so that they are thinking about the future, such as career and life goals, can give them a sense of working toward a definite end product.  In fact, because many gifted students possess strengths in almost every area, a trait called multipotentiality, they are often overwhelmed by an array of future career choice (Achter ''et al.'', 1996).  As a result, they often fail to develop their long-term goals into a concrete plan.  With a little guidance, they can be helped along in their career/decision making process (Achter ''et al.'', 1996).  And this can have results in their overall motivation to strive in learning.


'''Choosing to Learn'''

Although students often need to complete a standard set of coursework for school assessment purposes, students can still be given a sense of self-choice in deciding what work they will do.  This sense of choice and independence can provide motivation for regular and gifted students alike (Cleaver, 2008).  It is important to note, however, that there do need to be boundaries and suggestions to keep students from becoming overwhelmed by too much freedom.  But by giving students choice, it allows them to set more challenging goals for themselves and to choose topics that interest them (Cleaver, 2008).


'''Above and Beyond'''

Gifted students learn quickly and easily (Thomas, 1976).  If the material moves slow and fails to engage their attention, they will likely become bored and unmotivated (Hoekman ''et al.'', 1998).  One result is that they tend to ignore class instruction they already think they know.  By interjecting questions that require students to analyze and give critical thinking responses to the material, it is possible to keep the attention of those who would otherwise end up bored and distracted (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006).  Students can be encouraged to dig deeper into topics, a concept known as enrichment, so that they can remain engaged with the material being taught while still satisfying their hunger for learning (Heward, 2003).  Since they tend to complete work quickly, many opportunities occur where you can give them assignments that accomplish this goal (Cleaver, 2008).  These extensions from the curriculum are not only beneficial for keeping them engaged, but if handled well, can lead to valuable contributions to class discussions and the learning experience of others.


'''Class Leaders'''

When bored, gifted students can hinder the learning process.  But if properly utilized, they can be a valuable asset.  Gifted students often have a strong desire to help their peers (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006).  If paired properly, they can provide tutoring to other students that provide a basis for friendships, helping their emotional/social needs as well as taking the burden off of the teacher.  They are also able to enhance and encourage class discussions, provide motivation for other students, and bring enthusiasm to subject matter.  Don't be afraid to find ways to bring gifted students into your team, so to speak.  But be cautious not to lift them above their peers in a way that produces jealousy (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006).


'''Seeing What Works'''
A large portion of learning to work with gifted students is learning what works best with different individuals and the classroom as a whole.  I think giving a pretest and benchmark tests that have no bearing on grades is a safe way for the students and the teacher to see not only that students understand the course material, but also to see on an individual level if students are reaching their maximum potential.  Getting feedback is key to learning how to be successful in dealing with the specialized needs of students (Heward, 2003).


===Creating the Right Environment===

Creating a classroom environment conductive to learning will greatly enhance any strategies employed.  It is important that learning, and even more so excelling, is encouraged and rewarded (Cleaver, 2008).  But it is important that this encouragement is not done on a comparative basis that might cause resentment.  Even competition can be done is such a way as to encourage those needed extrinsic motivation without making the losers feel like they are less than the winners.  All efforts, not merely success, should be encouraged often and genuinely.  Every student has unique abilities that can be encouraged, even if they are not academically assessed.  The classroom atmosphere should be one that not only allows students to go beyond the course material required, but one that encourages and inspires it as a goal for all students (Cleaver, 2008).  This is not unique to gifted students, but is worth mentioning considering its implications.  If doing above average in a classroom will cost a student emotionally and socially, most will at least think twice before putting themselves at risk in these areas (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006).


===Social/Emotional Considerations===

[[Image:Teacher.jpg|225px|left]]
Because of their higher abilities, gifted students often experience greater stress and anxiety in certain areas than their peers do.  Teachers and parents can overwhelm gifted students with high expectations for success (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006).  This can result in a fear of failure, causing these students to shield themselves from taking intellectual risks.  The fear of isolation and bullying by their peers can also have a negative effect on their motivation, as well as their social/emotional well being.  Sometimes they develop defense mechanisms against this type of attack that encourages even more later.  In some cases they fit into a group where they have a sense of belonging, but their giftedness is unpopular so they dumb themselves down and take on characteristics that are more socially acceptable.  In all these cases, the instructor must learn to recognize signs of anxiety and intervene.  This may involve changing how expectations are being presented to the student, counseling, modifying the classroom environment, or talking with parents.  But if left unaddressed, these issues could blossom into long term behavioral patterns (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006).

==Strategies at the Administrative Level==

After discussing in length what strategies the instructor is able to employ, it is important to consider what is possible at the administrative level.  There are a variety of programming options, that range from leaving the child in the classroom but providing extra assistance to sending them to completely separate schools.


'''Consultant Teacher Program'''

This option leaves the gifted students in with the regular students but provides a special consultant teacher to help the normal teacher in providing differentiated instruction.  The benefit of this type of program is that it helps the student to develop varied social interactions.  The drawback is that the student often does not receive as much specialized instruction as they need (Gallagher, 1985).


'''Resource Room/Pullout Program'''

Gifted students are regularly pulled out of the classroom and sent to a place where they are taught by specially trained teachers.  The benefit of this program is that it provides a good amount of specialized instruction for the student.  The drawback is that it makes the student stand out among his peers in a way that can promote jealousy (Gallagher, 1985).


'''Community Mentor Program'''

This program involves connecting the students with selected members of the community for an extended period to focus on a special topic of interest to the student.  The benefits of this program are that it can be highly individualized and leaves the student ith his peers.  The drawbacks are that it does little to change the student's situation within the classroom setting (Gallagher, 1985).


'''Independent Study Program'''

Students are allowed to pursue independent study projects supervised by qualified adults.  The benefits are that this helps develop responsibility and does not require the student to be removed from his peers.  The downsides are that not all students benefit from this type of program and that it can make the student stand out among his peers if not handled well (Gallagher, 1985).


'''Special Class'''

In this option gifted students are grouped into a classroom taught by a specially trained teacher.  The benefit is that specialized instruction is provided to the degree that the student needs.  The downside is that the students do not receive as broad of a variety of social interactions as they could otherwise (Gallagher, 1985).


'''Special School'''

Schools are set up that consist of only the gifted in this option.  The benefit is that this environment is highly capable of providing for the intellectual needs of the student.  The drawbacks are that students do not receive as varied social interactions as they could as well as providing more opportunities for intellectual failure because of the higher level of competition among peers (Gallagher, 1985).


==Obstacles to Enabling Gifted Children==

===The Dangers of Standardization===

Standardization has become a major issue in education.  With the No Child Left Behind program underway, teachers find themselves under pressure to get all students to meet benchmark test scores (Apple, 2007).  The problem is not the idea of the program in and of itself, but that by putting such concentration upon minimum scores, gifted students, who are well above that line, are the first to be ignored.  But apart from the No Child Left Behind program, there are other issues related to standardization.  Many schools still offer no alternatives to grade specific curriculum, which assumes that all students in a certain grade need to learn the exact same material (Heward, 2003).  Standardization can also apply not only to students but to teachers.  Although not a requirement, it seems to me that there is often an expectation that teachers are to perform within certain guidelines that can limit their potential effectiveness.  This is not so much a spoken rule as it is something that flows down from administrative boards .


===The Failures of Past Neglect===

When gifted students have been left uncared for by previous teachers, they can become demotivated towards learning or develop behavioral problems.  This can lead to them not being recognized as gifted by other teachers, the new behaviors being much more prominent and the giftedness more dormant.  It takes a good deal more effort and patience to work with gifted children who have lapsed into these negative behavioral patterns.  It is not uncommon for them to be left in that state until they reach the age where they can and do drop out of school indefinitely (Phillips ''et al.'', 2006).  Children who were born with the potential to be highly productive members of society slip through the cracks and are left to continue down an unpromising path.  It is very important that when a teacher recognizes symptoms leading in this direction they take action to do what they can to prevent this loss.


===Cultural/Social Difficulties===

All people need a sense of belonging among their peers.  This need for acceptance often conflicts with gifted students pursuing their full potential.  It can come in the form of peer pressure, bullying, loneliness, and in countless other ways.  Sometimes students receive pressure to underachieve not through their peers but from home.  Parents or siblings can create pressure to lower their personal standards.  The family could encourage a child to pursue a technical track in high school instead of the college track because of a fear of college expenses.  The family could possess prejudices against their child trying to be accomplish things they failed to do.  Siblings can become jealous when the gifted student receives praise from his parents (Phillip ''et al.'', 2006).  Although a teacher can never fully prevent these kinds of conflict, reasonable efforts should be made to limit the interference created by them.

=Conclusion=

Gifted Students are an important and necessary part of the classroom that should not be neglected.  By understanding giftedness and identifying those who posses it, one can begin to provide for and utilize the student as part of a flourishing educational environment.  And when an understanding of the needs and abilities of one's students is thrown together with some classroom experience and a little creativity, it won't be long before a class is saturated with motivation and success.

&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;''By Sharon Manana&lt;/font&gt;


'''Introduction'''


&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Now more than ever, students have become progressively more infused with the use of technological advances both in the home and at school.  In fact, a study by the Kaiser Foundation found that the typical 8-18 year-old lives in a home with 3.6 CD or tape players, 3.5 TVs, 3.3 radios, 2.9 VCRs/DVD players, 2.1 video game consoles, and 1.5 computers (Rideout, Roberts, &amp; Ulla, 2005). As teachers, we can integrate technology in our curriculums and utilize these devices as a source for learning.  Podcasting is commonly used as one such medium since educators use them to convey complex information for material that would be less interesting if it appeared in print (Villano, 2008, p. 2). With each passing day, teachers are changing their teaching methods as technology advances beyond the use of chalk and into the era of Power points. This benefits the students because technology integration has popularized itself as an innovative way to learn while keeping the students actively engaged. Furthermore, student interaction and discussion groups are other non-traditional approaches to teaching. The following sections will cover the various ways of teaching in the classroom with the help of technology integration, student interaction, and discussion groups. &lt;/font&gt;


=== Facts ===


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;The Kaiser Foundation also conducted several studies about how much media the majority of U.S. teenagers use.  The results were as follows:

&lt;table border=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;The Youth and Media&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Statistics&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Uses the Internet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;87%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Hours a day playing video games&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Uses the Internet at school&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;78%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Downloads music from the Internet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;64%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Uses Instant Messaging&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;66%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Have a cell phone&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Have created a personal Web Site or Web Page&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Have an MP3 player&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Have a hand held device that connects to the Internet&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13% &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt; 

&lt;/font&gt;
(Rideout, Roberts, &amp; Ulla, 2005).

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;These are not surprising results considering the average student listens to their iPod while text messaging, navigating the Internet, watching television, and doing homework(Rideout, Roberts, &amp; Ulla, 2005). Although technology used in this sense has been characterized as distractions by some, it can also be a means for us as teachers to stay connected with our students, while helping them learn.&lt;/font&gt;

===Out with the Chalk, In with the... Technology?===

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;

This is a clip about some students' views on the importance of technology and the reasons why teachers should welcome it. http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=b5c8973ade16764156be
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;For many years, teachers have had rows of students, chalkboards, and red apples on their nicely organized desks. Times have changed and instead of the student asking the teacher where Samoa is located, the student can easily navigate the Internet to find its geographical setting, governmental structure, history, and population capacity. Some teachers are adamant about not changing the way they teach primarily because students are relying more on technology and less on teachers (Teacher, 2005). For this reason, manufacturers like Apple and Microsoft are working with educators to make technology advantageous for everyone. Power points, iPods, and podcasts are some of the technological aids teachers use to help their students learn (Hitlin, Lenhart, &amp; Madden, 2005). Teachers are slowly straying away from primitive methods of teaching and have turned to alternative techniques. For example, instead of passing out handouts in classrooms, teachers save paper by posting the handouts on Blackboard, even making it accessible for the students who missed class. Even teachers who are not accustomed to using Blackboard as a teaching tool, have agreed that it is convenient (Teacher, 2005). As the world vastly advances in the Digital Age, it is our job as teachers to keep up with the times by erasing the chalk marks and using the laser pointers.&lt;/font&gt;

===The &quot;T&quot; Word===



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #;

border: solid 10px #800080; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;###408080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt; '''&quot;It's much more important to give teachers a 

'''sense of the range of possible uses of technology and where any given technology activity may lie in 

'''that continuum&quot; (Bledsoe, 2008).''''' &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Technology integration in schools has become a common phenomenon.  It means, &quot;Using computers effectively and efficiently in the general content areas to allow students to learn how to apply computer skills in meaningful ways.&quot;(Holland, 2005). Teachers are now using iPods for testing, podcasts for lectures, and Text Messaging for quizzes (Carstairs, M., 2007). A couple of years ago, these devices would be the reason teachers said, &quot;Power Down,&quot; as students walked into classrooms but as of late, those two words are losing their significance. Research indicates that technology integration is a ground-breaking and exciting way to teach especially since students have become increasingly involved in their learning process(Holland, 2005). Also, technology integration has made learning a global enterprise for both counterparts, the student and teacher. A student in Japan can communicate with their teacher in Hawaii via Instant Messaging, a webcam, or even a cell phone. This is one of the remarkable ways students and teachers can stay connected. Technology integration has molded teaching into a simplified process and made learning an experience for academic success. Despite the praise it receives from both the student and the teacher, technology integration has confounded with the recipients of the Digital Age(The Children's Partnership, 2000). &lt;/font&gt;

===The Downside to Technology===


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt; Unlike students, adapting to technology is not an innate trait for most teachers.  In fact, some teachers are required to take courses to familiarize themselves with technological terms, the use of computers--software and hardware, the World Wide Web, Microsoft Word, Excel, Power point, etc. (Holland, 2005). The Digital Divide doesn't just apply to low-income households, foreign-born people, and the under-educated; it also encompasses the wide gap between student and teacher (The Children's Partnership, 2000). Because of this partition, many teachers have become oblivious to the ways in which students &quot;beat the system.&quot; A prime example of this stupor is cheating. It has always been education's malignancy and every teacher's worst nightmare.  For centuries, students have come up with multiple ways to double-cross the educational system and the use of technology has made cheating even easier. Rebecca Boone wrote a compelling article about one of the ways in which students use technology to cheat; iPods. Teachers who confiscated iPods have found answers to tests embedded in song lyrics, while others were recorded as part of the songs. The growing number of students' cheating caused some schools to ban the devices first in classrooms, then on school grounds (Boone,2007). &quot;With ESL English, some astute students use cell phones for 'dictionaries', and the situation does occur when a student says 'dictionary' when seen texting&quot; (Carstairs, 2007). In incidents like this, the student texts to get the answer to a question and since the teacher is unaware of how manipulative some technology is, they wont know that the student is cheating. It is equally imperative for teachers as well as students to familiarize themselves with technologies' capabilities so that any exploitation in the educational system can straightforwardly be avoided. &lt;/font&gt;

===Remain Mundane Or Divert to the Digital Age?===


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Incorporating technology in one's curriculum is not mandatory for teachers but it is unquestionably beneficial for students. It is our job as teachers to prepare students for the future and real life experiences. Technology is an immense part for both aspects and for us to shun away from the idea is fundamentally unwise. Some teachers find technology undeniably difficult to use and that is understandable (Teacher, 2005). It is not by any means an easy task to grasp every part of technology but even the diminutive steps count toward a greater feat. Most teachers today have practiced the use of Power point in lectures as opposed to having their backs to the classroom as they fervently write on the chalkboard (Holland, 2005). For the most part, technology can make teaching pleasurable for both the student and the teacher but it is up to the teacher to make the first move; they can remain mundane in their teaching tactics or divert to the digital age. Ultimately, the goal is to teach the student in a way that is efficient, effective, and advantageous. &lt;/font&gt;

===Supplementary Ways to Teach===


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt; The use of technology is certainly a great way to teach but other methods have proven to be just as superior. Research shows that student interaction and group discussions are other resourceful ways for students to learn (Picciano, 2002). This may be because of the peer-to-peer understanding students have with each other that they would not otherwise have with their teacher. Levels of competence, assessments, and difficulty are readily shared between students moreso than with their teachers.  For this reason, when students learn from each other and discuss their findings, teachers are no longer confined to the traditional way of teaching but broaden the students' potential in terms of what they can contribute to the classrooms' learning experience (Hitlin, Lenhart, &amp; Madden, 2005). In-person discussion boards or the ones found on Blackboard.com encompass the notion of student interaction on a couple of levels. For one, they encourage students to talk amongst themselves and rarely involve the teacher's input. They also promote social skills required in most real-life situations thus preparing the student for life after school(Picciano, 2002).&lt;/font&gt;



===Summary===



&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;The amount of time students spend with the media and technology has grown immensely over the years (Rideout, Roberts, &amp; Ulla, 2005). Teachers are no longer limited to one way of teaching their students and can simply incorporate the use of technology in their everyday learning. Also, student interaction and discussion groups are two different ways students can learn without necessarily following the traditional guidelines of what a typical classroom would look like; this refers to a teacher lecturing for a long period of time without any student input (Picciano, 2002). The use of all three teaching techniques make learning an efficient, effective, and advantageous way for students to learn. On the other hand, the use of technology in classrooms can be an arduous and time-consuming task but the benefits are well worth the efforts (Holland, 2005). Teachers are not required to use any alternative teaching methods in their current curriculums but students would appreciate new and creative ways to learn in order to be successful both in and out of school.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;center&gt;âI'm not changing how I teach&quot;: The Effects of Educational Reform in the Classroom&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;By&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Denise Rembis'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;




'''Learning Target'''

Readers should have a better understanding of educational reform and the impact of technology in the classroom on both students and teachers.




=='''Introduction'''==

Why should I change my ways after teaching for twenty five years?   Often at times teachers become set in their ways.  Letâs face it; we all do when it comes to one thing or another.  Technology is increasingly becoming a huge part of many classrooms in this day and age.  However, some teachers resist computers because they fear that students may know more about their usage than they do.  Younger generations are more in tune with advances in technology and more confident in using the advancements in everyday life.
Education reform can be defined as a plan to bring change about in the way material is presented to students to improve their knowledge and understanding. In many school systems, technology is a means of implementing such change. Studies have shown that sixty percent of American homes with children ages 8 to 17 have computers and most of these computers are connected to the Internet. (Wartella &amp; Jennings, 2000)  Introducing new forms of technology to children has long been debated.  Even when television and movies were introduced in the household, children were exposed to different things they were not normally used to seeing.  Even today, there are many skeptics who question the importance of implementing technology in the classroom.

'''&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;center&gt; &lt;center&gt;''âThey may forget what you said but they will never forget the way you made them feel.â  (Anonymous)''&lt;/center&gt;
 &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=='''Cognitive Development and Learning'''==

Cognitive development is the improvement of the thought and learning process throughout the various stages of growth and development.  When children reach certain developmental milestones they gain a better understanding of the messages that are being sent through various outputs.  Research on children's learning shows that the extent of interactivity involved in an experience with media may affect the learning process.  (Wartella and Jennings, 2000)  In today's world, advances have made such a breakthrough that companies even produce computers, cameras, and MP3 players for small children.  By introduction at such a small age, children are exposed to the mechanics of electronic devices and are able to better utilize the learning potential these devices have to offer, such as playing interactive games on a computer, taking digital photos or listening to musical songs to learn their ABCs.


=='''From the â3 Râsâ to the â5 Eâsâ'''==
:'''â¢ Reading â &quot;Exposing Knowledge&quot;'''
:'''â¢ Aritmetic â &quot;Employing Information&quot;'''
:'''â¢ Writing â &quot;Expressing Ideas Compellingly&quot;'''
:'''â¢ &quot;Ethics&quot;'''

In todayâs society, many educators are trying to keep up with the constant changes.  Some have even gone as far as to forget about the Reading, Writing and Arithmetic standards and bring them a little bit more up to speed.  The Traditional 3 Râs can be evolved into the 4Eâs to define standards for a more information literacy based world. (Armstrong and Warlick, 2004)

Reading has traditionally been taught through through student exposure.  Prior to the era of the Internet, being âliterateâ was defined as being able to read and comprehend the text. With the Internet being the most prevalent source of information, reading has now come to be known as âexposing knowledge.â  In a world where anything can be published on the Internet, students need to learn to determine which information is fact and which information is fiction.  Since the Internet has become the most prevalent source of information in todayâs world, reading is now known as âexposing knowledge.  (Armstrong and Warlick, 2004)  In order to find the most up to date and relevant information, students must apply all three of these strategies.

Traditionally, numbers were used as a way of measuring one thing or another, but now arithmetic has been changed to âemploying information.â  Just about everything is referenced in numbers, whether it is a measurement or actual code.  Computers are used to interpret these numbers. âIt becomes just as important to be able to use a computer to process the invisible numbers behind images, audio, and video content as it is to be able to add, subtract, measure, count, and calculate the visible numbers.â (Armstrong and Warlick, 2004) Basic math skills have not been lost or transferred; computers aid in the processing of numbers and media such as digital cameras or MP3 players.

While writing is still a core part of education, it can now be done in other ways besides using just words.  In the 4 Eâs, writing is now âexpressing ideas compellingly.â  What this means is that students can express themselves using pictures or sounds rather than just a pencil and paper. Students probably find this easier, perhaps motivating in that the formats presented are the ones that they already have considerable experience with.

The last part of the 4 Eâs is âethics.â  Due to the fact that anything can be placed in cyberspace by anybody, students need to learn to determine whether the information found on the Internet is acceptable or unacceptable.  Also, students need to realize that there is a right and wrong way to utilize the information found.   It becomes easy to copy and paste information.  Giving credit where credit is due is very important when using the internet as a source of information.  Students need to be taught to use information in an ethical manner.  Another lesson that needs to be taught is to find out how reliable is the information being used.  Double checking sources and accuracy of data is very important.  Learning to rely too much on the internet can also be costly; information and websites can change rapidly and sources can become obsolete.  Technology can break down and be inaccessible at critical moments (for example, on the night when a paper is due at midnight!).  Making sure to back up data and have back up sources is also important when using technology.

=='''Technology and Educational Reform'''==
Technology, just as it does in everyday life, plays a big role in education reform.  Learning becomes more hands on and allows for more interaction among students.  In changing methods from traditional teaching, students and teachers receive new roles in the classroom.  Students might end up helping teachers more than they have in the past with utilizing their computer skills.  The use of technology in the classroom also helps more with skills outside of the classroom.  


=='''Effects on Students'''==
According to the U.S. Department of Education educational reform has a number of effects on students:  


:â¢	Change in Student and Teacher Roles due to students being more comfortable with technology than the teachers. 

:â¢	Increased Motivation and Self Esteem because they better understand how the material is being presented. 

:â¢	Technical Skills since students are using technology that can be applied outside of the classroom.

:â¢	Accomplishment of More Complex Tasks because they are not only learning the material presented, but also how to use different means of technology.

:â¢	More Collaboration with Peers because there may be limited resources so they need to share or simply because they learn that they have more in common.

:â¢	Increased Use of Outside Resources since they are using instruments they are familiar with outside of the classroom. 

:â¢	Improved Design Skills/Attention to Audience 
(U.S. Department of Education, 2000)


=='''Effects on Teachers'''==
Technology-supported education reform efforts for teachers led an increase in their involvement in professional activities. (U.S. Department of Education, 2000)  Some of these activities were: 

:â¢	Grant writing to request more implementations. 

:â¢	Training in technology use because in order to teach it they must be at least somewhat familiar with it. 

:â¢	Greater access to technology for own use because they are becoming increasingly more comfortable with it.

:â¢	Collaborations with outside researchers to learn more ways to implement different resources in the classroom.

:â¢	Increased role in school decision making by deciding what may or may not be appropriate in the classroom.

:â¢	Collaborations with software developers to develop software that is more in tune to what they are teaching.

:â¢	Increased Collaboration Among Teachers Within the School by working together to devise new lesson plans that are on the same level.

:â¢	Increased Interaction with External Collaborators and Resources to learn what has been effective in other classrooms with technology.

:â¢	Professional Growth due to the fact that they are forced to learn more about such resources.
(U.S. Department of Education, 2000)


=='''Technology in the Classroom'''==

The U.S. Department of Education also noted that technology in the Classroom helps to:

:â¢	Support thinking processes because it involves more than just learning the material, but also how to use the technology.

:â¢	Stimulate motivation and self esteem because students use these resources outside of the classroom and are more confident in using them.

:â¢	Promote equity since teachers are impartial.

:â¢	Prepare students for the future because they are using resources that will be used later in life.

:â¢	Support changes in school structure by allowing more means of learning to be implemented.

:â¢	Explore technology capabilities by learning how things that are used outside of the classroom can be used in the classroom.
(U.S. Department of Education, 2000)

&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt;



In the early 1980s, the National Commission on Excellence in Education issued a report card for the public schools of the United States that showed a sharp decline in studentsâ achievement scores (Noll, 2005).  As a response to the news that the United Sates was no longer a leading country in preparing its youth for the future, educational reforms were initiated in many public school districts.  Magnet schools and charter schools were two approaches that stirred excitement among parents and many educators.  Exactly what are these alternative forms of education termed magnet and charter schools?  Who is allowed to attend magnet and charter schools?  What do proponents and critics say about magnet and charter schools?  According to the research, how to magnet and charter schools compare with traditional public schools and what are the implications of the research findings for parents and teachers?



&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''What is a magnet school?'''&lt;/font&gt;

A magnet school is designed to do just what its name suggests:  attract students.  
Within any student population, there are children with a variety of interests and career aspirations.  Magnet schools offer specialized curriculums that appeal to particular student groups, such as young people who want to study in depth such areas as foreign languages, drama, computer technology, or advanced sciences.  These schools are under the umbrella of a larger school district and may even be housed in an existing school that also offers a traditional curriculum (Villaverde, 2003).  Magnet schools receive at least part of their funding from the sponsoring public school district.  In addition, because magnet schools can assist in attracting racially mixed student populations from different socio-economic backgrounds, federal government grants related to desegregation are available to help support the costs of some schools (Villaverde, 2003).


&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''Who is allowed to attend a magnet school?'''&lt;/font&gt;

The student population of magnet schools can be chosen in more than one way.  The enrollment process often begins with the parents of an interested student filling out an application.  Some districts choose students solely on the basis of a lottery that includes applicants from different income levels, neighborhoods, ethnic backgrounds, gender, and races.  Other districts also have application requirements related to minimum academic achievement levels.  Parents list their first, second, and third choice for magnet school attendance on their applications.  Waiting lists are compiled for those students who do not receive immediate placement.  With these restrictions, free choice is more accurately termed controlled choice (Archbald, 2004).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''What is a charter school?'''&lt;/font&gt;

A charter school is a âpublicly funded school that is typically governed by a group or organization under a contract or charter with the stateâ¦In return for funding and autonomy, the charter school must meet accountability standardsâ (National Center for Education Statistics, 2007, par.2).  The charters list the schoolâs goals, details about the programs offered, specifics about student body selection, and the criteria that will be used for assessment (Buckley and Schneider, 2007).  The charters have time constraints that typically range from three to five years.  At the end of that time period, the charter-granting overseers, such as state officials, make a continuance decision based on how the terms of the charter have been met.  A charter school may be founded by teachers or administrators within a school district, by a group of parents, or even by a private or community organization.  Federal grants are available to assist with the initial costs, and funds also come from the school districts whose students are being served by the charter school (Peterson, 2003).  Like magnet schools, most charter schools are focused on providing more effective, innovative programs than parents are offered in traditional public schools (Buckley and Schneider, 2007).



&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''Who is allowed to attend a charter school?'''&lt;/font&gt;

Since charter schools receive state and federal funding, they need to meet the same diversity requirements as public schools and âreflect the social/ethnic makeup of their districtâ (Noll, 2005, p.226).  There is an application process that may require meeting certain other criteria, such as passing an audition if the charter school has a curriculum that emphasizes theatrical arts.  Many schools have no restrictions and often choose the student population on the basis of lottery outcomes.  Using the lottery is a way to fairly decide who gains admittance to these schools with much smaller enrollments than most public schools (Noll, 2005).

&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''What do proponents say about magnet and charter schools?'''&lt;/font&gt;


1.  Proponents of magnet and charter schools believe that these schools provide much-desired options for parents who are dissatisfied with the job that public schools are doing.  Magnet and charter schools are especially appealing to those parents whose children are from lower socio-economic backgrounds and have been placed in schools with below average achievement statistics (Peterson 2003).


2.  Magnet and charter schools encourage competition and make public schools more aware of and more involved in improving their curriculums, teachersâ performance, and administration procedures (Villaverde, 2003).


3.  When compared with most traditional public schools, both magnet and charter schools offer better student-teacher ratios and smaller, more personal school environments that help prevent student dropouts and capitalize on studentsâ interests (Noll 2005).

'''The director of the organization
called Friends of Choice in Urban Schools 
stated about alternative schools that 
they âprovide choices for parents, 
opportunities for teachers, and better schooling right now
to some kids, rather than making them wait for yet another 
system-wide overhaulâ
(Buckley and Schneider, 2007, p. 285).
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''What do critics say about magnet and charter schools?'''&lt;/font&gt;

1.  These special schools can drain school districtsâ budgets and result in districts having less money to meet the needs of a much larger percentage of students (Peterson, 2003).


2.  Magnet and charter schools have failed to attract diverse student populations that match the composition of the communitiesâ school districts, and the existing diversity requirements are not being enforced (Archbald, 2004).


3.  The average achievement scores of students in magnet and charter schools are not higher than those of traditional public schools (Buckley and Schneider, 2007).


&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''What does the research reveal about magnet and charter schools?'''&lt;/font&gt;

1.  '''Use of public funds and effects on school districts''':  
A Western Michigan University study (1998) concluded that &quot;charter schools may not be living up to their promise of educational innovation and more effective use of public moneyâ (Noll, 2005, p. 227).  An extensive UCLA study of California charter schools (1998) in ten school districts found âno evidence that charter schools can do more with lessâ (Noll, 2005. p. 226).  Marc Bernstein, a New York school district superintendent, explains that when money is taken from public school districts for the operation of charter and magnet schools, âthere are but two choices:  raise taxes or reduce programming.  Either choice has serious consequences for public educationâ (Noll, 2005, p. 228).



2.  '''Diversity of student populations in magnet and charter schools''':  A 2003 study of magnet schools across the nation was reported in ''Sociology of Education''.  The researchers examined the effect of magnet school choice on the socio-economic stratification in school districts with magnet school as compared with the socio-economic stratification in school districts without magnet schools.  The study did not find a positive growth in the socio-economic redistribution of students as a result of offering magnet school choices (Archbald, 2004).  Similar research findings of charter schools were reported earlier in a Minneapolis study (1997) and a Texas study (2002).  The reason for this failure of specialty schools to redistribute students more equitably along socio-economic lines was believed to be due to parentsâ reluctance to have their children bussed long distances and due to parentsâ reluctance to âface the prospect of their child being in a small minorityâ¦parents were likely to sort themselves along racial/ethnic linesâ (Buckley and Schneider, 2007, p. 122).  A 2004 study of magnet schools reported in the ''Journal of Education for Students Placed at Risk'' found that magnet schools did not significantly affect racial and class segregation because many magnet schools have entrance requirements that can only be met by students from higher income areas (Neild, 2004).




3.  '''Achievement''':  Magnet and charter schools typically attract higher achieving students, so it could be predicted that achievement scores of students attending these schools would be higher than students in traditional public schools.  However, a November 2004 report by the National Assessment Governing Board concluded from its testing of elementary students in public school and elementary students in charter schools that the average achievement scores of those students enrolled in charter schools were lower than those students in public schools (National Education Association, 2008).  The UCLA study of seventeen California charter schools (1998), mentioned above, also did not find an increase in academic scores (Noll, 2005).  Finally, in 2006, the Public Policy Institute of California studied the magnet and charter schools in the city of San Diego and concluded that âon the whole, there was no systematic improvement or deterioration in test scores from participating in a choice programâ (Betts and Rice, 2006, p. 184).



&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;'''Conclusion:  What are the considerations for parents and teachers in relation to magnet and charter schools?'''&lt;/font&gt;

There are success stories among the many magnet and charter schools started across the nation, but the overall research findings concerning average achievement levels are not favorable to these school reforms.  Parents may want to consider using their influence to encourage school districts to offer innovative educational programs for all students, rather than creating or encouraging separate schools.  Teachers may need to voice their concerns about the financial resources that are siphoned from the school districts for these unproven schools that serve a small proportion of the communityâs children.  This outflow of tax dollars affects the curriculums that public schools can afford.  Both parents and teachers should be concerned about the fact that specialty schools can further segregate children along racial, socio-economic, and ethnic lines since school choice can often mean choosing to attend a school with students of the same backgrounds.  Rather than creating the diversity that was intended by these school reforms, school choice could actually foster the growth of the very prejudices that a free public education for all was meant to eliminate.

&lt;u&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/u&gt;

The reader should be able to:

1. Understand exactly what charter and magnet schools are, as well as identify their differences and similarities. 

2. Identify how advocates and opponents feel about these alternative schools.

3. Know the names of several charter and magnet schools located in Virginia.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
== A Brief History ==
Charter and magnet schools have been around for about thirty years. They offer choices to parents who are looking for something a bit different from public schools but who can't afford to send their children to expensive private schools. 

Charter schools are defined as non-sectarian public schools that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional public schools (WestEd, 2000). It is said that the term &quot;charter&quot; may have originated in the 1970's when a New England educator suggested that small groups of teachers be given contracts or charters by their local school boards to explore new approaches to teaching. The idea was then publicized and in 1991 Minnesota became the first state to pass charter school laws. Today, charter schools exist in 39 states. 

Magnet schools are defined as public schools that provide specialized curriculums and instructional approaches to attract students from a variety of neighborhoods (ECS, 2009). Magnet schools pride themselves on being racially diverse; they employ lottery systems, first-come-first-serve methods, and application processes to ensure that everyone has an equal chance. They aim to end minority group isolation.   

== Pro's and Con's of Chartering ==
There are many drawbacks and benefits to charter schools. Some of the benefits include:

1. They create choices for parents and students within the public school system (WestEd, 2000). 

2. They provide a system of accountability for results in public education (...). 

3. They encourage innovative teaching practices (...).

4. The competition provided by charter schools forces school districts to improve the performance of their schools in order to attract and retain students and dollars (Education Commission of the States, 2009).

5. Encourage community and parental involvement in public education (WestEd, 2000)

You may be asking yourself, what does this all mean? Well, because charter schools are still considered public schools, anyone can attend. They offer alternatives to parents and students who may be dissatisfied with their local public school systems. They are also an alternative to expensive private schools. The system of accountability means that these schools have to produce results that their students are learning and that the school is meeting academic standards set out in the charter agreement or risk closure. Most charters are granted for three to five years, if the school has shown positive results then the charters are usually renewed. Teachers are also granted a bit more freedom with regards to teaching practices. They do not have to adhere to such a strict curriculum, like many public schools do. This fact alone attracts many teachers to charter schools.  


There are also many opponents to charter schools. They make many valid and interesting points.

1. Because charter schools operate as a business, as well as a learning institution, they are subject to market forces that may eventually force them to close, depriving students of a continuous education (ECS, 2009).

2.Charter schools sometimes segregate students along racial and class lines and fail to adequately serve students with disabilities or limited English proficiency (...).

3. They are bad schools (Maranto, 2007). 

It is true that charter schools can be opened by organizations, corporations, or just some people with some money to spend. (They do have to adhere to the guidelines laid out in the charter contracts.) I can understand how this fact can lead people to believe that their child's educations will be based on whatever these businesses think the students should be learning. This problem can be solved by simple research. Before sending your child to a charter school be sure to check up on the school, teachers, and administrators to insure that the school really has your childs' education in mind. Also because the charters are not subject to the same rules and regulations as regular public schools, there can be instances of racial and social class segregation and discrimination. While this is highly unlikely, research should still be done to ensure there will be no discrimination.  Some schools just fail, whether public or private, magnet or charter. Sometimes there is a lack of funding, lack of attendance, lack of staff, or just a lack of performance. The only reason it looks worse when charter schools fail is that they are forced to close, while regular public schools remain opened. This fact forces charter schools to try their best to produce positive results.

== Pro's and Con's of Magnets ==
Some benefits of magnet schools include:

1. They offer specialized programs that emphasize a consistent theme or method of teaching, they encourage student and teacher commitment (ECS, 2009). 

2. They create alternatives for students who have specific interests or needs.

3. Because students who attend magnet schools are often from outside neighborhoods, they are introduced to new people and can form new relationships (ECS, 2009.

Magnet schools are also public schools. They offer specialized approaches for students who are somewhat advanced. Because magnets are sometimes specialized (arts, science, mathematics, etc.) they are chosen by students who have an interest in these things. Students and parents alike choose magnets because of the personalization of learning programs. They base their curriculums on students needs. Students that attend magnets are often from different neighborhoods around the school itself, this opens up new doors for these students. They meet new friends, teachers, and administrators who may have a significant impact on their lives. They wouldn't have met any of these people if they stayed in public school and only attended schools in their district.


Some oppositions to magnet schools are:

1. The admissions criteria for magnets are selective and sometimes students with poor grades or behavioral problems are not chosen to attend.

2. Low-income and ESL students are underrepresented (ECS 2009).

3. They draw scarce energy and resources away from improving neighborhood schools (ECS, 2009).

It is true that magnet schools do have criteria for selecting their students, usually it is the more advanced children that attend. A child who has had poor grades in the past or who has had repeated  behavioral problems may not be selected. This can lead to those children who are not selected feeling left out. Also studies have shown that children from low-income and English as a second language families tend to be underrepresented in magnet schools (ECS, 2009) . Also, if all of these children are bussed out of their public school districts, it takes away from those public schools. If attendance is down for that public school then the school boards are less likely to give them extra funding and resources. They put more energy into the public schools that have a large student body, so the children at these under-funded public schools could possibly suffer.

A school voucher, also called an education voucher, is a certificate issued by the government by which parents can pay for the education of their children at a school of their choice, rather than the public school to which they are assigned(wikipedia). School vouchers can also be considered scholarships funded by the government, private organizations, or both. These funds are given directly to the family instead of the public schools. Parents then have the choice to choose whatever public or private school they would like their child to attend (Coulson 1998,).

There has been heated controversy on the subject of educational vouchers. There are many variables to be considered. One to be considered is who would receive school vouchers? Is everyone with school aged children eligible or do we target specific groups? There are many plans being proposed as to how to use school vouchers. One being restricting vouchers to private schools that will accept vouchers as full payment and limiting vouchers to low income families, children with disabilities, and those attending substandard schools (McCarthy,2007).





&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''Proponets of School Vouchers'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&quot;  Support for vouchers is highest among African Americans and Hispanics. Within these two groups, supporters outnumber opponents by as much as five to one.&quot; (Howell,2008) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
One of the arguments for school vouchers is that low income families should have the same opportunity to send their children to any school they desire as do wealthy parents (Messerli 2008).Proponents of school vouchers argue that vouchers targeted to low income families more clearly serve the goal of enhancing equal opportunity (Howell, West, &amp; Peterson, 2008). 

Another argument for school vouchers is that through competition  public schools  will be made better (Matus, 2008).Competition between school will increase, thus forcing public schools to be more efficient and public schools will be compelled to teach values such as hard work, respect, and discipline(Messerli,2008). Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize winning economist, argued that school quality would improve with free-market competition as the student and their money would go to good schools and leave the bad ones behind(Boyd,2006). Market pressures will improve education for everyone because incompetent schools will be eliminated(McCarthy,2007).  

Yet, another argument is that private schools would help improve children's values and their academics. Private schools have a certain reputation and a proven history of results. Private schools do not have an accountability to the government, but to the parents of their children. If they do not do well, the parents can remove the children. This kind of dynamic forces the private schools to do better(Messerli,2008). Another factor to consider is that private schools are not bound by the same government regulations as public schools are and can therefore have more flexibility in their teaching methods.(Messerli,2008). Statistically, parents of voucher students are more satisfied with their current schooling than non voucher parents. Parents are more satisfied with the overall school performance in discipline, academics, class sizes, and racial mix(Rouse, Burrow,2009).

One more argument for school vouchers is that it would bring more diversity and equality into the schools(Messerli,2008). Howard Fuller, Ph.D, Director of the Institute for the Transformation of Learning at Marquette University in Wisconsin, states that &quot;we should focus vouchers on poor and working class families who do not have the resources to move if they live in communities where schools do not work, nor do they have the resources to put their children in private schools.&quot;(Boyd,2008) It is true that poor and minority students are limited to their educational choices and are forced to go to failing schools(Boyd,2008). African-American students who participated in the voucher program in New York City Schools Choice Scholarship Program stated that they were more satisfied, the classrooms were more diverse, and they received higher scores on their test compared to students in public schools (Boyd,2008).




 

&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''Opponents of School Vouchers'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;  In the Washington DC Opportunity Scholarship Program the statistics showed that of those who participated:

*65% went to Roman Catholic schools

*17% went to other religious schools

*18% went to non-sectarian schools

(Wolf,Gutman,Puma,etc.,2007) 
 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

One of the arguments against school vouchers is that they violate the 1st Amendment which is the separation of church and state. Most private schools are religious and the majority of school vouchers go to religious schools, therefore, government funding to religious schools violates the 1st Amendment.(Messerli,2008). There have been many court decisions opposing and supporting the inclusion of religious schools. &quot;The central question concerning the legality of state-supported school voucher plans under the U.S. Constitution is whether the inclusion of religious schools violates the First Amendment's establishment clause by allowing government funds to flow to religious institutions. Claims have also been made that free exercise and equal protection rights are abridged if religious schools are excluded from voucher programs that allow nonsectarian private schools to participate.&quot; (McCarthy,2007) The Supreme Court answered that question in 2002 when it upheld the decision in, ''Zelman v. Simmons-Harris''.The Supreme Court decided that the Cleveland Scholarship Program which allowed public funds for private education was neutral in providing choices to families and answered the establishment clause question in 2002(McCarthy,2007). In other words, it was not unconstitutional to provide public funding for religious education if it is the parents choice. However, a state is not required to include secular schools if other private schools are participating (McCarthy,2007). 

Another argument against school vouchers is that public schools will lose their fundings. This would be devastating to schools who are already underfunded. As it is, public schools are underfunded and cannot keep up with the rising cost of books, technology, security, and, salary. To take even more money away would be detrimental(Messerli,2008). Arguments for vouchers are that a &quot;an education voucher system should be no more expensive than the current system as the state (or other public entity) would simply send a voucher check to schools for each participating child rather than to the local public school or district. However, if implemented on a large scale, there may be other, less appreciated costs that would depend critically on the design of the program.&quot; (Rouse, Barrow,2009). What else needs to be kept in mind is how the programs are handled. Who would fund the transportation of children, the record keeping, the monitoring of enrollments and, the handling of voucher disputes when amounts are varied. These factors could actually exceed what is being estimated now and would not make school vouchers &quot;cost-neutral&quot;(Rouse, Barow,2009). 

Yet, another argument against school vouchers is the right for private schools to discriminate. Unlike public schools, private schools are not required by law to accept everyone. Therefore, they could discriminate between who they can accept or make their standards higher to make it harder for certain families to get in (Messerli,2008).

One more argument against school vouchers is ironically the same as the argument for school vouchers. This is that private schools are not accountable to the government. The argument is that private schools do not have to follow that same rules and regulation and teaching methods proposed by the government. This in turn leaves private schools with no accountability to anyone and their performance cannot be monitored (Messerli,2008).


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''Do School Vouchers Work?'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


The jury is still out on whether or not school vouchers improve academics in students. Although there are some reports on successes,the &quot;empirical evidence regarding the impact of vouchers on parent choice, student achievement, and fiscal school management is inconclusive and incomplete&quot; (McCarthy,2007). A report that came out by the Department of Education stated that there were no significant differences in math and reading scores compared with students that were not on a voucher system. This report was focused on the Washington Dc Opportunity Scholarship fund a year later 
(Wolf, Guttman, etc.,2007). Even the longest running voucher programs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin(1990)and Cleveland, Ohio(1990) showed insignificant results when it came to students academic success (McCarthy,2007). 


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''Conclusion'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;



The school voucher debate has been a controversial topic for many years. Both the proponents and opponents carry equally weighted arguments. As to whether these arguments can be adjudicated through data and research remains unclear. The only data we have received is from small samples and it has been inconclusive. It is impossible to know what the data would show with a larger sample and over an extended period of time. Though, it would be interesting to see!

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
==&lt;center&gt;Introduction:History of School Vouchers in America&lt;/center&gt;==
&lt;br&gt;
For years, the debate over private vs. public education has been brewing in American society. Multiple politicians and Americans feel that low-income families are at a disadvantage when it comes to education. Since some parents are unable to afford the payments needed to send their children to private school, they rely on public schools and, on occasion, have felt this hinders their child's education. This hot debate has led to various outcomes, one of the most prominent being educational vouchers.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
School vouchers are money grants issed by the state, that allow students to attend private school when they would  otherwise have to attend public school. Vouchers first appeared in law in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1990, due to demand from Governor Tommy Thompson. Vouchers in Milwaukee were only issued in participating public and private schools and were determined by family income as to how much money a student would receive. Although other programs had been discussed before, Milwaukee was the first to establish it into society. Today, more than 10,000 students are benefiting from the Milwaukee voucher program. Similar programs have been founded in various other states, such as Florida and Utah, since 1990. (Peterson, 2003). 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With the increase of school voucher programs in the United States, another controversy has been &quot;stoking&quot; the fire. Do educational vouchers work? In a recent article published by ''Education Week'', 42% of adults in America were in favor of school vouchers while 56% oppose them(Education Week, 2007). The clear division in opinion should be evaluated in order to concisely and clearly reach a solution. As Kirk Jowers stated on the issue,â My biggest fear is that people will make up their minds on 30-second ads,â therefore calling an understanding of both sides(Norlen, 2007, p.1).

==&lt;center&gt;The Debate &lt;/center&gt;==
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
===&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt;Opponents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/center&gt;===
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Pass,&quot; 52% of Americans proclaim in concern to school voucher programs(''Education Week'', 2007). American opponents are looking at educational vouchers as a way to decrease public school education (McCarthy, 2006). With a strong footing, stated below, opponents are holding their ground and trying to make progress on this running debate.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Vouchers give government funding to religious instituitons(Peterson. P, 2003). This, in return, creates an &quot;entanglement&quot; between church and state. Under the Establishment clause in the U.S. Constitution, there is to be no state religion. With school vouchers, opponent feel this boundary will become to blurry (McCarthy, 2006)
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	 Studies have shown that there is no base for comparison between public and private schools. In the center is a âblack boxâ of unknown information, therefore making it hard for the voucher program to be proven effective. This is created when no clear areas have been established as a reason for &quot;improvement&quot; from the public to the private sector (Wolf, 2006, p.1).
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	âBlaine Amendmentsâ in 37 states outlaw the giving of tax income to any religious institution. These amendments have been a large reason why many states have not instituted voucher programs, allowing opponets to have a law to draw from(Peterson, 2003, p 8-9).
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	The use of vouchers will take money out of the public school systems (Norlen, 2007). By taking students away from the public sector, the tax money granted through vouchers will be dispersed to private schools. In return, limiting the resources available to these schools.
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	The public school systems function well already and do not need reform in the name of school vouchers (Kolbert, 2001).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Opponents are using all these aspects to attack the view of proponents. Through various research studies, no evidence has been found to conclude that private institutions are better than public. This was shown in an experiment conducted by Patrick Wolf, where no real conclusions were drawn on whether voucher granted students received a better education at private institutions. The students were tested on achievement before and after receiving a private school education (Wolf, 2006).  With no real evidence of change and effectiveness, the opponents of school vouchers are holding their ground.

===&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt;Proponents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/center&gt;===
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Hands up&quot; for educational vouchers! In a study conducted by the Center for Educational Reform, 67% of Americans felt that laws should be enacted to allow parents to take their children out of âfailingâ public schools and decide which school they attend. (Kolbert, 2001). With strong research, such as this, proponents of vouchers are speaking out. Research gathered by Kathryn Kolbert, Education Week, and T. Parry give a basic platform of the proponentsâ stance as follows;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Vouchers decrease class size. By dispersing students throughout schools, class sizes are reduced and there is a smaller teacher to student ratio (''Education Week'', 2007).
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Competition between public and private schools is implemented. Both school systems want to gain the support of the voucher so they will increase their resources in order to provide a better curriculum and atmosphere to attract students.(Parry, 1997)

&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Issuing vouchers, allows the parents to be the consumer for their child, therefore, getting them more involved in their educational success. (Kolbert, 2001)
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	By allowing low-income families to send their children to private school, ''Brown vs. the Board of Education'' will be upheld, allowing every child to have an equal educational career. (Kolbert,2001)
&lt;br&gt;
â¢	Voucher programs will put more money back into public school systems since vouchers are issued on income. Since not all of the public school tuition is granted through the voucher the excess will be given back to public schools (Norlen, 2007).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With politicians and economist behind them, proponents of the school voucher system have created a platform for debate.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Court decisions also have helped proponents establish their case. In 1998, a case was brought to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in which charges were filed against the Milwaukee voucher system claiming it broke the Establishment Clause under the U.S. Constitution . It was ruled that giving the option to the parents allowing them to choose a private religious institution for their child was voluntary and constitutional. (Kolbert, 2001, p.18-19) Later in ''Zelman vs. Simmons Harris'' the same claim was addressed in the United States Supreme Court with similar results (Peterson, 2003, p.1). The grounds established from these court cases gives proponents a strong angle on the debate of educational vouchers.

==&lt;center&gt;Conclusion&lt;/center&gt;==
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The battle will continue. There is no boundary on who feels for the issue. Teachers, parents, and politicians are divided on all aspects of the debate. Although politicians are seeking to find an answer to the gap in the education system between the public and private sector, the split over school vouchers is proof that work still needs to be done. In dealing with the issue on school vouchers, there is no wrong or right answer. With more research and compromise, there is hope that one day all students will be able to receive a proper and productive education.

===&lt;center&gt;&lt;u&gt;Personal Response&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/center&gt;===
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take a stance on the debate over school vouchers. Provide a detailed argument and explain how your decision may effect your teaching career.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Personal View: Example'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The debate over school vouchers is hard to predict. Being a future teacher and tax payer, I take the view of the opponents. In today's society there are multiple factors which increase the demand for private schools. Without these factors, public education would improve greatly. The lack of research available to provide a claim for vouchers is more reason to increase public school funding which will later improve their educational resources. It is important to me as a future teacher to better the school systems as they are now rather than take the students away. Not everyone is able to afford private schools with grants and it is my job to help all children not just a hand full that are forced into public education.

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot; font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; SIZE=&quot;&quot;&gt;Introduction
----
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;The education of young individuals in society is a common concern. Parents may worry if their children are receiving the appropriate knowledge to advance. Should they attend private school? Can we afford private school? Is the local public school up to par? Will they be safe in public school? Will their moral compass be reconfigured? The questions never seem to end. 


Some parents have found a solution to such questions: homeschool. But there are others who have suspicions on the validity of such a choice leading to a multitude of new questions. What exactly is homeschooling? What are our Governmentâs laws concerning homeschooling? Is homeschooling right for everyone?


This article provides answers to these questions along with an inside look at homeschooled individuals.






&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot;&gt;What is Homeschooling
----
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;The Merriam-Websterâs Online Dictionary defines homeschooling as: âto teach (oneâs children) at homeâ (Merriam-Webster, Incorporated, 2009). Yet, this is only a very general description of homeschooling. To be homeschooled does not necessarily mean to be taught in the home, but rather in a particular culture. Homeschooling is a way for parents or guardians to educate their children in the environment they believe is best for the child. The parents or guardians have the chance to further instill in their child the certain philosophies, customs, and traditions they believe to be true and helpful.


Also as the teacher, the parents or guardians can use more relatable, individualized methods of teaching using the same information as mainstream school systems. Therefore, homeschooling is a way to best educate oneâs children using personalized curriculum taught in a healthy environment (Millman, 2008).


However, there is a catch. Just as Public and Private schools have standards and regulations enforced by the government, there are Government laws concerning homeschooling.





&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot;&gt;The Government's Role
----
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;Each State in the United States of America has their own unique regulations regarding homeschooling. After parents register with the local school system, Virginia State Law provides four different criteria, one of which must be met. The four options given by the ''Virginia Code'' 22.1-254.1 are as follows:


-The parent has a High School Diploma or an equivalence of such


-In respect to the Board of Education, the parent âmeets the qualifications for a teacher.â


-The parent presents the chosen curriculum that sufficiently meets the school system standards.


-The parent proves that they are capable of successfully educating their child 
(The Virginia Department of Education, 2008).


Furthermore, the parents must annually ânotify the school division superintendent no later than August 15â that they wish to continue homeschooling. Along with this notification, regardless of the chosen option as laid down by the ''Virginia Code'', the parent must also inform the superintendent of the curriculum they chose (The Virginia Department of Education, 2008).


Choosing to home educate is not a decision taken lightly. So the two questions remaining are why homeschool and is it right for everyone? 




&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot;&gt;Why Homeschool?:
----
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;A parent might choice to homeschool their children for a number of reasons. Parents will homeschool their children to better foster cultural beliefs, practices, philosophies, etc. Also, homeschooling allows students to move through curriculum at their own pass. The student will be able to dedicate more time on the subjects of difficulty while flowing through other subjects that come more natural (Willingham, 2008).


Additionally, parents are allowed to use new, innovative teaching methods. Many take advantage of the numerous public libraries and museums. Field trips and many more hands on experience might better suit the learning style of their children. This technique of teaching can be more individualized (Willingham, 2008). As one homeschool family states ââ¦we scrapped dry textbooks and workbooks and found more interesting ways for our children to learnâ (Millman, 2008).


Finally, there are several Homeschooling organizations in the state of Virginia. These organizations allow for academic and extra-curricular interaction between other homeschoolers as while as many students in the school system. Through these organizations, opportunities involving music and sports are still available to homeschoolers (Willingham, 2008).




&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot;&gt;Is Home Schooling for Everyone?:
----
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;Although there are many great benefits of homeschooling, it is not always as exciting and it may seem. As Michael and Mary Leppert point out in their book The homeschooling Book of Lists, there are reasons for parents not to homeschool. 


They suggest that those who live in rural areas, too far to participate in organizations, extracurricular or social activities, should not attempt homeschooling. Communication skills can only be taught to a certain degree within the home. Another basis for not homeschooling is if the parent has a learning disability or a hard time with patience. If the parent has âa true learning disabilityâ that is not easily overcome or becomes irritated easily, then more harm can be done then good. Last, if the local school systems are creditable and would teach the child better than the parent, homeschooling is not completely necessary (Lepert &amp; Lepert, 2008, p. 6).




&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;Kristen ITC&quot;&gt;Conclusion:
----
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;&gt;Homeschooling, just like Public and Private Schools, has its advantages and disadvantages. Parents have the choice to teach their children in an environment conducive to their specific values; yet, our government makes sure the home education system is not abused. Each state produces and enforces its own rules and regulations pertaining to homeschooling. Although homeschooling can be beneficial in that it is more personalized, there are also mainstream schools that provide sufficient education.


As a homeschooled child, I enjoyed my experience. I lived in a suburban area and participated in homeschool organizations, sports, and music. My Mother has her bachelorâs degree in Psychology with a minor in Math. She not only taught me but my three sisters and three brothers. Five of us have graduated and have either graduated from college or are currently enrolled in college âthe other two are still being homeschooled through high school. Personally, I have had a wonderful experience with being homeschool and would never want to change it.

'''By: Megan Galligan'''




== '''''Introduction''''' ==


Many believe that home schooling has its roots in the 1960s though the 1970s when educational reform became an issue on the national forefront (Dobson, 2000, paragraph 5). Actually, until 1852, public school attendance was not mandatory.  It was only in 1852 that the state of Massachusetts made the first compulsory attendance law and eventually all other states followed suit. (All About Parenting).  This issue has become increasingly debated because the number of students enrolled in home school has been increasing 15 to 20% each year for the last fifteen years (Dobson, 2000, paragraph 9).  Parents are faced with the option to send their children to public or private schools, or to keep their children at home to educate the children themselves.  The parents must consider many aspects of education to make this decision including their educational aptitude as teachers, the possible social effect on the children, the production of good citizens, the attention the children need to learn, and the external pressures of the school systems placed on the children.

== '''''Pros of Home Schooling''''' ==

Home schooled children had many more freedoms than other children in public school settings.  They have Educational freedom giving them choices to learn what they want with subjects that interest them.  They have physical freedom to have more hands on experiences such as field trips to museums or aquariums.  Religious freedoms is one of the largest gains of home schooling for most families.  They have the opportunity to incorporate their religious and spiritual beliefs without standards and rules to abide by.  According to the ''Journal of College Admissions'', home schooling is the fastest growing forms of educating children (Ray, 2004, paragraph 2).  It is estimated that there are 1.7 to 2.1 million students in grades k-12 that are enrolled in home school as of 2003 and that number seems to be growing every year (Ray, 2004, paragraph 2).  Home schooling began as a way for parents to have more control over the curriculum being taught to their children (Cooper and Sureau, 2007, paragraph 9).  There were two major view points considered when deciding to remove a child from public school and continuing the education at home.  Parents either believed that public schooling developed topics that conflicted with the religious teachings or believed that they, as parents, could serve as a better educator for their children (Cooper and Sureau, 2007, paragraph 9). 
 
In an article written by Michael Romanowski, a professor at Ohio Northern University, he states that âNo other factor in life will have more of an effect on a child's life than the family, and home schooling enables the family to play its important role more activelyâ(2001, paragraph 6).  Home schooling also allows the parents more of and opportunity to become involved in all aspects of the childâs life because they become the focal point in all aspects of their life.  In Romanowskiâs article, he also states that the intensified relationship with the parents will extend to other siblings that are also being home schooled.  He believes that the since of communication is strengthened which allows a more personal relationship (2001, paragraph 7). 
     
There is also the argument that home schooled individuals grow up to become more well rounded citizens.  According to a separate article by Romanowski, 71 percent of people who were home schooled were involved in community service(2007, paragraph 14).  Moreover, only 37 percent of individuals who were educated in the public school system were involved in public service activities (Romanowski, 2007, paragraph 14).  The percentage variations also exist when examining topics such as young voters aged eighteen to twenty-four, contributions to a political party, and active participation in local politics (Romanowski, 2007, paragraphs 15,16,17, and 18)

Another reason for parents choosing the option of home schooling is for the protection of their children.  It seems that reports of violence in schools in the news and media are increasing.  For example, weapons being brought into public and private schools; increase in gangs; bulling and fights have become more violent; and acts against students are being video taped and broadcast on the internet.  These are a few of the reasons why some parents feel that public as well as private schools are no longer safe.  Although news reports of such violence seems to be increasing, the percentage of violent acts occurring in public schools has decreased; yet studentsâ absence due to fear of violence has increased.  According to the National Indictors for Education Statistics, âThere is some evidence that student safety has improved. The victimization rate of students ages 12â18 at school declined between 1992 and 2005. However, violence, theft, drugs, and weapons continue to pose problems in schoolsâ (âIndicators of School Crime and Safety,â 2007).  Furthermore, some parents who home school do so as a way of protecting their children from the exposure to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and premarital sex.  Parents who home school are able to teach their children about these issues in a way that supports their beliefs.  By home schooling their children they believe that they can provide them with a well rounded education in the safety of their own home.

Pubic education uses a set curriculum to teach all children in a given classroom.  The classroom is filled with a variety of learning styles, interests, and abilities.  For the parent who has chosen to educate their child at home, the curriculum can be catered to meet each child's indiviual needs, interests and learning style.  There is also the element of time.  More personalized time is given to the child at home and there is not the waisted time standing in line for lunch, recess, others to finish their work, etc. and therefor much of the schoolwork is completed much earlier in the day, leaving time for real life learning experiences. (All About Parenting).


I have also discerned that parents who are teaching their children at home also have the benefit of the one-on-one interaction with the child.  The child does not need to pace them self with the other members of the classroom.  They have the freedom to spend extra time on a troubling topic or to speed through a trivial part of a subject.

Amos Bronson Alcott, a teacher and writer from the 19th century once said, &quot;A true teacher defends his pupils against his own personal influence&quot;.  Is this possible when it is a parent teaching their child?
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== '''''Cons of Home Schooling''''' ==

On the other side of the issue there are many downsides of homes schooling that need to be accounted for.  Parents who home school their children struggle with time constraints for getting all of the work load done by one person.  This can consist of creating a schedule, activities, learning, and hands on projects/trips. Aside from time restraints there are many financial restraints as well, having one parent in the working world and one in the teaching world can cause some financial strain.  In the article âThe Pros and Cons of Homeschoolingâ Isabel Shaw says, âSurprisingly, most home schooling families believe that the brief loss of income is well worth the satisfaction of watching their kids grow and learn in freedom.â  In an article by Susan Orloff, she states that there are certain things learned in the school setting that do not occur in other environments but they ââ¦in the school setting they are happening every dayâ (Orloff, 2005, paragraph 5).  These things include making friends, learning to follow directions, and becoming able to handle deadlines. Orloff also states that she has âAll too oftenâ¦ seem home schooling as an escape from school and pressures that structured environment demandsâ (Orloff, 2005, paragraph 7). However, note that many home schoolers participate in peer groups that allow for some of these things to happen.

Another factor that should be considered in the choice to home school is that added financial burden.  Families spend an average of $400 per child each year to cover costs of  curriculum, softwar, field trips, materials for projects, etc.  (All About Parenting)

If the reason behind taking the child out of public school and beginning home school is to decrease the pressures that the public school produces, it could only lead to the future detriment of the child.  The child needs to be able to develop coping skills to deal with the trials that life would present.  Set backs allow a person to grow and develop the skills to combat similar situations in the future.  Taking the child out of public education for this reason only teaches the child to escape their problems, not how to learn from them.  

Based on the data provided by the Home School Legal Defense Team, 92% of who parents make the decision to home school their children intend to have the childâs entire education at home, grades K-12 (Ray, 1997).  Although the majority intend to complete they education at home, only 26% of students can claim to have over ten years of their schooling at home (Ray, 1997).  These statistics seem to imply some type of inconsistence in schooling.  On average, of high school graduates who were home schooled can claim 6.9 years of home schooling (Ray, 1997).  This seems to require quite an adjustment for the children in school.  They are required to go in between home and public school and make the required modifications socially and academically.

In Romanowskiâs article, âThe Strengths and Limitations of Home Schoolingâ, he states that âTo receive a complete education, students need to engage in discussions, share ideas, compete, and work with other studentsâ (2001, paragraph 19).  He believes that in order to strengthen the ideas, a person must get feedback and criticism on those ideas.    The original idea seems to change, expand, and grow with the input of others.  He also introduces the idea that the parent that becomes the primary educator might not have the proper background to adequately teach the upper level subject to the children (Romanowski, 2001, paragraph 24).  He questions whether parents have the ability to teach their children ââ¦higher levels of math, complex biological terms, or an in dept analysis of American historyâ (Romanowski, 2001, paragraph 24).  A parent may be knowledgeable in some of the subjects required, but it would be astonishing if they were skilled enough to teach in all areas.

== '''''Home Schooling and the Federal Government''''' ==

Once an isolated practice with little support, home schooling âhas now reached a level of unprecedented visibility, politicization, and publicizationâ (Cooper, p. 111).  Parents and advocates have gained significant legal, political, and social ground, substantially raising public awareness.  Subsequently, the increase in home schoolingâs power and popularity has caused state and local educational leaders to adjust some of their policies.  This has brought considerable criticism from supporters of the âdemocratic, public control of educationâ (Cooper, pg 112).  They claim home schooling âdenies democratic accountabilityâ (Cooper, pg. 112) and is âdetrimental to the common goodâ (Cooper, pg. 115).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #800000; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Despite political pressure to conform, homeschool families have become well informed, active, and influential â all qualities that are critical to the public life of society (Cooper, pg. 132).
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  

In light of this fiery opposition, how far legally and constitutionally can the federal government go to regulate home schooling and overturn parentsâ rights?  Twenty years ago, home schooling was considered a crime, and although many states began legalization in 1999, the court controversies are far from over.  The cases range in variety and often address attendance, parent qualifications, supervision, and dual-enrolment in public facilities (Cooper, pg. 123).  

In most recent legislation, the Second District Court of Appeals in Los Angeles, CA stated in February of 2008 that âchildren ages six to 18 may be taught only by credentialed teachers in public or private schools â or at home by Mom and Dad, but only if they have a teaching degreeâ (Kloberdanz-Modesto).  Californiaâs governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, defended parentsâ rights for the well-being of their child and guaranteed protest (Kloberdanz-Modesto).  This decision is merely another pull by the federal government in the tug-of-war being played with home school advocates.

== '''''Conclusion''''' ==

There seem to be many considerations before deciding which type of schooling is best for a child.  What seems to be the overriding factor is that all children are different.  It depends of the individual when deciding if home school is a plausible option.  There seems to be pros and cons that balance each other.  The benefits and the detriments are comparable.  The education of children seems to be an extremely important and personal decision that all parents face. Yet, will this decision stay in the parents' hands? The constant influx of court cases addressing the uses and abuses of homeschooling makes the future of home schooling unpredictable.

Bush in his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention, September 9, 2004 . (&quot;Text of Bush Speech&quot;, 2004)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&quot;We must fix the failures of No Child Left Behind. We must provide the funding we were promised, give our states the resources they need and finally meet our commitment to special education.&quot;  --- Barack Obama in his speech, âWhatâs Possible for Our Children,â  May 28, 2008 (&quot;Text of Obama Speech&quot;,2008, para. 17)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;







=='''Introduction'''==

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was a major emphasis of the Bush Administration education policy.  (&quot;How to Fix&quot;, 2007) The law was meant to '''hold schools accountable for student progress''', and, in fact, to expect that '''all children will be able to perform at or above grade level in reading and math by the year 2014'''. (&quot;Key Policy&quot;, 2002; &quot;How to Fix&quot;, 2007)

Since the passage of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), many educators and politicians have loudly expressed their disagreement with the law and its regulations, while others have lauded the accomplishments of successful schools around the country. The Obama administration is poised to begin implementing its agenda, which has been critical of aspects of the No Child Left Behind legislation.  This paper will examine how NCLB hopes to cure America's schools, what parts of NCLB are considered of concern to the schools and students, and what changes to NCLB some hope will help American students meet their potential.  


=='''Standards Set by No Child Left Behind'''==

&quot;&lt;Big&gt;'''The 4 Pillars of No Child Left Behind&lt;/Big&gt;
*1. Stronger accountability for results 
*2. More freedom for states and communities 
*3. Proven education methods
*4. More choices for parents.'''â (&quot;Four Pillars&quot;, 2004, para. 1) .  
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''Schools are Accountable for Students' Results'''  In an effort to increase accountability, all states must have state standards for performance and test their students on these standards.  Each state develops its own standards and tests.   In addition, schools must track the performance of certain groups of students who have not performed as well in the past, (i.e. minority students, students in poverty, students with disabilities) and attempt to âclose the achievement gap.â (&quot;Four Pillars&quot;, 2004, para. 1).  The Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) towards the goals are monitored, and schools must meet certain improvements within a specific timeframe or major restructuring will be required, including &quot;replacing administation and staff, reopen as a charter school, state takeover&quot; (&quot;Key Policy Letter&quot;, 2002,in Restructuring (Year Four)).

'''Local Control'''  NCLB allows states and communities to decide how to use federal funds.    Funds can be funneled to teacher recruitment or training, or to school safety, for example.  (&quot;Four Pillars&quot;, 2004).   

'''Effective Teaching Methods''' Making instruction effective is the aim of the regulations on using teaching methods which are research-based and proven effective.  (&quot;Four Pillars&quot;, 2004)

'''Alternatives for Families''' If, after several years, a school is not providing adequate progress under NCLB, parents are able to move their child to a well-performing school in their district.  In addition, tutoring and extended educational opportunities will be available to low-income students who do not make adequate progress.(&quot;Four Pillars&quot;, 2004)

=='''Support for NCLB'''==

'''High Standards, Strict Regulations''' Making such sweeping change to the education system and holding all schools to such specific and high standards has ignited strong feelings in educators,  politicians, and families.  Diane Picheâ, the Executive Director of Citizensâ Commission on Civil Rights, and a strong proponent of NCLB, believes that many schools have shown that children can reach these high standards, even when they have a large percentage of children in poverty(Pinche',2007).  Pincheâ believes that a âno-excuses approach to teaching the children of the poorâ (Pinche', 2007, para. 8) is the model for success.  She also believes that removing funding from schools failing to reach their goals is necessary(Pinche',2007).

'''Be Persistent: Federal Expectations Will Take Time''' As a civil rights lawyer, Pincheâ likens educational reform to civil rights reform (Pinche', 2007). She is adamant that educational excellence for minority and poor children can only come from strict standards on a federal level(Pinche', 2007). Pinche' asserts that progress towards the goal is important and that persistence is necessary as it will take more time before the objectives are reached (Pinche', 2007).

âSince when has leaving it all up to the states helped the poor and minorities achieve equality of opportunity?  Not when it came to voting rights.  â¦ Not when it came to desegregating schools in the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Education.  And certainly not now, when the achievement gaps based on race and class are as virulent as ever, with only modest signs of abatement.â (Pincheâ, 2007, Common Ground section, para. 2)  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

 
'''Progress Made''' The U.S. Department of Education highlighted the accomplishments under NCLB in December of 2008(&quot;Progress by our Schools&quot;, 2008).  They cited higher test scores, and improvements by children with disabilities and children for whom English is not their native language(&quot;Progress by our Schools, 2008).  They report that the âachievement gap is narrowingâ(&quot;Progress by our Schools&quot;, 2008, para. 3) and that accountability testing is occurring in all schools. For example, &quot;average reading scores for 4th-grade students with disabilities improved by 23 points between 2000 and 2007 [and] the achievement gap between white and African-American 8th graders narrowed by three points between 2003 - 2007&quot; (&quot;Progress by our Schools, 2008, para. 3 &amp; 4).

'''Funding''' Funding for the changes needed under NCLB has been under discussion.  Umstead reports that federal funding for NCLB would cover schoolsâ expenditures on assessments as long as schools do not choose the most expensive assessment methods (Umpstead, 2008).
 


=='''Concerns about NCLB'''==

'''Accountability''' Critics state that teachers are now teaching to the test, which may allow scores to improve at the cost of decreasing creativity in the classroom (Smyth, 2008).  Others are concerned that time spent improving reading and math scores is robbing students of time to study science and the arts (&quot;How to Fix, 2007).   In fact, some are concerned that states are setting their test standards so low in order to have a larger percentage of students who pass (How to Fix&quot;, 2007).  For example, of Mississippiâs 4th graders, 89% passed the state reading test, but only 18% passed the national test (&quot;How to Fix&quot;, 2007).   A national test standard has been proposed to truly bring all states up to par  (&quot;How to Fix&quot;, 2007).

'''Annual Yearly Progress (AYP)'''  Each state can determine what progess towards proficiency the groups in their school must make in order to meet the final NCLB goal of 100% grade level performance in 2014 (&quot;Key Policy,&quot; 2002). AYP measures have come under a great deal of fire.  Many educators  believe that the AYP system relies too heavily on punishment and that it is too easy to fail (&quot;How to Fix&quot;, 2007).  Progress may have been made in some areas, but schools fail if even one measure is not met(&quot;How to Fix, 2007).   Many believe that factors outside of the school building, such as poverty and family support, are the cause of some studentsâ poor performance at school, and that these issues must be addressed if children are to succeed (Wallis, 2008).

'''Children with Disabilities'''  Children with disabilities provide a unique challenge to school systems.  Hardman and Dawson (2008) report that many educators question whether children with disabilities should be instructed and tested with the general school population. They cite individualized instructional methods needed for students with disabilities as being at odds with a standardized test(Hudson and Dawson, 2008).  And many fear that it is an impossible goal to ever expect 100% of children to be reading and doing math on grade level (&quot;How to Fix&quot;, 2007).

'''Rural Schools''' Rural schools also find it challenging to meet NCLB standards, according to Mitchem, Kossar, and Ludlow (2006).  They report that rural schools find it difficult to find staff who meet the NCLB requirements due to low populations and remote areas.  Combine this difficulty with the requirements for special education teachers, and rural schools find themselves unable to meet NCLB standards. (Mitchem, Kossar, and Ludlow, 2006).

'''Funding''' Funding for the NCLB standards is of grave concern for many school systems.  In fact, the National Education Association, along with several states, filed âa federal lawsuit â¦ charging that the Department of Education has failed to provide dequate funding for the NO Child Left Behind initiativeâ (Dobbs, 2005, para. 1 ).   Others are concerned about the lack of funding for remediation services to assist troubled schools (Pickert, 2008). 
  
=='''Changes made to NCLB'''==

After several years of data from states, U.S. Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, announced three changes to NCLB to respond to areas of concern:
  
*1.	'''&quot;The Modified Academic Achievement Standards&quot;'''(&quot;Final Regulations&quot;, 2008, title) provide a modified test for students with special needs who will be tested on grade level material, but in a less advanced fashion  (&quot;Final Regulations&quot;, 2007).
*2.	'''&quot;The Growth Model&quot;''' (&quot;Secretary Spellings&quot;, 2009, title) is a sophisticated statistical model that measures student progress for students who may not be up to grade level yet, but have made progress  (&quot;Secretary Spellings&quot;, 2009).
*3.	'''&quot;Differentiated Accountability&quot;''' (2008, title) allows schools that are closer to meeting their AYP goals to receive less stringent consequences than schools that are seriously behind  (&quot;Differentiated Accountability&quot;, 2008).

=='''Whatâs Next?'''==

President Barack Obama has been very clear about his agenda for NCLB. He believes in increasing funding for the program, revising assessments, and allowing for more individuation(&quot;Education Agenda&quot; 2008). He also plans to &quot;improve NCLBâs accountability system so that we are supporting schools that need improvement, rather than punishing themâ  (&quot;Education Agenda&quot;, 2008, para. 5).

âIf we really want our children to become the great inventors and problem-solvers of tomorrow, our schools shouldn't stifle innovation, they should let it thrive  â¦  by using visual arts, drama and music to help students master traditional subjects like English, science and math.â  --- Barack Obama in his speech, âWhatâs Possible for Our Children,â  May 28, 2008 (&quot;Full Text&quot;, 2008, para. 15)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



==Conclusion==
   
The No Child Left Behind legislation did target a grave concern abaout America's education system.  After years of testing, it is of great concern that some groups of students (minorities, low-income, students with disabilities) continue to have consistently lower achievement levels. However, major disagreements remain as to how to raise the achievement levels of these students, and, indeed, whether all students can achieve at grade level.  

Early concerns about measuring schools' success have led to changes in the NCLB regulations.  NCLB now allows schools to measure student growth towards the goal, as well as to provide accommodations for students with disabilities.  The Obama administration has targeted more funding to help struggling schools and encouraged more creativity in the classroom. Despite strong differences of opinion about the implementation of NCLB, all seem to agree that Americaâs children should be provided with an effective education which will lead them to be productive citizens in the 21st Century.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt; '''No Child Left Behind: Cure or Curse?''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;By: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Mtubbs Mary Tubbs]&lt;/center&gt;



== Learning Objectives ==

'''After reading this article the reader should be able to:'''

â¢ Describe what the No Child Left Behind act is.

â¢ Remember key improvements NCLB has made in education since 1992.

â¢ Discuss main controversies about the No Child Left Behind act.


== What is No Child Left Behind? ==

The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is an American educational reform policy enacted in 2001 by former president George W. Bush.  The main point of No Child Left Behind was to make schools accountable for their studentsâ achievements and failures in education.  Schools would be rewarded for their studentsâ achievements by monetary grants and disciplined by the removal of grants, forceful removal of the current curriculum, teacher replacement and lastly the closure of the school.  

Under No Child Left Behind states would have to ensure that all children will be literate by the third grade.  Students who are not proficient in the English language will receive the instruction needed to make improvements.  Under NCLB military schools and schools attended by Native Americans would be repaired to benefit the learning environment of their students.  Ideally, under NCLB all students would graduate from high school with a diploma (Bush, 2001).

== Why is NCLB a cure for educational reform? ==

In 1994 Congress reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESE).  This act was supposed to make schools more accountable for their students.  Less than ten years later the No Child Left Behind made numerous improvements in educational reform.  


&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=1 style=&quot;background color:light green&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;'''Educational Improvements Since 1994'''&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;ESE Act&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;NCLB Act&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Students would be rated on performance in science and math &lt;br&gt;
by three levels: âpartially proficient, proficient and advanced.â (Shaul, 2005)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;In addition, students would also develop in performance in science by 2005-2006.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Students would be assessed in math and reading.  Students would be
assessed in performance in situations that would require higher thinking skills.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Students would be assessed in science the third grade up to the twelfth grade. 
Math and reading assessments will be administrated annually through the third grade 
to the eighth grade starting in 2005-2006.  Students would take the National Assessment of Educational Progress exams in the fourth grade and the eighth grade in reading and math.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Students with disabilities and limited proficiency in English would be assessed the same as all other students.  &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Students with limited proficiency in English, starting in 2002-2003, would be assessed if they had attended an American school for three years consecutively.  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Assessments would be reported using the following: âby state, LEA, school, gender, major racial and ethnic groups, English proficiency, migrant status, disability, and economic disadvantage.â (Shaul. 2005)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Information would be provided annually on individual studentsâ performance on tests starting in 2002-2003.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;(Shaul, 2005)&lt;/center&gt;


â¢ Under the No Child Left Behind act if a school had not reached the adequate yearly progress measure (AYP) for their state they must offer the choice to transfer schools to parents of the students who attended the failing school. Failing schools would be required to provide transportation to their former students to their new schools until they are âno longer identified for choice.â (Shaul, 2005)

â¢ NCLB requires that all teachers be highly skilled in their areas by 2005-2006 (Shaul, 2005).

== Why is NCLB a Curse? ==

â¢ '''No Child Left Behind has taken much longer than anticipated to enact'''.  It was only in 2005 that all the statesâ plans for accountability were accepted by the government (Wong, 2008).

â¢ According to Lance Fusarelli, âFederal policy makers seem to blame educators for the achievement gap.â  The added pressure to educators to not only teach well but to teach well enough for their students to pass has had a negative impact on some of the schools.  '''Schools that are failing their adequate yearly progress measures do not attract teachers''' as much as a school that is passing their AYPs.  This is due to the possibility of them either losing their job during a forced turn over or a forced school closure.  Nonacademic courses such as art, music, dance or sports may be the first subjects to be cut from a budget suffering from the diminished funds due to their failing rank on their AYPs. If a teacher is offered a job in an nonacademic course or an elective-type course in a school that is failing they may not choose to take the position (Fusarelli, 2004).

â¢ '''If a school does not pass all their goals they are listed as a failing school'''.  If a school does pass 17 of their 20 goals they are listed as a failing school on their annual progress report (Fusarelli, 2004).

â¢ Under No Child Left Behind if a school has failed their adequate yearly progress measure for three years consecutively they have to give parents the option to transfer their students to another school that is passing their AYPs.  However, '''only a small percent actually do take this option to change schools''' when offered the option.  The available spaces are usually taken by students who are doing well and passed their tests.  The students who did not get the open spots for transfer are left behind to stay in the same school.  The school may not have been forced to change their curriculum, staff or to close entirely.  If the same students who failed the tests are being taught in the same manner they may fail the next yearly assessment tests.  This situation will continually push the school further down the scale of their AYPs as the successful students keep leaving and the disadvantaged students are forced to stay (Fusarelli, 2007).

â¢ The '''lack of space at other schools''' who are passing their adequate yearly progress measures are limited and may force parents to keep their successful children from attending a school that is passing rather than failing.  This is true in the example from the Los Angeles Unified School District where they were 160,000 seats short for students who qualified or wanted to switch to another school.  Some school districts may have all their schools failing their AYPs forcing parents to stay in a school district that is failing all around (Fusarelli, 2007).

â¢ '''Some school districts didnât tell the parents of their students that they qualified to change school or receive tutoring''' until late in the school year when it was inconvenient to transfer (Fusarelli, 2007).

â¢ '''Some schools may refuse to accept students that transferred from a failing school'''.  This is due to the fear that the school that was previously passing their adequate yearly process measures might actually fail their next one after accepting students.  The government has not given any incentives to schools to accept students from a failing school (Fusarelli, 2007).

== How can NCLB be fixed? ==

One of the theories that has been purposed to help the No Child Left Behind Act achieve its goals more effectively is to introduce a national curriculum with tests that are associated with the curriculum.  This will however take away the states and school districts flexibility when it comes to curriculum (Fusarelli, 2004).

Another theory is to rezone school districts in such a way where a school will have equal amounts of low income students (who have been most likely to fail on the standardized tests) and high income students (who have been more successful on average).  Rezoning on socioeconomic status will more than likely be proven constitutional (Sanders, 2008). According to Adam Sanders, âThis proposal appears to have more merit than merely mandating interdistrict transfers because urban school districts will not cease to exist, they will exist as a mixed school district.â

3. As principle, what would be the best short-term option that your school could chose to help students who are at risk at failing your stateâs standardized tests?

â¢ '''(A)''' Give them detention so they have a mandatory time to study 

â¢ '''(B)''' Offer them free tutoring services 

â¢ '''(C)''' Prohibit them from participating in extracurricular activities 

â¢ '''(D)''' Test them continually every week

4. Your school just passed their first adequate yearly progress measure in three years.  What should you do to make sure you pass next year?

â¢ '''(A)''' Encourage your teachers to continue to teach their students as if they had never passed so theyâd be continually pushed educationally 

â¢ '''(B)''' Give your students a free homework pass 

â¢ '''(C)''' Give your teachers raises 

â¢ '''(D)''' Offer a pizza party in the cafeteria

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''''BACKGROUND'''''&lt;/big&gt;     The first public school came into existence in the mid-nineteenth century. Its founders called it the âcommonâ school. Common schools were funded by local property taxes, charged no tuition, open to all white children, governed by local school committees, and subject to a modest amount of state regulation(Tyack,2001).   Students often went to the common school from ages six to fourteen, although this could vary widely. The duration of the school year was often dictated by the agricultural needs of particular communities, with children being off when they would be needed on the family farm(Katz, 1987).  Typically, with a small amount of state oversight, each district was controlled by an elected local school board.  Traditionally a county school superintendent or regional director was elected to supervise day-to-day activities of several common school districts. Since common schools were locally controlled, and the United States was very rural in the nineteenth century, most common schools were small one-room schools(Kaestle, 1983).  Common schools had a single teacher (usually female) and all the students were taught together, regardless of age.  Common schools typically taught reading, writing, arithmetic, history, geography, and math. Evaluation of students was very varied (from 0-100 grading to no grades at all), but an end-of-the-year recital was a common way that parents were informed about what their children were learning(Cremin,1980).


&lt;big&gt;'''''THE INTELLECTUAL IMPACT OF SCHOOL'''''&lt;/big&gt;     What's the purpose of school anyway?   This is a question that every child asks at some point in their adolescent years.  After all, what is appealing to a child about going to bed early, getting up early, and sitting in a desk for six and a half hours a day?  Children don't understand how important going to school really is, but the importance of education is quite clear.  Education is the knowledge of putting one's potentials to maximum use.  Training of a human mind is not complete without education.  It tells one how to think and how to make decisions.  The importance of education is that only through the attainment of education, man is enabled to receive information from the external world to acquaint himself with past history and receive all necessary information regarding the present(Katz, 1987).  Knowledge of education is built upon a foundation that begins with pre-school, where a lifetime of learning begins.  It is vital to have a solid foundation of learning because each year new applications are taught and learning is like building blocks, you continually build on what you were initially given.  If you miss a piece of information along the way, you will never be able to reach the top.


&lt;big&gt;'''''GOOD CITIZENSHIP'''''&lt;/big&gt;     Achieving a good education to further knowledge is not the only purpose of school.  Todayâs schools really focus on teaching good citizenship and good character.  I have substituted for the past year and a half and I have to share an example of being a witness of following through with this application.  I recently substituted at an elementary school that encourages children to be honest and that no good deed goes unnoticed.  To follow through with this concept, each morning during announcements the principle recognizes children for picking up paper towels in the restroom or turning in money found on the floor, even if it is just a penny.  The children are so proud of themselves when they are acknowledged and this has really become an epidemic throughout the entire school.



&lt;big&gt;'''''SOCIAL SKILLS'''''&lt;/big&gt;     At a very young age children are taught to share and to be considerate of other peopleâs feelings.  They are also taught a great deal about emotions, behavior, and the consequences of their actions.  Being able to interact socially and have healthy relationships is a very important part of life.  While in the classroom children are constantly interacting with others and whether they are aware of it or not, they are learning to co-exist in a very diverse world.  This socialization helps children build critical thinking skills and develop good communication skills.  Schools also provide lots of extracurricular activities that incorporate teamwork, good sportsmanship, and exercise into participation.  The elementary school ages are considered to be the fundamental grades and stages of development. With this in mind, it is important that children are taught positive behaviors and habits early in life.  By teaching children positive behaviors at a young age, kids are more able to understand and engage in long-term attitudes and actions that will guide them towards future success.  To encourage students, and to teach all kids positive behaviors, elementary schools across the country have implemented positive behavior programs to improve student awareness, knowledge, and development(Wiggins, McTighe, 2008).


''&lt;big&gt;'''CONCLUSION'''&lt;/big&gt;''     Even before they enter school, young children learn to walk, to talk, and to use their hands to manipulate toys, food, and other objects. They use all of their senses to learn about the sights, sounds, tastes, and smells in their environments. They learn how to interact with their parents, siblings, friends, and other people important to their world.  When they enter school, children learn basic academic subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics.  They also continue to learn a great deal outside the classroom.  They learn which behaviors are likely to be rewarded and which are likely to be punished.  They learn social skills for interacting with other children.  After they finish school, people must learn to adapt to the many major changes that affect their lives, such as getting married, raising children, and finding and keeping a job.  Because learning continues throughout our lives and affects almost everything we do, the study of learning is important in many different fields.  Teachers need to understand the best ways to educate children. Psychologists, social workers, criminologists, and other human-service workers need to understand how certain experiences change peopleâs behaviors. Employers, politicians, and advertisers make use of the principles of learning to influence the behavior of workers, voters, and consumers.  The purpose of school is to provide a quality education so that all students have an equal opportunity to develop their full potential(Wiggins, McTighe, 2008).

'''Learning Target'''
*&lt;font color=#339900&gt;Student should be able to describe the function of public schools as it relates to social reform.&lt;/font&gt;
 

&lt;center&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/center&gt;

In order to determine the purpose of public schools today, we must first examine the evolution of the school system in the United States. The purpose of public education has been affected by major changes in American society. These changes include religious and economic transformations as well as the expansion of civil rights, which have had enormous effects on what goes on in the classroom. Other factors include population growth, immigration, and technology (The Story of American Public Education, 2001, p.2).

'''Early History of Public Education   (Religious)'''

The most preliminary form of public education was in existence in the 1600s in the New England colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire. The overriding belief of educating the children was more due to religious reasons and was easy to implement, as the only groups in existence were the puritans and the Congregationalists. However, the influx of people from many countries and belonging to different faiths led to a weakening of the concept. People refused to learn only in English and opposed the clergy imposing their religious views through public education. By the middle of the eighteenth century, private schooling had become the norm (Thattai, 2001).

'''After the Revolutionary War  (Political)'''

In the aftermath of the Revolution, a newly independent America came face-to-face with one of its most daunting challenges: how to build a united nation out of thirteen colonies with little in common. Many citizens like Thomas Jefferson and Horace Mann believed that education held the key. They and other leaders of the time launched a crusade to create a common system of tax-supported schools that would mix people of different backgrounds and reinforce the bonds that tie Americans together (The Story of American Public Education, 2001).

&lt;font color=#0000FF&gt;Public education was viewed as the fundamental way to prepare children from diverse ethnic, religious and class backgrounds to live as responsible citizens in a democracy.

&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''After the Industrial Revolution  (Immigration)'''

Between 1890 and 1930, nearly three million immigrant children arrived in the United States. For them, public schools offered a golden opportunity: a chance to be part of the American dream. During this time of massive immigration, child labor laws, and the explosive growth of cities, school attendance was fueled (The Story of American Public Education, 2001).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;
border: solid 1px #0000FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;font color=#0000FF&gt;Our city contains immigrants from every nation in the world, who speak many different languages. If we were to create special schools for each group that wants to preserve its cultural heritage, it would be the end of the historic ideal of public education as a common training ground for future citizens (Ravitcb, D, 2007).
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


'''Equality  (Discrimination)'''

From 1950 till 1980, this era was when public schools became a major battleground in the fight for equality for minorities, women and the handicapped. In spite of the belief that public education should be available to every child irrespective of race, gender, economic status or physical ability this was not happening in reality. Discrimination in schools on the basis of race, gender and physical ability has always persisted. Girls were not admitted in schools until many years after the establishment of schools, and even then, they were not taught the same subjects as boys. Since the 1950s, public policy toward education has addressed discrimination issues in education more than educational issues. The federal government has especially been concerned with issues of equality in school districts. In 1954 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Despite vigorous resistance for many years by many southern states, by 1980 the federal courts had largely succeeded in eliminating the system of legalized segregation in southern schools. Women have been equally discriminated against in American schools. The emergence of the womenâs rights movement during the 1960s was a boost against sexual discrimination. Title IX of the 1972 federal Education Amendments prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in education institutions that received federal aid (Thattai, 2001). People with disabilities have also been discriminated against until The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed by Congress in 1975 which ensures that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education (Heward W, 2008 p.18). 




'''Technology  (Assessment)'''

In 1983, a report launched by the Reagan Administration called A Nation at Risk, shattered public confidence in Americaâs schools and sparked a new wave of education reform, all with the goal of meeting tough, new academic standards (The Story of American Public Education, 2001). In 2001, President Bush introduced and Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). The intent of NCLB is to improve the achievement of all students, with a particular emphasis on children from low-income families (Heward, W. 2008 p.30). Todayâs technology has also changed the classroom for teachers and students alike. Technology demands that teachers utilize new strategies in the classroom to ensure that students receive the best public education possible.

'''Conclusion'''      

The history of public schools has shown that its purpose has had different priorities that has adapted to the different times. It started out in the New England colonies as a method of advancing religious beliefs. Then after the American Revolution as a new nation we used it as a common system to take people of different backgrounds and reinforce the bonds that tie Americans together. During our Industrial Revolution, at the turn of the century millions of immigrants looking for the American dream brought their children to America and this fueled school attendance. In the second half of the century public schools were the vehicle for equality and the need to stop discrimination. Finally as we enter the twenty-first century with most of our social problems under control we have turned to the new technology to educate our students as well as assessing that education. So the purpose of public schools our history has shown, has been primarily social reform and until recently only secondary in quality of education.

=='''Introduction and Learning Targets'''==
&lt;/font&gt;

Having been in school during the Ronal Reagan presidency and coming from a conservative political background these years were exciting to say the least.  My friends and family were excited to hear that Dr. William Bennett had been named Secretary of Education and would be investigating the state of education systems in the United States.  This article examines several of the risks identified by the National Commission on Excellence in Education headed by Dr. Bennett and assesses their relative merit vis-a-vie the advancements made in the United States public education systems.

This article will provide information required for the prospective teacher to:

&lt;font color=&quot;font color=&quot;#8D38C9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Identify specific risks outlined in the 1983 &quot;Nation At Risk&quot; document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Relate various means that the Public Education system has used to deal with the identified risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Name at least one method available to address the qualification risks faced by U.S. Public education teachers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Identify some choices for increasing teacher motivation from a list of options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

=='''Identified Risks'''==
In 1983 the National Commission on Excellence in Education enumerated the following risks faced by the public education systems at that time in an &quot;Open Letter to the American Public&quot; entitled &quot;A Nation At Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform.&quot; (Gardner, 1983)  The impetus for this commission, and ultimately this report (hereafter referred to as NAR), was the precipitous decline of the competitive advantage the United States enjoyed in the realm of education compared to that of other countries. (Segal, 2004)  While students abroad have long sought advanced degrees from many of the United States noted medical and legal engineering and technological degree programs there has been a noted decrease in the number of Unites States-born students in these schools.  

The NAR attempted to grasp for an ultimate direction the United States needed to take to insure the general increase in academic standards for both teachers and students.  The directives of this article will focus on the recommendations made toward the public education system since they account for over eighty-seven percent of all United States students.  (Hanushek, 1997)  While the report from the Commission covers a wide berth of issues pertinent to the state of education, this article will deal with the risks identified in dealing with teachers.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teacher qualifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teacher preparation weighted toward methods, vice subject matter expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salaries are not condusive to attract highly qualified and experienced individuals to the field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortage of teachers qualified to teach such courses as mathematics, science, languages, as well as courses for gifted and talented or special needs students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to other countries, there are severe deficiencies in the relative competency of both teachers and students in the areas of math and science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;font size=+2 COLOR=#800517&gt;

=='''Considerations'''==
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;70%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFFCC;
border: solid 10px #0000FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;All, regardless of race or class or economic status, are entitled to a fair chance and to the tools for developing their individual powers of mind and spirit to the utmost.  This promise means that all children by virtue of their of their own efforts, competently guided, can hope to attain the mature and informal judgement needed to secure gainful employment, and to manage their own lives, thereby serving not only their own interests but also the progress of society itself. (Gardner, 1983)&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

While many erstwhile pundits have severely criticized the Commissions findings on the state of education, we will for purposes of this exercise address the ways these identified risks have been addressed to date.  In truth, many of these deficiencies have been directly addressed in many of the High School programs throughout the country.  We must also remember that public school education monies are largely dependent on local property tax dollars and heavy state and federal subsidies.  It could be argued that local business investment in local schools may have a direct impact on supply of qualified graduates.

In practice high schools are designed to prepare students for both degree-oriented academics or vocational careers.  In terms of financials, âexpenditure outside of instructional staff salaries, going from one-fifth of total current expenditure in 1890 to one-third in 1940 and to more than one-half in 1990. â (Hanushek, p. 5).  School budgets must now cover everything from teachers but extended administrative personnel and counselors with extended social and even psychological skills.  During some of my own experience during teacher observation I learned that public schools are now in a situation that all applicants must be accepted and accommodated.  In addition, the introduction of technical resources such as computers and sophisticated measurement technologies into the public school classrooms has further extended expenses.  When you add the fact that these computers require software, licenses and extensive support resources the price tag for maintenance magnifies each passing year.

Many regard the subsequent reforms imposed upon the education system as &quot;laid down&quot; and often missing the mark with regard to root problems faced by teachers.  Teachers must now be equipped to handle a wide array of potential issues in their classrooms, especially with the onslaught of such conditions (properly or improperly diagnosed) as Attention Deficit Hyperac DisorderAcute Hyperactivity Disorder and those of students with English as a second language.  While no one ever regarded the costs of providing and maintaining a public education system was ever going to be inexpensive, the jury is still out concerning the return on investment when the public schools attempt to effectively teach under such circumstances.  No doubt this is why such programs as Standards of Learning (SOL) and demands for certification of all teachers has been promoted at both the state and federal levels.

&lt;font COLOR=GREEN&gt;

=='''Assessments'''==
&lt;/font&gt;

The publication of the NAR has resulted in numerous studies and controversies attempting to address some of the risks identified.  Among those dealing with teacher qualifications, references were made to increased expenditures for both staff and non-staff resources.  Schools today are equipped with technical devices such as cable television networks, local area networks, and sophisticated computer software in order to offer students access to the global world of educational opportunities.  These in turn require staff who are well versed in these technologies, their maintenance and current uses of them  in the global marketplace.  The implications of this trend are staggering in terms of the support structure that will be necessary to keep students on an equitable if not a more advanced standing compared to students in other countries.

Teachers are obtaining advanced degrees and in many states must obtain certification from state mandated programs in order to teach.  While these have been requirements for a number of years the breadth and extent to which these qualifications cover subject areas pertinent to modern classrooms has significant bearing.  Skills such as assessment, familiarity with current technology and multimedia are bearing fruit in terms of involving students and enhancing educator's means of communication and lesson planning.

Tuition tax credits have resulted from the long and bitter battle for vouchers for parents seeking some relief from the taxation burden when in fact they chose to send their children to private schools.  Whether for spiritual, advanced placement or special needs, the public school system did not always offer students a suitable environment to excel.

Standards of Learning (SOL) requirements have applied to children in public schools to gage their progress but unfortunately have caused the negative effect of pressure upon teachers to instruct toward specific test goals rather than tailor classes according to the more laudable intrinsic and formative form of pedagogy.  The summative aspect of SOLs provide only a benchmark but have treated the objective of learning as the proverbial black box. (Black and William, 1998)  Mr. Black and Mr. William contend the focus ought to be on the process of education and the use of formative assessment to insure students are on target with learning objectives and assisted as needed should they fall behind.  

Charter, private and home schools have increased in number during the last ten years and bear witness to the increased participation of parents into the educational welfare of their children.  Studies have shown that Charter schools have both increased the aptitude of both students who excel in public schools and minority students who would not otherwise have means or access to the advanced technologies or skilled teachers these institutions employ. (Hoxby, 2004) Home schooling have burgeoned and while their effectiveness has largely been at the primary school level, the author's experience is that the issues of limited socialization and technological opportunities faced by home schooled children are more than compensated by innovative parents pooling their collective resources to meet these needs.  With this population of students growing yearly it would behoove the public education systems to study their methods. 

Another consideration maybe that the problems with education today lay squarely in the laps of parents and guardian involvement in their children's learning.  Given that the composition of students throughout the United States has become multicultural, the fact of cultural variances with regard to expectation of parents in regard to their children's knowledge levels brings to bear a much broader element of adaptability by teachers than even ten years ago.  The rate of growth of Hispanic full-time teachers increased 2.7 percent to 5 percent between 1998 and 2003. (Weinberg, p. 10)  Arguments have been made for bi-lingual education and in many states such as California, Florida and Texas.  

Arguments have been made for bi-lingual education and in many area of this country such as Southern California and much of Texas and Florida this may in fact be a necessity.  Following an original supposition of this article one could forcefully contend that if answers to educational reform should be indicative of the local community than in fact what happened in the Salinas high school district provides an excellent example of parental activism with regard to not just what their children ought to be taught but how it should be taught. (Arriaza, p. 14)  This argument as been argued at a more universal level by Mr. Author Combs who notes that âeducational reforms which do not have whole-hearted support of those who must carry them out are a waste of time, effort and taxpayer's money.â (Combs, p. 4)

Another risk which was not broached by NAR was that of morals.  When I was in elementary school I remember seeing videos about family planning produced by Planned Parenthool and videos discouraging from drug use like the plague.  As an adult, I am offended that I only received part of the story with regard to these ethics while the Christian point of view was not even considered.  Today school teachers and administrators cannot even provide an aspirin to a child without a release from the parent or doctor.  Yet this same student can receive counseling about such moral decisions as birth control or abuse prevention with no consultation of the child's guardian. (FCPS, 2008)

=='''Conclusion'''==
&lt;/font&gt;

School reforms ought to be a continual process.  Unless public schools are constantly questioning their direction, their curriculum, and their motivations the changing world will continue to force their obsolescence.  So in answer to the title of this article, the author proposes a resounding âYES.â  Risks are a part of life as everyone can attest.  In fact it is the human condition to not only contend with but to face and conquer risks each day.  While the right to education by all is firmly upheld in these United States there are many troubles introduced and even some ethical considerations which are inadvertently compromised.  The degree to which our nation's educational systems, whether public or private, contend with the ever changing educational requirements will effect the competitiveness and even the moral fortitude of today's students.  The ability to effectively teach our young the skills required to think, judge and choose properly, based on sound learning principles, will ultimately decide the degree of success our future leaders will have facing the challenges of the world.

== Learning Targets ==
After reading this article, students should be able to:

*Explain what was said in the original report ''A Nation at Risk''
*Identify indicators that the school system is stable
*Identify indicators suggesting schools are in trouble
*Name reasons as to why the country's education system is struggling


== Introduction ==

In August of 1981, the Secretary of Education created an organization called the National Commission on Excellence in Education. This vast group of people was instructed to research and collect extensive data on the condition, quality, and progress of American Education. By April of 1983, the commission submitted a report called ''A Nation At Risk''. The release plainly stated that American education was at serious risk and that it had become a mere fraction of the marvel it once was. The quality of learning was being washed away by mediocrity. It revealed a shocking list of facts and statistics regarding poor student performance and a general lack of knowledge among adults. The authors also went on to explain the dangers of living in a country that could expect to be surpassed in knowledge by other leading industrial countries. It even went as far as to suggest that those who couldn't keep up intellectually in the U.S should have certain rights and privileges revoked. (&quot;A Nation At Risk,&quot; 1983)The initial reactions to this document varied from insult and outrage to commendation and praise. But to the majority of the population, the state of education had never been presented as being so endangered. And, after reading the brazen report that declared our entire society in jeopardy, the public all shared the same question. Are we really?

== American Education is Stable ==

Once the controversial report was released, more heads than ever before were turned towards the condition and quality of schools and learning. (Wehner, 2009)Those appalled by the claims continue to defend education to this day. Evidence to support this side of the argument include a number of improvements made over the past twenty years. According to the National enter of Education Statistics (NCES), studies of high school sophomores show an increase in the time spent on homework. From 1980 to 2002, the percentage of those who spent more than ten hours a week on schoolwork increased from seven to thirty-seven percent. In addition, the numbers of high school graduates and of students enrolling in college have gradually and steadily improved over the past thirty years. (NCES, 2006) Other observations performed indicate a rise in the quantity of students taking Advanced Placement courses in high school. There has also been a rise in the average IQ test scores among youths. (Williams, 2000)

== American Education is in Trouble ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #ECD872;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
 If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war. As it stands we have allowed this to happen to ourselves. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

These powerful words from the introduction to A'' Nation at Risk'' still ring true to millions of people. The consensus of much of the American public is that there exists a huge gap between what students are learning and what they are capable of learning. (Wehner, 2008) A plethora of studies have been conducted over the past several decades to assert achievement in the U.S. According to author of ''Education: Opposing Viewpoints'', SAT scores have dropped 55 points on the verbal section and 23 in math. More than 40% of high school seniors scored below average in math on the 2005 National Assessment of Education Progress. (&quot;Core Problems,&quot; 2008)The same test revealed certain &quot;common knowledge unknown to a percentage of high school seniors. One third of the students were unaware that the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Nearly half couldn't put 9% in the form of a fraction. A third couldn't name the countries that fought in World War II. Only 6% had the math skills of what was considered proficient a generation ago. The list goes on regarding other knowledge about the civil war, Brown Vs. Board of Education, Christopher Columbus, and numerous other not so well-known chapters of study. (Williams, 2000) With this shocking lack of information, its no wonder the country does so poorly on international assessments. According to the NCES, the U.S ranked 24th out of 29th on the 2006 international test measuring abilities in reading, math, and science. (NCES, 2006) American high-school seniors who participated in the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) placed 19 out of 21 developed nations in math and 16 out of 21 in science. (Bennett, ''et al.'') In communities across the country, students graduate without basic reading and math skills. This can explain the high demand for remedial courses in college today. In 2000, one third of college students were required to take remedial classes. (Williams, 2000) However, in some institutions, such as California State University, that ratio was as high as half of all freshman. Employers all over the U.S feel the effects too. More and more employers report difficulty in locating applicants with the skills, work ethic, and capabilities to fill technologically challenging positions. The severe shortage in qualified Americans signifies that students leave school without the vital knowledge critical to our future. ( Bennet, ''et al.'') 

== How It Became A Reality ==

The blame for the countries current state is aimed in several directions. The most popular include the intense focus on standardized tests, the unqualified selection of teachers, low standards, inadequate school funding, and outside social forces.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #ECD872;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;It is not so important to know everything as to appreciate what we learn.&quot; -Hannah Moore &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Students, teachers, parents, and other concerned citizens have come to detest standardized testing. &quot;Test-mandates are choking the life out of classrooms.&quot; writes Sylvia Bruni, a teacher of 40 years from Texas. (Glickman, 2004) The current rigid focus on standardized tests eliminates any creativity, experimentation, or hands-on activities in the classroom. Schools can no longer provide the time or the opportunity for students to &quot;explore their own interests or to encourage them to pursue learning outside of textbooks and assignments that are geared towards a single standardized test. (Glickman, 2004) In addition, the extreme emphasis on tests teaches kids how to memorize facts. They do nothing to help develop such skills as critical thinking, problem solving, arguing with conviction, invention and other skills desperately needed in the 21st century. (Schmoker, 2009)

Schools are dealing with high demand for teachers from coast to coast. Student enrollment is rapidly increasing and, qualified instructors are coming up short. Because schools cannot find able candidates, they are forced to either lower teacher qualification standards. (Glickman) The inability to recruit competent instructors denies students critical resources and, threatens the vitality of our nation. (&quot;Core Problems&quot;, 2008)The alternative to hiring unprepared teachers is to use out-of-field teachers; meaning, classes would be taught by teachers who may not be certified or have academic majors in the field of study. Unfortunately, this happens twice as often in high-poverty schools. (Sawchuck, 2008) This perpetuates the achievement gap and contradicts our democratic principles.

Low standards add to the decline in academic achievement. Teachers and parents tend to agree that standards are much lower today then they were when they were in school. Low expectations for students lead to unprepared high-school and college students. By creating such classes and assignments that do not ask much of its pupils, students begin to want to stay away from hard work. Any rigorous coursework is met with little or no effort. (Glickman, 2004)

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #ECD872;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;The poor performance of schools and the lack of achievement among many of our own students is indeed about money.&quot; -Bill Cosby &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Schools today are receiving less funding than ever before. They are under extreme pressure with new directives that are creating larger budgets for tests, more requirements, and unfunded programs. This just further contributes to the growing gap in education given to the wealthy kids in comparison with the poor. Senator Jim Jeffords reveals that 60 years ago, the federal government set aside almost 11% of the national budget for education. Today, school funding receives just under 3%. (Glickman, 2004) Without the appropriate financial compensation, schools cannot provide the qualified teachers, updated teaching methods and technology that American students deserve.

It must not be forgotten that many social factors affect the output of student success. Playing an important role are irresponsible and/or uninvolved parents. A child's upbringing is crucial in the development of a caring, intelligent, well-rounded student. The growing rate of employed teenagers can also be a concern. Time spent in the workforce is time taken away from studies. (Williams, 2000) But typically, one of the most significant factors is the economic status of students. Those living in low-income households generally perform poorer due to the poor quality of the schools in impoverished areas. All the problems held to blame for low student performance are highly associated with areas in need. For every hopeful student waiting for their acceptance letter to college, there are thousands who won't ever share the experience due to their financial situations of which they have no control. (Scully, 2008) In fact, a study in 2001 revealed that the high-school drop-out rate was six times higher for the poorest 20% of students versus the wealthiest 20%. (NCES, 2006)

== My Thoughts ==

From what I've witnessed in school, I can characterize the state of education as dismal. My personal experiences in high-school forced me to realize that my peers were ill-equipped to handle the most basic aspects of life. The fundamentals of math, science, reading, and writing were practically absent. This realization is disturbing enough. But what startled me the most, what still worries me today is the priorities of the youth I encountered. My peers cared so little about learning, humanity, themselves or their future. When did these things become invaluble? The aimless attitudes are the most shocking trend in students today. In ''The Path to Purpose'', author William Damon discusses this very idea. His studies confirm that 25% of youths show no drive, no interest in achieving something purposeful with their lives. He continues to say that a sizable portion of college students seek careers based on the salary, regardless of the actual work. Damon also mentions a professor at UCLA who has also noticed a &quot;drift in the intentions of college students from developing a meaningful philosophy of life toward being very well off financially.&quot; (Glazer, 2009) Has education become so unappealing, so riddled with defects that students don't even want to learn? Despite all the obstacles that education faces, the country must never give up. In order to prove to students everywhere that an education is worth the effort, our nation has to put forth the effort to correct its flaws.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #ECD872;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;Of all the civil rights for which the world has struggled and fought for 5,000 years, the right to learn is undoubtedly the most fundamental.&quot; -W.E.B. DuBois &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== School funding: Are all schools created equal?  ==


By Shelly Simonds


Just imagine; youâre moving to a new city, youâve got a wife and two young kids and tons of money.  Where would you want to send your kids to school? 

If you moved to New Hampshire, you could send them to a private boarding school called Phillips Exeter Academy where they have small class sizes, talented students and a one billion dollar endowment (Fabrikant, 2008).  Or you could send your child to a poor public school district an hour away in Lawrence, Massachusetts where students have at times needed to bring in their own toilet paper (Kozol 1992).

Hummmmâ¦. difficult decision?  I donât think so.  All parents make rational choices about their childrenâs education. Unfortunately, poor parents in the inner city donât have the same choices as wealthy and middle class parents because they are physically stuck where they are by limited opportunities. Minorities in the inner city are the biggest victims of school funding inequality, or the way some schools in America have more resources than others.
 
The topic of equal funding for schools is very important for teachers because many of us are asked to prepare students for a successful future without adequate resources.  In my opinion, we are increasingly held accountable for the success or failure of our students, although we are rarely provided with the facilities, materials and support needed for success.  

This article will provide teachers with new information on how their schools are funded and show how current inequalities in school funding impact minority students.   In it, I will argue that the inability of the United States to fix inequalities in school funding could hurt our countryâs future economic growth.  This inequality also threatens to create an underclass of people who cannot find jobs and as a result, place a drain on government resources.  The article will conclude by presenting multiple perspectives on ways to solve the current problems in school funding.  
 


== Why are there inequities in Americaâs schools? ==



Public schools are funded by a complex mix of local property tax revenue, state funding and federal grants.  The federal government currently only contributes 9 percent of K-12 funding with states and localities contributing the rest (Miller, 2008).   
 
Although most people agree that more money should be spent on school funding, there is much debate over which level of government should provide the money.  This disagreement has stood in the way of school finance reform (Walter and Sweetland, 2003).  Both local and state budgets are under increased pressure for funds in areas such as pensions, health care, and corrections (Walter and Sweetland, 2003).  

Local control of schools, and school funding, dates back to colonial times when colonists were leery of central government authority.  When rich and poor lived side by side in cities and towns property taxes seemed like a fair way to fund the schools all children attended (Miller, 2008).  But the funding gap began to increase in the 20th century as the wealthy and middle classes began moving out of large cities and into the suburbs, leaving poorer citizens behind.  



== What is the impact of this inequity on minorities? ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;

'''Why it matters''' 

&lt;li&gt;The United States once had the highest percentage of students attending university in the world. Today European countries are sending almost 50 percent of their students to college â whereas just over a third of US students participate in higher education today (Darling-Hammond, 2007).  

&lt;li&gt;The lost taxes from one class year of high school dropouts equals $192 billion dollars, or 1.6 percent of gross domestic product, according to Rouse (2006), an economists whose research appeared in Education Week.


&lt;li&gt;Dropping out of high school increases your chances of going to jail. According to research by Moretti (2006) published in Education Week, the United States could save over $1 billion a year for each percent we increase high school graduation rates, just because of the reduction in crime. 
 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The reason that the school funding issue is so important is that it has a huge impact on minorities who are the majority of students attending schools in the inner-city.  These are also the schools without a large property tax base.  Over time many inner-city schools have been the victims of a downward spiral in revenue which occurs like this: Once schools become known for having insufficient resources, those with means move else where, which causes housing prices to drop, which in turn means even fewer tax dollars can be collected to pay for schools (Miller, 2008). The result is that the poorer schools get poorer and the richer schools get richer.

âThe dirty little secret of local control is the enormous tax advantage it confers on better off Americans; communities with high property wealth can tax themselves at low rates and still generate far more dollars per pupil than poor communities taxing themselves heavily,â argued Matt Miller in the online edition of the Atlantic Monthly (2008).

This dynamic has a huge impact on minorities, who make up the majority of those attending poorly-financed city schools.  Students of color made up 69 percent of students in the 100 largest school districts3 (Darling-Hammond, 2007).

As the number of minorities increase as a percentage of our population, our failure to educate them in urban schools will decrease the number of our citizens who can enter the job market of the future (Darling-Hammond, 2007).  This failure to invest in education will cost the country in economic growth over the long run. 

According to Darling-Hammond (2007) âThose who are undereducated can no longer access the labor market. While the United States must fill many of its high-tech jobs with individuals educated overseas, a growing share of its own citizens are unemployable and relegated to the welfare or prison systems, representing a drain on the nationâs economy and social well-being rather than a contribution to our national welfare,â (p 318).

== How can we provide equal opportunity in education? ==


&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Improve teacher quality'''
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
One of the main indicators of school success, or failure, is the quality of instruction students receive.  An increasing body of research has linked student success to the quality of teachers, according to Darling-Hammond (2007).  She suggests a national policy as aggressive as the post World War II Marshall Plan to increase the number of qualified teachers in impoverished schools.  This new policy would include: $25,000 service scholarships to draw teachers to high-need school districts; stipends to experienced teachers who agree to teach in high-poverty schools; improved teacher preparation and professional development; as well as programs to mentor all beginning teachers. (Darling-Hammond, 2007).
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Increase federal funding'''
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
A number of experts have pointed to the need for more federal government support of education.  Darling-Hammond also recommends that the federal government create programs to promote âthinking curriculumsâ which would emphasize problem solving and the higher-order thinking skills required of the 21st Century jobs.

Others are calling for the federal government to greatly increase the amount of funding it grants local schools.  Much of the recent educational gain by European countries can be attributed to centrally funded schools with clear national standards for education (Miller, 2008).

âIf weâre serious about improving our schools, and especially about raising up the lowest, Uncle Samâs contribution must rise to 25 or 30 percent of the total,â stated Miller (2008, online).
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Use lawsuits to ensure equal funding'''
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Another strategy being pursued to improve the quality of inner-city schools is fiscal equity litigation.  This entails using lawsuits to force states to provide adequate educational opportunities for all students. They are also called adequacy lawsuits.  Over the last 20 years many such lawsuits have been successful and funding models having been declared unconstitutional in 17 states (Rebell, 1999).   Unfortunately, enforcing such rulings has been difficult and many rulings have been ignored by state legislatures.  

The recent court rulings in favor of more equitable funding shows that people are increasingly concerned about fairness in education (Rebell, 1999). According to Rebell (1999) âwhat seems to be at play here is the resurgence of a powerful democratic imperative at the core of the American political traditionâ (p. 5).  In other words, more and more people are seeing equal access to education as an essential part of democracy.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Conclusion: is change on the horizon? ==

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This change in attitude is good news for those in favor of more evenly distributed school funding.  For many years Americans have stuck to the notion that our current funding system offers equal opportunity to all (Darling-Hammond, 2007). This belief has been a major obstacle to change because, until there is a consensus about resource problems in our poorest schools, we wonât begin looking for solutions.

âThe common presumption that schools currently provide a level playing filed paralyzes necessary efforts to invest in schools attended primarily by students of color,â according to Darling-Hammond (p. 329).

In this way, I think the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 may have moved the country closer to accepting the fact of inequality. Now that the government acknowledges the problem as a matter of law, it needs to invest real financial resources in the solution.

Efforts to equalize educational resources are already working in my city, Newport News, Virginia.  Millions of dollars were recently spent to renovate a crumbling urban school and, as a result, children from more wealthy neighborhoods are happily riding the bus downtown to attend. The school, Booker T Washington, now has a Marine science focus, a new aquarium, a small number of students, and some of the best teachers in the city.  My daughter has begged me to let her go there for middle school.  Difficult decision?  I donât think so.

Where's the delete function?

As to the implementation itself, it looks somewhat over the top ... overengineered, I mean. Why pass N, M as parameters to a constructor! People make fine macro interpreters. Put static final int M=4; static final int N=4; in the class and you'll find that you get rid of a superflous constructor. People are smart enough to change the numbers as they wish, and smart enough to complicate up their own constructors!

Anyway .. what's &quot;N&quot;? Keys in inner nodes? Eh? Are you confusing keys and pointers? This whole thing is just mysterious. I suspect what you have called LNode is really Leaf. What you have is clear as mud, but it looks as though there's hope. It seems like the English used is bad, which may be the reason for much of my puzzlement.

Anyway, you need to define the strutcure up top, so Node and Leaf definitions must come first. Avoid silly generalizations. People abstract fine by themselves. Those casts are nutty. but remove the comments that say so .. that's worse. And enough of the Leaf extends Node extends I don't know what. Each must be independently defined for clarity. Remove the protected business too .. it serves for nothing. Remove all abstract stuff.

Ditto on dropping that compareTo nonsense. Use == ! or whatever. People abstract fine by themselves. Don't do it for them. It obscures.

Also, most comments break the 80 char per line limit.

Yep - that code is so confusing, it needs radical revision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Poker is a game, whose history is of much debate by many circles since it is not known exactly when poker was created, however, there were many games that used hand rankings when incorporating betting that were very similar to Poker. The game that was most closely related to poker and was the first known to be so similar was the German game Pochspiel. 

Another game that closely resembles the game of poker is the Persian game As Nas. When poker was first played in the United States, the game consisted of four players being dealt five cards using a 20 card pack, which would have made it a direct derivative of As Nas.

Another game which was similar to poker was a French game called Poque and in fact was played in a region very close to where the game of poker was said to have originated. It is also said that the name of poker came from this game and also another Irish game called Poca. 

Even though there is much argument as to where the game of poker exactly originated from, there are many experts and historians that state that the game of poker is influenced by all of the games listed above, not only influencing name, but as well as influencing bluffing and hand rankings as well. The game of poker has evolved greatly from these early ancestors who can all argue the claim that the game of poker was created from their game.

      <comment>/* The Electronvolt */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Just as an object at a distance r from a sphere has gravitational potential energy, a charge at a distance r from another charge has electrical potential energy &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt;. This is given by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{elec} = V_{elec}q&lt;/math&gt;,

where V&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; is the potential difference between the two charges Q and q. In a uniform field, voltage is given by:

&lt;math&gt;V_{elec} = E_{elec}d&lt;/math&gt;,

where d is distance, and E&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; is electric field strength. Combining these two formulae, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{elec} = qE_{elec}d&lt;/math&gt;

For the field around a point charge, the situation is different. By the same method, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{elec} = \frac{-kQq}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

If a charge loses electric potential energy, it must gain some other sort of energy. You should also note that force is the rate of change of energy with respect to distance, and that, therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{elec} = \int{F\; dr}&lt;/math&gt;

==The Electronvolt==

The electronvolt (eV) is a unit of energy equal to the charge of a proton or a positron. Its definition is the kinetic energy gained by an electron which has been accelerated through a potential difference of 1V:

1 eV = 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; J

For example:
If a proton has an energy of 5MeV then in Joules it will be = 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; x 1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt; J.

Using eV is an advantage when high energy particles are involved as in case of particle accelerators.

==Summary of Electric Fields==
You should now know (if you did the electric fields section in the right order) about four attributes of electric fields: force, field strength, potential energy and potential. These can be summarised by the following table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|align = &quot;center&quot;| '''Force'''

&lt;math&gt;F_{elec} = \frac{-kQq}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|align = &quot;center&quot;| → ''integrate'' →

''with respect to r''
|align = &quot;center&quot;| '''Potential Energy'''

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{elec} = \frac{-kQq}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|align = &quot;center&quot; colspan = &quot;3&quot;| ↓ ''per. unit charge'' ↓
|-
|align = &quot;center&quot;| '''Field Strength'''

&lt;math&gt;E_{elec} = \frac{-kQ}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|align = &quot;center&quot;| → ''integrate'' → 

''with respect to r''
|align = &quot;center&quot;| '''Potential'''

&lt;math&gt;V_{elec} = \frac{-kQ}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

This table is very similar to that for [[A-level_Physics_(Advancing_Physics)/Gravitational_Potential|gravitational fields]]. The only difference is that field strength and potential are per. unit charge, instead of per. unit mass. This means that field strength is not the same as acceleration. Remember that integrate means 'find the area under the graph' and differentiate (the reverse process) means 'find the gradient of the graph'.

==Questions==

k = 8.99 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

1. Convert 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt; J to MeV.

2. Convert 0.9 GeV to J.

3. What is the potential energy of an electron at the negatively charged plate of a uniform electric field when the potential difference between the two plates is 100V?

4. What is the potential energy of a 2C charge 2cm from a 0.5C charge?

5. What is represented by the gradient of a graph of electric potential energy against distance from some charge?

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt; 
&lt;big&gt;
*	Students will be able to identify what most Americans think about funding and education.&lt;br&gt;
*	Students will be able to explain what might happen to poverty levels if states cut funding or increase funding. &lt;br&gt;
*	Students will be able to describe one out of many suggested reforms for public education funding.&lt;br&gt;
*	Students will be able to identify possible effects of the economic recession on funding and public schools in Virginia.&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; '''Introduction''' &lt;/font&gt;==

Schools are the building blocks of education. Such an important institution requires a massive amount of money to run smoothly and at a high quality.  There are many different aspects to school funding.Questions such as who funds schools and how much they spend, how effective the amount of funding a school receives demonstrates the poverty level of the surrounding community, how reforms can be implemented in the way that funding is distributed, and lastly, how the current recession will affect the funding of different schools.  Of course, the topics listed above are only a small sample of the aspects of the multifaceted issue of school funding.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; '''Who Spends What?''' &lt;/font&gt;==

One point that many Americans agree on when it comes to education is that not enough money is allocated for schools and education in general. Another point is that if more money is spent on public education then learning would increase. Many Americans (22%) agree that the lack of funds for schools is the education systemâs biggest flaw ( Howell &amp; West, 2008, para. 2).
Although Americans agree that spending money on education should be increased, they tend to underestimate the amount per pupil that is actually being spent. In 2004 and 2005 the national average per- pupil expenditures was $9,435. The lowest per-pupil spending was about $5,644 and the highest was $ 24, 939. (Howell &amp; West, para. 9).

Public education funding comes from three main sources: federal, state and local governments. For the fiscal years of 2006-2007, the national average for federal spending was 8.9% of the budget.  The state government on average spent 47.6% and the local governments took the remaining 43.5% of the budget. During the same years, Virginia placed more responsibility on the local governments to fund the schools. In Virginia, federal funding accounted for 7.5% of the budget, state governments paid for 39.1% of the budget and the local governments paid for the majority of the budget paying for 53.5% of the budget (Boitnott, 2008).

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; '''School Funding and Poverty''' &lt;/font&gt;==

Poverty affects many different parts of the United States, and certain areas are more poverty-stricken than others. Poverty is a major concern in America and people are constantly trying to implement programs to lessen poverty throughout the country. Recent studies show that increasing state education expenditures could decrease the states income inequality. This would allow the poor to rise out of the poverty level. As more money is spent on education, education at different schools becomes more equal eventually leading to a higher level of income equality. As education in all of a stateâs schools becomes more equal, more people have the chance of going to a college or university and graduating. This will lead to higher paying jobs therefore decreasing poverty levels (Behr, Christofides &amp; Neelakantan, 2004, p. 13).

On the other hand, as state school funding is cut the poorest children suffer the most. This happens because the local governments have to pay the amount that the state cut. The poorest communities cannot afford to pay this; therefore schools have a smaller budget and fewer resources.  Ultimately the quality of education lowers and the equality of education among the public schools in the states diminish (Boitnott, 2008).



==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; '''Reform''' &lt;/font&gt;==

As stated above, most Americans agree that more money should be spent on public education. Current systems for allocating funding are in place, but some state that these programs should be reformed. 

Some basic reforms that many actively suggest are as follows: âbasing funding on student head counts, connecting education dollars to results, supporting more innovation and experimentation, and holding schools and districts responsible for making continuous progress to improve student achievementsâ (Viadero, 2008, p. 8).

Recent Studies and research projects call for a more large scale reform of the school finance system. The results of  the School Finance Project states that the problem is not that we are necessarily spending too little on our school systems, instead the way the money is being spent is unpractical. More money is being spent by on elective courses than core courses, and a lot of state money goes to categorical programs instead of helping the disadvantaged. The study suggests solving this problem all of the money being spent should be added up and divided based on enrollment in all schools K-12. After this happens all of the schools that are still struggling would receive extra money, but only if they are willing to make changes to improve which might include: personnel and program changes. Overall, the new system would place more responsibility on the school leaders to decide how to spend their money (McNeil, 2008, p. 10).

Reforms can either be implemented by changing how much funding is given to schools or by changing how that funding is used by school districts.

Currently, the United States is experiencing an economic recession. This almost certainly affects the amount of funding that public schools will receive.

In Virginia, Governor Kaine has already proposed budget amendments to the state budget for the fiscal years of 2009 and 2010. These budget alterations will decrease the amount of state sponsored school funding. Governor Kaine has proposed permanent budget cuts in the part of the Virginia state budget that goes to fund public schools.  He has proposed doing this by adjusting the funding formula. This will decrease state support for public schools, and it will last longer than the recession of the economy (Boitnott, 2008).
Whenever a hard economic time faces the United States, and in turn Virginia budgets must be adjusted. In previous recessions or other difficult times, the people of Virginia have fought to keep public education budgets close to the same.  Many Virginians feel that this is an excellent precedent to follow for the current recession(Boitnott). 

The Constitution of Virginia States: â The General Assembly shall provide for a system of free public elementary and secondary schools for all children of school age throughout the Commonwealth, and shall seek to ensure that an educational program of high quality is established and continually maintainedâ(qtd. in Boitnott). This shows that a quality education is important to the people of Virginia and that just because times are hard we should not sacrifice the education of our youth. If by cutting budgets and school funding we are sacrificing the costs of our youth, then we are not abiding by the state constitution.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; '''Conclusion''' &lt;/font&gt;==

School funding is very important. The money that the federal, state and local governments give each school allows that school to educate their students with the best resources available. When funding to a certain school is cut ultimately the income equality for that community or state lowers, but on the other hand when the funding for schools is increased education equality is increased which helps the community in the long run(Behr, Christofides &amp; Neelakantan, 2004, p. 13). Many people agree that the current system of financing schools is flawed. Some people state that in order to fix this more money should be poured into the education system. Others state that by simply changing the way the money is used the education system would benefit greatly(Howell &amp; West, 2008). In the current economic recession, money is tight and school budgets are being shaved. In Virginia, Governor Kaine hopes to reformulate the way that schools receive funding in order to permanently lower the state funding of schools.  This will create more of a strain on already stretched local budgets(Boitnott, 2008). 

In my opinion, under the current school finance system schools are not equal. Some schools, usually those located in the richer communities have more resources from their local governments. Reforms to the system could solve this problem, yet it is extremely complicated and it is not likely that schools will ever be completely equal.

I feel that school funding is a complex issue and the only way that the best system can be formulated is through constant revision and experimentation. The ultimate goal is for education to be the best it can be in each state. The ways that schools are funded is just a way to meet this goal.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; '''Review Questions''' &lt;/font&gt;==

1. What is one thing that Americans agree on about education?
   A. There is generally not enough funding.
   B. The federal government should fund about half of education costs.
   C. Taxes should be raised to allow for more funding.
   D. The education system is efficient and needs to be left alone

2. Who is affected the most by a cut in state funding?
   A. The children from wealthy families.
   B. The children from middle-class families.
   C. The children from poor families.
   D. All children are affected equally.


3. If 92% of students from Ghent School pass the SOL's, 89% of students from Fairlawn Elementary School pass the SOL's, 67% of students from Popular Hall Elementary School pass the SOL's and 98% of students from Sewell's Point Elementary School pass the SOL's which school will receive the most state funding based on a basic school finance reform?
   A. Ghent School
   B. Fairlawn Elementary
   C. Popular Hall Elementary 
   D. Sewell's Point Elementary

4. Suppose that the City of Virginia Beach expects to have a budget defecit of $10 million this coming fiscal year. The State of Virginia plans to cut their funding of schools by 1%. What will most likely happen to the funding of the schools in Virginia Beach?
   A. The federal government will decrease their support as well.
   B. The city of Virginia Beach will pick up the funding that the state dropped.
   C. The city of Virginia Beach will not be able to make up the difference; funding will drop.
   D. The federal government will increase how much money it gives to the schools in the city.


Answers: 

1. The answer is '''A'''. .Americans agree that not enough money is spent on education. Americans also generally agree that if more money is spent on education then the quality of education would increase.

2. The answer is '''C'''. This is true because when a state cuts funding to public schools, the local governments have to make up the difference in the budget. Children from poor families tend to live in communities where the local government cannot afford to pay this difference, thus causing the schools to not be funded adequately.

3. The answer is '''D'''. One basic school finance reform is connecting education dollars to results. Since Sewell's Point had the largest percent of students to pass the SOL's they should receive the most funding from the state.

4. The answer is '''C'''. The city government would normally pick up the slack from the state, but since it is experiencing its own budget defecit it will not have the ability to fund the schools with more money.

=Who is the Boss? How are Individual Schools Governed?=

== Learning Target ==

Students will identify the tiers of the hierarchy of public school governing.

Students will identify the responsibilities of each tier.

== The Hierarchy of the System ==

Who is the boss in the school systems?  The public school governing system is actually a hierarchy (March, 1978).  There are several tiers to this hierarchy beginning with the federal level and ending with the individual teachers.  It is a pyramid of administrators doing everything they can to educate today's students.

== Federal and State ==

While some may believe that administration of schools starts with the federal government, the truth is that on the federal level there is very little involvement in education, even in funding (Federal Role, n.d.).  The federal government sets some guidelines for education, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, but not specific ones such as curriculum taught.  In actuality, the states have most of the power over their own schools and what they teach (Education Commission of the States [ECS], 1999).  The states set what the students will learn and what standards they have to meet.  This means that if a child is meeting their grade level standard in Tennessee they may or may not be meeting the Virginia standards for that grade level.  States try to decide what knowledge is imperative for students to learn before they move on to the next grade or even college (ECS, 1999).

States also choose the standards that the teachers must meet (ECS, 1999).  The state wants the teacher to be able to educate the students to achieve the set standards.  There are things that every state requires, but each of them has their own variation.  Every state requires the teacher to have a college degree and some form of standardized testing to be able to teach in their public school system.  There are national tests available, but each state requires different ones.  Teachers moving to a different state may be required to complete a new test or even a new course before gaining licensure in that state.  

States have the largest financial role in the schools.  Very little funding comes from the federal government.  Most of the federal funding is applied for by the individual school in the form of a grant for a special purpose (Federal Role, n.d.).  The states provide teacher salaries and the money required to run each individual school.  Each individual school has a PTA that can help the school gain funds for things like technology (ECS, 1999).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;30%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: red;border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;'''Hierarchy Tiers on a District Level'''

School Board

Superintendent

Principal

Teacher&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== District ==

Each state is broken up into districts (ECS, 1999).  Most administration deals on a small level, either within the district, or in the individual school (March, 1978).  The districts each have their own school board made of elected members (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.).  Those boards decide how their schools will achieve the standards set by the state.  They will also decide anything else they believe the schools should be doing to service their district's children.  Some of these things include overseeing the curriculum and helping to promote better teaching techniques (Education Administrators, n.d.).  The board has to have all schools achieving at a level set by the state, so they use their resources to push the schools to achieve the standards they have set (ECS, 1999).

== Superintendent ==

A superintendent is chosen to oversee the schools in the district (ECS, 1999).  Much like a politician, this office is often given to those who have worked their way up from the bottom of the hierarchy (March, 1978).  They are in charge of making sure the schools are doing what is required by the school board.  They make routine visits to schools to check on how they are doing.  They work with the principals and teachers to see that children are getting the most out of each school day.

== Principal and Assistant Principal ==

The district hires principals to oversee each individual school.  These principals are there to see that the teachers are doing their job and the children are getting the education they deserve (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.).  They are responsible for scheduling, planning the daily activities, and managing the overall activities of the school (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.).  Principals make routine visits to classrooms to make sure they are running smoothly and that teachers are making the most of their instructional time.  Another difficult duty of the principal is the budget for the school. The principal must decide how to best spend the school's money (Education Administrators, n.d.).

The schools also have assistant principals.  These administrators help the principal in the daily activities of the school. They also handle most of the discipline problems leaving the principal available to focus on other duties (Education Administrators, n.d.).

== Teacher ==

Each school is responsible for the hire of their teachers.  The principal can decide who to hire as long as they are qualified by the state (ECS, 1999).  Teachers apply for a job through the district and might interview at several schools before being hired by one.  Each school is different so principals often look for a teacher who will fit into the school.

The teacher is the one with the most direct affect on students.  They ultimately decide what happens in the classrooms (ECS, 1999).  When the door closes every morning it is up to the teacher to make an effective use of time and get children to those standards set by the state.  If children in their classrooms are not performing well, the teacher is held responsible.


== Summary ==
In summary, the federal government makes general regulations for education and contributes very little funding for the schools (Federal Role, n.d.).

The states have most of the power because they are able to set the standards for teachers and students, and they fund the public school system almost completely (ECS, 1999).

The district has the power in the area entrusted to them by the state. Each district has an elected school board that determines how state standards are achieved and anything else they see fit to better the students' education (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.).

The superintendent oversees the schools in the district and makes sure they are following what is set by the states and the district (ECS, 1999).

The principals manage their individual school with assistance from the assistant principal (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.).

The teachers instruct the students in accordance with the standards set before them by all levels of the hierarchy.

== Review Questions ==

1. Which tier of the hierarchy of education is responsible for hiring teachers?
   a. the federal government
   b. the principal
   c. the school board
   d. the state

2. Which is not a responsibility of the principal?
   a. budgeting the individual school's money
   b. hiring teachers
   c. making standards for curriculum
   d. scheduling activities

3. A teacher does not meet the standards set by the state, district, and school. Who will act on correcting the situation?
   a. the board of education
   b. the federal government
   c. the principal
   d. the superintendent

4. When will the state get directly involved in an individual school?
   a. when the an individual teacher is not teaching the curriculum set by the state
   b. when the building needs repair or rebuilding
   c. when the school board sets standards higher than the state's standards
   d. when the school is not meeting state standards repeatedly

== Answers ==

1. B â The principal hires the teachers that they think fit best in the school.

2. C â The principal does not make a standard for the curriculum.  The states and districts choose the curriculum that will be taught.

3. C â The principal will deal with the situation because if it is not a matter of the whole school, it is dealt with on a small level.

4. D â The state does not intervene in individual schools unless the school is not meeting state standards and steps have not been taken by the lower tiers of the hierarchy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Chain of Command in Public Schools==

==Learning Points==
Student will learn about:
-the Department of Education
-The School Board
-The Superintendent
-The Principal

[[File:School_Governing_order.JPG]]

==The Chain of Command in Public Schools==
In a public school setting, the school, itself, is run by the principal but the principal answers to the superintendent. The superintendent then answers to and works hand in hand with the school board. The school board then must set rules and regulations according to those set by the Department of Education, both state and federal. (EIUS, 2009)

==Department of Education==
The Department of Education is the United States way of interacting with the school system. (EIUS, 2009) The Department of Education was made by the Department of Education Organization Act on October 17, 1979 which was signed into law by Jimmy Carter. (USDE, 2009) The law did not go into affect until the following year on May fourth. (USDE, 2009) The Department of Education is overseen by the United States Secretary of Education. (USDE, 2009) The department employs 5,000 employees making it the tiniest cabinet - level department. (USDE, 2009) The job of the department is to oversee the federal funding of schools and to make sure the privacy and civil rights laws are enforced. (USDE, 2009)

==School Board==
The school board of a town or city is elected. (Paulin, 2009) Decisions are made by voting and majority rules. (Paulin, 2009) One very important job of the school board is to hire a new superintendent, firing a superintendent and to evaluate how well a superintendent is performing their job. (Paulin, 2009) The school board will hold monthly meetings to discuss business matters. (Paulin, 2009) They will hold &quot;student disciplinary hearing&quot; and will meet and talk with staff. (Paulin, 2009) Members will train to learn ways to manage district budgets better. (Paulin, 2009) The board will decide &quot;salaries and benefits,&quot; &quot;approve purchases.&quot; (Paulin, 2009) They also make policies, introduce new curriculum materials and look over the building of new schools or repairs to old ones. (Paulin, 2009) When they make and consider new policies they must look at what is best for the majority of the children in their districts. (Paulin, 2009)

==Superintendent==
The Superintendents are hired by the school board. (Paulin, 2009) They work with the school board and with the principles that they place in charge of the schools. (Black, 2007) When the superintendent and the school board work together they will develop strategies, which will also involve leaders, the parents, minority groups, and school employees, to achieve success with the districts. (Black, 2007) They should be involved in everything from spending time in schools and classrooms, and help to better techniques. (Black, 2007) The superintendents will work with the teachers unions and can even stand up to them. (Black, 2007) They will delegate some responsibilities on to the principals and other staff members, but will always monitor the progress that schools are making. (Black, 2007) When strong superintendents appoint strong principals that will equal strong achievements in the schools. (Black, 2007)

==Principals==
Principals will set goals, standards along with the requirements to reach those goals. (EA, 2007) They oversee the teachers, support staff, librarians, counselors, and coaches in their schools. (EA, 2007) A good principal will help to motivate teachers, look over the record keeping, and make budgets. (EA, 2007) The principals will maintain relationships with parents, students, &quot;employers and the community.&quot; (EA, 2007) When staff members have concerns with procedures the principal will meet with them to talk about them. (EA, 2007) They will observe classrooms; listen to the concerns of teachers, parents and community members. (EA, 2007) They responsible for the school budget and fundraising, meeting sure students meet with the standards set by the local, state and federal government. (EA, 2007) The principal is responsible for improving school environments thru repairs, teacher workshops and other means. (EA, 2007) 

==Overall==
The running of a school and district has a lot more to it than I thought before. Each level of leadership has a lot of duties and responsibilities given to them. Any job has a type of chain of command that is important in its own way.

==Questions==
1. Who has the power to get rid of a bad superintendent? a) teachers b) parents c) school board d)all of the above

2. The Secretary of Education oversees _______________. a) Department of toolboxes b) the Sales Department c) School Board d)Department of Eduaation

3. If Mary is a parent of a student at a local school and wishes to speak with some one about the way the principal acts towards the students should she go to the: a) schoool board b) assistant principal c) Superintentdent d) Department of Education

4. Dave wishes to become the next superintendent of his local school district where would he apply: a) principal b) school board c) the present superintendent d) none of the above

I liked the way this article stated how the different levels of the system worked. Not only was it clear but it was in order from top to bottom and it flowed from letting the audience know what the article was going to be about then explaining it well.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color= black font size= &quot;2&quot;&gt;The federal government sets up departments, advisory committees and programs (such as the [http://www.ed.gov/programs/wethepeople/index.html We the People Program]) to ensure the state and local agencies follow the basic human rights for all citizens by implementing civil rights amendments and programs that endorse good citizenship. The departments also serve to allocate funds and ensure a good development of students and curriculum.  Originally, the federal government's main use was land grants for states to develop colleges and universities. As world competition soared after and during the world wars of the 20th century, the U.S. government started to help with education assistance ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill &lt;font size= &quot;1&quot;&gt; Wiki's &lt;/font&gt; GI Bill website]) for returning veterans; and then later, the National Defense department in 1958 set up allocations to help potential students better in all core areas like math and science (click here to find out more about the [http://nsf.gov National Science Foundation]). &quot;In the State of the Union Address on January 31, 2006, United States President George W. Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the [http://www.stemedcoalition.org STEM] fields&quot; (STEM 2008).
&lt;br&gt;The federal government also sets up a great resource tool for teachers. The Federal Resource for Educational Excellence ([http://www.free.ed.gov FREE]) allows teachers to utilize the internet for classroom resources for all subjects and levels from the National Science Foundation and other federally funded programs like the Endowment for Humanities, National Park Service, Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institution, National Institutes of Health, and even the Labor Department among others. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the federal government has no constitutional role in education because of the [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment10/ 10th amendment], and no mention in the document pertaining to the federal role, in 2003, the Secretary of Education released the revision of the &quot;constitutionally protected prayer&quot; in public schools (originally from the Elementary and Secondary Act) and mandated by the No Child Left behind Act of 2001 (ASCD, 2003) (Findlaw 2008). The voucher system gives parents an option for their child's education through the faith-based initiatives issued by the white house in 2002 to &quot;create a level playing field for faith and community based organizations to compete for USAID programs&quot; (USAID). The executive branch has implemented National Charter Week for a week in May starting this year, 2008. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giving options and opportunities to parents and students is the underlying theme in the federal's role in the educational system. They have the power to make changes and institute ideas that help students benefit more from the national educational system. The federal government's role in education also plays a socio-economic role on a national level because most of these changes dealt with funding and civil rights and a lot of controversy build awareness for some these issues. &lt;br&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/2/24/Historic_Roles_of_the_Federal_Government.pdf Historic Roles of the Federal Government PDF &lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;chronologically ordered&lt;/font&gt;]

According to &quot;Home Instruction in Virginia,&quot; guidelines set by the  Department of Education of Virginia, home-school teachers must meet licensure requirement in addition to a high school diploma. Virginia's department of education has a great job resource site for state-certified teachers at Teach Virginia Education Career Center.

&lt;font color= black font size= &quot;2&quot;&gt; Nobody can bring the school community together more than the collaboration of parents and teachers when it comes to general and special education. According to the guidelines set by the state, the superintendent collects curriculum information from home-school parents as well. Constitutionally, all students should have the same opportunities that can be implemented not only by the federal and state governments, but through local means as well. Together, the parents and the teachers with consideration of the students, can best represent the school's wants and needs. The local agencies have to have their submitted &quot;programs&quot; in order to get funding from either the state or the federal governments (under the ESEA of 1965, all programs must comply with all other programs under the act). There seems to be an overwhelming outcry for alternatives to public education by people who believe the local agencies are not doing enough for their schools; may it be for more home schools or school vouchers. But, the popular trend of privatizing various school programs has some parents wondering if this is a real alternative or just product placement. (Manning, 1999) The [http://www.vapta.org/index.php/about-us.html PTA] (parent and teacher association) is locally and state funded with cooperation on the national level. It is the PTA that brings communities and schools together to ensure proper development of the student and school is being implemented. A good example of this is the Standards of Learning Test nationally mandated, state funded, locally implemented.

== What are the roles of Federal, State and Local Agencies in Education? ==

By: Allyson Earhart

== Learning Objectives: ==

To distinguish the levels of importance of federal, state and local agencies in the education system.

To identify the more prominent educational agencies on each level.

To identify the important perspectives on education that each level has imposed.

== Introduction ==
With nations worldwide increasing their educational standards and advancing globally, it is important that the United States maintain the most efficient form of public education possible. The United States educational system has many different components that are constantly changing to further improve the demand for a more efficient educational system. Education is influenced by many organizations on the local, state and federal levels, each with more influential power than the next.  The United States education system is set up with little regulation from the federal government, allowing each state to impose its own regulations.  This article will talk about the different contributions from each level of authority.

==  Local   ==
The components of the local education system begin with the people of the community, parents, teachers and the students themselves.  Not all local education agencies or LEAs are responsible for providing education but rather contributing in research and in funds.  Each school is responsible for its own performance, conduct of the school, control of the school, hiring staff, budgets, curriculum implementation, repair and maintenance and in some cases admissions.  Public Education at the general level is organized by school districts, which are governed by the school boards.  With other local agencies they have the authority to perform operational oversight and administrative support (VDOE, 2009).  In the city of Virginia Beach, the school board is the one who makes all the policies for the city's public schools.  The administrators and teachers within the city are expected to familiarize themselves with these policies in order to implement them into the school system (VBCPS, 2009).

'''The mission of the Virginia Beach Public Schools Education Foundation is to raise private sector support to reward excellence and fund innovative, creative education programs to benefit students, teachers and staff of the Virginia Beach City Public Schools.'''

(Virginia Beach Education Foundation, 2009)
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0033FF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==  State  ==
Educators, Parents, Politicians and Scholars are constantly asking questions about the policy making of the state.  Each state has its own constitution defining the regulations of public education for that particular state.  The policies of a state are based on several factors including its history, geography and its demographics because each state has different needs and characteristics (Marshall, Mitchell and Wirt,1989, p. 8).  The state implements the minimum education standards and then encourages the advancement of these standards on the local level.  Giving charge to the state for its own educational responsibilities also charges the state to come up with its own finances.  The federal government sets aside as little less than nine percent of its budget to give to elementary and secondary education.  School systems draw their funds by fund raising and the implementation of property taxes.  Some states set tax limits that require the state to have a strict budget breakdown (Wirt and Kurst, 1972, p. 115). The main state agency to implement regulations is the State Department of Education.  In Virginia the State Department of Education consists of several different offices that deal with each important component that make up the education system.  These divisions include the superintendent of public instruction, division of student assessment and school improvement, division of fianance, division of instruction, division of policy and communication, division of special education and student services, division of teacher education and licensure, and the division of technology and career education (VDOE, 2009).  All of these divisions compose the Virginia Department of Education.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0033FF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;'''Duties of the Board of Education''':
â¢Setting statewide curriculum standards;
                                                                                       
â¢Establishing high school graduation requirements;
 
â¢Determining qualifications for classroom teachers, principals, and other education personnel; 

â¢Establishing state testing and assessment programs; 

â¢Establishing standards for accreditation of local school divisions and preparation programs for teachers and administrators;
 
â¢Implementing the No Child Left Behind Act and administering federal assistance programs; and 

â¢Developing rules and regulations for the administration of state programs.

(Virginia Department of Education, 2009)
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==  Federal  ==
Under the United States Constitution, the federal government contributes little to the education system and leaves most of the power up to each individual state (US Department of Education, 2009). The primary federal agency involved with education is the department of education.  It was created in 1867, and has changed its name several times since then, but still maintains the same mission &quot;to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access&quot; ( US Department of Education, 2009). In 1965, the United States passed a piece of legislation that affected the education system tremendously.  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act or ESEA was imposed with a major component being the Title One.  The Department of Education's role in Title One is to develop the guidelines regarding the approval of Title One projects.  Curriculum is another topic of increased federal input.  Although the majority of curriculum input is still left up to each individual state, Federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation and Department of Education have encouraged the implementation of new curriculum standards among the main subjects.  Also although each different district within the state has its own School Board and Superintendent the Federal Government has created The National School Boards Association (NSBA) and the American Association of School Administration (AASA). Each organization provides information and resources from school boards nationwide and the chief executives or superintendents nationwide.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFFFF;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0033FF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Federal Role in Education according to the National Education Foundation:

Support the field of education as a desired and complex field of study and practice.

Federal guarantee for the sustained funding of Title 1 and IDEA and for special needs populations.

Equal access to educational services and supports.

Support state-led public school transformation through authentic accountability that is transparent.

Establish high-quality educational research and development as essential to educational improvement.

Support innovation and best practices to accelerate state-based improvement efforts and improve student learning based on proven teaching strategies and programs grounded in sound teaching and learning research.

(National Education Association, 2009)

&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Conclusion  ==
Although schools do recognize that they have considerable freedom in their policies, they also recognize the importance of cooperation between local education authorities and the community  as a whole.  With the collaboration between the three branches of agents within the educational system, the system can work as a functional whole (Corrigan, 2000).

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Readers should understand the benefits and disadvantages of Teachers Unions &lt;li&gt; Readers should understand how the Unions effect teachers &lt;li&gt; Readers should be able to decide if they would like to join a union once they begin their career &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Introduction&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

----

&lt;font color=&quot;##000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Throughout time unions have worked to provide more for their employees. In 1857 the National Education Association; also known as the NEA; was formed by one hundred educators (NEA). The NEA became an advocate for children who were not learning to read and write. Over the course of one hundred and fifty years the NEA has become the largest teaching union (NEA). Currently there are over 3.2 million members across the United States (NEA). While the NEA is the largest teaching union the American Federation of Teachers is the second largest teaching union. The AFT was founded in 1916 to represent the economic, social and professional interests of classroom teachers (AFT). The American Federation of Teachers currently has 1.4 million members that belong to three thousand local affiliates nationwide and forty-three state affiliates (ATF). Virginia does not belong to the ATF as a state affiliate but there is a local affiliate in Fairfax County (ATF). Although teachers are not required to join the NEA or ATF many do to protect their selves in many aspects. These unions often provide employment security while protecting teacherâs rights with working conditions, teacher pay and benefits and other contract provisions. This raises the question to up and coming teachers as to whether they should join a teachers union.&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Today unions represent 67 percent of the nation's 3 million active public elementary and secondary school teachers&quot; Randall W. Eberts&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;##000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;There are many benefits of joining a teachers union. When a teacher joins a union they are granted many more benefits then teachers that do not join a union. The benefits that teachers are most concerned with are their pay and benefits, working conditions, employment security. A study found that teachers who are members of the union earned between five and twelve percent more than those who did not join a union (Eberts, 2007). These teachers also had more benefits and this may have increased the quality of education (Eberts, 2007). Teachers are often concerned about their working conditions such as class size, time for preparation and other activities away from students (Eberts, 2007). Studies found that that the student-teacher rations were seven to twelve percent lower for union teachers than for nonunion teachers (Eberts, 2007).  The study also found that union teachers were allowed more time in class preparation and administrative duties (Eberts, 2007).  Without the union teachers would not be allowed this planning time which is necessary for their classroom to run smoothly.  While the unions protect a teachers pay and benefits and working conditions it also protects their employment security. Many teachers are granted tenure after teacher for a few years (Eberts, 2007). Tenure protects teachers from dismissal except for specific causes, which are not related to performance (Eberts, 2007). As you can see there are many benefits to joining the union that will protect you as a teacher.&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Disadvantages of Joining a Union&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

----

&lt;font color=&quot;##000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;While there are many benefits of joining a union there are also many disadvantages. Some teachers do not want to join the union because they are often very political and they may not agree with what the union stands for. Randall W. Eberts stated, âTeachers were not always anxious to be part of organized laborâ (Eberts, 2007). While the unions often helped with the financial aspects of being a teacher they had many views and were often not agreed by the teachers (Eberts, 2007). There are also some districts that say that a teacher must be part of a union. Many people are forced to go along with the views of the largest unions like the NEA and AFT because there are no counter propaganda organizations (Moore, 1996).  A disadvantage of joining the union is the cost. The average annual dues for the National Education Association is between four and six hundred dollars (Moore, 1996).  This raises seven hundred and eighty five million dollars in revenue for the NEA (Moore, 1996). While the union may do a great job at protecting teachers pay, working conditions and their employment security it also protects bad teachers. An example of this is a high school teacher that was fired for producing and appearing in an x-rated video and asking students to be involved (Moore, 1996). The union defended this teacher claiming that he was working to augment his income (Moore, 1996). Teachers like this should not be protected under the union. These disadvantages may outweigh the benefits of joining a union. &lt;/font&gt;



&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Conclusion&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

----

&lt;font color=&quot;##000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;There are many benefits and disadvantages of joining a teachers union. While some teachers want to protect their pay and benefits, working conditions, and employment security others view the unions as if it was forced upon them. Some may feel that unions are too political for them to join whither it is for a religious reason or ethical view of the NEA. Some may believe that joining the union is costly while others see that there are benefits in joining the unions that may increase their pay. As future teachers we will have to decide whither we will join the 3.2 million teachers across the United States in the NEA. One must weigh out their views of the unions and decide if joining will be an advantage or disadvantage for their career as a teacher.&lt;/font&gt;

Why do Teachers Join Unions?

Nekita Roscoe

Old Dominion University

















Abstract

Organizations such as unions, represent the nationâs teachers, and play a crucial role in helping to determine the policies that affect public schools. At least 80 percent of public school teachers belong either to the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) or the National Education Association (NEA), with more than 60 percent being covered be some formal collective bargaining agency. Through both political advocacy and collective bargaining on the local, state and national levels, teacherâs unions seek to improve not only the general working conditions and salaries of its members, better health and retirement benefits, more secure jobs, and safer working conditions, which therefore impact the way in which education is provided, financed and governed.  Teachers are given the option of joining a union to procure all of these benefits and to stand together as a unified body when facing the many adversities in the public school system today.  The role of the unions has drastically changed the way in which educational resources are distributed, and the way in which schools function.








Introduction

Mrs. Jensen announced to the class one week earlier that they were to study for an upcoming science test. She also advised her students on the day of the test that they were to take their notebooks from their lockers as she was willing to give them an open book test to help them pass the test. On the morning of the test all students except John Miller had his notebook. He was standing in the hallway socializing with his friend, and did not have time to go to his locker as instructed. As Mrs. Jensen started handing out the test, John raised his hand and asked to go back to his locker, Mrs. Jensen politely declined his request, stating that he had had over twenty minutes locker time and should have followed the instruction that she had given. Thinking that this was the best corrective measure for John and to show John that he needed, not only to follow instructions, but also to learn responsibility, Mrs. Jensen continued her test and did not allow him to go to the locker.  The next day, she was summoned to the office of the principal who clearly indicated her disapproval of the situation and asked that Mrs. Jensen, not only apologize to the student, but also to the parent who had made the complaint.  Flabbergasted, Mrs. Jensen called her union representative to find out what was the best course of action when faced with such a situation.  Before the end of the day, a representative was in the office of the principal as an advocate for the teacher and the choice that she made.  This is primarily one of the duties that unions provide to teachers, and a main reason why teachers join organizations such as union, as they provide a host of positive benefits to teachers. Consequently, there are also a few negatives associated with unions and why teachers may opt not to become members of any of the number of unions that offer these benefits.


Positives of Joining a Union.

The question might arise: why would a professional join an organization such as a union? The simplest reason might be to improve wages and benefits.  However, for teachers the answer is more complex. âTeacher unions are driven by goals, concepts, and ideas-not by solely financial enhancements.â
During the seventies organized teachers made remarkable strides in gaining non-compensation benefits.  By the eighties, a number of bargaining agencies included in their provisions for the teacherâs contracts regulations on the length of the school day, allowing teachers to exclude disruptive students from the classroom, and allowing teachers to respond formally to administrative evaluations. As reform policies that were formally aimed at students have moved to reforms aimed at dealing with teachers, teacher organizations have become even more crucial in advocating educational improvement. 
Teachers join the union so that they have a way for their voices to be heard. One teacher alone would have little impact on the educational decisions being made. The union provides a means for individuals to amalgamate and have a collective voice in developing safe schools, improving teaching conditions, and raising educational standards with the understanding that their thoughts will not be ignored or be subject to retaliation.
Teacher unions advocate for the students whose schools serve even as they achieve security and respect for their members at the same time. Presently, teacher unions are in the front fighting to get legislation for lower class size, more staff development to improve teaching techniques, higher academic standards, more technology in the schools, and zero tolerance discipline codes. Teachers join the union because unions benefit the students, raise standards, and have significant influence on the entire educational system.
In addition, teachers join unions because through the process of collective bargaining,
the union offset management demands. A negotiated contract sets the rules and working conditions, and subsequently a good contract clarifies basic values, expectations, and goals. Contracts provide consistent policies that are fair and sensible with procedures for appeal if disparities should arise. Teachers want these protections so that they can function in an atmosphere of academic freedom.



Negatives of Joining a Union

The aim of teacherâs organizations is to be advocates for teachers and to work on the local, 
state and national level to improve working conditions and wages for teachers. However, in a recent study, it was indicated that less than a third of the teachers had had much improvement in setting limits on class sizes, or changes in instructional policies at schools.
In todayâs economy teacher unions are struggling to keep what they have despite declining enrollments, diminishing tax bases and federal education cutbacks. School districts everywhere are trying to squeeze concessions out of teacher unions in the form of pay freezes, benefit reductions and even salary cuts. But with both the schools and unions struggling economically, there is little ground for negotiation.
Another major drawback to organizations such as unions is that they sometimes disagree on each level. The local level may have one idea of how to improve the conditions for teachers and the state and national may have another. Not only do these differences exist within one particular organization, but they exist between the AFT and the NEA.  A crucial criticism of these organizations is that they sometimes advocate their own agenda or the agendas of other agencies.  Unions have contracts with regulations that teachers may go against that can lead to fines imposed by the unions. There are also dues which are subtracted from the teacherâs pay.
A negative aspect to unions is that they can have tunnel-vision when it comes to certain issues and may not take into account the whole picture when making a determination. Parents and teachers may not agree, and the unions tend to take the side of the teachers. 
There are also tenure charges from the school district trying that try to dismiss teachers. In such an event a unionized member may be protected, as certain procedures must be followed in-order to dismiss a teacher.

Conclusion

Unions provide a host of positive benefits to teachers. Although there are also a few negatives as to why teachers may opt not to become members it has always been purported that a united front is always better to achieve the collective good of all. Therefore, as a collective bargaining agency and a political advocate, teacherâs organizations serve to enhance the educational experience of students and to provide the best benefits for teachers to ensure that they have the best working conditions possible.


The AFT was formed in1 916 has more than 3,000 local affiliates nationwide, 43 state affiliates, and more than 1.4 million members.

== Teacher Evaluation:  Who decides if I am successful, and how? ==


'''Introduction'''

	The teaching profession is one of the most important, fundamental occupations in todayâs society.  Teachers play a very influential role in the lives of their students, and have a great impact on their future and on society as a whole.  Because teachers play such an intricate part in societyâs well-being, school systems have to make sure teachers have efficient skills and knowledge in their disciplines, and that their methods of teaching are effective.  Teachers frequently have to undergo an evaluation process in which school administrators assess the teacherâs competence, teaching abilities, effectiveness, and overall success.  It is imperative that this assessment be carried out honestly and accurately to ensure the best quality of education for the students.

border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
 
&quot;By understanding the means by which teachers have attained student learning and growth, 
assessors can verify that they actually possess the skills, knowledge, and habits necessary to 
attain consistent, continued student learning and growth,&quot; (Johnson &amp; Jones, 1998, p. 1).  
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;






'''The Evaluation Process:  Who Evaluates?'''
	
The teacher evaluation process is a collaborative project in which members of the School administration take part.  The principal, and other administrators in the school system, come together to complete this task.  Before the school year begins, the principal, administrators, and teachers meet to discuss specific goals for the school and its classes.  The principal explains the supervision process, and reviews the evaluation instrument with the teachers (Spokane, 2002).  The teacher must then prepare the lesson plan for the class and think of a way to administer the classroom in an effective manner.  The principal usually has scheduled observation dates, and may also have unscheduled and unannounced dates of observation and evaluation.  The teacher is assessed based on performance, the validity of the material taught, and overall effectiveness and connectivity with the students.


'''The Evaluation Process:  Support and Criticisms'''
	
Each teacher has his or her own individual style and methods of teaching.  It is impossible for all teachers to adopt a universal system of teaching because each teacher has a different background, different life experiences, and unique morals and values.  These differences must be taken into consideration when creating an evaluation rubric for teachers, and in the actual process of evaluation.  Many people believe that most teacher evaluation systems are fair, but a great number of people disagree.  They feel that many evaluation instruments used in school systems eliminate individuality in teaching styles and take away the essence of a good education.
	Teachers and administrators have very different outlooks on the evaluation process.  According to Enz &amp; Searfoss (1993), evaluation of teacher performance âonly perpetuates the status quo (principalsâ views) and causes nothing but frustration over missed opportunities (teachersâ views),â (p. 7).  Enz &amp; Searfoss (1993) found that administrators were reluctant to alter the status quo.  Even though the administrators agreed that the evaluation system should be augmented to improve the assessment of holistic, integrated classrooms, they felt change was unnecessary because the effective teachers would âtop outâ on the evaluation instrument regardless, and their merit pay would not be affected by the change (Enz &amp; Searfoss, 1993, p. 5).
	The teachers in this study felt that their holistic and integrative teaching philosophy was unappreciated by the principals, who used an evaluation system based on a direct instruction model (Enz &amp; Searfoss, 1993, p. 3).  Rather than trying to defend their holistic, integrated beliefs, the teachers prepared a direct instruction lesson for their evaluation in order to please the principals (Enz &amp; Searfoss, 1993, p. 6).  These teachers viewed their evaluations as missed opportunities:  opportunities in which the principals missed out on discovering the accomplishments of holistic, integrated classrooms (Enz &amp; Searfoss, 1993, p. 6).


'''The Impact of Evaluation:  Teachers, administrators, and students'''
	
Teacher evaluations affect everyone in the school system, directly or inadvertently.  Teachersâ stress levels may increase due to the fear of poor performance or receiving a bad report.  Students in the class during an evaluation may feel that they are being evaluated as well and may either become more engaged in the class or may avoid giving input, asking questions, or participating in discussions as much.  Administrators, especially those who directly carry out the evaluations, may be stressed by the number of evaluations or might be concerned with making sure the evaluation is a fair assessment.  Teacher evaluations may also create a strange relationship between teachers and administrators, increasing tensions on both sides. 
	The positive impacts of teacher evaluation outweigh the negatives and are much more important for the well-being of the students.  Proper evaluation of teachers allows the administration to determine which teachers are beneficial to the students.  An extremely significant duty of the administration is to maintain a school wide, productive learning atmosphere for all students.  Accurate and honest teacher evaluation is an essential part of maintaining an efficient school system.


'''What happens after evaluation?'''
	
Once the teacher is evaluated by the administrator, decisions regarding the teacherâs performance will be made based on the results.  The teacherâs quality is judged based on his or her own personal performance, and how the students benefited from the teacher.  This calls for two main types of assessment, formative and summative (Harris, 2007, p. 2).  Formative assessment is on-going throughout the year, which includes the periodic announced and unannounced teacher and classroom evaluations (FCIT, 2007, âClassroom Assessmentâ).  The summative assessment refers to the end-of-the-year compilation of retrieved data to come to a conclusion about the teacherâs overall performance and effectiveness (FCIT, 2007).  These assessments are also used to monitor the studentsâ progress throughout the year, and how beneficial the teacherâs instructional methods were to them.  
	Beginning in 2001, with the passage of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law, schools have shifted toward evaluating the teachers based on the studentsâ results more so than individual performance and characteristics (Harris, 2007, p. 3).  Even though the NCLB law has put more focus on holding schools accountable for studentsâ success rather than individual teachers, the pressures were designed to âtrickle downâ and influence the actions of the teachers (Harris, 2007, p. 4).


'''Universal Evaluation Practices'''
	
The process of teacher evaluation should be somewhat universal in order to provide fair and just treatment of teachers.  Teach for America (TFA), a national teacher corps of recent college graduates, developed an evaluation instrument called the Performance Assessment Instrument (PAI) (Johnson &amp; Jones, 1998, p.1).  The main ideas that the instrument is based on are the extent to which the teacher has attained the goals established in student learning and growth, and the means by which the teacher has impacted student learning and growth (Johnson &amp; Jones, 1998, p. 1).


'''Conclusion'''
	
Teacher evaluation plays a monumental role in the educational experience of students, in the proficiency of school systems, and in the society as a whole.  The school administrations must deliver evaluations that effectively assess the teacherâs abilities, interactivity, and the resulting success of the students.  Proper teacher evaluations allow successful teachers to teach and lead the students who will become the future of society.

After you have read this article, you should be able to identify why evaluating a teacher is important and the different methods use to evaluate. ''If parents, students, and educators get involved in the way our children are getting taught in the classroom teachers can be more successful in teaching.''&lt;s&gt;The involvement that parents, students, and educators have to make sure our children are getting the proper teaching.
&lt;/s&gt;

The school principal, administrators, and even students are all involved in evaluating a teacher's performance and quality of teaching. These people have an important role because they ensure that the teachers are performing a great job and that they have the proper skills and preparation to teach the course. The evaluation can determine how much knowledge the teacher have to teach the material and can also give feedback for improvements. The school administrators and principal have the final responsibility to evaluate a teacher. Their task can be very challenging, and they must be both judgmental and open minded; especially in evaluating teachers and reassuring audiences (parents, legislators) that good work is going on in the classroom and the students are achieving. As a parent, I want to make sure that my children are spending time with a well qualify teacher and also an experience educator. An evaluation can give recognition to a good teacher and to the school where the teacher teaches. Students that are passing with high grades can have a significant impact on how well the teacher is doing his or her job.

The old evaluation system that ignores student achievement and finds virtually all teachers &quot;satisfactory&quot; does not address whether students are actually learning.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Why Evaluate a Teacher? ==
[[User:Dtorr005|Dtorr005]] ([[User talk:Dtorr005|talk]]) 03:38, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

The evaluation process gives a chance to see how well that teacher is performing and creates accountability. It can also show dedication for teaching and  student academic progress. The evaluation can promote ways for teachers to become better educators and give solutions to academic problems. A research done by the University of Haifa, Israel addresses the validity of teacher evaluation measures produced by the Tennessee Value Added Assessment System (TVAAs). The system analyzes student test score data and estimates the effects of individual teachers on score gains. These effects are used to construct teacher value-added measures of teaching effectiveness. We describe the process of generating teacher effectiveness estimates in TVAAS and discuss policy implications of using these estimates for accountability purposes (Kupermintz, 2003). The evaluation results can bring everyone together in the field of education to gather ideas, skills, and knowledge from each other to help students achieve many dreams and be better learners. In Virginia, teachers are evaluated according to planning and assessment, instruction, safety and learning environment, communication and community relations, and professionalism.

== Guidelines in Virginia ==


Virginia is on the leading edge in reforming educator evaluations. First, with the passage of the Education Accountability and Quality Enhancement Act of 1999 (the Act), Virginia requires evaluations of educators based on certain criteria, including student academic progress. The policy behind the Act is to provide strategies to train and evaluate educators with a primary focus on increasing student achievement and school safety (www.cepionline.org).


== Why NOT Evaluate a Teacher? ==

Some teachers don't agree ''with'' getting evaluated, but the problem is the method used for evaluation that they feel is not fair or precise. Some methods are the principal observing &lt;s&gt;in&lt;/s&gt; the classroom,the result of test scores, and not sufficient assessment to evaluate if a teacher is good enough to teach a class. Not all districts use the same method, but some of them use teacher's choice, student surveys, student achievement data, multiple data sources, and principal observation of the class. The principal sits unannounced in the classroom and takes notes assessing the teacher.  Evaluators need to keep in mind that some days in the classrooms are better than other days; especially  if you have a student with lots of problem outside of school. Teachers don't agree on being evaluated on student test scores or student achievement data because home environment, &lt;s&gt;well&lt;/s&gt; ''good'' nourishment, language barriers, and many more factors play a significant role on student's performance in school. The state of teacher evaluation is a significantly and frequently neglected problem in public education, an enterprise that spends $400 billion annually on salaries and benefits. Because teacher evaluation is at the center of the quality of teaching in the nation's classrooms, it has the potential to be a powerful lever of teacher and school improvement (Toch, Rothman, 2008).

== What are the benefits of a teacher evaluation? ==

[[User:Dtorr005|Dtorr005]] ([[User talk:Dtorr005|talk]]) 03:45, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
An evaluation will help the teacher grow professionally and develop academic strategies to help the student succeed. It also provides feedback on academic achievement from the student and teacher.  A good evaluation or unsatisfactory evaluation can also reflect the school system because it can lead to poor evaluation of teachers and improvement is required. The teacher can self-evaluate a curriculum material to enhance student learning and receive peer coaching to guide them. Effective teacher evaluation programs link teaching to ongoing professional development opportunities that address the needs identified by both the teacher and the evaluator(s). Evaluation must balance the identification of strengths and positive aspects of performance with the identification of areas needing improvement (www.nctm.org).

My goal is to be a Spanish Teacher and have the credentials necessary to be the best. If getting an evaluation is going to help me develop professionally and remind me why we teach, then why not ''use'' an evaluation. Students are held responsible for their studies and behavior in the classroom, so I think  teachers need to be held accountable for improper teaching. 
&lt;center&gt;''Students who have several effective teachers in a row make dramatic gains in achievement, while those who have even two ineffective teachers in a row lose significant ground, which they may never recover. Indeed, students who achieve at similar levels in the third grade may be separated by as many as 50 percentile points three years later, depending on the quality of the teachers to whom they were assigned!  (Futernick, 2003)''&lt;center&gt;

The quality of learning depends largely on the quality of teaching, teacher evaluation clearly is essential in effective schools.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

      <comment>Poverty, a description of ones situation.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">							                                                   Lisa Selwyn


Poverty: A Description of One’s Situation

”To be poor is to be deprived of those goods and services and pleasures which others around us take for granted.” Mollie Orshansky, developer of the poverty measurements used by the United States government. 

What is poverty? Poverty can be a situation in which one is born into, be subject to due to a natural disaster or fall into by means of personal hardship like disease, drug or alcohol use, and other illnesses. Poverty is a situation not a judgment upon one’s character.
Poverty is a shortage of common things such as food, clothing, shelter and safe drinking water. Shortages of unclean drinking water results in poor sanitary conditions. Poor women, suffering from isolation often spend many hours a day fetching water for the household, diverting them from income generation and childcare activities.
Being physically weak due to illness can prevent the poor from earning an income and push them further into poverty making the cycle of depression and desperation more intense. Many feel powerless and vulnerable because they have little access to justice for help with legal issues for example, a death of the primary wage earner in the family because the family can not afford adequate health care services. Thus putting the units’ assets in jeopardy or exhausted digging the household deeper into poverty. 





In the United States extreme poverty is called destitution or absolute poverty. Extreme poverty is traditionally defined as having an annual income that’s less than half of the official poverty line, an income level determined by the Bureau of the Census, 2008 http://www.census.org.

Extreme poverty in developing nations, as defined by international organizations, means having a household income of less than one U.S. dollar per day. It doesn’t take into account the cost of living differentials within countries. A dollar will buy different amounts of goods in urban and rural areas. A bushel of corn (eight ears) costs more in the cities than it would in a small farming community that grows corn as a source of income. Many poor countries people grow and rear food and animals for their own consumption. This isn’t captured by measures of income and consumption based on the measurements of the purchase of goods sold as commodities. This definition also does not show who lives in permanent and who lives in temporary poverty. More information on this will be discussed later on. 
Next is relative poverty. Relative poverty is the condition of having fewer resources or less income than others within a society or country, or compared to worldwide averages. Relative poverty is measured as having a family income less than one half of the median income for that developed country such as the United States. 
According to the United States Department of Agriculture 34.5 million American people are living below the poverty level. Of this number, the country’s 2.1 million American Indians are the poorest in the United States. 400,000 of those live on reservations where the highest rates of poverty, unemployment and disease are of any other ethnic group in American. 


￼



Pine Ridge of Shannon County, South Dakota, is the poorest county in the United States. Unemployment hovers around 80%. Per Capita income is $3,419 a year, the lowest in the nation and two out of three people live below the Federal poverty level. 
The average poverty threshold for a family of four is $16,660 in annual income to that of a family of three which is $13,003 yearly income The poverty rate-in the metropolitan areas and central cities is twice as high compared to that in the suburbs.
Sadly, children make up the highest poverty rate compared to any other age group 13.5 million children. These poor children make up 39% of all the poor population and they make up 26% of the total population in the U.S.
￼ 


Facts about the ”poor” in the United States by the Census Bureau of the United States in 2007 it is reported that 43% of all poor households actually own their homes. The average home owned by persons classified as poor by the Census Bureau is a three bedroom house with one and half baths, garage, and a porch or patio. This may come as a surprise, but you can also see that such a home would not be found in the middle of a New York City neighborhood. It is reported that eighty percent of poor households have air conditioning. Six percent are over crowded, of that two thirds have more than two people in one room. The average poor American has more living space that the average individual living in Paris, London, Vienna, Athens, and other cities throughout Europe, those are just the average Joe’s not compared to the poor of foreign countries. 

It is reported by the Census Bureau that that three quarters of poor households own a car, with 31% owning two or more cars. Ninety seven percent of the poor have color televisions, some more than one. Seventy-eight percent have a VCR or DVD player with sixty-two percent having cable or satellite television reception. And 88% of the poor according to the Census Bureau own microwave ovens and more than half have a stereo and more than a third have an automatic dishwasher. 
As a group, American’s poor are far from being chronically undernourished. The average consumption of protein, vitamins, and minerals is virtually the same for the poor and middle class children and, in most cases, is well above the recommended norms. Poor children consume more meat than do higher-income children and average protein intakes one hundred percent above recommended levels. Most poor children, today, grow up on average to be one inch taller and ten pounds heavier than the GI s who stormed the shores of Normandy in World War II.
Contrary to this census, the effects of poverty in the United States vary. Many low income families purchase a cheaper variety of foods high in starch, sugar and sodium. Those who are considered low income tend to frequent fast food franchises hitting up the value menu items and dining at all you can eat buffets resulting in the poor nutrition.
The effects of poverty in the wealthier countries – such as the United States, Canada, Japan and those in western Europe include poor nutrition, mental illness, drug dependence, crime, and high rates of disease.

Mental illness among the poor is high. Diagnostic criteria for many mental disorders require symptoms to cause significant impairment on the individual’s ability to function in social or work environments. It can be reasoned that those with a severe mental health disorder may have difficulties functioning at work which then would lead them to unemployment and possibly poverty. There are some organizations that aid the mentally handicapped with employment and living skills but those are few and expensive making it difficult to attain services.
	Poverty is painful. Poverty fills one with shame and anxiety. Drug dependency takes the lives of many who are living in poverty. Many fall victim to drug and alcohol abuse due to much of the depression and hopelessness that prevail with poverty conditions. Some turn to crime out of desperation. Resorting to selling drugs, prostitution, racketeering, theft and larceny in order to take care of themselves or families.
	It is a fact that there is a high rate of disease among the poor. Inadequate health care is the main reason for this. Most of the illnesses associated with poverty in developing countries are infectious diseases such as diarrheal illness, malaria and tuberculosis. Diseases among the poor in the United States consist of gum disease, heart disease, diabetes and sexually diseases to name a few. 
The world’s poorest people live in developing areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. They struggle daily for food, shelter, and other necessities. They often suffer from malnutrition, a dietary condition caused by deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients in the diet. Malnutrition is characterized by a wide array of health problems, including extreme weight loss, stunted growth, weakened resistance to infection, and impairment of intellect. Severe cases of malnutrition can lead to death. 
	These poor countries suffer from epidemic disease outbreaks which are contagious diseases affecting an unusually large number of people or involving an extensive geographical area. Epidemics, which may be short-lived or last for years, are brought on by the widening reach of disease-causing organisms. These organisms can spread by contaminated food or water, directly from one person to another through physical contact, or by the exchange of bodily secretions such as saliva, semen, or blood. Insects, rodents, and other disease-carrying animals, known as vectors, are agents that may infect human populations with epidemic diseases.  	Diseases that have an epidemic history are the Bubonic plague, influenza, smallpox, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, cholera, bacterial meningitis, and diphtheria. Occasionally, childhood diseases such as mumps and German measles become epidemics.
One of the largest epidemics ever recorded was the outbreak of the bubonic plague or the Black Death. This plague killed one-third of the people in Europe alone. It also raged through Africa and Asia from 1347 to 1350. 
Famine, a severe shortage of food, generally affecting a widespread areas and large numbers of people impact the people of developing countries. These shortages occur for many reasons such as natural causes for example droughts, floods, earthquakes, insect plagues, and plant disease. Other causes are human caused like that of war, civil disturbances, sieges, and deliberate crop destruction. The population increases disproportionate to the food-producing or procuring capacity of people in a region.	
The number one killer of young women in the developing world is not disease whose cure eludes us; the cure for A.I.D.S. is not in grasp, or a condition which the world lacks resources to treat. It is pregnancy and childbirth. Every year, 500,000 women die while trying to give life. That’s one every single minute, according to End Poverty 2015 campaign.

￼

To end poverty is a huge task. One way of trying to fight the fight would be try to end hunger. One way this could be done would take a look at the wasted food in America alone. America’s Second Harvest, a non-profit food bank organization, states that over 41 billion pounds of food have been wasted every year. A 2004 study from the University of Arizona in Tucson, on average, American households waste 14 percent of their food purchases. 15 percent of that includes products still within their expiration date but never opened. Timothy Jones, an anthropologist at the UA Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology, who led the study, estimates an average family of four currently tosses out $590 per year, just in meat, fruits, and vegetables. 16 billion pounds of milk and 14 billion pounds of grain products have been included in this loss. When you think of this waste in numbers and try to imagine that people go hungry everyday and think of the nations guidelines of poverty, it makes you think hard at yourself and what you are doing.
Poverty hasn’t any respect to one’s race, color, or religion. It has extraordinary wide variations in terms of breadth and depth. It can be relatively minor, requiring nothing more than some degree of personal adjustment, or it can be deadly; freezing to death in the dead of winter because you can’t pay for your heating bill. For some it is fleeting, temporary condition. Such as those who fell victim to natural disasters such as drought, hurricanes, floods or tornadoes. For others it is a generational norm, revealed only at a sufficient age of awareness. To illustrate, when a child realizes and experiences shame for the first time when he notices he or she is being judgeds by the brand of shoes they are wearing or singled out because they are unkempt or unclean due to lack of clean running water. It can be a reflection of a tragic mindset or harsh images of seemingly inescapable realities, as that of the products of war. It is a description of one’s situation, not by definition an assessment of one’s character.
Therefore, poverty is a situation in which one is lacking one or more necessities of life. It is not a judgment on ones character. The fact that someone is poor does not mean they are a bad person. In Lakota culture the ”poorest” of the tribe was the chief, because he all he had back to the well-being of the people. The poor do not have to be nameless or faceless. There have been many people in American history who have risen above the lines of poverty to become a successful positive contribution to society. Among these individuals who have become well-known is comedian Jim Carrey; he was homeless and lived out of his VW van for two years. 
Cary Grant, the Oscar-winning actor slept on the streets of South Hampton England during a summer in his youth at the time of World War I. The actress Halle Barry stayed at homeless shelters while struggling to find work when she was too young to obtain employment legally. Billy Mills, a 1964 Olympic gold medalist, was born into poverty on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The author and inspirational speaker Cedric Jennings came from the inner city of Washington D.C. He was born of his surroundings but with hard work earned his way to an Ivy League college. Today he is still successful helping other troubled teens growing up in the inner city.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''How Mentoring  Provides Support for New Teachers.

By: Nancy Currence'''&lt;/big&gt;

âIn the mentoring process, reflection enables us to slow down, rest, and observe our journey and the process of self-knowledge that is so important along the way.â - Huang and Lynch, 1995&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;





===Introduction===
Unlike many professions which allow a recent graduate to work side by side with an experienced professional, the teaching profession requires the new professional to be alone in a classroom gaining experience without the benefit of a seasoned professional watching over them.  This isolation may lead to discouragement and high anxiety among novice teachers resulting in high attrition and low retention rates.  A solution to this problem is implementing an effective mentoring program.
	
Imagine youâre the teacher in a high school classroom when a verbal argument begins between two young men.  This is your first year of teaching and you are not much older than your students and have never been involved in a conflict like this.  You are trying to remember what your textbook taught you to do in this situation, but things are escalating faster than you can think.  You know you cannot leave the room in search of help nearby, but something must be done immediately.  Before you can place a call for help, the argument escalates into a physical confrontation.  By the time help arrives, the situation is way out of hand.  Or, imagine you are sitting quietly grading papers when one of your students knocks on your door.  She is obviously upset and crying and asks if she can speak to you.  She tells you she is pregnant and her boyfriend wants her to have an abortion.  Looking at this young girl you realize she not much younger than you are, and she has entrusted her future to you.  You realize that not only is her future at stake but also the life of another human being.  You feel overwhelmed with the burden of responsibility.  Has your formal education really prepared you for this non-textbook experience?  If your school has an effective mentoring program then you know where to go for assistance in resolving these issues or you may have already had a discussion about these issues with your mentor.  At least you know you are not alone!


===What is mentoring?===
As defined by Websterâs Third New International Dictionary, mentor means âa close, trusted, and experienced counselor or guide.â  Among many professions, such as physicians, engineers, architects, and lawyers, direct supervision by a licensed professional is required in order to obtain professional licensure.  A mentor who can communicate hope and optimism is needed to assist a novice teacher with the transition into the profession of teaching. There are many different types of induction (or mentor) programs, but this one aims at under-girding novice teachers.


===What is the role of a mentor?===
A mentor can provide for the novice teacher direction and guidance in how to set up behavioral management plans for the classroom, how to be flexible when problems arise, knowledgeable information about the characteristics of students they will be teaching, information about the community and local activities available for the student, how to organize and manage their classroom, the school procedures and policies, and how to interact with the administration.

The agenda of the mentoring program is to pair a veteran teacher and novice teacher in a mutually satisfying relationship. Steve Metz, a veteran science teacher was happy to mentor Lisa a first year teacher, and expressed that âthe hidden secretânow revealedâis that I received by far the better part of the bargain.â  Lisa offered enthusiasm for teaching, which was infectious and stimulated Steveâs imagination again allowing him not only to help Lisa experience personal professional development but also rekindled his desire for continued professional growth.

âMy advisor kind of walked me through the year.  She was always there to listen to my ideas, my reflections.  I never felt alone, even when she wasnât in the roomâ¦â - Moir, 2003&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


===Why the need for a mentor program?===
According to âSchoolâs Out: The Crisis in Teacher Retentionâ approximately thirty percent of new teachers leave the teaching profession within three years; and associated with this is the estimated $2.6 billion annual cost due to this turnover (Alliance for excellent Education, 2004) which has brought about an increased awareness for the need of additional support for novice teachers.  The mentoring program has been in the forefront of discussions as a method of retaining new teachers.  First year teachers are known to show high levels of stress due to their lack of practical skills in the profession.  They have difficulty balancing their work load of lectures, class interaction, resolving classroom issues, grading, administrative duties, and assuring that their lesson plan is addressing the standards of learning which is necessary for their evaluation as an effective teacher. It is evident that there is a need to retain new teachers and mentoring is one viable way to address this situation.

âMentors who assume the mentor role without adequately preparing themselves or their relationship are often disappointed and dissatisfied.â - Zachary, 2000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


===How to ensure a successful mentoring program===
In order for the mentoring program to be successful, training is necessary for the mentor.  Workshops can help the mentor become aware of issues that they will need to address with novice teachers.  A detailed job description is also needed so the mentor is aware of the objectives of the program (Rowley, 1999).  The program should be supervised and evaluated for effectiveness.

&lt;li&gt;A mentor should be a veteran teacher who demonstrate the ability to assist in the professional growth of a novice teacher
&lt;li&gt;A mentor should have a strong belief in the teaching profession
&lt;li&gt;A mentor should believe that all children can learn
&lt;li&gt;A mentor should be skilled in a wide range of teaching strategies
&lt;li&gt;A mentor should communicate well (verbal and written)
&lt;li&gt;A mentor should be sensitive and capable of maintaining confidentiality
&lt;li&gt;A mentor should be proficient in planning and organizing.

===E-Mentoring===
One problem that has been associated with the mentoring program is efficiently matching up mentors and mentees in their appropriate fields.  This especially occurs in the area of special education.  East Carolina University has come up with a successful option to this situation.  They have established an e-mentoring program.  The program is web based, using Moodle &quot;(http://moodle.org), a free, open course management system.&quot; (Williams, J., Warren, S., 2007).   The mentors are matched with new teachers in their field, usually in a distant school district from the mentor with similar grade levels and classroom situations.  They are required to maintain weekly contact with their mentors and &quot;participate in one learning module per semester.  Modules address specific topics and needs expressed by new teachers&quot; (Willialms, Warren, 2007).  such as inclusion, managing classroom behavior, etc. These topics often lead to forums which groups can participate in and is moderated by a university facilitator.  The teachers/mentors can share personal success stories, resourses and gain comradery through this method.  This is a potential option for those districts that have distant schools where mentors are in short supply or there are special needs teachers with little or no menotrs available as well. (Williams, Warren, 2007).


===Reflection Summary  ===
As I embark on completing my formal education to become an educator I look forward to entering my profession yet I also feel great apprehension when realizing that without guidance I could be doomed to failure at what has been the dream of my life.  However with the thought of a supportive mentoring program available for me I realize that the uncertainty of the first few years of teaching can be rewarding.  I would look forward to working side by side with a veteran mentor who has been trained and is qualified to assist me in my new endeavor with optimism and hope of becoming an effective educator.

I had the opportunity to interview Leigh R. Quick, School Board, District 3, New Kent County who was instrumental in creating a mentoring program for New Kent County.  I asked what goal she set when preparing the mentoring program and she replied, âto make new teachers feel welcome, give them resources (a mentor, as well as a written guide), and help prepare them as much as possible.  I knew their success would translate into good instruction for our students and, hopefully, they would decide to stay a long time.â

I believe that the mentoring program is a great opportunity for novice teachers and will dispel many of the fears and trepidations facing someone new to the profession. While research indicates that the mentors greatly benefit from this experience and grows professionally while interacting with novice teachers. This interaction appears to counter the inevitable stagnation and complacency that may occur when a teacher has been teaching the same thing the same way for many years. Many experienced teachers express a renewed interest in the profession as a result of being a mentor.  Mentoring can be a win-win situation for both the mentor and the novice teacher.

===Essay===
How do you view the role of a mentor?
 

===Essay Response===
I believe a mentor is someone who enjoys their profession and wants to share their knowledge and experience with others.  A mentor is someone that familiarizes you with the school and the community where you will be teaching.  They will give you advice about daily classroom management, they will inform you of successful behavioral management plans for the classroom, explore first day strategies for the upcoming school year, help with individual problems as they arise and offer positive reinforcement.  They will be your sounding board and bridge the gap from formal education to real-life classroom experiences.  But most of all a mentor is someone who cares.

The âBenefits of Mentoringâ is a good article because in the article the author writes about how the mentors need to be trained for the mentoring program to be effective.  The novice teachers will learn more form the teachers that have been trained to mentor new teachers.  In the article the author also writes about how the mentor teachers help the new teachers.  The mentors help the new teachers by teaching them how to write lesson plans and observe there classes so the mentors can provide feedback on how the new teachers can improve.  Even though the author of the article that I am editing included that the mentors need to me trained, I feel that âThe Benefits of Mentoringâ will expand on the subject of training mentor teachers.

== Learning Targets ==

&lt;big&gt;
*''Understand what a mentor is''

*''Understand the benefits of having a mentor as a new teacher''

*''Identify various challenges new teachers face''

*''What steps are needed to implement a successful mentoring program''
&lt;/big&gt;



== Introduction ==

Fresh out of college at 22 and being faced with a classroom filled with mostly 18 year old high school seniors can be daunting thought. What do I do if there is a fight? How do I deal with the very small age difference between me and my classroom full of students? What are they going to think? These and many other frightening and discouraging thoughts might run through a new teachers mind, but what can you do to ease the transition from college to your own classroom? One option is an implementation of a mentoring program for novice teachers.




== What is mentoring and why implement it? ==

Mentoring defined by the Plano Independent School District can be said to be Ã¢ÂÂan exemplary veteran teacher that is selected by the campus administrator to work on a regular basis with one or more teachers not to the district having their major role be to support and guide the new teacherÃ¢ÂÂ (Ã¢ÂÂTeacher Mentor ProgramÃ¢ÂÂ 2004-2008). The Merriam-Webster online dictionaryÃ¢ÂÂs definition of a mentor is, Ã¢ÂÂa trusted counselor or guideÃ¢ÂÂ (Merriam-Webster, 2009). Generally a mentor could be referred to as someone who would be able to Ã¢ÂÂshow the ropesÃ¢ÂÂ to a novice teacher; especially someone who is fresh from college and has little or no experience. Most universities have a form of student-teaching requirement that needs to be completed before students would be able to earn their degrees. This only gives students a very sheltered and small amount of actually practice in teaching. Suddenly going from having the support of the original teacher you are student-teaching from completely disappear and be faced with a room full of students that expect you to know everything about your particular subject is extremely intimidating.

Another issue that has faced the education department is retention rate of new teachers. In an article from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, there was an issue of some schools having difficulty keeping new teachers from leaving after only five years of service to the school. It could be determined that with the overwhelming amount of pressure and the difficulty to make a smooth transition into professional teaching, new teachers found that they were not cut out for this field (Ã¢ÂÂMentoring New TeachersÃ¢ÂÂ,2009). With the guidance of a highly experienced teacher that could help the new teacher with any simple or challenging questions or concerns could have increased the retention rate.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;





== What it takes to start a successful mentoring program ==

Many schools are beginning to take a proactive stance in attempting to implement new teacher mentoring programs. According to the New York State Education Department, there are a few aspects that need to be present to achieve a successful program. To have a successful program a school will need a few components. 
* First, a group of interested candidates to be viable mentors
* Second, a well developed and efficient training program so that the mentors will be able to function and perform at a higher level
* Third, a set amount of programs and activities that the mentor could do with the new teacher to help make smoother transitions 
* Forth, a reasonable time-line for the mentoring period 
(Guidelines for Implementing District - Based Teacher Mentoring Programs, 2007).

== Conclusion ==

Teachers are some of the most important people students will ever meet. The life-long memories of that one special teacher whom that student had the most memorable and impacting experience with is something that many teachers aspire to be. Having a great level of communication skills and also the inept ability to make such a difference in a studentÃ¢ÂÂs life is not an easy task nor does it come naturally to many professionals. Practice might make perfect, but making sure that you are practicing in an efficient and correct way can be made into a better form of perfect with the right guidance. Think back to a time when you were learning to ride a bike, play around with make-up for the first time or even use a computer. Almost everyone can say that with any or all experiences they ventured to try for the first time, they had someone to help guide them in the right direction; no matter how many times you read a step-by-step instructional book, it might have seemed to be easier, faster and more fun to learn when someone showed you themselves. Now imagine a fresh from college teacher who is new to the school and has no one to help learn the ropes from. Although there are many faculty staff members around at all times, you can feel so alone! Although you took countless hours of courses in your university learning how to tackle problems in your classroom, it eases your nerves when someone who has more experience and a stable footing in the school you are starting out in helps you through the first few months. That is one of the main reasons a new teacher mentoring program can help new teachers not fear staring their first few years of teaching and also it can help the retention rate of these new teachers.

&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;
One of the most critical decisions a parent will make is when and where to begin their child’s formal education.  Various schools of thought exist on the matter ranging from beginning a traditional academic curriculum once the child is toilet trained to retaining the child in the home so the parent can home school.  A commonality exists in all cases and that is the expectation for the preschooler to gain a solid foundation in academics, social interaction, and cognitive functioning in order to enable their future scholastic achievements.  Before enrolling a child in any sort of preschool program, it is imperative the parents evaluate their child’s readiness and define their expectations for the preschool program.  In a 2005 study conducted in Charlottesville, Virginia, researchers found dissimilarities between the expectations of teachers and the expectations of parents for preschool children (Lane, Stanton-Chapman, Jamison &amp; Phillips, 2007).  Their findings suggest the importance of communication between teachers and parents and the necessity of making the child aware of the desires of both (Lane et al., 2007).  A child’s success in any early childhood education program hinges on the guidance given to them by their parents and teachers.


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot; face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;
== The Pros ==
&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Potential for Early Identification&lt;/big&gt;

Proponents of pre-kindergarten education identify the potential for early identification of learning disabilities as a basis for their position.  Early identification increases the likelihood the child will achieve greater academic gains and avoid the development of secondary problems (Steele, 2004).  These secondary problems include “frustration, anxiety, behavior problems, greater academic deficiencies, and subsequent motivation problems” (Steele, 2004, pp. 75-76).  As with any prospective problem, an early diagnosis increases the chances of improvement.  Thus, experts in various fields agree the ages between birth and five are crucial for early detection of a child’s learning deficits (Steele, 2004).  

&lt;big&gt;The Early Impact (EI) Program&lt;/big&gt;

According to Larmar and Gatfield (2007), “The Early Impact (EI) Program is an early intervention and prevention program for reducing the incidence of conduct problems in pre-school aged children” (p. 703).  A 2006 study regarding the effectiveness of the program surveyed 455 preschool children and found significant gains in the management of behavior problems in pre-kindergarten students (Larmar &amp; Gatfield, 2007).  Additionally, parents, teachers, and students all acknowledged a positive regard for the EI program (Larmar &amp; Gatfield, 2007).  Implications of such research suggest the possibility for implementation in preschools across the country with the prospect to negate behavior problems in a child prior to them entering kindergarten thus reducing the need for further discipline at the elementary school level.

&lt;big&gt;Greater Academic Gains/Closing the Gap&lt;/big&gt;

It has been widely noted that significant academic gaps exist for children of low socioeconomic status and varied multicultural backgrounds (Perez-Johnson &amp; Maynard, 2007).  According to Perez-Johnson and Maynard (2007), “Our focus on the period of early childhood stems from two critical research-based observations.  First, early childhood is when achievement gaps first emerge.  Second, early childhood represents an optimal period for intervention, because gaps compound and become more costly and difficult to address as time passes by” (p. 588).  It is their belief that if a child from a disadvantaged background can be reached at an early point, then it is plausible they will enter kindergarten on a “level playing field” (Perez-Johnson &amp; Maynard, 2007).  Although it seems Caucasian children are more likely to be enrolled in preschool programs assessed to be of better quality, African-American and Hispanic children are still benefiting greatly from their attendance in government sponsored programs such as Head Start.

“Public funding of early education programs is probably already reducing ethnic and racial gaps. Large shares of Hispanic and black children are attending Head Start; as an upper bound, we estimate that the black-white test score gap at school entry might be as much as 24 percent larger in the absence of Head Start” (Magnuson &amp; Waldfogel, 2005, p. 187).
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Proponents of a universal pre-kindergarten program cite the potential to balance the academic performance levels of all U.S. children as a paramount purpose to substantiate their cause.




&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot; face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;
== The Cons==
&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Pre-K Isn't Cost Effective&lt;/big&gt;

With the recent presidential election, this topic has been thrust to the center of a national debate.  Critics question spending scarce state and federal resources on the education of preschoolers when students in upper grade levels are not performing as expected.  In a recent Wall Street Journal article, two contributors from the Reason Foundation presented evidence against President Obama’s claim that “every dollar spent on preschool will produce a 10-fold return” (Dalmia &amp; Snell, 2008).  It is their assertion a universal preschool program would be of little value until the failures of the K-12 system can be repaired (Dalmia &amp; Snell, 2008).  In Virginia, only 13 percent of those children enrolled in preschool attend a state funded program (VA Snapshot, 2009).  Thus, parents who do not meet the guidelines for a state funded program are left to bear the financial burden of enrolling their child in a private preschool.  Critics assert that whether the burden is assumed by the state or the parent the gains do not substantiate the cost.

&lt;big&gt;Lack of Parental Involvement&lt;/big&gt;

Opponents of mandatory pre-kindergarten contend instruction becomes less advantageous if concepts learned are not reinforced in the home by the caregivers.  A study including 77 children attending a Head Start program examined the relationship between a child’s language acquisition skills and “parental nurturance” (Merlo, Bowman &amp; Barnett, 2007).  Researchers followed up with the 77 students approximately four years later and found those who lived in a more loving home environment with greater parental involvement displayed greater gains in their early reading skills (Merlo et al., 2007).  Unfortunately, no universal preschool program in the world can compel parents to maintain an active interest in their child’s academic progress if they choose to be estranged from the learning process.

&lt;big&gt;Inappropriate Curriculum&lt;/big&gt;

Currently, preschools, especially private ones, vary widely on the type of programs implemented in their institutions.  Additionally, many early childhood educators are not trained to differentiate instruction for students who perform on either end of the academic spectrum.  While much focus remains on the early childhood special education, those students who may later be categorized as gifted are left behind.  Also, those students characterized as “twice-exceptional preschoolers” can often be overlooked in the preschool classroom.  This term refers to those students who may have academic deficits in one area but show extraordinary abilities in another (Chamberlin, Buchanan &amp; Vercimak, 2007).   Recommendations for the improvement of preschool curriculum include the merging of special education and gifted education methods to reach children at every sector of the academic continuum (Chamberlin et al., 2007). 


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot; face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;
== Conclusion ==
&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;
In examining the plethora of opinions on early childhood education, certain factors must exist in order for a child to attain lasting academic benefits from their pre-kindergarten instruction.  These include open communication among teachers, parents, and students, clearly defined expectations for the young pupils, proper training of early childhood educators, and ample parental involvement.  With such components in place, children can derive many advantages from their attendance in pre-kindergarten program including possible early identification of learning disabilities, a decrease in problematic behaviors, and a more level playing field.  However, since each child is different, every case needs to be considered on an individual basis with the well-being of the child remaining the primary focus.

As a parent who has research the subject in depth on behalf of my own child, I would like to offer the following advice for others now making similar decisions.  First, know your child.  This sounds simple but some programs focus on social growth while others stress academic gains.  Enroll your child in a program that best suits them.  Second, evaluate your options based on cost, transportation availability, accreditation, and any other elements you find important in a preschool program.  Prior to enrollment, interview the director, observe the classroom your child would join, and, if possible, speak with your child’s prospective teacher to gain a sense of his or her teaching philosophies.  Lastly, I would advocate you trust your instincts both as a parent and as a current or future educator.  If the program you are considering does not seem to fit your child’s needs, then find one that does.  Likewise, if you feel teaching your child the basic skills from home is most beneficial, you should provide ample opportunity for socialization through playgroups and work diligently from home to ensure your child is prepared for kindergarten.  Simply, a mandatory pre-kindergarten is not the answer.  The answer lies in allowing parents to make decisions based upon the best interest of their child and trusting their determinations.

== Q &amp; A ==
&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;1.  Which of the following &lt;u&gt;IS NOT&lt;/u&gt; one of the arguments for pre-kindergarten education?&lt;/big&gt;

a) A decrease in behavior problems as the student enters elementary school

b) Lessening parent responsibility for child's academic gains

c) Possible early identification of learning disabilities

d) The leveling of the playing field for children from disadvantaged backgrounds


&lt;big&gt;2.  Which of the following &lt;u&gt;IS NOT&lt;/u&gt; one of the arguments against pre-kindergarten education?&lt;/big&gt;

a) Costs more substantial than academic gains

b) Inadequate parental involvement and/or nurturance

c) Lack of adequate curriculum to service needs of ALL students

d) Possible early identification of learning disabilities


&lt;big&gt;3.  Mrs. Smith teaches 4-year old Zachary who exhibits great ability in phonemic awareness but has a documented disability, ADHD.  In order to best suit his individual needs, Mrs. Smith wants to utilize the most beneficial research-based teaching strategies available.  As a colleague, what sort of advice would you give Mrs. Smith?&lt;/big&gt;

a) Combine both special education and gifted education methods to reach this twice-exceptional preschooler

b) Focus on Zachary's advanced early literacy skills and hope the behavior corrects itself

c) Treat Zachary the same as all the other students so as not to stigmatize him

d) Use positive reinforcement techniques to counteract Zachary's negative ADHD related behaviors


&lt;big&gt;4.  One of your brightest 4-year old students, Sophia, seems to grasp number recognition during your lessons at school.  Since she is so interested in numbers, you send home worksheets so she can continue to practice while not at school.  However, you have begun to notice that after the weekends Sophia returns to school with the worksheets blank and displays little improvement in her overall counting skills.  What additional factor seems to be at play in this situation?&lt;/big&gt;

a) Sophia does too many extracurricular activities on the weekend to complete worksheets

b) Sophia is not receiving the parental nurturing she needs from her single mother who works two jobs

c) Sophia is probably just not as interested as she appeared to be in class

d) Sophia may have a learning disability in math

2. d) Early identification of learning disabilities is an argument for pre-kindergarten education.

3. a) Although Zachary has multiple needs, none of them should be ignored.  Mrs. Smith should research twice-exceptional students and utilize both special and gifted education tactics with this student.

4. b) Sophia does not appear to be receiving reinforcement of concepts learned within the home.  Therefore, she is not retaining the information as expected.

== The Question ==

Early intervention: Is pre-k the answer?...to what?  

What is meant by ''early intervention''?

To understand these questions, we need to go back over 40 years when, as part of the War on Poverty, President Johnson created Head Start, the first federally funded pre-school program for low-income children (Center for Public Education, 2007).  There was a recognition at both the federal and state levels that children from low socioeconomic status (SES) families were starting out behind and were unable to catch up with their peers from higher SES families.  Head Start was our nation's first effort to try to prepare disadvantaged children for school.  

Fast forward 20 years to the to the 1985-1986 National Governors Association. This organization was made up of the 50 U.S. governors and education was the most important issue on their agenda.  Many states were also investing in pre-school programs, to reach the children that Head Start wasn't serving, but they knew more was needed. 

 
&lt;font color=&quot;#990033&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
&quot;...we were all faced with the same issues. Our States were behind; the world was changing, and we needed a better education system, particularly at the elementary and secondary level. So that by 1983, when the report of the U.S. Department of Education, called &quot;A Nation at Risk,&quot; came out saying we were greatly at risk because of the mediocrity of the education system, it was into that environment that it came.&quot; (United States Senate, 2004, p.1)&lt;/font&gt;

With the election of President George H. Bush in 1989, the first president to declare himself to be an education president, the governors had an ear at the federal level.  All 50 governors met with Bush at the Education Summit Conference in Virginia, and outlined what was to become the Education Goals for 2000.   These six goals captured the concerns of Bush and the governors: 

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All children in America will start school ready to learn.
&lt;li&gt;High school graduates will increase to 90 percent.
&lt;li&gt;American students will leave the fourth, eighth, and twelfth
grades having demonstrated competency in math, science, English, 
history, and geography
&lt;li&gt;America would be first in the world in math and science.
&lt;li&gt;Adult Americans would be literate.
&lt;li&gt;Every school would be free of drugs and violence. &lt;/ol&gt;
(United States Senate, 2004, p.1)

The goals were broad and far-reaching.  There was a lot of work to do and only ten years to accomplish it all.  The National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) was formed to outline the plan.  The first goal on the agenda was &quot;all children in America will start school ready to learn&quot;.  What does ''ready to learn'' mean?  NEGP provided an answer in their ''Ready Schools'' report.

&lt;font color=&quot;#990033&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
&quot;....prevailing view today, endorsed by the National Education Goals Panel,
is that readiness to learn hinges on a range of factors, including a childâs health and physical development; social and emotional development; approaches to learning; language and communicative skills; and cognition and general knowledge. Efforts to improve school readiness, therefore, begin long before children enroll in kindergarten. They begin with efforts to support families, educate parents, expand access to health care, and raise the quality of early care and education. Getting all children to startâand continueâschool âready to learnâ is a shared responsibility of all adults and institutions in a community (NEGP, 1998, p 3).&quot;  
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;35%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;border: solid 3px #FFBDBD; padding: lem;&quot; Valign=center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''The Real Question'''

Does pre-k help children arrive at school &quot;ready to learn&quot;?
   
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Their definition outlines several areas of focus for readiness, including raising the quality of early care and education.  So whose responsibility is it to provide the early care and education for children?  Shouldn't the parents be providing that?  The NEGP states that we all share responsibility.  This is where the question '''''what is early intervention?''''' is answered.    As a nation, it is incumbent upon us to '''intervene''' on the behalf of children in families that do not have the resources to provide quality care and education.  It is also where the question '''''Is pre-k the answer?'' ''' becomes relevant.  Does pre-k raise the quality of early education, and help ensure that children arrive at school ''ready to learn''?    

It's important to understand that the goal ''ready to learn'' is just that, a goal.  The NEGP, armed with the definition of readiness to learn, outlined their plan for ensuring that children are ready to learn.  The plan was presented in the form of objectives.  In ''Ready Schools'' the NEGP outlined three objectives aimed at achieving the first goal of the ''Education Goals of 2000.''

Goal 1: Ready to Learn

By the year 2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn.

Objectives:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;All children will have access to high-quality and developmentally      appropriate preschool programs that help prepare children for school.
&lt;li&gt;Every parent in the United States will be a childâs first teacher and 
devote time each day to helping such parentâs preschool child learn, 
and parents will have access to the training and support parents need.
&lt;li&gt;Children will receive the nutrition, physical activity experiences, and  
health care needed to arrive at school with healthy minds and bodies, 
and to maintain the mental alertness necessary to be prepared to learn, 
and the number of low-birthweight babies will be significantly reduced  
through enhanced prenatal health systems.&lt;/ol&gt;
(NEGP, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;1)

== The NEGP Answer ==

&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;border: solid 3px #FFBDBD; padding: lem;&quot; Valign=center&gt;
Objective 1:  

All children will have access to high-quality and developmentally appropriate preschool programs that help prepare children for school.

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

With the objectives outlined by the NEGP, it is clear that pre-k is considered to be part of the answer. That was then, this is now.  Where are we on the issue today?  

Fortunately, Governor Bill Clinton was one of the leads at the Education Summit in Virginia, and when he was elected President in 1993, he kept focus on the original plan.  Despite the efforts of two administrations however, it was still unclear as of December 1999, whether our children were coming to school ''ready to learn''.
 
&lt;font color=&quot;#990033&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&quot;The Goals Panel does not yet have direct data regarding childrenâs readiness for school. A major new study from the National Center for Educational Statistics, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, however, promises to provide the kind of new data the panel has sought.(NEGP, 1999, p.10).&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

For more information on NCLB, please see the articles in      
Chapter 4 â Education Reform, Article 4.5 âNCLB: Cure or Curseâ.   
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  

In 2001, the administration changed once again and President George W. Bush continued to hold education as a national priority, implementing his program &quot;No Child Left Behind (NCLB)&quot;.  

More importantly, as it relates to the question of pre-k, Bush implemented Good Start, Grow Smart (GSGS Interagency Workgroup, 2006) (click here to read about GSGS)[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ccb/initiatives/gsgs/fedpubs/GSGSBooklet.pdf], his program aimed at ensuring that children enter school ''ready to learn''.  GSGS outlines the Federal Early Learning Initiatives and the children they serve.  Review the table on page 5 to see how the federal funds are being used to provide preschool programs through local agencies. 

Through programs like Head-Start, Early Head-Start, the Child Care Development Fund, Title 1 Preschool, and Special Education grants, the federal government is providing ''early intervention'' through direct funding of preschool programs.  In addition, states are funding an additional combined total of $2 billion dollars for pre-k programs today (Center for Public Education, 2007).

'''Is pre-k working?'''

Whether federally or state funded, there is accountability for the dollars being spent on pre-k.  Are the eligibility requirements for the government programs reaching all children in need?  Are the programs staffed with qualified teachers?  Do they have quality learning programs? '''Is pre-k working?''' Many believe that pre-k can make a difference in a child's readiness for school, but it depends on many factors. 

Data is difficult to gather and interpret.  The variety of programs (length of day, quality of staff, type of program) directly affects the outcomes (Gormely, Gayer, Phillips &amp; Dawson, 2005).  &lt;font color=&quot;#990033&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&quot;Evidence on Head Start remains controversial, although carefully designed studies have documented positive effects on children's early learning&quot; (Gormley ''et al.'', 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;872)&lt;/font&gt;.  Gormley's (2005) article also reports positive results on the school readiness of children who attended the universal pre-k program in Tulsa, Oklahoma.   Based upon data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), referenced in the National Education Goals, Lessons Learned, Challenges Ahead report (NEGP, 1999), &lt;font color=&quot;#990033&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&quot;...results suggest that the greatest potential return to public investments in early education may be obtained by increasing disadvantaged children's enrollment in prekindergarten and by expanding programs located in local public schools&quot; (Magnuson, Ruhm, &amp; Waldfogel, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;49). &lt;/font&gt;

But what are the long term benefits of being 'ready for school'?  Is the investment in pre-k reducing other costs associated with poverty such as drop-outs, welfare and internment?  It takes  decades to trace long-term effects, and there are many factors that influence those outcomes.  It is difficult to isolate pre-k as a variable.  However, one frequently cited study, the High/Scope Perry Preschool Project provided some impressive results.  In the chart from the Center for Public Education below, both short-term and long-term differences were recorded.

== Consider This ==

Early intervention: ''how early is &quot;early&quot;?''

'''Do you remember when....?''' 

...kindergarten was where children got ready for school.  Up until the late 1960s, kindergarten was the first time most children were in a group setting with a teacher, learning about the alphabet, colors, sharing and caring. Now, many children are learning what they need to know '''before''' they get to kindergarten.  With the increased number of two-income families, many children are getting a 'head-start' on kindergarten, in quality daycare and private pre-school progams.  Childcare centers like Kindercare, founded in 1969, provide early learning programs.  Kindergarten is no longer the first 'school' experience for a much larger population of children.  Socially and academically, children who have been in a quality program are more advanced and are ''ready to learn'' by the time they go to kindergarten.  Children who are economically disadvantaged and don't participate in these programs are already behind by the time they get to kindergarten.

'''The conundrum'''

Kindergarten was supposed to prepare children for school.  But now Kindergarten is considered school.  If pre-k becomes school-based, will '''it''' become part of school?  Do you then need to ensure that children enter school ready for pre-k?
 
''&quot;Obama's Agenda&quot;''

With the inauguration of President Obama, we now have our 4th consecutive president with education, early education in particular, on the agenda.  His &quot;Zero to Five&quot; plan is more far reaching than his predecessors, and supports voluntary, universal pre-school.  This translates to a school-based pre-k program, implemented at the individual state level, like the one in Oklahoma.  In addition, his plan includes increased funding for younger children (Early Head Start), and quality child care, to address the needs of children from birth.  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;border: solid 3px #FFBDBD; padding: lem;&quot; Valign=center&gt;
Early Childhood Education

Zero to Five Plan: The Obama-Biden comprehensive &quot;Zero to Five&quot; plan will provide critical support to young children and their parents. Unlike other early childhood education plans, the Obama-Biden plan places key emphasis at early care and education for infants, which is essential for children to be ready to enter kindergarten. Obama and Biden will create Early Learning Challenge Grants to promote state Zero to Five efforts and help states move toward voluntary, universal pre-school.
 
Expand Early Head Start and Head Start: Obama and Biden will quadruple Early Head Start, increase Head Start funding, and improve quality for both. 

Provide affordable, High-Quality Child Care: Obama and Biden will also increase access to affordable and high-quality child care to ease the burden on working families. (White House, nd)
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Conclusion ==

There is no &quot;silver bullet&quot;.  While the question of pre-k focuses on children's readiness to learn when they start kindergarten, children at every grade level come to school everyday with backpacks full of physical, medical, emotional and financial issues that impact their readiness to learn.  It is a complex issue and while there is evidence that pre-k makes a difference, that evidence is qualified by statements about the kind of program, the quality of staff and other factors.   

Better pre-natal care, early parenting intervention, better health care for children.  All these things contribute to a child's readiness to learn as well.  What is the best allocation of funds?  As a future teacher, specifically a future kindergarten teacher, I am personally encouraged by the fact that Obama's agenda includes plans for voluntary universal pre-k. 

As voters and taxpayers, however, we are all participants in answering this question.  I hope this article has increased your understanding of this issue and it's history and helps you make a more informed decision on:  ''Early intervention:  Is pre-k the answer? ''

 9FF&quot;&gt; Introduction==

It takes a lot to run a school, an effective one at that. There are several important factors necessary in order to maintain a successful school. A few of these include an excellent teaching staff and a positive classroom environment. &quot;To be good and effective, a school should have a clear organization, characterized by stated missions, goals, values, and standards of performance&quot; (Ninan 2006). 



==&lt;font color=&quot;FF0
 066&quot;&gt; '''Teachers:''' the building blocks of life==

&quot;Society demands that teachers should be men or women with qualities of both head and heart&quot; (Ninan 2006). The dictionary defines a teacher as &quot;one whose occupation is to instruct,&quot; but a teacher is and offers much more that that (m-w.com). Teachers are a fundamental element in the life of a student. A teacher must possess numerous qualities in order to be effective with both their head and heart. Some of these qualities include motivation, compassion, encouragement, communication, and challenging the student (Patten 2003). 

In an ineffective school, a teacher cannot control their students. Kraut states, &quot;a teacher cannot teach unless his/her classroom is orderly&quot; (2000, p. 103). This goes to show that it is the responsibility of the teacher to manage his or her class. Sadker and Zittleman have identified 5 key factors in regards to what it takes to have and maintain an effective school. The first of these factors is strong leadership. A teacher must be prepared, organized, and on time for everything (Ninan 2006). By doing this, the teacher sets a prime example for the students to follow. 

Many studies show that well-qualified teachers (with certifications, acquired skills, extra training, etc.) further enhance a student's learning potential. Teacher training ranked number six on the top nine things that need to be changed to make a school effective (Kearns and Harvey, 2000, p. 187). Sadker and Zittleman state that under qualified as well as uncertified teachers serve at the academic expense of the students (2007). 

==&lt;font color=&quot;009
 900&quot;&gt; '''Feedback and Expectations:''' helpful not hurtful ==

It is essential that teachers provide a positive learning environment for their students. This feat can be accomplished through several strategies including, but not limited to high expectations and feedback. 

One of Sadker and Zittleman's key points to an effective school is high expectations. In the past, expectations were standards to measure up to or be labeled by (Ninan 2006). Today teachers are trying to break that mold and are encouraged to focus on the positives. &quot;In effective schools, teachers hold high expectations that students can learn, and they translate these expectations into behaviors&quot; (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007). 

Kearns and Harvey have compiled a list of the top nine goals in reforming an ineffective school into an effective school with number two being high expectations. They state that, &quot;high expectations create a climate in which educators, parents, and citizens understand that all children can learn and all of them can achieve at very high and demanding levels&quot; (2000, p. 187). Furthermore, these goals must be apparent in all aspects of classroom work (Baker, Herman, and Bain, 3). Ninan states that students, &quot;perform better in schools where teachers desist from 'labeling' and such other negative measures, and express high, but reasonable expectations about their academic performance as also responsible behavior&quot; (2006). In addition, students that are assigned important responsibilities and classroom jobs exude greater behavior as well as attendance because they are involved in meaningful activities (Ninan 2006).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Feedback is defined as &quot;a reaction or response to a particular process or activity&quot; (dictionary.com). There are many types of feedback, and the way that teachers convey it can impact the student. Feedback can also be used to show what is and is not permitted while at school. Teachers must be careful in what they say or do because negative feedback can be extremely traumatic to younger students. On the other hand, ''excessive'' positive feedback can put too much stress to excel on the student. Positive feedback is necessary to boost the students' morale, and in turn it will influence other positive actions. 

In an ineffective school, &quot;performance, results, achievement, success&quot; are stressed by teachers and administrators (Kohn, 1999, p. 27). The overemphasizing leads to fear of failure and challenges, in addition to lowering the student's learning quality (Kohn, 1999, p. 28).

Direct and immediate feedback such as a compliment or scolding are essential in the classroom. &quot;Researchers have found that the most immediate direct feedback like praise or approval had the strongest association with positive pupil behavior, whereas higher incidence of punishments resulted in negative outcomes of behavior ... quiet reprimands are more effective than loud and frequent nagging&quot; (Ninan 2006).

Assigning work is a way for teachers to use feedback because it allows them to assess and help the students. &quot;When homework is graded and commented on, achievement is increased from the 50th to nearly the 80th percentile&quot; (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007). 

==&lt;font color=&quot;FFC
 C99&quot;&gt; '''Safety and Behavior Management'''==

School safety is an important issue that should be addressed during the student's earlier years. Though there have been many horrific incidences occurring in schools worldwide, &quot;schools today are safer than they have been in years&quot; (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007). Sadker and Zittleman report that &quot;nearly all public school teachers (98%) and most students (93%) report feeling safe in schools&quot; (2007).

Ninan states that safe schools focus on achievement in terms of academics, involvement with the community and parents, the mission of the school, and everyone being treated with respect (2006). Schools provide a safe haven for many as an escape from the tough outside world.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000
 0FF&quot; face=&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;One girl, who did not have money to buy a winter coat or glasses to see the chalkboard, rode the subway 1 hour and 40 minutes each way to get to school. She never missed a day, because for her school was a refuge and a place of hope where she could learn in safety&quot; (Sadker and Zittleman, 2007).&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Behavior in the classroom can affect everyone. Harvey Kraut reports that the teacher, &quot;is charged with the burden of creating an environment that instills security, sharing and a sense of togetherness&quot; (2000, p. 104). The teacher is not there to baby sit or yell, but must reinforce rules and policies to efficiently run a class. As previously mentioned, the instructor must be prepared and organized. &quot;Behavior is determined by the way the teacher goes about his/her teaching and organization of the learning activities&quot; (Ninan 2006). Ninan states that to successfully manage a classroom, the students must be &quot;actively engaged in productive activities&quot; (2006). 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000
 0FF&quot; face=&quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Psychologists have shown that children have a strong tendency to copy the behavior of their elders, especially people in positions of authority who they like and respect&quot; (Ninan 2006).&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

It is not fair for the good students to be exposed to disruptions from fellow classmates. Studies show that a teacher who must deal with an unruly student also distracts the class. According to Ninan, the greater the punishment, the more the student displayed disruptive behavior (2006). Again, quiet reprimands are key in keeping the classroom calm. 

==&lt;font color=&quot;999
 9FF&quot;&gt; Conclusion==

Effective schools require many things. A good teaching staff is essential. Educators must be role models for their students. The teachers must genuinely care about their students and lead with their head and heart. All students need and deserve a positive and safe learning environment. Instructors must manage their class and keep everything calm. With goals clearly stated and involvement from all, effective schools can be achieved.

1. Students should know the reasons why effectiveness in education is important.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#153E7E&quot; face=&quot;bookman old style&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

People often talk about the importance of education and how schools need to improve.  However, that is usually as far as the idea goes.  This is because everyone has different definitions for what an effective school is and how to improve ineffective schools.  Just because a student goes to school every day, it does not mean the school is doing the best job they can.  There is always room for improvement, even in the best of schools.


Essentially, an effective school is one which is conducted in a safe environment by qualified teachers (Ashley, 2006).  Everyone in the education field should have goals and high expectations for the school and its students (Ashley, 2006).  Students should not only be taught academics, but also life skills (Ashley, 2006).  There are many schools which are not at this level of effectiveness, though.  Ineffective schools are most commonly found in high poverty areas (NEA, 2001).  They typically are not well funded, do not have enough technology, and do not have highly qualified leaders (NEA, 2001).


Improving ineffective schools should be one of America's top priorities.  A good education is the foundation of every qualified professional in this country.  There have been many studies done to find out what makes high performing schools effective (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  These studies show that there are six top factors which make a school effective, among other characteristics.

&lt;/font&gt;

----

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#153E7E&quot; face=&quot;bookman old style&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Positive Classroom Environment'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

The classroom environment is a very important aspect of an effective school.  If a student does not feel safe or comfortable while in their classroom, they will not be able to focus on what is being taught.  


It is essential that students feel safe while in school (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  Even though 98% of teachers and 93% of students say they feel safe in their school, safety is still a topic of debate (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  Making schools safe begins with teaching students respect, for themselves and others (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  Another key step in safety is to identify student problems early, before the student turns to violence to solve them (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #98AFC7;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Aside from safety, it is also valuable for students to feel at ease while at school (Ashley, 2006).  They should feel able to approach their teacher and other students (Ashley, 2006).  The learning environment should also be open, clean, colorful, and inviting (Armstrong, 2002).

&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#153E7E&quot; face=&quot;bookman old style&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Qualified Educational Leaders'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

Having qualified leaders in the field of education is essential for success.  These are the people who are around the children for approximately 35 hours each week.  They are the people who will teach, inspire, and guide the students and they need to be qualified to do so.


The school leadership begins with the principal.  The principal should be open and honest with teachers and staff (Ashley, 2006).  They should make themselves approachable so teachers feel comfortable approaching them with new ideas (Ashley, 2006).  Principals should allow their teachers to be creative and innovative in the classroom (Ashley, 2006).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


The other aspect of school leadership is the teachers.  Schools should require that all of their teachers are highly qualified and fully certified (NEA, 2001).  There also needs to be incentives for teachers who meet these requirements and do their job well (Lockheed, Levin, 1993).  Incentives could include mentoring programs to help teachers adjust and loan forgiveness for those who teach in low performing schools (NEA, 2001).

&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#153E7E&quot; face=&quot;bookman old style&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Setting Goals'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

Setting goals for schools and students is an important process.  It helps to motivate people when there is something specific to aim for.  It is also a good way to show the clear path to success.


The principal should work with the teachers to develop a plan and mission for the school (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  Once they have done this, they should share it with the students (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  Goals should include specific strategies and techniques for improvement and progress (NEA, 2001).  Also, everyone should be pushed to work hard in order to achieve the goals and be successful and effective (Ashley, 2006).

&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#153E7E&quot; face=&quot;bookman old style&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''High Expectations for Students'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

It is a known fact that people often live up to what is expected of them.  If you do not expect much from a person, they often will not give you much.  This is why it is crucial for teachers to expect their students to do well so there is a standard for students to uphold.


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #98AFC7;
border: solid 6px #153E7E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Each student should be expected to do their best on each assignment, despite previous performance or social background (Ashley, 2006).  There is no reason that any student should be held to a lower standard than any other student (Ashley, 2006).  When a teacher holds low expectations for a student, they tend to treat them differently (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  They may even give those students less praise and less communication (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  Once teachers have made their expectations clear to the students, they need to develop objectives that the students can excel in (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).

&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#153E7E&quot; face=&quot;bookman old style&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Conducting and Implementing Research and Funding'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

It is necessary for schools to conduct research for many reasons.  They need to use their research findings in order to find out what works in schools and what does not.  Then, schools need to receive funding in order to implement plans that support the research findings.


Research should be conducted in many different ways in order to reach each student (Lockheed, Levin, 1993).  Everyone in the field of education should pay close attention to the findings in order to figure out where next to go with the school curriculum (Lockheed, Levin, 1993).  If the research shows that something is not working, the subject or technique should be discarded and a new plan should be implemented (Lockheed, Levin, 1993).


One of the biggest problems when it comes to funding in education is the difference of funds spent on students in high poverty areas compared to those in better financed schools (NEA, 2001).  Low performing schools need the funding the most due to all of the resources they are already lacking (NEA, 2001).  However, all schools need more funding in order to provide everything necessary for each student to get the best education possible (NEA, 2001).

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

One of the best ways to see if the school curriculum is effective is by monitoring student progress.  If a large majority of students are not progressing, it probably means that there needs to be massive curriculum changes.  On the other hand, if only a few students are struggling, it most likely is a sign that they need extra help.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


The best plan to have when monitoring progress is to take a well rounded approach since one test is not a good measure for everyone (NEA, 2001).  Progress reports should be made so students can know their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as where they are now and future goals (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  Students should be assessed in comparison to national averages as well as to see if they know the material (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  There have also been studies done which show that doing homework is a good way to monitor progress and raise student achievement scores (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).

&lt;/font&gt;

----

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#153E7E&quot; face=&quot;bookman old style&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Other Factors'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

''Early Start''

Typically, when a child starts attending school is based on their age.  However, a child's age does not have much to do with their ability to learn.  Some children may be ready to start learning earlier than the minimum required age.  Educational studies have shown that children who attend early start schools receive better grades and have higher IQs as adults (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).


''Extended Learning''

It is common sense that more time spent in school means more time spent learning.  This exra learning time could help students who are struggling to catch up with their classmates (NEA, 2001).  Other methods to extend learning include longer school years, more testing, more graded homework assignments, and more after school programs (NEA, 2001).


''Better Behavior''

One of the biggest complaints from well behaved students is that their teachers spend too much time disciplining students with behavioral issues (Ashley, 2006).  When teachers have to stop their lesson in order to discipline a student, it causes a huge disruption for the rest of the class.  Teachers need to be taught how to handle all of these minor interruptions, as well as major disciplinary issues, so that valuable learning time is not lost (Ashley, 2006).


''Smaller Classes and Schools''

Whenever a student is in the position to receive extra support and attention, they are likely to excel in their schoolwork.  Small class size, particularly during elementary school, typically has a positive effect on students because they receive more individual attention (NEA, 2001).  Studies have shown that, for older students, being in smaller schools is most beneficial (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).  It has been proven that students who attend small schools are more likely to pass their classes and attend college (Sadker, Zittleman, 2006).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


''Community Partnerships''

The saying, &quot;It takes a village to raise a child,&quot; is true when it comes to a child's education, as well.  A child will only benefit if teachers, parents, policy makers, and any other community figures are involved in their education (Ashley, 2006).  It is also beneficial if all of these people involved share their ideas with each other about how to improve education (Ashley, 2006).  It is extremely important for parents to have chances to be involved with their child's education by opportunities such as skill workshops and volunteer programs (NEA, 2001).


''Student Driven Curriculum''

There have been studies which have shown that when students have a hand in developing the curriculum, they are more invested in it (Armstrong, 2002).  This is also a good way to develop assignments in which all learning styles are addressed (Armstrong, 2002).  After all, the students are the ones who know how they learn best.  Also, students have said that they learn better when assignments are individualized and engaging (Armstrong, 2002).


''Technology''

Using technology at schools and for homework can be a great thing for students.  Technology can be an excellent motivational tool for students who are otherwise disinterested (NEA, 2001).  Schools can also use technology to keep track of student behavior and to monitor progress (NEA, 2001).


''Planning for the Future''

It is vital that schools help prepare their students for the future.  Students should leave school with the knowledge that lifelong learning is the key to success (Armstrong, 2002).  Also, students who leave high school to enter the &quot;real world&quot; should have been taught the skills necessary for surviving it (Armstrong, 2002).

&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#153E7E&quot; face=&quot;bookman old style&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#488AC7&quot; face=&quot;tahoma&quot;&gt;

Education is the key to success in this country.  It is vital that we do everything we can in order to ensure that each student gets the best education available.  This is important because these students are going to be entering professional fields and, possibly, even teaching the next generation.


Simply attending school does not guarantee a good education.  There are many factors which must be used together in order to build the best education possible.  It is necessary for schools to have positive, open environments with highly qualified leaders.  It is also crucial for schools to research progress in order to see what is or is not working so they are able to build a balanced curriculum.


A school does not just need to offer an education, they need to offer each student the best education they possibly can.  By implementing as many of these factors as they can, a school can give each student a well rounded, successful, and effective education.

Jamie Accashian, Principal&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




'''Learning Targets'''

Students should be able to:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define and give two examples of what a School and Community Partnership is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have working knowledge of what Communities In Schools is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name two benefits of School and Community Partnerships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



'''
== Introduction ==
'''

&lt;P&gt;Let's imagine this scenario. You are a first year freshman English teacher. You have a student who has the potential to be very successful. However, you have noticed recently that he has skipped classes, not turned in assignments, and went from makings &quot;B's&quot; to &quot;D-'s&quot; and &quot;F&quot;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You talk to the student and he tells you that he has had to take on two jobs to help support his family. What do you do? How can you help him?&lt;/P&gt;


'''
== What is School and Community Partnerships==
'''

&lt;P&gt;A school-community partnership involves &quot;the connections between schools and community individuals, organizations, and businesses that are forged to promote students' social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development&quot; (Saunders, 2001).
&lt;P&gt; These organizations can give money or volunteer their time and services. A few ways they can volunteer their time is by mentoring a student, tutoring, or just allowing a student to shadow them.&lt;/P&gt;


'''
== Why do we need Community Partnerships in our Schools? ==
'''

&lt;P&gt;Schools are being held accountable for students learning and what they know. However, schools cannot do this alone. This is where school and community partnerships come into play. In these different partnerships students are given the best opportunities to succeed in school because the community can sometimes provide resources that schools cannot really afford to provide. In a personal interview with Mr. Bob Cartwright, he said that, &quot;in tight monetary times, the financial advantages to the school are apparent&quot; (B. Cartwright, personal communication, September 30, 2008).

'''

== What is Community In Schools? ==
'''

&lt;P&gt;Communities In Schools (CIS) is a nationwide organization that helps to prevent students from dropping out of school and being prepared to become active and productive citizens in their communities (Communities in Schools At A Glance). CIS is a place where students can feel safe and feel as though someone actually cares about what happens to them. They are free to learn and not worry about being bullied. For some they are given a second chance at an education. One thing CIS helps to provide is alternative high schools that offer both day and night programs.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The teacher in the above scenario could recommend this to her student. The principal and the faculty would have worked with the student to help him be able to work to help his family and to still get his degree. They could even transpose his work experience into high school credit and work with his job to make sure he is able to attend school. The teachers are caring and go out of their way to help their students. I know all of this because I was lucky enough to experience it. I was that student that wanted to learn but had a hard time functioning in regular high school. The night school program was strict, as with any Community In Schools (CIS) program. Attendance is mandatory and if you miss so many days of school, you are dimissed from the program until the next semester. (B. Cartwright, personal communication, September 30, 2008). 
&lt;/P&gt;

'''Interviews'''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;P&gt;After my sophomore year, I was dealing with more family issues at home and being picked on at school. It got to the point that I really did not want to go to school and begged to be sent to a private school. Private school was not feasible and I had heard about an alternative high school that my best friend attended. It was called Burger King Academy, and the only ties we had to Burger King were that we received generous amounts of monetary funding from them.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We were still a public high school in Chesterfield County, VA. The school is now called Community High School. I actually felt free at school to learn and not be fearful of being picked on because it was simply not tolerated. Our principal was not only a leader for us but also a mentor. The teachers were able to really get to know me there because there were fewer students in my class. I had a relationship bond with them that if something was bothering me I could talk to them about it and I knew they would help me if they could. They were some of the inspirations in why I wanted to go into teaching. I still talk and visit with them today.&lt;/P&gt;



'''

== Benefits of School and Community Partnerships ==
'''

&lt;P&gt;There is research out there about the many benefits of community and school partnerships. One benefit is opportunities for students to take what they have learned in the classroom and apply it to a project that is meaningful (Bouillion and Gomez, 2001). One way this is happening is through a program called, Junior Achievement. This program pairs business professionals with students in local schools. I remember being in middle school and participating in Junior Achievement in one of my classes. Our class was broken up into groups and we were to form our own businesses. We had to come up with everything from the product to the price and everything in between. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A second benefit is students are able to build real relationships and networks to prepare them for the &quot;real world&quot;. Through Communities in Schools, as well as other regular high schools, students are given a chance to network with professionals in the business world through cooperative education programs. A student at a CIS school would work during the day and turn in the work to the teacher. The class would be more of an independent study course.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A third benefit is one that affects students' attendance rates. Research done by Sheldon (2007) has shown that the stronger the connection between school and community partnerships, the better school attendance is. Students test scores on achievement test went up when schools partnered with the community (Sheldon, 2003). When schools and communities partner together students graduation rates increase According to Chesterfield County Public Schools website, more than 1,000 students graduated from Chesterfield County Public Schools with the help of CIS.&lt;/P&gt;


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;As I reflect, I keep remembering the students that could see the light at the end of the tunnel, and who could, quite often, say that they were proud of setting and reaching a goal for the first time in their lives. But they need not say it; it was always apparent in their positive attitudes, and their proud smiles.&quot; ~ Mr. Bob Cartwright
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;P&gt;In my personal interview with two people who worked in a Communities in Schools (CIS) High School, I asked them about the benefits of Communities in Schools (CIS). According to Coach Jamie Accashian students benefit both &quot;financially&quot; and through &quot;marketable skills that would lead to direct employment&quot; (J. Accashian, personal communication, September 22, 2008). A teacher at the night school program said, &quot;A hand-picked, and volunteer staff that was more in tune with the needs of, and approaches to, these special situation students&quot; (B. Cartwright, personal communication, September 30, 2008).&lt;/P&gt;
'''

== Conclusion ==
'''

&lt;P&gt;School and Community partnerships can provide students today with a better education and help with the demands put on the schools to meet expectations set by federal and state education mandates. The partnerships can provide monetary and non-monetary support. Through Communities in Schools students can have access to resources that can help them succeed in school. The benefits of community and school partnerships are numerous. In a world that is changing every moment and with more pressure being put on teachers to make sure students meet high standards of excellence, the community can help. In my opinion all we need to do is ask.&lt;/P&gt;

== Introduction ==
'''
In various communities across the country many schools are reaching out.  Oftentimes many of the schools need extra funding or even to bridge the gap between the community and the school.  These days more and more schools are socially linking themselves within the community. Community partnerships can improve school programs to connect students parents to put forth more effort at home as well as helping teachers. The main reason for community partnerships is to help young kids succeed in school and later in life. Many often wonder what exactly makes a good community partnership. With the help of the local, federal, and state policies it outlines a distinct route to work from.  In the 1990s the Educate America Act set partnerships as a voluntary national goal for all states. This means that many school systems are setting up policies to create more connections with the surrounding communities.

== Examples of Community Involvement ==
'''
In Boston many of the low-income communities see a significant incline of student dropouts.  Many of these kids just feel the need not to attend school and often become related with illegal activities. In Boston an organization has stepped to the plate to stop this with the young black and Latino community. Each Monday night this organization rents multiple vans to take the blacks and Latinos to the club organization. By picking these young kids up it insures their safety to the parents and so the parents know they are attending. This community organization reaches out to the kids to make them feel part of the community. It gives them a sense of belonging and a place where they feel safe. This organization also reaches out to them by creating community building and critical thinking activities. By having a organization that is targeted to racial classes it helps out in low income communities. It gives these kids a sense belonging and they are doing food for their community. Without these small organization many of these kids would still be running the street in Boston, instead every Monday they are socializing together, creating a better life for themselves as well as their families.

From growing up in Chesapeake, Virginia my whole life the community has been nothing but a huge impact on the school system. When I was in grade school the school system had a partnership with Pizza Hut for the Book It Program. This program was geared for young kids from kindergarten to fifth grade to get out and read as much as possible. This program encouraged students to read as much as they can during the month, once the month was over they were given a book it certificate from their teacher. Once the student received the certificate they would take it to their local pizza hut and they would receive a free one topping personal pan pizza. Also the student would be presented a book it pin which accumulated stickers for future months. This program lasts from October 1st through March 31st. If the student met his or her goal each month they would receive the personal pan pizza each month as well as the sticker. At the end of the year they would become a Pizza Hut All-Star Reader if they completed the program each month. This community organization was very helpful when I was younger. It made the kids in each class read as much as possible and it even encouraged the parents. Many parents would often have reading time with the family and encourage students to go to the public libraries to check out books to read.

== Schools Reaching Out to the Community==
'''
Many schools these days reach out to the community in which the school resides. At my local high school in Chespeake they had a club called MAGfrat. This club was geared towards community involvement with the school and community. Oftentimes they would go to local establishments and clean. They often reached out to the elderly in Chesapeake and often did community service. They would often go to elderly's houses and do yard work because oftentimes they could not do it themselves. They would rake yards, bag leaves and cut the grass. Doing this helped the students perform various tasks to help their community. It taught them that it's always a good deed to help others in their time of need and that one day these services could help you. 

Also many schools around thanksgiving and Christmas orchestrate a canned food drive. They get each homeroom to college non-parishable food items that can be sent off to the less fortunate during the holidays. The schools normally team up with the local foodbanks to help out amongst the community.

Another form of school support is the adopt a child program. Many schools in Chesapeake adopted this idea. Each homeroom teams up with other homerooms and they receive a child that they are responsible for to buy gifts for Christmas. Each homeroom donates money to a fund and at the end of the two weeks they take the money and go buy various gifts the child had written down for his or her Christmas list.

These three forms of school involvement are a huge benefit for the less fortunate in our community. It brings the community closer to their local school system and gives the students that are involved a sense of belonging that they are helping out people that are not as wealthy and stable as they are. It gives you a sense or pride in knowing that you too are helping the community through your local school.

'''
== Communities Reaching out to Schools==
'''
Oftentimes it goes unnotices by the majoritiy of the population, but we as a community are helping out the school in many different ways. The community as a whole funds the whole public school system.  People may not realize, but the money you spend and the tax it generates helps pay the teachers salaries as well as any staff it has on payroll. It goes from the people cooking school lunches to the substitutes that are filling in for the teachers. This funding is a great asset because the public school system is a non profit organization and is solely funded on generious donations as well as the tax payers money.

Another example of community outreach is when sports teams often go out and get donations to help feed the athletic team before games. When I was in high school many local businesses often would send large portions of food to help feed the team before games. This is a grateful impact of what your community is willing to do for your school. Oftentimes football teams have anywhere from fifty to eighty kids including coaches they would have to feed before hand. With the help of local restaurants they donate food which helps so that parents do not have to pay out of pocket for their kids to eat before sporting events.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#4CC417&quot; face=&quot;VERDANA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Who is the first person that a student sees when entering a classroom? Who do students rely on to teach them all that they need to know about how to succeed in life? The answer is the teacher. Most children dread going to school when they wake up in the morning but is there not a way that teachers could change the way they feel? There are many ways in which one can create a positive learning environment in the classroom, but the main ingredient is the teacher.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;VERDANA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Why Is the Role of the Teacher So Important?'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If a teacher wants to have a room full of students who will succeed, then he/she needs to set a good example in the classroom. In an article titled, &quot;Setting A Tone For A Positive Learning Environment&quot;, Rebecca Schauffele says,&quot;The teacher is the facilitator, the teacher sets an example, and the teacher is the role model. Attitude goes a long way(2009).&quot; Students look up to their teachers each and every day. If teachers want to have students who are excited to learn, then they must be excited themselves. Even if one is having a rough morning, it is important for the teacher to come to school everyday with a smile on his/her face , otherwise the children are not going to want to be there either. The most important role of a teacher is to let the students know that they are respected and cared for. If students understand that they are wanted by the teachers, then they may be more willing to learn from them.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #4EE2EC;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;Veranda&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;They may forget what you said but they will never forget how you made them feel&quot;--Anonymous.'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C9C299&quot; face=&quot;VERDANA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''How To Have A Positive Attitude'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The word positive does not simply mean to be happy or optimistic all of the time, but to feel safe and comfortable too. While students are in the classroom, they need to feel wanted and valued. They need to know that even if they answer a question incorrectly or behave inappropriately that they will still be cared for. Instead of people telling children what not to do or how not to do something, they need to let the students know what they should do or suggest how they could do something. Another way to make students feel important is to give them choices. For example, if a child refuses to do schoolwork, positively ask the child, &quot;Would you like to complete the worksheet during your play time at home or your free time at school?&quot; More than likely, the child will choose to do the work at school because they want to play during their play time. In addition, the student now feels more important because they were able to make their own decision.


&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;4EE2EC&quot; face=&quot;VERDANA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Creating A Positive Learning Environment'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

There are many other ways in which a teacher can create a positive learning environment such as, learning the students' names, making themselves available, and noticing each individual's differences. When a teacher calls a student by their name, it lets the child know that they are seen as an individual. Therefore, the student may feel more relaxed in the classroom or more willing to speak out loud in class discussions. By making themselves available, the student realizes that they can go to their teacher for help or to talk about other problems whenever they want to. If a child knows that their teacher is available and willing to listen, then they may be more willing to talk. It is also important to recognize that each student learns in a different way. Once a student becomes discouraged, it is hard to make them believe in themselves again. If a student gets the wrong answer, an encouraging teacher should go over the problem with the child and determine what went wrong. Then, he/she should suggest a way in which they can redo the problem together as a team. A teacher should never flat out tell the student that they are wrong because that will lower their self-esteem. Students see their teacher as a mentor, someone who will sail through the year not behind them or ahead of them, but right next to them.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #4EE2EC;
border: solid 10px #4CC417; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#151B8D&quot; face=&quot;Veranda&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;Every student can learn, just not on the same day, or the same way.&quot; -George Evans'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The students need to be engaged in activities and interact with one another. To make students interact with one another, assign group projects or play learning games as a class. A quote from &quot;The University of Delaware Teacher Assistant Handbook&quot; reads, &quot;We know from research on teaching that students learn best in student-centered classrooms where they are actively involved not only with the subject matter but also with their classmates and their teachers.&quot; Therefore, it is a benefit to the students to get them to interect and socialize with other classmates. Once students become friends with other children in the classroom, they may be more eager to come to school. One way to have students interect with others is to rearrange the desks or seats every nine weeks so that they have the chance to interact with different children in the class. Adam Waxler, the author of &quot;The Reading Process&quot;, suggests another positive idea, &quot;While straight rows are conducive for lectures, students need to have an opportunity to share information with their peers and learn from one another. The room should change from rows to pairs to groups to circles and so on depending on the social interaction expected in the lesson(2004).&quot; By doing this, children will feel the urge to learn more.  

In the handbook titled, &quot;A Positive Classroom Climate&quot;, the author suggests an idea, &quot;Asking students to come to the front of the room so that they are close to each other encourages more participation than an arrangement with students scattered around the classroom.&quot; In this case, the students may feel more comfortable because they are not feeling discouraged by sitting alone. In addition, this also reduces a child's anxiety. Students tend to get very nervous when asked to write something on the board in front of the class or simply answer a question. According to Waxler, &quot;Teachers can reduce anxiety by making instructions clear, avoiding unnecessary time pressures, and providing alternate assessments for students(2004).&quot;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6E6A6B&quot; face=&quot;VERANDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In this article, the colors that I chose to use are known as cool colors. Cool colors usually have a tendency to make people feel calm and welcomed. In the article titled, &quot;The Colors of Calm&quot;, Jacci Bear says, &quot;At the other end the cool colors are comforting and nurturing. Blue, green, and the neutrals white, gray, and silver are examples of cool colors(2009).&quot; By using these colors, I wanted my readers to feel warm and welcomed, just like students should feel when they first enter a classroom at school. Although many factors weigh into creating a positive learning environment, teachers are the most important. Teachers should be the people who want to teach, who want to help children succeed, and who want to open the minds of young ones. To be a teacher is like living a dream because teachers actually get paid to stay positive.Who could ask for a better job?

A positive learning climate in a school for young children is a composite of many things.  It is an attitude that respects children.  It is a place where children receive guidance and encouragement from the responsible adults around them.  It is an environment where children can experiment and try out new ideas without fear or failure.  It is an atmosphere that builds childrenâs self-confidence so they dare to take risks.  It is an environment that nurtures a love of learning.

~Carol B. Hillman (20th Century), U.S. early childhood educator.  Creating a Learning Climate for the Early Childhood Years, Fastback Series (1989).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


---------
&lt;font color=&quot;#33FF00&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction
------
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; Having a positive learning environment is crucial and the first start to having a successful class and motivated students.&quot;Teachers who have a positive classroom are more likely to have positive students, Which means that as a teacher you will have more success&quot;, and who wouldn't want that (Carr,2008). In this article are some really great pointers on how to create a positive learning environment.

&lt;font color=&quot;#33FF00&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being a Positive Teacher
-----
[[File:Teacher.jpg|246x185px|right]]
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being a positive teacher most often comes from within. In order to make your student feel comfortable, a teacher's attitude should always remain positive. In my opinion, a good teacher should be patient, fun-loving,and have a passion for what they do. In the classroom, children look up to the teacher for guidance and responsibility. Other than their parents, the teacher is the only other adults that they grow up to respect. So in return you should always respect the students. Teachers should also serve as a model for their students. Children often imitate adult behavior so, by setting an example of the approriate behavior this will encourage the students to do the same.(Lynch,Warner 2004)For all too many students school becomes something to avoid. As the students get older they start to see school as boring, depersonalized, or all together irrelevant(Partin, 2005). It is the teachers' job to keep the student motivated, interested and enthusiastic about learning and it can all start with a positive attitude. 
Here are a few steps that can help to become a positive teacher:
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; 
*Welcome student
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; 
*Never Show Anger
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
*Treat everyday as a New Day
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
*No Question is Dumb
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
*Don't be a Punisher
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
*Call Each Student by Name
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
*Positive Feedback at all Times 
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;
*Accept Every Student No Matter What
(Carr,2008).

&lt;font color=&quot;#33FF00&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good Classroom Management
-------
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good classroom management is essential to keeping a positive environment. Without classroom management the classroom would be in chaos.The students would not be able to learn nor would the teacher be able to teach. The responsibility of classroom management lies with both the teacher and the student. By the teacher establishing responsibility and routines within the classroom, this gives the students the tools to carry routines out on their own. Having daily routines and responsibilities have an impact on how children behave and what they learn(Lynch and Warner, 2004). Routines establish a predictable and stable environment that helps the child to feel balanced and comfortable. This in return cuts down on stress and ables the child to learn. Some examples of good classroom management are having set times for: snacks, lunch, naps, cleaning up after play time and recess.Sticking to the routine that has been established in the class is key to having good classroom management. Often when a routine is disrupted children become disruptive and irritable with the situations around them and that causes them to not want to learn.

&lt;font color=&quot;#33FF00&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical Environment
-----

[[File:Poland-elementary_classroom.jpgâ|246x185px|right]]

&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The physical environment of a classroom consists of many things such as: the chalk boards, bulletin boards, posters, cubbyholes and even the people inside the class room. The teacher should make sure that the physical environment screams with positivity. When walking into a new environment it always feels better when it is made to be comforting and welcoming. This is especially important with children because transition from home to a new place is harder for children the teacher should take precautions to make sure that the child is comfortable. The physical environment should be attractive but balanced.&quot;Some children respond negatively to bright colors,especially children with special needs. If the classroom is too colorful and busy,tone down the color scheme to prevent children from being distracted be classroom brightness&quot;(Lynch and Warner, 2004).Put up inviting posters with the teacher and students name.Another thing that can contribute to a positive learning environment is to take steps to personalized the classroom.Doing small things like putting up the children's artwork and putting their names on cubby holes makes the children feel like they are important, and gives a positive outlook on learning in the class.

&lt;font color=&quot;#33FF00&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Having Fun
-----
[[File:Children marbles.jpg|246x185px|right]]

&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; Having fun can be called many things: play time, recess,P.E,or social time. Whatever it may be called, having fun within the classroom can be a major element to maintaining a positive learning environment. To the children plat time is just that a time to play, but as a teacher we know that having fun could prove to be very beneficial to both the student and the teacher. Elementary school students' bodies and minds are not made to sit down and be still for a long period of time. Children have to have some type of stopping points and or brief &quot;intermissions&quot; to keep them interested and engaged in the lesson.&quot;Many educator provide recess periods for their children because they recognize that the  benefits of  this type of play go way beyond just refreshing the children's mind&quot;(Kovar, Combs, Campbell,Napper-Owen,and Worrell 2007). Some other benefits to having fun other than just the physical part is that it keeps the children happy and focus on the lesson when they return from play time and,also while engaging in various activities they gain other skill such as sharing,communication,decision-making skills and it teacher them skills on how to develop relationships with other students.These skills gained from having fun will in turn transfer into the class and keep the class running smoothly and opens the door for more learning.

&lt;font color=&quot;#33FF00&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion
------
&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; In my opinion, being a positive teacher perhaps is the most important element in creating a positive learning environment. Children know more than we sometimes think. Just like adults, they can pick up vibes from their teacher and if the teacher is giving off negative vibes then the child will respond back negatively. I also think that giving positive feedback is another great way to establish a positive learning environment because,it make the children feel important, and also motivates them to want to learn and do good so that they can earn more positive feed back.

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;''&lt;big&gt;Teachers: Found in Genes, Books, or Both? &lt;/big&gt;''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

By Brittany Bowman


== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Students should be able to: 

1.  Understand that some people are born with certain qualities that make them better suited for the job. 

2.  Understand the benefits of proper training and experience.

3.  Understand that the teaching profession demands more than just training ensure success.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

While good teachers are essential, great teaches are invaluable.  We always remember our greatest teachers.  They are the ones that not only educated us, but the ones that motivated and pushed us to our greatest potential.  They were driven by the passion of intellectual aspiration.  They are the ones that we looked up to as role models, giving us inspiration to one day repay their dedication and teach our future students with as much passion as when they taught us.  They are the individuals we go back to visit to reaffirm how great they once were and how great they still are.  These are the teachers that we are so fortunate to have had in our lives.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;SEGOE PRINT&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;It's easy to make a buck. It's a lot tougher to make a difference.&quot;       -Tom Brokaw''' (Brokaw 2009)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

But what makes up a great teacher?  Some say it is in the genetic make-up of individuals who are born with distinct, innate qualities and characteristics that makes them better equipped for working in the classroom.  Others say that taking courses and reading through textbooks makes a teacher better suited for the job.   But who is to say that it can not be somewhere in the middle.  Taking into consideration the ideas behind both sides, maybe the answer to the question 'are teachers born or made?' is simply both?

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''It's in the Genes'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Some believe that genetics and the structured DNA sequence that makes up an individual plays a significant role in how that individual can excel within the classroom as a teacher.  A person's genetic sequence can enable them to inherit certain characteristics and qualities that enables their nurturing and teaching side to emerge.  These innate characteristics and personality traits can not necessarily be taught, and by tapping into inner talents, the full potential of the teacher can be discovered.


&quot;By nature, some people possess a combination of personality characteristics that are conducive to effective teaching&quot; (Malikow, 2006 1).  Having a caring, patient, encouraging, and joyous personality really makes a 'born' teacher stand out compared to a 'made' teacher.  These innate characteristics along with many others can not be learned or acquired from reading a textbook or by taking education courses; you either have them or you don't.  For a teacher from Framingham, Massachusetts, he had all these qualities and much more.  Everyone always remembered Charles Sposato as a natural-born teacher, he went above and beyond expectations.  Mr. Sposato was known to be full of spirit and have high amounts of energy that he brought in the classroom to ensure that his students would always be surrounded by a positive environment (Spitz 2007).  He even helped a student's family buy needed clothing when money was scarce (Spitz 2007).  All the little things really do add up.  Based on Mr. Sposato's actions, he was more than a teacher to his students, and he didn't learn that by reading through any textbook.  
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #33FF99;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;SEGOE PRINT&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;Teaching is the only major occupation of man for which we have not yet developed tools that make an average person capable of competence and performance.  In teaching we rely on the &quot;naturals,&quot; the ones who somehow know how to teach.&quot;            -Peter Drucker'''  &lt;li&gt;(Drucker 2007)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Along with many other professions, teaching is primarily based on leadership and communication (Vilhanova 2008).  Teachers must have the ability to lead and guide their classroom in a way that promotes controlled and free thinking.  It is very important for teachers to be able to communicate effectively, not only to the students but to the parents as well.  Communicating to the students is so important to the learning process.  If a teacher can not get his/her point across, then it is very possible for the students to not understand the lesson being taught.  Communication must be present among, both the teacher and the student.  This is where the student can begin to gain trust from the teacher, and vice versa, where the teacher can gain trust from the student (Vilhanova 2008).  Gaining each other's trust is very valuable because they are able to rely on each other.

All these aspects and characteristics can only be obtained if it is present in the individuals genes.  They can not be taught or learned and that is why, those who possess these innate traits must use them productively or else they would just go to waste.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''It's in the Books'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

To some individuals, an excellent education and a comprehensive training creates the best foundation in the classroom setting and that natural talent helps but it can't provide for the necessities that makes up an adequate and positive teaching environment.  Being good or great at something does not always mean that there will always be passion.  People who may not possess a natural talent for teaching, but are determined to still become a teacher,  may have more passion that those born with the gift.  These individuals would have to work harder for their reward, which shows how driven and committed they truly are.


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #33FF99;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;SEGOE PRINT&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;...even the most brilliant scientists may not know how to communicate their knowledge to children.&quot;    -Jay Mathews'''  (Mathews 2002) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  The main point for teacher education and training programs is to inform teachers about effective instruction methods that can be very beneficial to improve and make the overall classroom experiences more desirable and more successful (Malikow, 2006 2).  Once the teacher training and education is completed, the teachers become higher quality because it allowed teachers to gain more practice and experience.  In essence, teachers really do 'make themselves' (Moore, 2004 6).  


Teachers' work reflects on the students' work.   Studies have shown that teachers, with no means of education training or certification, have a negative influence on students in the classroom.  Teachers without this proper training, have a higher percentage of students in their class that scored lower on standardized tests (Mathews 2002).  Other studies have revealed that the individuals who received a five-year degree from a teacher education program, tend to stay teaching longer that those who graduated with a four-year degree; also, the individuals with four-year degrees stay teaching longer than those with little or no training at all (Mathews 2002).


According to Education Secretary, Roderick P. Paige, and his teacher quality report, he states that &quot;we now have concrete evidence that smart teachers with solid content knowledge have the greatest effect on student achievement&quot; (Mathews 2002).  Well isn't that exactly what teachers strive to accomplish? They want their students to be able to reach their greatest or maximum potential and to get the most out of their education.  There is an old saying that parents want what is best for their children.  Can't teachers want what is best for their students?  The answer is of course, and by spending more time taking extra classes or going through additional educational training, this really underlines how the average teacher can be 'made' into a great teacher.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''It's Both'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

To the others who fall in the middle, including myself, we believe that great teachers are a combination between the two.  Having the qualities, characteristics, and drive in becoming a good teacher is one thing, but taking classes to better educate yourself on how to better your students really takes it over the edge into becoming a great teacher.  Who is to say that teachers who seem to be born with this raw, natural talent, couldn't benefit from some type of educational training to reemphasize their strengths and build on their weaknesses.


Teachers are a lot like athletes and artists.  All three were born with talents, and those talents will be refined because of the training and performance that comes along with each career (Malikow 1).  Even the people that were born with all the traits that would make them an excellent teaching candidate, they still might be missing something.  If they do not have the desire, drive, or passion to become a teacher, then these innate traits can be thrown out the window.  Proper training and experience will help give advise on different techniques and methods that can be utilized.  After teaching for quit some time, the teacher will be able to throw out the methods and techniques that did not work or fix the methods to better suit or accommodate the students. Practice makes perfect!

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;by Cecilee Landefeld&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== ''' Introduction ''' ==

It is a question that is almost as old as the hills. Are teachers born to teach in front of a room of eager students, with a naturally patient and friendly personality that makes them successful, or are teachers made through all their education classes, molded through their classroom observations and classroom management courses? Better yet, is it a little bit of both situations that helps to create a successful teacher? From some research, it would seem that most agree that teachers are made, that to believe teachers are born is to believe an outdated myth meant to scare away potential teachers.  However, other people believe that yes, teachers are born with a certain personality that makes them amenable to teaching, but that also they are refined through their education classes.  No one is born with all the classroom management techniques needed for a successful classroom, they say. At the opposite end of the spectrum are those that believe that it is merely a matter of education that creates a successful teacher. Let us take a look at these different views, and see where you might stand on this age-old issue.

== ''' âEither You Got It Or You Donâtâ: Teachers are born''' == 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Teacher.jpg|250px]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Those who are said to have the gift of teaching, more often than not, do not really know that they have that special gift. Yet when they are in a teaching situation, anything from volunteering to teach crafts at a local scout camp to even just showing a family member how to fix a computer for example, something happens inside of them. These kinds of people instinctively know what to do and how to manage the classroom. They have a natural, patient rapport with the students, and they know how to help the students learn what they need to know. 

The perfect example of such a teacher was reported in the San Diego-Union Tribune in an article titled &lt;i&gt;Construction teacher builds on his success&lt;/i&gt;. Ozzie Roberts, a regular writer for this newspaper, reports on a man named Glenn Hillegas, a former high school shop teacher at Scripps Ranch High School who is now director of Construction Tech Academy at Kearny High School in San Diego County. 

When Hillegas was in his early teens, his mother and aunt taught students with emotional disturbances in Riverside, California. He himself had gone through some family issues, what with an alcoholic father and divorce, and he had just moved to the San Diego area with his mother. At the age of 13, Hillegas walked into their classrooms one day, and he knew immediately what he could do to help them, and how to do it.

&lt;ul&gt;âHe mentored the kids; got right down with them and helped them see beyond their challenges. And when he, in turn, saw them respond to his counsel, he promptly told himself that he would be a teacher for the rest of his lifeâ (Roberts, 2003).&lt;/ul&gt;

From that day on, Hillegas became a very successful teacher. In the 1980s, he first taught in the San Diego area at various schools for students with emotional challenges. Later on, as a shop teacher, he became renowned for a one-on-one teaching method to help his students learn. In 1998 he was even named one of four San Diego County Teachers of the Year (Roberts 2003).

For him, it was all purely instinct, and he knew how to help students based on his own experiences in an abusive home. âGive kids understanding and the proper environment, Hillegas says, and they soar. And it is the great teachers who just seem to know that instinctivelyâ (Roberts 2003).

== ''' It takes a village to teach a teacher: Teachers are made ''' ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #C48189;

&lt;center&gt;âGreatness is often overlooked because the performer makes the exhibition look so easy that one mistakenly thinks, &quot;Anyone can do that!&quot; This seems especially true for the teaching professionâ (Prusak and Vincent 2005).&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Of all the professions in the world, perhaps no other profession looks as easy as teaching does. It looks easy to get up in front of a classroom and teach the students what they need to know, all while holding their attention. However, as with any public profession, there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes to make it look that easy. It is like the pianist who practices for hours on end before the big competition, able to run their fingers up and down the keys in time to difficult sonatas and concertos that may seem unfathomable to the average listener. The pianist makes it look so easy, like anyone can do that without even blinking an eye. Of course, a lot of training goes into making it look so effortless; so it is with teaching. A lot of teaching has to do with knowing the right strategy to use at the right time, and of course that certainly does not happen naturally. 

Those who are advocates for the âteachers are madeâ side believe that if teachers were really born to be in their job, then why even have education programs? As Prusak and Vincent wrote in the Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance:

&lt;ul&gt;&quot;If teachers are simply born to teach, why then do we have teacher education programs? Would we not be as well served to line up 1,000 hopeful teachers and watch them teach? Those who were able to demonstrate that they were indeed born with the gift would be given jobs, and the rest would be encouraged to look elsewhere&quot; (Prusak and Vincent 2005).&lt;/ul&gt;

Instead, the consensus seems to be that the skills required to become a great teacher are learned from practice and years of hard work. Even if you are not a natural teacher, you can acquire the necessary skills to become an effective instructor; it might take you longer, but it can be done (Svinicki 1995). Sam Dietz even adds in the TCU Magazine article Myths Behind the Blackboard, that great teachers have worked for years to acquire their skills, and that it comes naturally for very few people:

âTeachers need to learn to suppress criticism, harsh tones, and other forms of punishment. They need to stress what is positive to help a child learn how to behave well. In academics as well as in skills of character, common sense alone cannot prepare a teacher to accomplish these difficult tasksâ (Dietz, 2007).

However, it can also come down to the 'good' vs 'great' teacher. Good teachers can be born, great teachers are made. Richard M. Reis, a professor at Stanford University shares this view. In his article, &quot;What Makes a Good Teacher&quot; he discusses that many teachers arriving in classrooms shortly after graduation are very well prepared, received, and liked. A select few of these people are born with a desire to teach therefore they are good at it. After years of experience in the field, Mr. Ries believes he too started out as a good teacher but would like to believe that he, along with his colleagues, are now great teachers. It takes experience to become a great teacher. There are methods, values, and tools that only an experienced teacher will know. This seems to be a significant point in the born or made teacher debate. You can start out as a good teacher and become a great one.

No one is born with all the classroom management techniques that they need to know, and that is a process that can sometimes take years to master (Dietz 2007).&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Why does everything have to be black and white, when the gray area is so much better? If you are not born with the patience to teach, can you still teach? If you have taken all the education classes in the world, and you still hate being in the classroom, can you be a successful teacher? That lovely gray area between sheer talent and intestinal fortitude has to be reserved for the majority of teachers, who may or may not have the original talent, but who have had enough education and experience to be a truly successful teacher.

For most people, teaching is not necessarily something that you are either âbornâ to do or simply âmadeâ to be. Some say that individuals might have the personality traits and the right mindset to become a teacher, but also that education programs offer a lot of valuable information to upcoming teachers that just does not come naturally (Malikow, 2005-2006). No one is born with all the classroom management techniques that they need to know, and that is a process that can sometimes take years to master (Dietz 2007).

In Marilla Svinicki's essay ''The Seven Deadly Comments That Get In The Way of Learning About Teaching'', Svinicki talks about this eternal question of âare teachers born or made.â 

&lt;ul&gt;â..if only âbornâ teachers were allowed in the classroom, there would be a severe shortage of instructors especially in higher education, where very few actually identify themselves as teachers in the first placeâ (Svinicki 1995).&lt;/ul&gt;

Instead, every teacher, in his or own way, combines their own natural talents with what they have learned along the way in education courses to make their classrooms successful. In fact, some say that it is almost pointless to even try to figure out where one ends and the other begins; each one contributes to the other (Burgoyne and Timpson 2002). Over the years, the teacher improves through his or her own feelings on how to become even better teachers, and some even actively seek feedback from their students and peers on how well they are doing. 

== ''' Conclusion ''' ==

Even now in this day and age, when humans seem to have figured out many things that were mysteries for centuries, there is really no clear answer for whether teachers are born, made, or a little bit of both. Some still believe you have to be born into it, others believe teachers are made through their education and experiences, and others are in the middle. Since teaching is truly a personal relationship between the student and the teacher, the success or failure of a teacher cannot be measured by how much education or talent the teacher has, but by the end results: the success of the students. Whatever your opinion might be on this issue, it will definitely be discussed for more years to come, and who knows if a consensus will ever be found.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#FF6666&quot;&gt; '''Introduction''' &lt;/font color&gt; ==

'''Mrs. Smith escorts the students, in her kindergarten classroom, outside to the playground.   She asks her students to take off their shoes; she wanted them to feel the grass between their toes, to walk on the rocks and cement, and all the things that had different textures. They spent a little time while outside, just taking in the air and observing things around them. Then she asked them to put their shoes back on and follow her in a line back into the building.  On the way back into the school, Mrs. Smith asked her students questions like, “What do you see as we walk down the hall?” “What does it smell like?” “Do you hear anything?” When all of the students returned to their desks, their teacher continued asking questions for the students to brainstorm.  She asked them “What color was the fence?” “Did they see any people?” Then she asked her students “what parts of your bodies did you use to get all of this information?”'''


'''Across the hall, another kindergarten teacher starts her class; she takes out a folder full of worksheets and distributes them around the classroom; on each worksheet are five square boxes, and in each square is a picture.   One picture was a hand, representing touch; a nose was in another box, representing smell.   The students study each box, trying to better understand what their teacher was going to teach them today.   The teacher takes out some markers and begins to write and draw on the board; she explains to her students what each of the five senses is, and she has them write the words in the correct boxes as she writes them on the board.   She explains in detail everything she can possibly think of that her students would need to know about the five senses, including what body parts each sense works with, what smells and tastes one may discover, and even ways some people do not have all of their senses.   The teacher talks and explains as her students listen, draw and write the things she puts on the board.''' 



'''Both of these teachers have taught their students the same information today, however, they each used a different method of teaching to do so.  Teacher one, who took her students on a field trip, was performing discovery learning through exploration; whereas, the teacher across the hall was implementing direct instruction.'''

==&lt;font color=&quot;#99CC33&quot;&gt; '''What is Direct Instruction?'''&lt;/font color&gt;==

'''Direct Instruction can also be referred to as explicit teaching; it occurs when educators teach using lectures, presentations and text books to demonstrate a lesson to their students.  This type of teaching is the most common way of instruction, and includes direction by the teacher.  To teach by direct instruction, you must know what you want your outcome to be; teachers must have a purpose and a specific reason for teaching the subject in order for it to be structured and well planned out (Saskatoon).'''

==&lt;font color=&quot;#FF6666&quot;&gt; '''What is Discovery Learning?'''&lt;/font color&gt;==
'''“Discovery learning is a type of learning where learners construct their own knowledge by experimenting with a domain, and inferring rules from the results of these experiments (Joolingen, 1999, p.385).” In other words, this means that students actively learn through hands-on and interactive experiences.  In a discovery learning atmosphere, students are free to work with little or no guidance in order to discover information (Mayer, 2004).  Discovery learning focuses on the beliefs of Jean Piaget, in which students should be able to choose how they are going to learn, discover new information, and do so without correction from an educator (Mayer, 2004; Piaget,1970).  Of course, teachers would still be present in a discovery learning situation; they would monitor each student and ensure things ran smoothly.'''

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6666&quot; face=&quot;COMIC SANS MS&quot;&gt;''“Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely.&quot;''&lt;/br&gt;(Piaget, 1970, p.715)&lt;/font color&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;font color=&quot;#99CC33&quot;&gt; '''Educator's Preference'''&lt;/font color&gt;==
'''Most educators in mathematics and science typically instruct using discovery learning, as opposed to direct instruction, because they believe it is the best way to achieve an understanding of the subject that will stick with the student, because students learn best by doing (Klahr, 2004). “Over the years, however, some researchers and educators have challenged the argument for hands-on learning. They maintain that a more straightforward approach—known as direct instruction—has the potential to help students learn science more effectively&quot; (Cavanagh, 2004, p.12). Some educators also believe that using discovery education for younger children works better than direct learning, because it enables the young learners to be engaged and not bored with the subjects they are learning (Klahr, 2004).'''

==&lt;font color=&quot;#FF6666&quot;&gt; '''What Statistics Show'''&lt;/font color&gt;==
'''A study was conducted by the Department of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, in which it was discovered that “many more children learn from direct instruction than from discovery learning&quot; (Klahr, 2004, p.661). This study was conducted on 112 third and fourth grade students and it measured their ability to acquire and retain new information. Based on this information, it is obvious that discovery learning requires some past knowledge of the subject being “discovered” in order to obtain new information. Based on a “half-century of advocacy associated with instruction using minimal guidance” or discovery learning, there has never really been any scientific evidence that proves discovery learning works better than direct instruction (Kirschner, 2006, p.83).'''

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''Personally, I think the ideal classroom would be one that incorporated both direct instruction and discovery learning.  I think novice information could be taught using direct instruction and then supplemented by discovery learning.  For example, students could be taught the basics by their teacher and then allowed to work independently to discover more about that topic.  I don’t foresee a classroom being able to run smoothly when their focus is solely on discovery education, because, in my opinion, at some point direct instruction would have to occur. I believe that educators should make it a priority to incorporate activities into their classroom that allows for students to discover and explore; technology is so readily available, yet so infrequently used for classrooms; something as simple as a WebQuest could allow direct instruction and discovery learning to intermingle as one teaching method.'''

Our comprehension of our vast universe grows each day.  With every new discovery and information gathered from researchers across the globe, we continue to come closer and closer to our understanding of the universe we live in.  Not long ago, we believed that the world was flat; however, today we have access to real time pictures taken from satellites orbiting our world to prove its true form.  What we teach our children today may be far advanced from what we learned as children ourselves.  New discoveries may lead to future generations treating the knowledge of today as obsolete and outdated.  

Perhaps equally as important to what we teach our students is also how we teach them to learn the material.  As we grow in our understanding of how the human brain operates, we must also use this understanding to help us learn more efficiently.  One of the more widely accepted methods of learning that is being applied in today's classroom is that of cooperative learning.  This method differs in many ways to that of traditional lecture methods of learning.  In this article, we will explore the many ways to effectively apply cooperative learning, the advantages, and the possible challenges of this method.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;What Is Cooperative Learning?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

 [[Image:Funny_Kids1.jpg|150px|left]]

The traditional classroom often consists of classes in which children of similar ability levels are taught together.  Nearly all classrooms in the United States are taught by grade level specific to the age of the student rather than his or her ability.  Many schools also group students according to their apparent ability levels, but this risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for each respective group.  By placing students into group in this way, we run the risk of those placed in low-level learning groups perceiving themselves as unintelligent or slow-witted. Grouping students together with varying levels of ability and backgrounds can help eliminate this threat.  A very popular method of learning in this way is called cooperative learning.  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;27%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC99FF;
border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt; 
'''Cooperative learning''' is the collaboration on a task by a small group of students who resolve differences of opinion, share responsibility, consider one another's ideas, and work toward common goals. (Berk, 2008)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''Cooperative learning''' is defined as &quot;the collaboration on a task by a small group of students who resolve differences of opinion, share responsibility, consider one another's ideas, and work toward common goals.&quot; (Berk, 2008) Unlike traditional methods, cooperative learning lets students enhance the weaknesses of their peers with their own strengths.  Students feel a part of a team rather than isolated and students deemed as having low-ability can benefit from those considered higher.  In a symbiotic relation, higher level students also tend to do better by teaching the learned material to their peers.

According to Robert E. Slavin of Johns Hopkins University, there are four major perspectives on cooperative learning, which are motivational, social cohesion, cognitive development, and cognitive elaboration (Slavin, 1995).  The '''motivational perspective''' focuses on the reward for the group in achieving their objective, and that the only way for the group to achieve this goal is to learn how to work together.  The theory that students want each other to succeed is more in keeping with the '''social cohesion perspective''', but is similar to the motivational perspective in that the members of the group are motivated to succeed, but instead of goal oriented, it is more motivated by compassion.  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;35%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC99FF;
border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Four major perspectives on cooperative learning:'''
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;u&gt;motivational&lt;/u&gt; - group focused on common goal   
 
&lt;u&gt;social cohesion&lt;/u&gt; - group wants each other to succeed   
 
&lt;u&gt;cognitive development&lt;/u&gt; - the human brain simply learns
better in a group environment    

&lt;u&gt;cognitive elaboration&lt;/u&gt; - the best way to 

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The '''cognitive development''' perspective takes a very different approach to cooperative learning in that it contends that the interaction of students with their peers stimulates the mind and increases the ability to learn.  Unlike being motivated by a common goal or by compassion for their peers, those who follow the cognitive development perspective feel that the human brain simply learns better in a group environment than on its own.  

A variation of this is the fourth theory of '''cognitive elaboration''', which contends that the best way to enhance the knowledge already present in the brain is to in turn explain it to ones peers.  This slightly differs from cognitive development perspective in that the members of the group must already have some knowledge of the material before entering the group.


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;What are some Cooperative Learning examples?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

For almost a quarter of a century, Dr. Spenser Kagan has been developing teaching structures of learning based on cooperative learning, called Kagan Structures, to help in the classroom as well the business world.  (Kagan, 2008)  

[[image:Scotty_n_CeCe1.jpg|right|150px]]

One of Kagan's most widely used method of cooperative learning is that of '''RoundRobin''', purposely spelled as one word to differentiate the term from the standard definition of round robins, a type of athletic tourneyment.  In a RoundRobin group, each learner takes a turn orally presenting the material that they have learned, helping them to better organize their thoughts on the material.  Kagan says that labeling methods of cooperative learning like RoundRobin are beneficial to the student because &quot;students know exactly what to do&quot; when instructed to use a specified method.  According to Kagan, this is also helpful to instructors in that it helps facilitate communication among peers in learning from each other how to teach.  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;35%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC99FF;
border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Examples of Cooperative Learning:'''
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;u&gt;RoundRobin (Kagan)&lt;/u&gt; - the group takes turns orally presenting the material.   
 
&lt;u&gt;Jigsaw (Aronson)&lt;/u&gt; - learners are split up into groups, assigned portions of 
the material to learn, meet with learners from other groups assigned the same
portion, and then return to their groups to teach the material they have learned.

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Another method that is fast becoming a popular form of cooperative classroom learning is that of the '''Jigsaw''' method.  Elliot Aronson, Professor Emeritus at the University of California in Santa Cruz, first implemented his Jigsaw method in 1971 initially as a way to deal with the sudden desegregation of schools in Austin, Texas.  By placing students into groups with various social and ethnic differences each with the same goal to succeed, the hostility became muted as the students were forced to work together to achieve success.  

The Jigsaw method gets its name because each student is a vital piece of the overall puzzle that is the learning task.  Students are first divided into groups and assigned various portions of the material to become an expert on. Then, each student meets with students from other group assigned to the same portion of the material and discuss what they have learned.  This allows for the student to share what he or she learned on their own while also hearing other students perspectives.  Eventually, these students return to their original groups and in turn teaches the members of their group the material that they learned.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Advantages and Possible Challenges of Cooperative Learning&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

As mentioned earlier, there are many advantages to cooperative learning supported by empirical evidence.  Students who participate in cooperative learning programs have outperformed students in traditional learning programs at the elementary, secondary, and collage levels, as cited in Boling and Robinson's article on how cooperative learning is used in lecture-based distance learning. According to the journal article, students have been shown to increase social skills, perceptions of their own ability, and the relevance of the material they are learning (Boling 1999).  

Although cooperative learning can be highly effective, there are also some possible challenges in this style.  One of the major criticisms of cooperative learning is that it tends to hold back the learning potential of those students who are naturally gifted.  Oftentimes, students who are prone to social anxiety and prefer to work alone may suffer a negative effect of cooperative learning.  Instructors must understand that cooperative learning is not for everyone and must compliment or supplement some material to students who thrive in a less socially active environment. 

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Conclusion&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

In conclusion, cooperative learning is a very different style of learning than how traditional school systems have taught student.  There are a number of theories behind why this method tends to be effective; however, there are still a number of unknown variables out there that make cooperative learning hardly the absolute best way to present material.  Still, learning methods like Kagan's RoundRobin and Aronson's Jigsaw techniques have proven to be very helpful and have empirical evidence that supports the increase in participants learning ability.

'''(Engaging the Student in Learning)'''

By Carol Halligan&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


=='''Introduction'''==

Confucius said âI hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.â 

To add more insight to Confucius' wisdom, Lynn Schultz, Old Dominion University Educational Instructor writes, &quot;We learn...(taken from an old proverb) 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, 30% of what we see, 50% of what we both see and hear, 70% of what we discuss with others, 80% of what we experience personally, and 95% of what we teach to someone else&quot; (Schultz, n.d.).  
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #C9BE62;
border: solid 1px #FF0000; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;[[Image:Konfuzius.jpg|137px]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
How did you learn in school?  If your learning experience was like mine, the teacher lectured and I took notes.  I didnât look at or study my notes until the night before my test.  My goal was to memorize, not learn.  What could have been done differently to make my learning experience more effective?  Confucius said âI hear and I forget.  I see and I remember.  I do and I understandâ (Stalheim-Smith, 1998, p.3).  Emphasizing &quot;I do and I understand,&quot; educational research writers Chickering and Gamson write, &quot;Learning is not a spectator sport. Students do not learn much just by sitting in classes listening to teachers, memorizing pre-packaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences and apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves&quot; (Chickering &amp; Gameson, 1987, paragraph 14).

 
What Chickering and Gamson are referring to is âactive learning.â  Active learning means âhands onâ working on things, and âminds onâ reflecting upon the work which engages the student in learning.


As future teachers, we owe it to our students to go beyond traditional methods of teaching which is lecturing and taking notes to more active learning methods that help students become involved in their own education.

=='''Active Learning Strategies'''==


In this article, we are going to look at the benefits of moving teachers away from lecturing which is âteacher-centered instructionâ to facilitating or coaching which is âstudent-centered learningâ (All, n.d., table).  Below are six strategies to aid in this process.


==='''Short Lecture, Class Exercise, and Review'''===


In traditional learning, teachers often lecture for long periods of time and students take notes.  Research has shown that students will learn more when lectures are broken down into small segments, followed by a class exercise.  Class exercises help you as the teacher to know if the student understands what you have just taught them, and also fosters questions.  Following the class exercise, provide a summary of what was learned (Calegari &amp; Moulthrop, n.d.).  For example, if the subject you are teaching is math, provide math problems to test the studentâs understanding.  If the subject is history or literature, have the students write what they learned from your discussion (University, 2001).  After the students have completed the class exercise, review their answers as a group to ensure their understanding of the lesson, followed by a summation of what they learned highlighting important ideas and concepts.  This strategy of a short lecture, class exercise, and review is a more active way of learning than the traditional method of long lecturers and note taking.


==='''Peer Teaching'''===


To make learning even more active, research indicates peer teaching (students teaching students) is a very effective way to learn.  Lynn Schultz, Old Dominion University Educational Instructor writes, &quot;We learn...(taken from an old proverb)...95% of what we teach to someone else&quot; (Schultz, n.d.).  From my own teaching experience, I think that this statement is very true.  It is human nature to want to be prepared when speaking in front of a group of people.  You create a lesson plan that you feel comfortable with, and become an expert in the process.  You dive into the content of the material preparing for any type of question that may come your way.  Peer teaching not only teaches content material, but communication skills as well.  Peer teaching doesnât have to be teaching to an entire class, but can be applied to small groups, or groups that include only two students (University, 2001).   Publications written at the Center for Teaching and Learning indicate âStudents are more willing to share their views in small groups and often develop deeper insights about the material than they would be working aloneâ (University, 2001, paragraph 3).  Peer teaching can be applied in many content areas.  It can be used to teach a complex problem, or as simple as teaching studentâs spelling words, vocabulary, or math facts allowing each student to be the teacher as well as the student.  


==='''Cooperative Learning Groups, and Debate Teams'''===


Another active learning strategy is Cooperative Learning.  Cooperative Learning means grouping students together to learn from one another to achieve an educational goal.  Success which is reaching the educational goal is based on how well the members work together and help each other.  Failure from one of the members will have a negative impact on the group's success (Chapter, 2004).  A good example of Cooperative Learning is this Wikibooks project we are working on.  Each student explores a topic that falls under the umbrella of Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment.  The students are active in researching their topic, reflecting upon it, and writing about what they have learned.  After the articles are written, peers review articles providing information on ways to improve an articleâs content.  After reviewing articles, the class as a whole will study all topics researched by the group.  The entire Wikibooks project is a cooperative effort that engages the student in learning.


In addition to Cooperative Learning groups, another effective way to learn is to group students into teams that take different positions on a topic and debate them.  Again this style of learning is cooperative and engaging as members of a group explore a topic to debate.  In addition, there is an element of stress involved in a debate competition that can only put some pressure on the group to fully understand what they are debating.

==='''Role Playing, Case Studies, and Simulations'''===
To add real life experiences to a student's learning, role playing, case studies, and simulations are effective strategies to use.  For example, role playing allows the student to put themselves in the shoes of another person, teaching them empathy and understanding of peopleâs differences or situations.  Role playing can also be used to teach a process where the student goes through steps to learn a concept (Active, 1993).  


Case studies also deal with real life.  They are based on research of real life problems.  Case studies examine a problem and leave out âanalysisâ and âconclusionsâ forcing the student to be the âdecision makerâ using his or her âanalytical and problem solving skillsâ to come up with a solution to the problem (Active, 1993, page 2).  


Simulations are another way to imitate real life.  They are very similar to case studies where they put the student in the decision maker role.  The student learns to problem solve using a simplified version of the real world problems.  These simulations are a great way to bridge in-class examples with real life (Florida, 2008).  There are many software applications on the web today that can be downloaded to educate the student in real life events.  In addition, you can take these simulation examples and apply it to role playing, or case study activities.  


==='''Games'''===


Games, another active learning strategy, are always a fun way to engage a student in learning.  You can find many game ideas on the web to incorporate in your curriculum.  For example, play the baseball game by splitting the class into two teams.  Ask batters a question, and if he or she gets the answer right advance a base, but if answered wrong itâs an out.  Play the game as if you are playing baseball and have students mark outs and runs on the chalkboard (Harrison, n.d.).  Another fun game is classroom Jeopardy which is a lot like the television version of Jeopardy.  This a good review game where the teacher provides the answer to a question and the student must write down the question.  For example, if the teacher was reviewing multiplication math facts, the techer might say 27 and students who wrote 3X9 would win points.  The student with the most points at the end of the game would win a prize like being the first student in the lunch line or the first student out at the playground for recess (Whiteboard, 2002).  


==='''Journals and Portfolios''' ===


Other active learning strategies include journals and portfolios.  Journals and portfolios aid the student in tracking their learning progress (Florida, 2008).  Journals and portfolios can be a compilation of the studentâs work over time, perhaps in nine-week increments, or for the entire school year.  It is a great way for tracking what a student came to the class knowing, how they progressed in their learning, and a reflection on what they have learned. 



=='''Traditional Learning versus Active Learning'''==


Based on research it appears that applying active learning methods can really engage a student in learning so that more knowledge is retained and understood.  But, one major concern of active learning is that it may be too time intensive and because of this, SOL requirements that test a vast amount of knowledge might not be met.  Is it possible to implement active learning strategies and cover all necessary SOL material?  I suppose the best way to answer this question, is to look at research.  At Newsome Park Elementary School in Newport News Virginia, the school changed from a traditional learning program to an active learning program and their SOL test scores rose.  Based on the schools statistics, â...between 1997 and 2000, the percentage of fifth graders passing the Virginia Standards of Learning test increased from 35 percent to 65 percent in math, 52 percent to 79 percent in science, and 53 percent to 65 percent in Englishâ after active learning practices were implemented (Curtis, 2001, paragraph 15).  To view a multimedia video on the active learning successes that took place at Newsome Park Elementary School go to http://www.edutopia.org/more-fun-barrel-worms. 


Another concern of active learning is that it appears ideal only in small classrooms of fewer than 20 students, but when you get into teaching larger classes of greater than 20 students it  may be impractical to use active learning strategies.  There may be too much noise and confusion in large classes using active learning strategies.  The traditional method of teaching would provide order.  According to educators from North Carolina State University, they disagree and feel &quot;the larger the class, the more essential it is to use active learning&quot; (Felder &amp; Brent, 1999, paragraph 9).  They suggest that large classes be divided into small groups of 2 or 3 students.  After a specific amount time has lapsed, stop the group's activity, and direct a question to one member of the group.  Asking questions directed to one of the group's members will ensure everyone is on their toes, because any member can be asked at random to answer a question for the team (Felder &amp; Brent, 1999).

=='''Conclusion'''==


Active learning is a change from the traditional education method of lecturing, taking notes, and testing.  It enables the student to become an active participant in their learning process which makes a studentâs quest for knowledge a more enlightening experience. As Confucius said, âI do and I understand.â

== '''&lt;u&gt;Positive Reinforcement or Harsh Punishment? by Mary Parker&lt;/u&gt;''' ==
== Introduction ==

How should teachers, parents, and babysitters deal with children? Should they work as a team or should adults be on an entirely different level than their students?  All children respond to authority in a unique way. Naturally, kids like to push their limits, test their boundaries, and see what they can and can not get away with. Discipline can be separated into two different categories: positive discipline or negative discipline. I have had a lot of experience working in classroom settings, not only as a student, but also as a volunteer, camp counselor, and as a teaching assistant. I have been exposed to many different personalities of teachers such as calm, stressed, easy-going, aggressive, and even frustrated teachers. Throughout my education, I was mainly taught using negative means of discipline. It is easy to recall students who, no matter how many times they had been sent to the principal's office, never seemed to correct their behavior. Could there be a better relationship between the adult and child that could have led to fewer trips to the office and better performance in the classroom? I am an avid believer in positive discipline because I have seen a classroom where it has been successful. Yet, I have also been exposed to classrooms where students get their work done because the teacher is strict and did not tolerate misbehavior. What is the solution? Should children constantly be praised for their good behavior or reprimanded when they act out? Are teachers required to punish in order to maintain respect as an authority figure. It is important to understand:

1. What positive discipline is, and how it compares to negative discipline. 

2. How to apply positive reinforcement in the classroom.

3. Understand how Positive Reinforcement can work.

----

== What is Positive Discipline? ==
Jane Nelson, who according to Alice Yand a publication manager for the Northeartern Foundation for Children, has written a very inspirational book on Positive Discipline and illustrates to her readers how to implicate it in and out of the classroom. Nelson states that, &quot;Positive Discipline is based on the understanding that discipline must be taught and that discipline teaches&quot; (Positive  Discipline Associates). There are several different components that combine to define positive discipline. A few of these factors include: mutual respect between teacher and student, understanding the drive behind bad behavior, efficient correspondence, discipline that allows learning, focusing on improvement rather than reprimand, and encouragement (Positive Discipline Associates). Along with these aspects of guidance through positive reinforcement, consistency is also crucial in this method of teaching. When teachers use this type of reinforcement, children are acknowledged for the things they are doing right, rather than receiving attention for what they have done wrong. 

----

== What is Negative Discipline? ==
According to Dictionary.com, Negative Discipline can be described as punishment that denounces a child's behavior. Often, reprimands are given to the kids that act up and the child is punished in front of the class. Children crave attention, whether it is positive or negative, and will take extreme measures to be noticed by the adults in their lives. When a child is corrected in front of the other children, sent to the office, or even yelled at, they are receiving attention that they crave. Should students try and lash out to obtain negative attention from their teachers? The Institution of Educational Statistics states that some people believe that being stern is the way to get children to be corporative and respect authority. Also, it is understood that if there is a strong sense of power in the classroom, students will not test their limits. If children gain the understanding that they will not be chastised for their bad behavior, they may not comply with the rules. Negative Discipline has been in classrooms for decades, children have been exposed to referrals, suspension, time-out, and even spanking. There have been many schools that base their education on negative discipline and the results have been successful. Why is there a need to change now?

== How to Apply Positive Discipline In the Classroom==

'''Positive Discipline Phrases:'''

&quot;Do the right thing.&quot;

&quot;Gentle Hands.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry he knocked you down.&quot;

&quot;Do you think that was a good choice?&quot;

&quot;Thank you for doing the right thing.&quot; 
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

There is a new method of teaching called Positive Discipline. What components are involved in this new teaching method? S. Doescher and L. Burt of Oregon University, explain that there are many ways to incorporate positive reinforcement into the teaching curriculum. Some ways to apply this method of partnership include:

1. Making positive comments. When students do something desirable, instead of ignoring it. It is crucial for the instructor to address the good behavior. If children realize that others are being praised for their behavior, they may also try to receive encouraging feedback from his or her teacher.

2. Ask for children's input. Everyones opinion matters and even adults tend to pay attention to topics that they are interested in. When teachers inquire students' opinion, they are more likely to be entertained and participate. 

3. Body language is essential. Even young people can sense approval through accepting gestures such as eye contact and smiling. 

4. Getting on their level. Positive Discipline is defined as a partnership, therefore; children should feel as though they are an important part of the relationship. Some teachers feel as though, &quot;bending, kneeling, or sitting at a children's level&quot; (Doescher and Burt), makes a child feel involved and important.

5. Encourage children to redirect their negative behavior to a positive one. Children learn new things everyday, if students are made aware of positive behaviors they are more likely to want to try new things. An example of redirected a child's attention could be if he or she is trying to take someone else's toy, an instructor can present the idea of a different toy to play with. 

6. Ignore actions that are not desirable. When children are performing inappropriate manners, adults should act like they do not see them behaving bad, therefore; they may loose interest in the behavior and do something positive to gain the teacher's attention.

7. Consistency is essential. If a teacher chooses to use Positive Discipline in his or her classroom, they must not change. Children crave structure and fluctuating between methods of discipline will only lead to confusion and frustration, two unhealthy attitudes to have in a classroom.

== A Success Story and Conclusion==

Katharine Kersey, a professor of Early Childhood Education at Old Dominion University, wrote a book dealing with the idea of Positive Discipline. It is titled ''The 101s: A Guide to Positive Discipline.'' In this book, Kersey addresses how to present children with a vigorous classroom experience by highlighting positive behaviors rather than negative. I have experienced many classroom environments as both a student and as an adult. Not only have I been in classrooms where Negative Discipline was the teaching approach being used, but also I have worked in Old Dominion's Early Childhood Development Center and the Old Dominion Day Care. Both centers are avid believers in the use of Positive Discipline. After viewing it first hand, it is obvious that some education institutes can succeed using Positive Reinforcement. 

No matter what teaching method is going to be used in a classroom, the instructor must remain consistent and understanding. It is important to understand kids and how to deal with them appropriately. People have different opinions on what works and what does not work for them. Through personal experience, I have seen success stories on both sides of the spectrum. Finally, it all comes down to the idea that although Positive Discipline is a somewhat new teaching tactic, it can work. Whether or not one discipline method is better than the other depends on the teacher and the students. As a teacher, one must find what works for them and try to make their classroom the best environment for his or her students.

Positive Discipline:
:Is it all about being nice?



----

===Introduction===

----

&lt;small&gt;I am a father, a parent, and a future schoolteacher.  Licensed social workers and professional psychologists, people I have gone to for help, people I respect, experts in their fields, have called me &quot;laidback,&quot; &quot;easygoing,&quot; and &quot;too nice&quot; in my style of discipline.  &quot;But I'm positive in my discipline; I encourage them (my kids) and praise them, and, still, they show me very little or no respect!&quot;  I shout from the rooftops.  &quot;What am I doing wrong?&quot;  Wayne A. Martin, a '''Licensed Clinical Social Worker at Colonial Psychiatric Association in Newport News, Virginia''', says, &quot;Children need structure, structure through positive discipline and mutual respect!&quot;  It all sounds well and good, but what exactly does it mean?  What is positive discipline?  Is it all about being nice?  How do I apply it to a classroom of kids, kids from diverse ethnic backgrounds, kids from various positions in the sociological and intellectual ranks, kids who have learned a unique style of discipline from their own parents, and some who have learned no discipline at all?&lt;/small&gt;

----

===Definition===

----
&lt;small&gt;The term '''Positive Discipline''' might sound like an oxymoron to some people: I mean, let's face it, '''discipline''' has usually had a negative connotationâ'''punishment''' (Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary), and in the mind of a child, '''punishment''' is not a '''positive''' consequence.&lt;br&gt;  
According to Carol Chemlynski, '''Assistant Managing Editor, School Board News''', Positive Discipline is a system of &quot;responsibilities and mutual respect.&quot;  (Education Digest, Nov96).  Using common sense, and Carol Chemlynski's definition, let's break it down into easy to understand terminology: '''Responsibility'''âboth teachers and students must know the rules and adhere to them.  For example, if school policy is turning off cell phones in the classroom, then teachers and students have the responsibility to make sure they turn them off.  '''Mutual Respect'''âstudents respect teachers, teachers respect students, students respect other students, teachers respect other teachers, and everybody respects the rules.  What happens if there's a breakdown in '''Responsibility''' and '''Mutual Respect'''?  What happens if a student becomes obstinate, unmanageable, or disruptive?  How should a teacher execute discipline in the classroom?&lt;/small&gt;

===Executing Discipline in the classroom===

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:dunce.jpg|100px]] --&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;small&gt;It may surprise you to know that the United States is one of the few industrialized countries to allow corporal punishment in schools; in fact, twenty-two of our fifty states still allow teachers and administrators to paddle or spank children: most of those states are located in the south(ies,2007).&lt;br&gt;  
Although a number of states abolished corporal punishment in schools in the 1980s, teachers still ridicule students, place them in detention, and suspend them.  In her book Positive Discipline in the Classroom, Jane Nelsen interviewed a group of middle school students and asked them if getting yelled at, spanked, suspended, sent to detentions, or embarrassed in front of peers and parents solved their discipline problems; they responded with &quot;No,'&quot; &quot;What do you think?&quot; or they just laughed (page 24).  Okay, so students don't like the corporal punishment approach; in fact, psychologist Elizabeth Thompson Gershoff, Ph.D of the '''National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University''', suggests that corporal punishment stunts the learning process, promotes low self-esteem, incites anger and violence, and makes the job of teaching that more difficult(July,2002).  Yet, many school districts in many states still advocate spanking as a way of controlling bad behavior.So, what's the answer: corporal punishment or positive discipline?  Does one work better than the other does, or is it just a waste of time?     &lt;/small&gt;

----

===Coporal Punishment versus Positive Discipline===

----
&lt;small&gt;Growing up, I had the opportunity to experience a school that used positive discipline (I attended Parochial school from Kindergarten through eighth grade) and one that used corporal punishment (I attended public school from ninth through twelfth grade).  The Catholic school I attended used the Preventive Method of discipline as taught by a 19th Century Salesian priest named Don Bosco.  Don Bosco's method of study knew nothing of punishment.  Observance of rules was obtained by instilling a true sense of duty, by removing assiduously all occasions for disobedience, and by allowing no effort towards virtue, how trivial so ever it might be, to pass unappreciated.  He held that the teacher should be parent, adviser, and friend (The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1907).  Of punishment, Don Bosco said, &quot;As far as possible avoid punishing and try to gain love before inspiring fear.&quot; &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Patrick Webb, Doctoral Student, School of Juvenile Justice and Psychology, Prairie View A&amp;M University, Lecturer, Sociology, Social Work and Criminal Justice, Lamar University did a study on the pros of corporal punishment and found that, although it is not a long-term deterrent to bad behavior, spanking and paddling is effective when:&lt;br&gt; 
1.  It is given by an adult with an affective bond to the child&lt;br&gt;
2.  It is consistent and close to the behavior needing change&lt;br&gt;
3.  It is perceived as &quot;fair&quot; by the child&lt;br&gt;
4.  It is developmentally and temperamentally appropriate; and&lt;br&gt;
5.  It ultimately leads to self-discipline (pg 5)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
Corporal punishment in public schools was outlawed in Virginia in the mid-1980s. Now, 26 states and most large school districts have banned the practice, according to Katharine Kersey, professor of early childhood education at Old Dominion University.  Kersey, who lobbied for Virginia's ban, said, ``Corporal punishment is unnecessary, and it creates additional problems because you have now become a model for hitting. Children who have been hit will go out and hit others, their siblings, their dogs. They have to do something with the anger that the hitting produces ('''The Virginian-Pilot''',1997).''&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Although governed by the laws of the state, what is the responsibility of classroom teachers?  Should they expect parents to send disciplined students to the school?  Should they write detention slips, send unruly students to the principal, and let him or her handle discipline?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;


----

===The Responsibilities of Teachers===

----
&lt;small&gt;Many teachers think that they are only responsible for teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic; parents should teach discipline, in the homes.  According to Dr. Jane Nelsen, teachers want students who are responsible, have respect for self and others, exude self-discipline and self-control, show concern for others, display self-esteem and self-confidence, are risk takers, show confidence and happiness, have developed communication skills and problem-solving skills, have a sense of humor, are motivated to learn, and are compassionate.  (Page 6)  Yet, how can we as teachers expect all of those things from our students if we lecture at them, ridicule them, if we fail to praise them when they achieve, if we give them detention, and we paddle them when they misbehave?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;  
In the '''Practical Tools for Positive Behavior''', Edna C. Olive, writes, &quot;Human behavior is not something we can simply pop into a machine, push a button, and have delivered to us in an altered state.&quot;  Saying a kind word to a classmate, acknowledging other students' feelings, sharing books and advice, defending a victim of bullyingâthese are just a few of the prosocial behaviors that can enhance students' social and academic lives at school.  Because we know that children do not develop social values in a vacuum, educators, policymakers, and researchers are increasingly emphasizing the importance of the school's role in building students' prosocial skills. (Kidron &amp; Fleischman, page 90).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
David Strahan mentions case studies in which positive discipline was employed. Strahan shares that teachers in these case studies established warm, supportive relationships with their students. They did so by showing a deep interest in individual students and involving students in classroom decisions. Teachers play a huge role in not only creating positive discipline, but a positive classroom environment as a whole. Teachers can help students understand that they choose their behaviors and guide them in accepting responsibility for their choices. Many schools now implement practices in which students are engaged in addressing their disruptive behaviors in ways that promote self-discipline. By asking students to reflect on their decisions, plan and carry out corrections, make commitments, and discuss what they have learned, teachers simultaneously hold students accountable and reinforce positive relationships (Strahan, 2005, p. 26). Positive discipline has been a crucial aspect of schools for as much as twenty years. As far back as twenty years ago educators were encouraging teachers to improvement classroom management by making rewards and punishments more explicit. Strahan references âInviting Positive Classroom Disciplineâ, which includes three features for a successful classroom: successful classroom management promotes self-discipline; successful classroom management begins with Academic Learning Time; successful classroom management promotes academic achievement. These features encourage students to understand themselves and make better decisions, while learning more about the subject matter.

&lt;br&gt;
So, Responsibility, Mutual Respect, Positive Discipline, will it work in the school, in the classroom: is it all about being nice?  &lt;/small&gt;

----

===Conclusion===

----
&lt;small&gt;I think it's safe to say they we all were young at one time and probably met a teacher or two we didn't like, and even now, as adults, we are still students, still learning, still searching for all of the right answers.  Jerry Rubin of the infamous ''Chicago Seven'' is credited with coining the phrase, &quot;Never trust anyone over thirty!&quot; (Thinkexist.com).  Schoolchildren look at teachers and parents as the older generation that doesn't know what's best for them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;  
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain) the teachers that taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain) Holding me down, turning me round, Filling me up with your rules (Lennon &amp; McCartney, 1967).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;  
We don't need no education.  We don't need no thought control.  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.  Teacher leave those kids alone.  Hey, teacher leave those kids alone! (Roger Waters, 1979).&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;
You could probably ask one hundred kids why they hate school, and they'll give one hundred different answers: it's boring, it cuts into my free time, the teacher's think they know everything, teachers make me feel stupid, they yell at us, they send us to the principal's office to be punished, they don't treat us with respect, etc. (SNN,Dec/2003).  Add to that, the rise in violence in schools, and you can see why the demands of being a teacher are challenging.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;  
The question was, Positive Discipline: Is it all about being nice?  The answer is; yes, sometimes, when it's appropriate, but not without structure and guidance, and a lot of patience.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here are some rules to follow to help make Positive Discipline work:&lt;br&gt;  
Dr. Jane Nelsen's '''Positive Discipline Classroom Management Tools:'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Limit choices to appropriate and acceptable&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Assign classroom jobs to give students opportunities to contribute in meaningful  ways&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Problem solve, and follow through with dignity and respect&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Ask, don't tell -- &quot;what,&quot; &quot;why,&quot; and &quot;how,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Use redirection questions to defuse bad behavior&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* When appropriate, do nothing (natural consequences) and don't overreact&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Decide what we want to do and how to handle a problem&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Say &quot;no&quot; with dignity and respect&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Treat everyone fairly&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Use positive time-outs instead of immediately punishing&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Use parent/ teacher/ student conferences to get everyone involved&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Take small steps, think before acting. (pp 189-216)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* These tools might not create a perfect world, a perfect classroom, but it's a good start.&lt;/small&gt;

=='''Introduction:'''==

The world of education is becoming more and more complex.  Oftentimes the array of educational research and teaching models can be a bit daunting for the novice teacher.  How can a new teacher be sure which strategies are the most effective when most teaching strategies have been backed by years and years of research?  Most education models seem legitimate and useful and this can be overwhelming. With dropping graduation rates, poor test performance, stretched budgets and the stress of accountability teachers are hard pressed to keep classroom instruction interesting, meaningful and fun.  Teachers are now more than ever being challenged with the task of keeping students engaged.  There has been a paradigm shift to students becoming active learners and teachers taking on the role of guides to knowledge and learning independence. ( Erlauer, 2003 )  Brain research and its effects on learning is definitely not a new area of research.  In the past there have been a variety of theories ranging from right brain vs. left brain learners, gender studies, and many other theories in between. ( Willingham, 2006 )  This article will review the core principles of brain based education, the implications for best teaching practices, and the twelve classroom design principles based on the mainstream research.

=='''What is Brain Based Learning?'''==
 
Brain-based learning is an instructional-design model based on the idea that learning activities are more effective if they occur in an atmosphere that is compatible with the way the brain learns. Brain based education centers around the principle that learning is more productive if the learner is in a natural, challenging, yet non-threatening environment.  Learning is a natural condition of humans.  However, humans do not learn to be more effective on the job, or to be more gifted with numbers than words.  Humans learn to survive.  The main tenet of brain based learning is that if the environment is conducive to natural learning then learning will not only take place, but flourish.

=='''Brain Based Learning:  Fact or Fiction:'''==

Most researchers of brain-based education would be the first to admit that many of the findings of brain-based learning research are still in the early stages.  Two of the pioneer researchers in brain based learning, Renate Nummela Caine and Geoffrey Caine have published several books and articles on brain based research and have brought focus to the subject.  The Caines came up with 12 principles based on brain based research which outlines its implications in the classroom.  The 12 principles will be discussed in detail later in the article.  But first, it is important to point out that there are some scientists who believe that although neuroscience has made great strides in finding out how the brain works, it is a bit premature to try and use those findings in the classroom.  Neuroscience is a vast discipline filled with mystery, and only in the past 15 years have scientist been able to uncover some of those mysteries through use of MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) and PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography). (Erlauer, 2003)  Other scientist have cautioned educators from getting drawn in by all the research because many of the findings used to support classroom instructional models is not brain based at all.  Most of the research is based mainly on already existing psychological theories based on cognitive research. (Bruer, 1999) Neuroscience and psychology are very similar.  The main difference is that neuroscience is the science of the brain and how it functions, and psychology is the science of the mind and human behavior.  (Bruer, 1999) Psychology has been considered to be a soft-science for many years. Neuroscience is a hard science.  Hard sciences are generally grounded in rigorous methodology and hypothesis formation.  Soft sciences are usually not as rigid and there is much room for speculation.  John T. Bruer explores this dichotomy in a ''Phi Deltan Kappan'' journal article, In Search ofâ¦Brain Based Education. 
Bruer contends that most of the evidence available against traditional models of education can be supported by 30 years of research in constructivism and cognitive development not brain research.  (Bruer, 1999 ) As mentioned previously some scientists will agree that brain research has accomplished much in the last decade. Daniel Willingham, a renowned cognitive scientist and professor, cautions educators to be aware of the different levels of analysis present when trying to bridge neuroscience and effective classroom practices.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  
Nonetheless despite skepticism many scientists have found enough validity in the research to press forward in changing the face of the American classroom.  Eric Jensen, Renate Nummela Caine, Geoffrey Caine and Laura Erlauer have designed educational models which integrate brain based research into the classroom.  The next section will survey some of the principles and implications their research has had on education.
----

=='''Integrating Brain Based learning into the Classroom'''==

With all the information out in the world about brain based learning how does a teacher successfully integrate the best teaching practices into their classroom.  It is important for a teacher to know that they donât have to reinvent the wheel.  Whenever trying to implement a new strategy into the classroom it is always best to start small.  When I first began teaching my aunt, who is also a teacher, told me to never stop learning.  She advised me to attend conferences regularly, and pick two good strategies to incorporate into my classroom.  I intend to incorporate some of the strategies I have read about in my research with caution.  Renate Nummela Caine and Geoffrey Caine created the 12 mind/brain principles for integrating brain based research into the classroom.  According to Renate Caine, â These principles are not meant to represent the final word on learning. Collectively, they do, however, result in a fundamentally new, integrated view of the learning process and the learner. They move us away from seeing the learner as a blank slate and toward an appreciation of the fact that body, brain, and mind are a dynamic unity.â  Following is the complete list of the twelve brain/mind learning principles, as defined by Caine and Caine:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;
 
1.	The brain is a complex adaptive system.
 
2.	The brain is a social brain.
 
3.	The search for meaning is innate.
 
4.	The search for meaning occurs through patterning.
 
5.	Emotions are critical to patterning.
 
6.	Every brain simultaneously perceives and creates parts and wholes. 

7.	Learning involves both focused attention and peripheral attention. 

8.	Learning always involves conscious and unconscious processes. 

9.	We have at least two ways of organizing memory. 

10.	Learning is developmental.
 
11.	Complex learning is enhanced by challenge and inhibited by threat.
 
12.	Every brain is uniquely organized. (Caine and Caine 1997)


&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



Each of these principles has specific implications for the classroom which are fully illustrated in their book ''Education on the Edge of Possibility''.  Eric Jensen took the principles base on the Caine research and developed a teaching model which breaks down teaching preparation to three distinct phases.  The first phase is the preparation and planning stage, next phase focuses on the learning process and then finally the last stage is for reflection and processing of information.  (Jensen, 2005)  If a teacher uses Jensenâs teaching model and integrates the following three interactive elements Renate Caine writes about in her book Making Connections then setting up a classroom which takes a brain based approach would be a less challenging process.
  
â¢	Teachers must immerse learners in complex, interactive experiences that are both rich and real. One excellent example is immersing students in a foreign culture to teach them a second language. Educators must take advantage of the brainâs ability to parallel process. 

â¢	Students must have a personally meaningful challenge. Such challenges stimulate a studentâs mind to the desired state of alertness. 

â¢	In order for a student to gain insight about a problem, there must be intensive analysis of the different ways to approach it, and about learning in general. This is whatâs known as the âactive processing of experience.â (Caine, 1991)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Brain-Compatible Teaching and Learning'''

'''by'''

'''Melissa M. Hendrix'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


=='''Introduction'''==

Early in the 1990's a new form of schooling began to emerge that was based on neuroscience, it was known as brain-compatible teaching.  &quot;Brain-compatible learning is the understanding and teaching based on what we have learned ''directly'' from studying the brain.  Brain-compatible teaching is the application of principles and strategies that ''appear'' to be ''compatible'' with what we know about the brain.&quot;(Jensen,2007)  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''&quot;The process of brain building grinds on at the guesstimated rate of 10,000 new cell-to-cell contacts forming every second.&quot;''' (Ebner,1996)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 
&quot;Studies of the brain's electrical activity and metabolic activity&quot; allow us &quot;to see which techniques and strategies stimulate, and which impede, communication between the parts of the brain where information is processed and stored.&quot;(Willis, 2007)  Our brains are constantly changing, as we experience new things, and learn new information &amp; skills our brains form dendrites which stem from neurons to form pathways to other parts of our brains.  The brain is divided into four lobes: the frontal lobe controls things such as judgment, language production, working memory, initiation of problem solving; the parietal lobe controls things such as spatial sense and short-term memory; the temporal lobe controls language and vision; and the occipital lobe is responsible for vision (receiving &amp; processing.)  &quot;The brain is also divided into 2 hemispheres: the right hemisphere learns in sequences, works with parts, is better with language, and acts as &quot;interpreter to our daily lives&quot;; the right hemisphere learns randomly (sequencing is unimportant), works with wholes, and is better with pictures, space, and color.&quot;(Jensen,2007)  Studies have shown that the brain remembers the information at the beginning &amp; end of a lesson best.  



=='''The Female Brain vs. The Male Brain'''==

Neuroscientists have developed certain characteristics of male and female brains, these characteristics may vary depending on factors such as hormone levels.  There are many differences in the male in female brains such as:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The female brain develops the left hemisphere earlier than the right, while the male brain develops the right hemisphere earlier than in females and has a left hemisphere that develops later than the right&lt;li&gt;The female brain has a larger corpus callosum&lt;li&gt;The female brain has monthly fluctuations in the two hormones progesterone and estrogen, which causes shifting scores on spatial, math, verbal, and fine motor skills tests&lt;li&gt;The male brain maintains higher testosterone levels, which aid skills in abstract manipulation, spatial, science, math, and sports, while the female brain has 20-30 percent more serotonin, which is correlated with fearfullness and lower self-confidence&lt;li&gt;The male brain is more compartmentalized and less distributed in functional areas, while the female brain spreads thinking function over a wider area of the brain&lt;li&gt;The female brain can distinguish faces and photos earlier and better as well as learning to speak and read earlier than male brains&quot;(Jensen,2007)&lt;/ul&gt;



=='''Principles of Brain Research'''==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''&quot;In conclusion, brain-based, learner-centered, professional development, combined with a larger set of systemic changes, leads to both better student performance and significant shifts in the culture and operation of the system itself.&quot;''' (Caine,2006)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Brain-based research teaches us that there are three critical age groups in which the principles used should vary.  These three age groups are Mediation(birth to 5), Young Children(5-11), and Tweens to Teens(11-18).  Principles of brain research say that all brains have the ability to change.  There is no one correct way of teaching, everyone learns differently which is why information should be presented in multiple forms so that students have a better understanding.  Presenting information in multiple formats also goes along with brain-based learning, in that, proponents believe &quot;the more ways that the material is learned, the more memory pathways are built(Willis,2007)&quot;.  Socialization is a major part of learning.  Being around other people helps us learn behaviors that are acceptable in society, how to deal with our emotions, and much more about tolerance, diversity, and cultural &quot;norms&quot;.  Everything that happens in our life, emotionally, physically, and in many other ways, affects our brain and the way we learn.  Our sleep patterns, the way we eat/drink, the environment in which we are taught, and knowing about our brains &amp; the way we learn all influence the way in which we retain information.  Also, there are limitations to the amount and content that the brain can learn.  Educators should keep all of these principles in mind when working with students of any age.



=='''Strategies'''==

Active learning is when we learn through doing something.  &quot;The brain learns best with active rather than passive learning (doing vs. absorbing).&quot;(Prigge,2002)  Active learning works because the brain can better recall information from experience rather than items from memorization that we cannot relate to anything.  &quot;Relational memory occurs when students learn something that adds to what they already have mastered; they engage or expand on &quot;maps&quot; already present in the brain.&quot;(Willis,2007)  Graphic organizers are one way in which we can use our relational memory.  Also, teaching information in separate groups helps with relational memory, for example, the way we learn phone numbers or social security numbers. 

When we learn through working with other people or in groups that is known as cooperative learning.  When we work with other people we are able to hear thoughts and ideas that we may not have thought of but help us to remember a topic better.  Cooperative learning is based on the principle of social learning.  

A learning environment is created when the educator considers the look and feel of the classroom.  Some things to consider when setting up the classroom are colors and creating an environment that promotes the topics that are being taught.  Using music and laughter in the classroom are also ways to create a better learning environment.  These two things touch people emotions and also stimulate relational memory because normally when your emotions are brought to the surface it reminds you of a particular place and time in your life.  

Learning through physical movement is also a strategy of brain research.  Getting students out of their seats to get their blood circulating helps to break up the monotony of the lesson and keep the children focused.  One example of the physical movement strategy is Brain Gym.  Brain Gym is based on activities that are done to stimulate the brain.  The main premise of the activities are crossing the midline of your body to get both the left &amp; right hemispheres of the brain working together at the same time.  Another belief of Brain Gym are lengthening activities which are basically stretching.  Proponents believe that these lengthening activities help to refocus the brain. Many neuroscientists, however, consider this to be pseudoscience, as there is no actual evidence for the claims made.

=='''Opponents of Brain Research'''==

Many opponents of brain research consider it a &quot;popular mix of fact, misinterpretation, and speculation.(Jorgenson,2003)&quot;  Opponents feel that much of the information represented by brain research is unfounded and that many of the people who promote brain research do not hold credentials in neuroscience.  &quot;There's a whole industry of brain-based education based on no research at all.&quot;(Jorgenson,2003)  Challengers of brain research question such principles as the &quot;right brain/left brain&quot;, &quot;critical period or window of opportunity&quot;, and the &quot;Mozart effect&quot; saying that there is no evidence to prove increased brain activity.  These techniques have led to reports of success but &quot;it is difficult to know whether the improvement is due to &quot;brain-based&quot; theory, increased attention paid to hands-on activities and engaging teaching strategies, improved teacher awareness and attention to student needs, the pressure of a unified district mandate with support throughout the chain of command, or one of many other variables contributing to increased student achievement.&quot;(Jorgenson,2003)

'''Is this an easy choice to make'''

By Wendy Belgrave&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;        


== Learning Targets ==
* To understand what positive reinforcement means
* Understand there can be drawbacks to any method
* To learn alternative ways of punishment

==Introduction==
 
&quot;Great job on figuring out that problem!  Way to analyze the data Sarah. And you Nathan! I want you to write me a 500 word essay on why it is important to pay attention and be quiet while class is in session. I'm tired of having to talk to you about this!&quot;  Does this seem fair to you?  In an ideal world the students would walk into a classroom, and their soft murmurs would come to a halt once the bell rang.  They would all take out their paper and pencils, take notes, raise their hand if they had a question or answer, and smile during the entire class period.  But this is not fantasy land and we have children coming into our classrooms with all sorts of personalities and issues.  A teacher might find it easy to praise their students when they do something good, but what if the students are having a âbad dayâ?  Can you really catch more flies with honey than with vinegar?

==Reinforcing A Desired Behavior==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #005CB9; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;âYou can win people to your side more easily by gentle persuasion and flattery, than by hostile confrontation (Hirch 1988 p. 49),&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;.

Growing up, receiving a sticker on a gold star at the end of the day was the ultimate feeling for me.  The sticker meant a job well done throughout the day.  I didnât know it at the time but that was positive reinforcement at its best.  The concept definition of positive reinforcement, according to the ''Centre of Psychology'', occurs when 3 conditions have been met (Grant 1996).

*	A consequence is presented dependent on a behavior. 
*	The behavior becomes more likely to occur. 
*	The behavior becomes more likely to occur because and only because the consequence is presented dependent on the behavior. 


In my observations I have witnessed teachers praise their students.  You do not hear the student say how this makes them feel, but you will see their demeanor change when a student is given accolades in front of his or her peers.  This provokes a willingness to chime in more often regardless of right or wrong answers. A student named Lee Ray was recognized for his risk taking.  His teacher wrote a summary of him saying, &quot;He answers all the questions, correct or not (Lashaway-Bokina 2000 p. 225).&quot;  Positive feedback and recognition build self esteem and confidence.  

Giving a student a âgood jobâ for a correct answer is always good, but the learning of subject matter is not the only thing that deserves recognition.  Rewarding desired behavior is easier than you may think.  For instance, you are doing a class project that requires cutting pieces of paper, at the end of the project you notice a student picking up pieces of paper that fell off the desk and throwing them in the trash.  This is a perfect opportunity to acknowledge a thoughtful gesture.  This in turn tells the other students to do the same without you having to request it.  This is much more effective than reminding the students that you are not their parent and wonât pick up after them.  Acknowledging good attendance, a pat on the back for team work, and even recognizing special achievements even if they are not related to the class are great ways to build self esteem.  Just as important, the recognition of improved behavior or grades is also a great confidence builder.  Sending a post card home to the childâs parents is a great way to reinforce positive behavior.

A discipline program, for example, should not only eliminate problem behavior, but it should also systematically build the positive behaviors that you want to replace the problems (Fred Jones).&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;.

== When Rewarding By Incentives Goes Bad ==

Some teachers choose to pass out candy or give special privileges for good behavior or for doing certain tasks, but what if there is not an actual reward other than a âthank youâ?  ''Student Awards, Rewards, and Recognition'' says that you mustnât use rewards as incentives because it sends this message, âif you do this, then you get this.â  This may seem too much like bribing.  Bloggers on ''An Unschooling Life'', are not fans of the rewards for learning.  They believe that the reward for studying is learning.  One of the bloggers who is a homeschooling parent said, âIf someone had to bribe me to do something, my first thought would be &quot;It must be unpleasant if you have to bribe me to do it.&quot;  She continued on to say that her daughter would only read if she was given candy while in school.

Peter Callaghan, a writer for ''The News Tribune'', agrees with the home schooling parent about the damage that incentives create.  He mentions a school in Washington that was giving a five week course to better scores on reading, writing, and mathematics for an upcoming standardized test.  A $79 free IPod Shuffle was offered to every student that signed up. Only 80 failing students had signed up for the test before the incentive was given.  The incentive was enough to fill 270 additional slots.  âKids who goof off shouldnât receive gifts while kids who try hard get nothing extra. Kids shouldnât be bribed to try to learn something (Callaghan 207).â

== Punishment As An Incentive ==

It would be easier to teach a classroom full of children if there were no children misbehaving.  According to ''Student Teacher Advocate'', one third of new teachers leave the teaching field within the first 3 years.  The teachers questioned said that they spend an overwhelming amount of time doing other tasks (disciplining included), beyond actual instruction.  Forty percent of those teachers surveyed said that they spend more time than expected on disciplining (Miller, Higgins). 

Teachers sometimes find punishment to be effective as a classroom behavior management tool, especially as a short term solution. Because punishment tends to rapidly stop problem behaviors, the teacher in turn is positively reinforced for using it (What Every Teacher Should Know About Punishment 2008).  Teachers may be tempted to use this technique over and over because of its quick response, but this very sort of punishment can have side effects.  Students who are generally punished in this way can overtime develop negative attitudes toward school, can develop an uncomfortable relationship with their teachers, and perhaps feel apprehensive about participating in class activities (What Every Teacher Should Know About Punishment 2008).  Discipline and punishment are important parts of rearing children not only at home but in school settings as well.  

When people use the word âpunishâ, it is usually used to describe a negative consequences for a violation.  In some schools around the United States punishment can mean physical punishment.  Corporal punishment is still allowed in 21 out of 50 states, but is only practiced in 4 of those states; Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee (Farrell).  According to C. Farrell, a writer for ''School Corporal Punishment'', paddlings were given in the classroom or right outside the door, but then only the principle had to do the paddling or it was done in front of his or her presence in a private room.  Some of the people I spoke to remember being paddled or being hit on the palms with a ruler for horse playing.  Educators must be careful and administer punishment with care, especially if it comes in the form of corporal punishment. &quot;Punishments are an expression of violence of the more powerful adult against the weaker child (Cerney 2008 p.51).&quot;   

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #005CB9; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;âAccording to estimates from the federal Department of Education (Office of Civil Rights), there were about 272,000 paddlings of students in the 2004-05 school year -- down from 457,754 only eight years previously. This shows that the rapid decline of the 1980s and early 1990s, which had leveled off by the middle of the 1990s, has now resumed. Total paddlings were equivalent to only 0.6% of the total US school population (Farrell).&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;.

This is a link to a few videos on our current day paddling. http://www.corpun.com/viduss02.htm

== Alternative Ways Of Punishment ==

Punishment can take on many forms; it can be a reprimand, or a type of punishment known as response cost. Response cost means that a student can have rewards, or privileges taken away when he or she demonstrates problem behavior even if it is only momentarily (What Every Teacher Should Know About Punishment 2008).  An example would be that a student on time-out would not be able to join his or her classmates when it is time for playtime until their time-out was over. 

Disciplining does not necessarily mean having the child sit in the corner with a dunce hat on, getting paddled, whacked on the hands, or writing sentences.  Experienced teachers will say that remaining calm can diffuse an angry disposition more effectively than responding in an equal tone.  One of the teachers that I interviewed, Kristin Gorsuch, a high school math teacher from Isle of Wight County, said that when she has a continually disruptive student, she simply asks them to step outside for a minute until she can go outside and discuss in private what she expects.  The point is not to intimidate or belittle them in front of their peers.  Disciplining does not have to be an aggressive act is what she believes.   

You will see and hear what other teachers believe is a good way of âpunishingâ a student without it being demeaning or embarrassing. Visit this web site for the videos under âWhat Would You Do?â  http://www.nea.org/classmanagement/discipline.html

== Conclusion ==

Time changes everything.  The material taught in schools, the thoughts on child creativity, and classroom management have all been revised over time.  The question as to what is a better way to develop productive adults has perplexed people for ages.  Should we pat our children on the back for a mediocre job and hope that next time they do better, or should we whoop them into shape, tell them what we expect and show no mercy since the âreal worldâ wonât show them any?  As educators we need to build up our children and young adults, evaluate what the problem really is, if any and make a decision based on each child.  There is no cookie cutter solution.

== &lt;font color=&quot;turquoise&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Learning Targets &lt;/font&gt;==
* The student will understand the difference between reward and punishment.
* The student will know different methods of rewarding a student.
* The student will know different methods of punishing a student.
* The student will be able to choose the best method depending on a classroom scenario.


== &lt;font color=&quot;turquoise&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt; ==
When it comes to rewarding and punishing, it can be hard for teachers to decide the best way to get their point across to their students. In today's world, long gone are the times when a licorice stick was given as a reward and a light slap on the hand sufficed as suitable punishment. This action of causing pain to be used as a punishing tool, known as corporal punishment, can sometimes scar a child for life. Now, there are more effective ways of correcting or appraising a student's actions. When it comes to correcting a student's behavior, verbal reprimanding is not always the best answer. Concerning praise, there are other alternatives other than incentives. The choice that teachers have to make is a difficult decision because of the impact it can have on a student. Exploring many methods is an effective way to pick the best solution for the student based on his or her situation.


== &lt;font color=&quot;turquoise&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Spare the Rod, Spoil the Child?&lt;/font&gt; ==
When a student performs well in the classroom, there are many things a teacher must consider before showering the child with praise. Rewarding a student consists of giving a student praise because of good behavior, performing a task well, or other positive classroom attributes. Forms of praise are beneficial if used correctly. Firstly, one should not overly praise a student while not praising another enough. Also, giving a student too much rewarding can sometimes hurt them in the future. The student can feel confident about the work they have accomplished; however, if they do not perform well on the next task, it can make them feel insignificant or bashful to try in the future. So the question teachers must ask themselves is, &quot;What is the best method to reward a student without hurting them or the rest of the class in the future?&quot;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: white;
border: solid 8px turquoise; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;For some teachers, this method has worked in the past: &quot;Games, which included drawing, cooking, building with clay, and telling stories using a flannel board, encouraged children to be physically active, promoted cooperative work, and provided a 'safe' environment for practicing&quot; (Stratzner, 1994, p. 292).&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===&lt;font color=&quot;turquoise&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''Methods of Rewarding a Student'''&lt;/font&gt;===
For some teachers, the best way to reward students for performing well and encouraging them to try in the future is by using incentives. Incentives can be used in many different ways. One of these methods is using a point system that incorporates giving a student a point when he or she does well. At the end of the week, they can receive a prize such as doing a fun activity, to act as a reward (&quot;CanTeach,&quot; 2008). Another effective award system consists of having the class work together to fill a jar full of marbles. A marble is put in the jar when a student does well and the marbles are counted at the end of the week for a class prize (&quot;CanTeach,&quot; 2008). This is an effective reward method because it requires the class to work together while building teamwork skills and allows them to achieve a group goal.

Many teachers struggle with different methods while teaching. The wrong method may not only be unsuccessful, but it could also entice the student to act out more in the future. In an article written by Elsa Stratzner, she writes of a teacher who struggles with the same scenario as previously mentioned. The teacher tries many different ways of dealing with the student in order to find a method that worked. At first, she simply ignores his disruptive behavior to see if it is a one-time thing (Stratzner, 1994, p. 289). When the behavior does not subside, she tries a rewarding way of dealing with his problems. The teacher put the misbehaving student in a group that works together to receive points (Stratzner, 1994, p. 290). This way of praise seemed to bounce the bad student back into shape immediately. He began to raise his hand in class to participate and, soon, became a student who volunteered to answer frequently in the classroom (Stratzner, 1994, p. 290).

&lt;center&gt;[[File:840.jpg|300px]]&lt;/center&gt;


Many incentives are questioned about whether or not they are effective. Some people believe that if a student only strives to perform well because of an incentive, they will not learn to do things on their own when they are older. According to some instructors, &quot;...neither facile bribes (i.e. immediate incentives and rewards), nor immediate punishments, (threats and negative consequences) actually realize their desired end-results. That such tactics tend to encourage the desired behavior at such superficial and incomplete levels, that, at the end of the day, students overall skills, retention and interest actually decline because they are misled about the nature of and reason for learning&quot; (Henry, 2008). Like rewards, incentives are beneficial when they are correctly used. Rather than rewarding a student with candy or other materialistic things, learning exercises, like a math or spelling game, can be used as a reward. This method ensures that the incentive is educational to the student and does not promote students to act out of greed but rather the desire to learn while having fun.

==&lt;font color=&quot;turquoise&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Can Punishing Be Rewarding in the Long Run?&lt;/font&gt;==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: white;
border: solid 8px turquoise; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;While you are teaching a lesson, a student is continuing to disrupt the classroom. He not only is distracting you while you are trying to teach, but he is distracting the other students around him from learning. What do you do? Do you single him out in the middle of the room and reprimand him in front of his classmates? Do you stop your lesson completely and pull him aside to speak to him alone? Or do you ignore his misbehavior completely and deal with his punishment after you are finished teaching the lesson?&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Sara E. Rimm-Kaufman wrote an article discussing different punishment scenarios and the apprehension teachers face when punishing a misbehaving student. According to her journal, &quot;Corrective comments and modeling have been described as practices that improve children's classroom behavior, foster a classroom atmosphere well-suited for learning, and provide students with a sense of class membership&quot; (Rimm-Kaufman &amp; Sawyer, 2004, p. 324). A teacher sometimes has to experiment with different means of punishment before finding a suitable way of reprimanding the student that is beneficial, not hurtful.

===&lt;font color=&quot;turquoise&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Methods of Punishment&lt;/font&gt;===
One way to get over a misbehavior barrier is to have the student write about their misbehavior; some teachers find this exercise to be a great way to learn about their students. According to Ellen Delisio of ''Education World'', &quot;Having students write about their misbehavior, why it occurred, and what they are going to do to correct it is valuable for students and teachers. Students get a chance to have their say, and teachers can review the write-ups with students and keep the documents in students' files&quot; (Delisio, 2008). This method gives a different viewpoint to why misbehavior occurs.

Some teachers actually got together to develop a method that would help classroom management. This method is known as the ''Responsive Classroom'' approach (Rimm-Kaufman &amp; Sawyer, 2004, p. 324). The ''Responsive Classroom'' approach uses teacher empathy and structure to help students learn self-control in the classroom (Rimm-Kaufman &amp; Sawyer, 2004, p. 324). The approach helps create a suitable, calm environment that enhances student's good behavior and makes them aware of how their behavior affects others (Rimm-Kaufman &amp; Sawyer, 2004, p. 325). Using teacher empathy to promote structure in the classroom helps to develop a routine that students can become comfortable with by doing things such as having a morning meeting as a class and letting students be aware of rules and consequences (Rimm-Kaufman &amp; Sawyer, 2004, p. 325).

==&lt;font color=&quot;turquoise&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Reward or Punishment?&lt;/font&gt;==
Overall, the decision to use methods of rewarding or methods of punishment is solely up to the teacher. Many educators prefer to neither punish or reward. &quot;As teachers, we need to look not at how to punish or reward, but how we can create an environment in classes that values openness, choice, caring, frequent collaboration and super interesting/engaging content&quot; (Henry, 2008).The best way to find out which methods work is to do trial-and-error exercises when a child does something well or a child misbehaves. For some teachers, their methods may change with each student. It may take a while, but once a teacher studies and practices means of reward and punishment, the classroom will soon be balanced and under control. Hang in there and you will be holding the reigns in no time.

== Learning Targets ==

The student will understand:

a.) the concept of reinforcement techniques.

b.) the locus of control. 

The student will be able to:

a.) determine whether a reinforcer is positive or negative.

b.) apply knowledge of the control locus to situations to determine the motivating factor's origin.

== Introduction ==

We have all heard that there can be too much of a good thing.  In fact, we have most likely all experienced this type of good.  For example, I love pizza! I do not eat it very often, because without a doubt, no matter when I last ate pizza, I will eat so much that I am absolutely miserable.  Can the same thing be said about things that are less tangible?  Specifically, can we offer someone, especially a child, so much praise that we negate the good?

&lt;div class=&quot;boilerplate metadata&quot; id=&quot;attention&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 2.5%; text-align: center; background: #C38EC7; padding: 20px; border: 7px solid #C0C0C0&quot;&gt;
''' ''' What is Praise?

Merriam-Webster defines praise as both a noun and a verb.

Noun:  &quot;An expression of approval. Verb: To offer a favorable judgement.&quot;
-- Merriam-Webster Online, 2005, n.p.''' &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Traditional Behaviorism:  A Reinforcement Theory ==

B. F. Skinner's (1904-1990) operant conditioning theory tells us that a behavior can be increased or decreased through reinforcers (Berk, 18). Reinforcers change the rate of a behavior's occurrence.  Steve Booth-Butterfield (1996) expands on this by saying that positive reinforcers, rewards, increase the desired behavior, while negative reinforcers, punishers, are those that decrease the occurrence of an action.  Additionally, he tells us to offer no attention at all in order to do away with something entirely (Booth-Butterfield, n.p.).

== The Locus of Control ==

The Journal of Applied Social Psychology (2006) publishes, Icek Ajzen's (2002) concept that control over an individual's behavior depends both on internal and external factors that might change the intended or expected outcome.  He theorizes that it is the individual's self-efficacy that determines the roll of external motivators (p. 678). In other words, external stimuli play only a small part when individuals strongly believe in their own inherent ability.  However, people with low self-esteem feel they lack the ability to control their own lives, which, in turn, allows external factors to have greater influence over their actions.

== The Debate ==                                              

Controversy exists, not so much with the idea that reinforcement changes behavior, but instead, in how it changes it and for how long. Debate has also arisen over whether or not we inhibit an individualâs natural desire to achieve by offering a reward. Cameron and Pierceâs (1994) meta-analytical study  reviewed twenty years of research into this debate. They concluded that rewards, such as praise and positive feedback, were successful motivators as long as performance ''quality'' was the basis for the reward (p. 391-395).  In this scenario, it is not sufficient to complete a task; the job must be done well.  

Critics of this study point out that even Cameron and Pierceâs own data verifies that intrinsic motivation decreases over time when incentives are used (Kohn, 3). For example, in his rebuttal, ''By All Available Means'', Kohn (1996) tells us that only purely informational feedback is effective if one hopes to avoid adverse consequences to an individualâs internal motivation (p. 3).  In other words, keep your opinion, good or bad, out of it. 

Still others, such as Judge, Erez, Bono, and Thoresen (2002),  believe that self-esteem, in conjunction with locus of control, self-efficacy, and neuroticism, is the key factor controlling whether or not extrinsic stimuli effect intrinsic behavior (p. 706-708). For example, praise will have little effect on the end result for a person with high self-esteem, largely, because the level of output produced by this individual is NOT dependent on your opinion, but rather on his/her own level of neuroticism.  On the other side, someone who lacks confidence may work diligently for the sole purpose of seeking even some small amount of recognition.

'''âWhat's going on is this: Reinforcement theory is a functional theory. That means all of its components are defined by their function (how they work) rather than by their structure (how they look). Thus, there is no Consequences Cookbook where a teacher can look in the chapter, &quot;Rewards for Fifth Grade Boys,&quot; and find a long list of things to use as rewarding consequences. Think about this a minute.â   

-- Steve Booth-Bloomfied, 1996, n.p.''' ''' &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Limitations ==

The limiting factor, or the variable, is that all people are different.   As such, a particular reinforcer may serve as a reward or a punishment depending on the individual.   For example, a mom sends her two children to their rooms as a negative consequence for cutting down her rosebush. The punishment works well with one child who shows appropriate remorse for her actions, while the other child is delighted with the opportunity to play indoors.
Anthony Chelte (1998) argues that the reinforcement theory completely ignores an individualâs internal motivation.  The implication is that people require the external stimuli.  In his view, people seek to accomplish a set task, or reach a predetermined goal, simply because it feels good to know that a job has been done and done well (p.10).  In other words, reaching the goal is the reward.

== Conclusion ==

Behavioral scientists concur that reinforcement effects behavior. The above controversy is over  ''proper application''.   In the educational setting the reinforcement theoryâs effectiveness has been weakened by an inability to use it properly. In his article entitled ''Reinforcement Theory'', Steve Booth-Bloomfield (n.d.) tells us that punishment can be a truly effective tool when it is âimmediate, intense, and unavoidable.&quot; (Booth-Bloomfield, n.p.) He goes on to say that while this tool âhas been taken away from the teacherâ¦some teachers persist in using weakened forms of punishment, often with unsuccessful and frustrating effects.â (Booth-Bloomfield, n.p.).  It is my opinion that the absence of a good negative consequence not only reduces the lessonâs value, but also takes away from the positive effectiveness of reward.  It is simply a matter of expectations! Furthermore, I believe, that actions foster outcomes. As the adult, we ''must'' show respect.  By respect, I refer to authoritative child rearing principles: We show children (truthfully, all people) a âhigh level of acceptanceâ (Berk, 2007, p. 279).  This must be offered in conjunction with âfirm, reasonable, controlâ (Berk, 2007, p. 279) that is reduced based on age-appropriate maturity and responsible behavior.

== Questions == 

1.Praise is a positive reinforcer in which of the following situations?

a.) The studentâs final draft improves following informational feedback from her teacher.
 
b.) The studentâs final draft improves following positive verbal feedback from her teacher.

c.) The studentâs final draft is a direct copy of the rough draft following positive verbal feedback from the teacher.

d.) The studentâs neglects to turn in a final draft of the paper following positive verbal feedback from her teacher.


2.Suzy exhibits disruptive behavior at school this morning.  Following her normal warning then consequences routine: her teacher first gives Suzy a warning, then gives her silent lunch, followed by walking laps during recess.  Suzyâs behavior improves for the remainder of the day and is less disruptive for the remainder of the week.  What has happened in this scenario?  

a.) The teacher successfully applied negative reinforcement to achieve a negative outcome.

b.) The teacher successfully applied negative reinforcement to achieve a positive outcome.

c.) The teacher successfully applied positive reinforcement to achieve a negative outcome.

d.) The teacher successfully applied positive reinforcement to achieve a positive outcome.



3.Return to the scenario in Question #2, but in this case Suzyâs behavior digresses daily.  This time the teacher gives the entire class silent lunch and requires Suzy to watch as her classmates walk laps during recess.  A long term decrease in Suzyâs disruptive behavior is noted.  Which answer best describes why this approach worked?

a.) A consequence is only effective if it serves its intended function. 

b.) Peer pressure can be a powerful reinforcer.

c.) Suzy enjoyed being disruptive. 

d.) Suzy was not internally motivated to behave in school.

&lt;big&gt;'''Prostate Therapy Utilization'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Utilization==
*'''Center for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta; 2007''' PMID 17469027 -- &quot;Use of additional treatment for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen deprivation, or watchful waiting.&quot; (Berge V, Scand J Urol Nephrol. 2007;41(3):198-203.)
**SEER + Medicare claims data. 12,711 patients. Initial RP 31%, initial RT 31%, initial ADT 9%, initial WW 28%
**Outcome: Initial RP: 8% additional RT, 12% additional ADT. Initial RT: 23% additional ADT. Initial WW: 22% additional ADT
**Conclusion: If initially treated with RT or observation, more likely to receive ADT as follow-up treatment than if initially treated with RP


==Costs==
*'''American College of Radiology; 2002''' (1992-1993) PMID 12065564 -- &quot;Comparing the costs of radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy for the initial treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.&quot; (Burkhardt JH, J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jun 15;20(12):2869-75.)
**Linked SEER-Medicare analysis. 
**Outcome: Costs RT $14,048 vs. RP $17,226 (SS)
**Conclusion: For early-stage PCA, average costs were at least 23% greater for RP

*'''UCLA; 2000''' (1993-1996) PMID 11042575 -- &quot;A nationwide charge comparison of the principal treatments for early stage prostate carcinoma.&quot; (Brandeis J, Cancer. 2000 Oct 15;89(8):1792-9.)
**HCFA claims data for inpatient, outpatient and Part B claims. 10,107 men with initial diagnosis of prostate cancer, treatment, +6 months of follow-up. RT 58%, brachy 7%, RP 35%. During the 4 years, RT decreased by 20%, brachy increased by 21%
**Cost: RP + adjuvant RT $31,329 vs. RT + brachy boost $24,407 vs. RP $19,019 vs RT $15,937 vs brachy $15,301 (SS). Utilization varied with age, race, and geographic region
**Outcome: Without clear survival advantage, costs, QoL and patient preference take on paramount importance


==Proton Therapy==
*'''Fox Chase; 2007''' PMID 17704408 -- &quot;Is proton beam therapy cost effective in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the prostate?&quot; (Konski A, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 20;25(24):3603-8.)
**Markov model. Cost-effectiveness evaluation of 91.8 CGE proton beam vs. 81 CGE photon IMRT, using cost, bNED, utility data
**15 year model: 70 year old: cost of protons $63,500 vs. IMRT $36,800; 60 year old: protons $65,000 vs. photons $39,400. Incremental cost/QALY 70-year old $63,6000 and 60-year old $55,700
**Conclusion: Assuming 10 Gy additional dose-escalation, proton beam not cost-effective for most patients
**Editorial PMID 17704400

By Catherine Byrd'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;






&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;



&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Students should be able to:


a) Differentiate between intelligence and effort praise and identify which one is more effective in a classroom setting

b) Distinguish how much praise in a classroom is beneficial to a studentsâ future

c) Give reasons and examples as to why praising a student is important and the emotional positives it has on students&lt;/font&gt;







&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;





&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Most parents and educators would say that praise is important to a childâs development of self esteem; so one would think that the more praise, the better. Right? Not always. Some educators and psychologists believe that praise is good but if done too often then it loses its effect and molds children that are constantly seeking approval (Delision, 2000). 

The question now raised is how much praise is too much and what exactly should be praised?

As humans, we prefer to be praised for our correct efforts than be criticized for what we did wrong. We are a society that thrives on individual recognition. As teachers, we need to criticize and praise our students but need to explore and research how to praise students and determine what is beneficial and what is damaging.&lt;/font&gt;




&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Honest Feedback'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;âI do not believe you can give anyone self esteem, but you can create an environment where it can grow.â ( J.D. Hawkins, 2000)&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Marshall Duke, a clinical psychologist, says that a childâs strengths need to be identified and developed which will lead to more self confidence rather than continuous praise. Feedback to children that is honest is more beneficial than an empty praise. Being honest with children while they are young will help them survive in the real world because if not then they will not know how to deal with adversity as they become adults (Delision, 2000).

Many people believe that praise leads to higher self esteem and that high self esteem results in happier children that perform better in school but there is no research to support that idea. Duke told Education World âSelf esteem does not make them happier, achieve more, or become more capableâ (Delision, 2000).&lt;/font&gt;




&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Intelligence Praise or Effort Praise'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;




&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;A study was done by Melissa Kamins, Claudia Mueller and Carol Dweck to determine whether intelligence praise or effort praise is more effective on children. Intelligence praise is when a teacher emphasizes to a student that they did well because they are smart and effort praise is when the teacher emphasizes the studentâs success because of their hard work. The results of the study showed that students who were praised on their intelligence had a goal to look smart even if it meant sacrificing learning. Students that were praised based on their efforts had a goal to learn new things even if it seems challenging or risky (Aronson, 2002). The results of this study show that not all praise is beneficial to students and that if praise is going to be used by teachers then it should be practiced in a manner that has positive learning outcomes.

Research has found that giving too much praise to students can lessen self-motivation and lead to children becoming dependent on rewards for their work. One study found that when teachers praised preschoolers for doing an activity that they were already excited to do, the children lost some motivation to do the activity. âChildren have an intrinsic desire to learn. Ineffective praise can stifle studentsâ natural curiosity and desire to learn by focusing their attention on extrinsic rewards rather than the intrinsic rewards that come from the task itselfâ (Hitz, 1989).&lt;/font&gt;

'''&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Like a Cheerleader&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''




&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&quot;The praise keeps them goingâ¦â (Lori Palmer, 2000)

âPraise is defined as verbal comments indicating approval, commendation or achievementâ (Madsen, Becker &amp; Thomas 1968). This is essentially the most important tool a teacher can have. When students are praised constantly, they know they are being praised for trying. Lori Palmer believes that âall children benefit from steady praiseâ (Delision, 2000). Praise is a type of positive reinforcement and is used to motivate students to behave and achieve positively. Praising also helps teachers manage individuals or groups (Hitz, 1989). Praise is important to a childâs confidence in class and fosters independence in the classroom. Students see praise as a way of teachers expressing their appreciation. Praise should be used on a daily basis and can be an effective tool for change as well (CTER, 2007).&lt;/font&gt;





&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Effective Praise'''
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;





&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Praise is very effective in the classroom. Praise gives students information on how valuable their accomplishments are. Students who are praised often, better appreciate their thinking and problem solving skills and know that the teacher expects the same effort in the future. Not only is praise a teacherâs way of expressing appreciation but it encourages students to appreciate their own work giving them a sense of self gratification (Kizlik, 2009).&lt;/font&gt;




 
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;




&lt;font color=&quot;#808000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;In my opinion, I believe that praise should be used in the classroom but used in a way that is effective to the student. My research has found that there is no evidence that praise should not be used at all in the classroom. The argument is rather what type of praise is positive and how often praise should be given. I agree that effort praise should be used in the classroom. A good balance of praise and criticism should be given. There are no perfect people in this world and until then everyone including young and old students should be given honest feedback even if it is not what they want to here. Although I believe honest feedback should be given, adults and educators [alike] need to give a solution as to how a student or child can improve.&lt;/font&gt;

'''Learning Targets:'''


After reading this article, students should be able to:


â¢	Define, understand and give examples of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

â¢	Understand opposing theories on motivation

â¢	Describe Self Determinaton Theory and provide examples of how to meet students' needs



----

== Defining Motivation:  What makes you move? ==


'''''moâ¢tiâ¢vaâ¢tion''': the act or process of motivating b: the condition of being motivated: a motivating force, stimulus, or influence : INCENTIVE , DRIVE  ( Merriam Webster, 2008)''


The subject of motivation has been researched and analyzed by countless scholars in various fields such as psychology, philosophy and education.  What makes people behave in certain ways?  What makes them âmoveâ?  In the 1940's, a pioneer of motivation theory, Abraham Maslow, described his own theory on human motivation.   He proposed that people have a heirarchy of needs that motivate them to do all things (Maslow, 1946).  These basic needs must be met in order of precedence, meaning that the needs at the bottom of the hierarchy must be met before the needs at the top of the list can be (Maslow, 1946).

In this model, certain needs must be met in order for a person to be motivated to learn.  Later research expands on this idea, as noted in the following sections.  In Educational Psychology, it is a common belief that teachers can âmotivateâ their students by providing an environment or situation that may enhance learning.   Researchers have been studying motivation for several decades, attempting to understand how to use motivation to specifically benefit the learning process.   Motivation has been classified into two generally accepted forms:


â¢	'''Intrinsic motivation''' is motivation that comes from within the student (e.g. contentment, enjoyment, pride, sense of accomplishment, responsibility)


â¢	'''Extrinsic motivation''' is motivation that comes from an external source (e.g. tangible rewards, trophies, stickers, gifts, applause, praise)

== Instrinsic versus Extrinsic? ==


So, which is better for use in the classroom?   Is one more effective than the other?  Or can both be used?  

On one hand, some could say that extrinsic rewards are more effective and reflective of the &quot;real world&quot; - people aren't motivated to work without paychecks.  So does extrinsic motivation prepare students for the &quot;real world&quot;?  Or are we just bribing them? 

Because intrinsic motivation comes from within, it is considered by many to be the more effective of the two when it comes to learning.    Intrinsic motivation can foster life long excitement for learning, resulting in students who are eager to learn new things.  Their experience is more meaningful and they go deeper in their learning to fully understand it.  It helps develop a studentâs attitude towards education and ensures more lasting success.  Of course, we all want our children to want to go to school and learn because they enjoy learning.  But what about subjects that just don't interest them or that are difficult for them to master?  Is it possibly to be intrinsically motivated for all things?

We're back at our question.....which works better?  Intrinsic or Extrinsic Rewards?   Let's look a little closer at each...

----

== Extrinsic Motivation ==


Extrinsic motivation can take the form of anything that doesn't come from within a person.  Examples range from a smiley face on a paper or a &quot;great job&quot; sticker to a hefty pay raise or bonus for an adult.  It can be getting the approval of a teacher or being accepted by peers.  Extrinsic motivation can also be negative in the form of punishment or taking rewards away.


Extrinsic motivation may be more effective when a student has a less-desirable task ahead of them.  For example, the student who dislikes math, might be more motivated to do well on the math test to get a good grade.  Many argue, however, that once the reward is gone, the student will not continue to be motivated (Vockell, 2008).  The predominance of researchers seem to agree that intrinsic motivation is more desirable, encouraging a more lasting desire to learn; however, extrinsic motivation is sometimes more popular when the task is not as appealing or if the technique seems to be more effective for the task at hand and for certain types of learners.  For example, if Susan hates her math homework and is simply not interested in doing it, it might give her incentive to do her homework if she knows she will get a good grade, a reward or praise from her teacher.


----

== Intrinsic Rewards &amp; Self Determination Theory ==


Many believe that motivation is the most powerful when it comes from within, rather than from outside forces.  Some go farther to describe one or more factors that can promote intrinsic motivation.   Some of these factors are challenge, curiosity, control, fantasy, competition, cooperation, or recognition (Vockell, 2008).


Self Determination Theory (SDT) started evolving over 30 years ago with the research of Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan.  The basis of their theory is that people have three basic needs:  the need for a sense of autonomy, the need for relatedness (or belonging), and the need for competence (Deci &amp; Ryan. 1991).  Many theories on teaching motivation have centered on meeting these three needs:  


1.	Sense of ''Autonomy'' -  Students need to feel a sense of control and self-determination

2.	Sense of ''Belonging'' â Students need to feel accepted by peers and teachers

3.	Sense of ''Competence'' â Students need to feel capable of succeeding


SDT proposes that all individuals have a âseedâ for learning and with the right nutrients or environment, they can be encouraged to be self motivated (or intrinsically motivated) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1991).  This implies that if all these basic needs are met for our students, then their natural curiosity and thirst for learning can shine through.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;''To be self determined is to endorse  one's actions at the highest  level of reflection.  When self determined people experience a sense of freedom to do what is interesting, personally important, and vitalizing.  - Edward L. Deci &amp; Richard M. Ryan''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Deci &amp; Ryan went even further to claim that extrinsic motivation can undermine intrinsic motivation (Deci et al. 2001).   In 1994, Cameron &amp; Pierce challenged this theory saying that the effect of extrinsic rewards was &quot;minimal and inconsequential.&quot;   Deci and Ryan countered this claim with newer research in 1995 which proved that &quot;tangible rewards do indeed have a substantial undermining effect&quot; (Deci et al. 2001).

== An Argument Against Motivation Theories ==


On the opposite end of the educational motivation research field are some that believe that motivation theories are not valid, such as Steven Reiss.  Reiss, a professor of pscyology at Ohio State University, claims that Deci &amp; Ryan and other similarly minded researchers are &quot;taking many diverse human needs and motivations, putting them into just two categories, and then saying one type of motivation is better than another.  But there is no real evidence that intrinsic motivation even exists&quot;  (Reiss, 2008).   Reiss believes that different people can be motivated in different ways and there is no right or wrong way to motivate.  &quot;Individuals differ enormously in what makes them happy - for some competition, winning and wealth are the greatest sources of happiness, but for others, feeling competent or socializing may be more satisfying.  The point is that you can't say some motivations, like money (or other tangible rewards), are inherently inferior.&quot;  While some children are &quot;inherently curious&quot;, other children are not as much so, for which extrinsic rewards may be more effective.  Reiss further argues that extrinsic rewards may encourage students to pursue activities that they would normally have shyed away from.

== OVERVIEW ==

Your third grade class is very active today.  The energy level is high as the kids get ready for an end-of-the-day holiday party.  But before they can go, they need to finish an important history lesson which they will be quizzed on.  You know getting their attention will be hard.   What do you do?  Do you offer them all a &quot;homework-free&quot; night as a reward for paying attention?  You still have a bag of lollipops in your desk for halloween - would that be a good idea?  Or if you make it a fun, interactive game will they all jump in and get the job done because they'll be enjoying themselves?   Or perhaps giving them the choice of giving up some of their recess in order to spend more time on the history lesson would encourage them to make good choices?


People can be motivated differently for a variety of reasons, from age to culture to special needs.  As teachers, we will each have various scenarious where one might work better than another or a combination of the two is a better approach.   While many of our actions are motivated extrinsically, intrinsic motivation must be there as well to encourage long term interest and learning.  Being aware of different theories (such as intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, self-determination theory) and being flexibile in our methods will be important in order to be the most effective teachers we can be.

[[File:Rewards_2.JPG|thumb|300px|top_left|Example of treats rewarded for good behavior.]]

Do you remember what motivated you as a student?  Was it pizza parties, fun Friday activities, or encouragement from a great teacher that cared?  


When working as a boss, with a pet, as a personal trainer, or even coaching after school sports, there is one thing that is very apparent.  Motivation is needed when instructing or teaching.  


There are many types of motivation but here the focus will be on intrinsic and extrinsic in the classroom environment.  


In a fifth grade classroom, a teacher decides that giving her students an external reward of âwinner circlesâ (pieces of paper shaped into coins) for making good grades in her class will be more of an incentive to work hard.  Not only will the students feel satisfied with good grades, they will also get some type of external reward when they cash in their paper coins for small prizes.  Are these external rewards okay or should there only be internal motivation?  What does this really teach students?

== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''Defining Two Types of Motivation'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

What is the difference between intrinsic verses extrinsic motivation?  The definition of motivation is âForces acting either on or within a person to initiate âbehaviourâ.   The word is derived from the Latin term motivus ('a moving cause')â (Motivation, n.d.).
  

Intrinsic can be defined as âBelonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thingâ (Intrinsic, 2004, p. 383).  An example of this would be praise, encouragement, and âhigh fivesâ.  &quot;Intrinsically motivated behaviors were defined as those that are not energized by physiological drives or their derivatives and for which the reward is the satisfaction associated with the activity itself.  Intrinsic motivation thus represents engagement in an activity for its own sake&quot; (Deci, 1971, 1975).  When a teacher tells a student that he or she knows that the student can improve and do better, the teacher is given the student intrinsic motivation.       


Extrinsic can be defined as âNot forming part of or belonging to a thing: externalâ (Extrinsic, 2004, p. 255).  An example of this would be stamps, stickers, or candy.  &quot;Extrinsically motivated behavior is defined as engaging in an activity to obtain an outcome that is separable from the activity itself&quot; (deCharms, 1968; Lepper &amp; Greene, 1978).  Children that receive a physical reward would not be related to inner feelings such as self accomplishment.


Can internal and external motivation be incorporated together or is one better than the other?


== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''What's Good and What's Bad about Intrinsic Motivation?'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Intrinsic motivation has many advantages.  A strong advantage for intrinsic motivation is that it costs nothing to provide.  Teachers do not have to pay anything to be able to reward their students with encouraging comments or feedback on how students can improve on a subject.  As students excel in the things they do by being given intrinsic motivation, they will feel more comfortable taking on new tasks.  When a child can read out loud in front of their peers, be competitive in a spelling bee, or say all the letters in the alphabet, this helps the child to have a feeling of self worth, confidence, and accomplishment.  This in turn gives them motivation to excel in other subjects as well when they feel good about themselves.   


A study was conducted to see how two different groups of participants would act.  One group was given rewards for the activity they were involved in and the other group did not receive anything.  The results showed that the group that received the extrinsic reward showed less interest in what they had participated in and enjoyed it less when compared to the group with no reward (Vansteenkiste, Lens, &amp; Deci, 2006).


According to Vansteenkiste (2006),&quot;Indeed, intrinsically motivated activity is the natural basis for learning and development&quot;    


Another example would include âAdding an intrinsic causal explanation for doing well on a task likely could solidify and extend performance gains achieved through extrinsic rewardsâ (Stockdale &amp; Williams, 2004).  Just by letting a student know what they need to improve on will enhance their performance and show them the areas they could improve on.  In some cases, once external rewards phase out from learning the basic knowledge, school kids transitioning to learn a greater depth in another subject will feel rewarded intrinsically from mastering the next subject that was built on from the basics (Stockdale &amp; Williams, 2004). 


There are cons that exist for intrinsic motivation as well.  Sometimes saying good job may not be good enough.  If childrenâs interest does not lie in that specific subject, then it may take a physical reward to spike their engagement (Vansteenkiste, ''et al.'', 2006).  Another con could be that a child that has put a tremendous amount of effort into a science project and only receives a pat on the back when they may feel that they deserve more than that.


== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''What's Good and What's Bad about Extrinsic Motivation?'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

[[File:Rewards_1.JPG|thumb|300px|top_left|Example of extrinsic reward (riding the shuttle)for good behavior]]

The advantages of extrinsic motivation apply as well.  A prime example would be when a child shows no interest in a subject that seems mundane to them that could include memorizing how to spell new vocabulary (Stockdale &amp; Williams, 2004).  In this instance, rewards to get children interested in a subject such as spelling would help them intrinsically later on in other subjects relevant to spelling like writing.   According to Stockdale and Williams, âOperating from the premise that extrinsic rewards are most valuable when children show little interest in a potentially useful activity, the teacher might employ external rewards to get child to engage in and work hard on that activityâ (2004).  Grades also count as extrinsic motivation because grades promote students to do a better job if they know there performance will be judged (Stockdale &amp; Williams, 2004).  Extrinsic motivation may sometimes work better than intrinsic motivation depending on the situation.            


Here are some of the disadvantages of extrinsic motivation.  In the example mentioned before about a teacher giving out children winner circleâs in the fifth grade, this could teach children to expect something for doing a good job and not just be proud of themselves.  So what will children expect when they get to sixth grade?  Will it be bigger and better rewards?  So teachers should be cautious when it comes to external rewards because of the dependency factor (Stockdale &amp; Williams, 2004).  Students that have to read a particular book where they know they will be expected to later write a report on the information may not enjoy the book as much as if they had a choice to read it on their own.

== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''Other Factors to Consider'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFB5D;
border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;  âPeople often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily.â
-Zig Ziglar 

  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


When it comes to motivation in a classroom there are many factors to consider.  School is for children around the age of five all the way up to adult years.  With that in mind, schools manifest children with different ages and ethnicity.  As children or even adults progress in levels of education, how does the type of motivation fluctuate?  Do these factors really matter when it comes to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation?  


A study showed that when children get older they tend to desire less intrinsic motivation, where extrinsic motivation stayed about the same (Lepper, Corpus, &amp; Iyengar, 2006).  An example of this is in later years when college is not required by the state like primary and secondary schooling, many people go to college because careers that pay well require a college degree.  Most universities stay in business because of the extrinsic motivation behind schooling which is to have a good paying job to live a better life and not primarily for the reason that an education makes people feel good about themself which would be intrinsic motivation.  This was an example of how intrinsic motivation decreases as children get older. 


A study conducted on Western cultures and Eastern cultures showed results in an Asian community that intrinsic motivation was high in students when their parents made most of their choices for them compared to a European community where students felt higher intrinsic motivation when they had made decisions for themselves.  Another study between Caucasian and Asian students showed that Asian students have more of a desire for intrinsic motivation from their teachers opposed to Caucasian students who desired less intrinsic motivation from their teachers (Lepper et al., 2006).  Norms can be different all over the world.  This also applies to society's view on what's important and widely accepted.

== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''Conclusion''' &lt;/font&gt; ==

&quot;Intrinsic and well-internalized extrinsic motivations, in turn, are expected to promote adaptive learning outcomes (Vansteenkiste, et al, 2006).  It is imperative that intrinsic motivation is needed as well as extrinsic motivation.  Intrinsic is rewarding by receiving recognition for something verbally or visually, a parent telling a child how well they did at something, or encouragement for a job well done.  Whereas extrinsic motivation can be used to provoke children's interest to learn something they may not otherwise have cared for or show appreciation for a reward a child for extra hard work.  Extrinsic motivation can also encourage students to pay better attention if there could be a test afterwards.  Extrinsic motivation can help to emphasize praise or punishment.  Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation help teachers provide students with the knowledge that is required for them to understand.

Overall, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can both work hand in hand or separately.

So I edited the page, correcting the example output. I think that the original author mistakenly left in the extra property when he edited his build.xml after the previous example, then ran ant on it and pasted the output not noticing the extra &lt;echo&gt;. Easy to do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creating Equity in the Classroom'''

by: Anthony D. Richardson

=='''INTRODUCTION'''==

There are many avenues we can take toward equity in the school.  We will discuss Culture, School Size, Gender, Learning, and Funding.  Five important topics needed for equity in the classroom.  Before you can fair assessment of anything a person faces, they must try to understand the what, when, why and how.  Equity is what every Teacher, Principal, School Super Attendant, and Parent should strive for.

=='''CULTURE'''==

Year 2004 represented the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954), the Supreme Court decision outlawing racial segregation in schools. Brown v. Board has been called the defining legal decision of the 20th century, framing as it did the United Statesâ struggle with issues of race and racial equality. In that decision, the justices clearly state that they were striking down segregation in public schools both to increase educational equity and to eliminate the racial stigma associated with segregation. 

Despite a wide range of efforts over the past 50 years, issues of racial and ethnic stigma and its relationship to identity and motivation remain central issues for those interested in creating racially equitable educational settings today. I argue that efforts to improve educational equity can only advance when a corresponding effort is made to reduce racial and ethnic stigma.

In the 50 years since the first Brown decision, we have learned a great deal about both the value of diverse learning environments for student development and how to create effective diverse learning environments. Nevertheless, as we come to understand that the racial and ethnic stigma discussed in Brown continues to play a central role in modern educational outcomes and inequities, we can direct our reform efforts in productive ways.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, teachers much acknowledge how deficit-based notions of diverse students continue to permeate traditional school thinking, practices, and placement, and critique their own thoughts and practices to ensure they do not reinforce prejudiced behavior. 

&lt;li&gt;Second, culturally relevant pedagogy recognizes the explicit connection between culture and learning, and sees studentsâ cultural capital as an asset and not a detriment to their school success. 

&lt;li&gt;Third, culturally relevant teaching is mindful of how traditional teaching practices reflect middle-class; European-American cultural values, and thus seeks to incorporate a wider range of dynamic and fluid teaching practices outcomes through the amelioration of stigma. &lt;/ol&gt;

'''''Culture ... impacts our lives by determining what is important and what is not,what makes sense and what does not. The culture then makes these constructions available to the young and to new initiates for appropriation and use in transforming their participation in that culture. Learning, then, becomes a matter of changes in one's relation to the culture(s) to which one is connected.'''''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=='''SCHOOL SIZE'''==

A large-scale quantitative study using nationally representative and longitudinal data attempted to identify the ideal size of a high school, based on student learning. The study explored these issues for about 10,000 students in 800 public and private schools in the United States. Although most research on this topic has been framed within a &quot;bigger versus smaller&quot; mode, the objective here was to estimate an appropriate balance point between student learning and school size. Achievement gains in mathematics and reading over the course of high school were found to be largest in middle-sized high schools (600-900 students). Schools of this size were also favored in terms of social equity, in that they had weaker relationships between student socioeconomic status (SES) and achievement. Lee and Smith also found that even though the same &quot;ideal size&quot; was consistent across schools identified by their average SES and minority concentrations, school size was a more important factor in determining learning in schools enrolling more disadvantaged students. 

Investigating the effects of school size in Chicago's (K-8) elementary schools, another study also found favorable effects for smaller schools in terms of student learning and teachers' willingness to take responsibility for their students' learning. Although without exception, teachers and students reported that social relations were more personal in the smaller high schools; this was not always seen as a benefit. A few students in the smaller high schools reported that they were unable to &quot;live down&quot; the negative reputations of their older siblings or even parents. Some teachers in such schools had to work hard to keep a modicum of privacy. 

Sociological theory suggests that human interactions and ties become more formal as organizations grow. Organizational growth generates new bureaucratic structures, as connections between individuals become less personal. These structures can inhibit communal organization. This general theory has been confirmed in research identifying the organizational characteristics of effective schools. In school climate studies, for example, size operates as an ecological feature of the social structure, part of the physical environment that influences the nature of social interactions. In general, the sociological evidence about high schools suggests that social relations are generally more positive in smaller schools.

=='''GENDER'''==

As young people move into adolescence, they begin to explore gender roles. Finding their way through this potential minefield is complicated and challenging for middle school students. The process of determining the variations in masculinity and femininity is largely a social function, not a biological one. What it means to be a man, and what it means to be a woman, is communicated to children by all the adults in a child's life, including teachers.

Boys and girls create very distinct cultures; when they are in same-gender groups they act and play very differently. Girls are talkative and cooperative, boys are competitive and physical. Teachers need to understand these differences and be purposeful in the treatment of each so as to send the healthiest messages to adolescents.

In 1992 the American Association of University Women (AALUW) published a groundbreaking study about how schools were not meeting the needs of young girls. Their schools shortchanged girls in many ways: when questioned in class, girls were less likely to receive a prompt to clarify thinking if they answered incorrectly; boys were more regularly called on, and if not, they were just as likely to shout out an answer, leaving girls to sit quietly; and girls were not encouraged to take advanced math and science classes (AAUW 1992). Perhaps not surprisingly, then, in their middle school years, girls stopped being successful in math and science.

So what do we do? The first thing is to become aware of the differences between genders. Once these differences are explained and accepted, educators must be proactive in the way boys and girls are treated in schools.  Indeed, there are distinct advantages to educating boys and girls together appropriately, for in doing so, each gender will begin to see how the other thinks, feels, responds, and reacts. Such understanding is in itself a major goal for gender-friendly classrooms.

We should also consider the nature of the differences between boys and girls. Creating a gender-friendly classroom does not mean that you create gender-specific activities, divide your classroom, or even insist on single-sex classes. Students should at some times have an opportunity to work in a gender-matched activity, while at other times they should learn to function in a more typical gender-mismatched one. This allows students to experience instructional times that are more comfortable for students when the activities are matched to their nature. But they also learn to function outside that comfort area when they are in a mismatched situation, and thus strengthen weaker areas.
    
For teachers the imperative is to learn about the differences in gender. Teachers need to accept that learning occurs differently for each gender, and to measure out activities and experiences that favor one some of the time, and the other some of the time. Keep in mind that although some girls may be more linguistically advanced than boys, some boys are just as advanced. Although some boys manipulate objects well and see patterns better than girls, some girls are headed toward engineering schools.  When boys see girls appropriately modeling relationship behaviors, the boys learn how to be more sensitive and open. Likewise, when girls see the appropriate use of assertiveness that boys learn early, the girls see that this can be used to their advantage as well.

=='''LEARNING'''==

Human beings, in our conscious hours at least, are always learning. We cannot do otherwise; learning is an involuntary human activity. What varies among us is what we learn, how our learning is put to use and reinforced, and what learning is valued by a particular group of people at a particular time--our education. The result is that, while everyone learns, some learn to survive and some learn to thrive. 

Unfortunately, access to the learning experiences that help people to thrive, though these depend on context, are not equally or equitably available to everyone. And although there may be value in all types of learning experiences, a deep understanding in the field of education of the range of learning experiences available to people who thrive is the first step toward ensuring adequate access to these experiences for all.

Schools, then, are only one of society's educative institutions. Although schools may be the most widely recognized of such institutions, a theory of education must encompass not just a theory of schooling but also a theory of the relation of various educative interactions and institutions with one another and to the members of the society at large. And a vision of educational equity must become a vision of providing access not just to schooling but also to these other resources.

=='''FUNDING'''==

Throughout the United States, wide performance gaps exist between poor and minority students and their peers in other groups. The inequities that result in those performance gaps carry enormous costs, not only for the children and families involved, but for the nation as a whole. The annual price tag of inadequately educating our young people is staggering, in the realm of $250 billion per year in health and welfare costs, criminal justice expenses, and lost tax revenues. The heavy toll on the social and civic fabric of the nation is an additional, inestimable price that we all pay every year.

If we are to meet the global economic challenges of an increasingly &quot;flat world,&quot; if we are to prepare our students to be capable civic participants in our democratic society, and if we are to fulfill the moral imperative of ensuring that a child's racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, or family background no longer predicts that child's educational attainment or level of achievement, we need a comprehensive approach to educational equity that attends to the full array of factors that affect educational opportunity.

Since late in the 20th century, there has been a burgeoning of initiatives, programs, projects, and activities that fall under the umbrella of what we are calling &quot;comprehensive educational equity&quot; by seeking to integrate education and supports and services in other areas that enhance students' abilities to succeed.   

A wide range of institutions, from federal and state governments to national and local foundations, to individual schools, carries out some type of &quot;comprehensive educational equity&quot; effort. The delivery models employed include community, full-service, and extended schools; comprehensive early childhood programs; school-linked services projects; school-community partnerships; private interagency commissions; family support and education programs; integrated-services initiatives; comprehensive community initiatives; and state programs and broad national legislation. 

Within these models, individual efforts have varying goals, rationales, methodologies, scopes, participants, scales, and time frames. The proliferation of these efforts provides a rich and complex field of study for potential models, best practices, and policy direction on which to build. Their many variations point to challenges for study, evaluation, and replication.

=='''CONCLUSION'''==
Equity in the class room is not an easy task, but a necessity.   As we continue to create equity in our classrooms were contributing and enhancing peoples lives.  We are better equipping students, parents, communities, America, and the World.  We must recognize what is going on with our students by communicating with them in order to make the right assessment.   We as educators must think outside the box.  Times are changing so the way we educate must change as well.

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Reader will understand the concept of equity and its role in the classroom.
&lt;li&gt; The Reader will be able to understand the influence of teachers' roles in the classroom.
&lt;li&gt;The Reader will be able to assess an inequitable situation and determine the best course of action. &lt;/ol&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;#C12869&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

It is the first day of class and you tell your students to divide up into groups and get to know their classmates.  You tell them they will be introducing each other to their classmates. You examine the steps they take to make a group and soon realize they have separated themselves based on gender and race. What steps do you take to prevent something like this from happening and to help your students become diverse within their classroom?

There are many challenges today that face equity in the classroom.  Gender, race, socioeconomic status, and learning style are just naming a few.  Even though this isn't an easy task to handle, there are ways to help control the situation at hand.  There are measures teachers can take to help with the equity in the classroom. Knowing how to handle different situations can help the student feel more at ease when they walk into the classroom.  We will discuss the difficulties and ways to help solve the problem of the classrooms, the main way being by teacher influence.

&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;A growing consensus is that the chorus of voices is calling 'in different words'for the same thing: 
# high, equitable expectations for all students, and 
# a new approach to improving student performance in school&quot; (Education Development Center).
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;#C12869&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;'''Defining Equity'''&lt;/font&gt; ==


According to Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, equity is defined as &quot;justice according to natural law or right; specifically : freedom from bias or favoritism.&quot; Also, according to &quot;An Equation for Equity,&quot; equity is &quot;the equal understanding and appreciation of the various cultures from which the students come (by both the students and the teachers), the development of knowledge within those cultural frameworks, and an understanding of mathematics within varying cultural frameworks. Achievement is, thus, a measure of the mastery of mathematics within the student's own culture and an understanding of mathematics within cultures outside of the student's culture.&quot;  Equity in schools is not meant to be defined as treating everyone the same, but rather making sure every mean possible of equality in the classroom is obtained (School Supervision, 1). No matter the teaching method, students should feel equal. Some examples listed have been retrieved from the Education Development Center article:

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;A sixth grade girl in an urban technical school feels pressure from her parents and teachers to excel in school. But when she does well, her peers call her a 'nerd'. She starts to participate less often in class discussions and doesn't study as much as she used to study.&quot;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;When two second grade girls want to join the football game at recess, the boys ignore them and
continue the game.&quot;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;A high school girl resists higher level math courses, saying she doesn't think she is smart enough
to master the material.&quot;&lt;/ol&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;#C12869&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;'''Teacher Influences'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

The amount of pressure on teachers is strong when it comes to equity.  Some key components that relate to equity in the classroom are forming the classroom for full participation, making sure all of the students are represented, acknowledging each students needs for learning and their expectations, and considering the perception of fairness ( School Supervision,1-2). These components help balance out the classroom.  Full participation in the classroom can be critical.  You want each student to feel as if their opinion counts fully and no question nor answer is stupid.  It can be a challenging task to attempt full class participation, but when creative ideas are implemented, it can work. There are different ways to ask questions. By using  declarative statements, it can help a student to understand the statement first. Also, asking authentic questions can help a student to participate, not a right or wrong answer. Letting a student explain their thoughts behind a question can help them to express themselves in a better way.  Some teachers use the &quot;card sort call on strategy.&quot; This involves students being able to pass the question to someone else, but having to try to answer the best they can and then passing it onto someone else with their hand raised who can add more of an explanation to the question asked. Mapping out lesson plans for each day can also contribute to the management of the class.  If the students know exactly what is being accomplished that day, it can help them to figure out what they need to work on.  Having clear expectations and reminders about what tasks need to be done can also help.  The physical layout can be appropriate too, because you can determine where each child needs to sit in conjunction with their learning abilities. Knowing each students strengths and weaknesses is one of the best assets a teacher can have.  Working individually can attribute to their learning abilities(School Supervision 2).

== &lt;font color=&quot;#C12869&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;'''Classroom Examples of Strategies'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

1. Learning Each Student's Name: This can help to enhance participation within the class, engage the students, help them interact, and attendance can rise because of the interaction. Some of the techniques are:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(a) in the beginning of the semester: divide the class into small groups using the list and balance out race and gender, each student must learn something else about each person in their group and when you bring them into a group discussion, have each person in the small group introduce one of their group members to the class. This will develop a sense of a fresh and comfortable atmosphere among the students. 
&lt;li&gt;(b) in the middle of the semester, set up appointments for conferences with each student, only about ten minutes each and discuss the progress of each student and let them tell you any concerns they have.  This can help them to feel more comfortable with the teacher and also less embarrassed in class.  They will have one on one time with the teacher. 
&lt;li&gt;(c) One of the most important strategies is remembering your student's name.  Helping to do this can help them feel more comfortable and at home and ease with the class and you, as the teacher (Faculty Development Program, 1).&lt;/ul&gt;

2. Creating a Safe Environment for Students: This ultimately results in a relaxed, comfortable, non-judgemental place for students. They can respond and react to material in their own ways, having student-centered learning. Some techniques are: (a) Teachers are advised to not answer their own questions, but instead have a discussion with your students about the question, this way they feel apart of the discussion and you are learning together. (b) group work and presentations can influence working together with classmates that are attached with clear guidelines and discussions, and (c) Some teachers say participation skills, such as listening skills, spoken contributions, and written material can help students respond in a reflective, and less pressured way. In all, having different aspects of participation will contribute to the dynamics of the classroom (Faculty Development Program, 1).

3. Being Conscious of Your Audience: It is imperative to accommodate your students needs, expectations, and levels of understanding. Following these strategies can help: being aware of assumptions you have about roles/responsibilities, exploring ways to communicate through visual activities, noticing the status, gender, public and private discussions you are having to avoid misunderstandings, and avoiding slang, jargon, and colloquial expressions.  Your expectations have to be clearly stated in the topic you are discussing (Faculty Development Program, 1).

== &lt;font color=&quot;#C12869&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Creating equity in the classroom is something we are always going to be improving upon.  There are many ways to help, but no real answers. Every teacher must do the strategy that works best for them.  Each school district is different and have to take different approaches to achieving equity. Even though there is not one set answer, there are many ways to contribute to the problem we are facing today in our schools.  Working together and understanding each other can greatly increase the effectiveness teachers has upon students.  Students feel more comfortable in a classroom setting knowing their questions will be answered and discussions will take place with the teacher interacting fully and not asking a simple right or wrong answer.  Students can engage more in daily discussions no matter what race or gender they may be.

='''Learning Targets'''=
*Students should be able to detect signs of Child abuse and child neglect in a classroom.
*Students will know the proper procedure of reporting suspicions of child abuse or nelgect.
*Students will know the 3 types of Child abuse and the statistics on all 3.

='''Introduction'''=
To a student a teacher can be seen as someone they can tell their deepest darkest secrets too. So what happens when a student tells a teacher some information that might suggest child abuse or neglect? Teachers need to know how to handle child abuse suspicions on the legal and ethical level and how to recognize it.
Definitions
The lines between child abuse and child neglect can get a little hazy sometimes. The Child Welfare Information Gateway has defined child abuse as 
&quot;Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk or serious harm&quot; ( Child Welfare Information Gateway,2008)

There are 3 different types of Child abuse; physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. The Child Welfare Information Gateway also defines the three types of abuse 
*Physical - &quot;is non-accidental physical injury as a result of punching, beating, kicking, biting, shaking, throwing, stabbing, choking, hitting, burning, or otherwise harming the child.&quot; (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2008)
*Emotional - &quot;pattern of behavior that impairs a child's development of sense of self-worth&quot; (Child Welfare Information Gateway,2008)
*Sexual - &quot;activities by a parent or caregiver such as fondling a child's genitals, penetration, incest, rape, sodomy, indecent exposure, and exploitation through prostitution or production of pornographic material&quot; ( Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2008)

Child abuse can be seen as causing immediate harm to the child.  While child neglect might not cause immediate harm to the child, over time, child neglect can cause physical and developmental harm. Child Neglect it defined as 

Child Neglect - &quot;the failure of a parent, guardian or other caregiver to provide for a child's basic needs.&quot; (Child Welfare Information Gateway,2008) Those needs can be put into four catergories: physical, medical, educational, and emotional.

='''Statistics'''=
A teacher needs to know the statistics of child abuse and neglect, once they know the numbers they will see how dyer the situation is and how important it is to know how to respond to child abuse and neglect.The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System is a federal organization that collects data and statistics on child abuse and neglect every year (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008). In the year 2006 there was an estimated 3.3 million cases and of those cases over half of them were reported by professionals, such as teachers (U.S Department of Health and Human Services, 2008) in the year 2006 the data showed
*	905,000 victims of Child abuse or neglect
*	51.5 % were girls an 48.2% were boys
*	48.8% were white,22.8% were African-America, and 18.4 were Hispanic
The data that was collected also showed the child neglect was more common than child abuse, in years past the NCANDs reported that child abuse was more prevalent that child neglect. In 2006 the data showed
*	64.1% were victims of neglect
*	16% were victims of physical abuse
*	8.8% were victims of sexual abuse
*	6.6% were victims of emotional abuse
='''Detecting Child Abuse or Neglect'''=
As teachers we spend an average of 7 hours, 5 days a week with our students. So besides their parents, we are the people that the children spent most of their time with, and this allows us to create a relationship of trust with our students. The relationship that is created is one that is so strong that a teacher will do anything to protect their students. So by knowing how to detect abuse and neglect, teachers are better prepared to protect their students. We also get to know our students behavioral patterns, and if changes occur. A dramatic change in behavior can be a warning sign of child abuse or neglect (Coleman).  According to Dr. Coleman, a child psychologist some other warning signs of child abuse or neglect both physical and emotional. They are as follows(Coleman).
*	Bruises, lumps, welts
*	Repeated broken bones
*	Burns
*	Shyness around adults
*	Is often absent
*	Frequent accidents-such as wetting their pants
*	Lack of concentration
*	Poor academic performance
*	High aggression
*	Early arrival to school and reluctance to leave 
*	Unsociable
When it comes to detecting the possibility of child neglect the warning signs can be a lot more apparent and can be easily seen by the outer appearance of the child. Some of the things to look for if a teacher suspects a child is being neglected are as follows (Duncan, 2001)
*	Child appears to be always hungry
*	Unorganized train of thought
*	Child appears to suffer from medical and dental neglect
*	Child comes to class in clothes that appear dirty and worn

='''Reporting Suspicions of Child Abuse or Neglect'''=
When teachers suspect child abuse or neglect they sometimes hesitate to report it, this may be because of a fear that the parents of the child may retaliate against the child, or they feel that even if it is reported nothing will be done. As teachers those we are mandated to report any suspicions of child abuse or neglect. This is stated in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act(CAPTA) if a teacher fails to report any suspicions they can face disciplinary action up to and including termination and criminal liabilities(Smith, 2007). 
When a teacher suspects that a child is being abused in most school the teacher will file a report for the principal once the report is filled it is normally given to the guidance counselor who will be the one to contact the local depart of Child Protective Services(CPS)(Citizens Information). The website also states that if a child confides in a child that the teacher should record the conversations. The teacher also needs to have the child's basic information such as; name , address, phone number, details about the suspected abuse, and information about the potential perpetrator(Duncan, 2001). 
The CPS will determine in the information is substantial enough for an investigation. The CPS will normally send the mandated reporter a letter, but a family's right to privacy is still of importance. So a mandated reporter might know that the CPS investigated but may not know the findings or results of the investigation (Duncan, 2001).
='''Conclusion'''=
So in conclusion teachers have not only a legal responsibility but an ethical responsibility to protect their students. Teachers should pay attention to students' behavior and create strong relationships with their students. If this happens, I feel that we will see a huge drop in numbers of children dying from child abuse and neglect. Every child deserves a happy and safe childhood and as educators we can help ensure that they are happy and healthy.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face=&quot;COURIER&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Educators must always be aware that they are held to a high standard for ethical and appropriate behavior in publicâand the public sphere now includes cyberspace.&quot; Laura Barrett&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face =&quot;COURIER&quot;&gt; LEARNING TARGETS &lt;/font&gt;==
*Understand the definitions of rights, responsibilities, and social media
*Recall examples of popular forms of social media
*List guidelines to follow when using social media
*Recognize the controversy with social media

==&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face =&quot;COURIER&quot;&gt; A LITTLE INSIGHT &lt;/font&gt;==

The ideas associated with the rights and responsibilities of teachers are very broad.  It could be argued that the definitive guidelines as to what constitutes teachersâ rights and responsibilities are extremely versatile, sometimes controversial, and constantly evolving to keep up with the pace of society and new technology.  One of the more recent facets of technology being enjoyed leisurely by a large percentage of the population, including teachers, is social media.  From social networking sites, to personal blogs and web sites, to video messaging, and texting, our lives have become an open book in a digital library.  In the world of education, what does this mean for educators?  In their spare time, can or should they participate in social media sites?  Exactly what is appropriate when teachers participate?  These questions require answers.  This article will elaborate on social media, and its widespread usage, while outlining simple rules that educators can adhere to when utilizing social media sites.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face =&quot;COURIER&quot;&gt; WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? &lt;/font&gt;==


The first step in examining teachersâ rights and responsibilities within the parameters of social media is to understand the meanings of certain key concepts.  Consider the following definitions of the words ârightâ and âresponsibilityâ, and the concept of âsocial mediaâ.

According to Merriam-Webster.com, the definition of the word ârightâ when used as a noun is:  âsomething to which one has a just claim: as a: the power or privilege to which one is justly entitledâ.  When used as an adverb the definition of ârightâ is:  âsomething that one may properly claim as dueâ (Merriam-Webster, 2009).  Rights can be defined by legal boundaries, implied based on ethical precedence, and formed from feelings of entitlement.

In contrast, Merriam-Webster.com, defines the word âresponsibilityâ as:  1: the quality or state of being responsible: as a: moral, legal, or mental accountability 2: something for which one is responsibleâ (Merriam-Webster, 2009).  Responsibility is the complete opposite of entitlement because it shifts the focus to an exterior cause and requires that there is âaccountabilityâ. 

Wikipedia defines the concept of social media as:  âprimarily Internet- and mobile-based tools for sharing and discussing information among human beings.  The term most often refers to activities that integrate technology, telecommunications and social interaction, and the construction of words, pictures, videos and audioâ (Wikipedia, 2009).  The phrase âonline social networkingâ has become synonymous with social media.  

Among some of the more recognized social media sites are Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Flickr, Youtube, Plaxo, and LinkedIn.  Each site features easy-to-use graphical interfacing software that allows users to build personal profiles that showcase their relationship statuses, schooling history, work history, social tendencies, and digital photographs to name just a few. These various options allow transparency to exist at its best for honest subscribers who aim to utilize the sites for their intended purposes.  On the other hand, the usage of social media raises several important questions like âjust how much transparency is neededâ, âdoes there exist an age when social media should no longer be usedâ, or âis there a profession that negates a personâs ârightâ to participate in social mediaâ?

==&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face =&quot;COURIER&quot;&gt; JUST HOW POPULAR IS SOCIAL MEDIA? &lt;/font&gt;==


The global Internet research firm, comScore, which monitors and gauges Internet traffic, released the following numbers reflecting the growth and popularity of some of the more frequented social media web sites.  According to these numbers, the popularity of social media is an increasing trend that is bound to intercept younger generations of teachers.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face =&quot;COURIER&quot;&gt; A CLOSER LOOK &lt;/font&gt;==

As veteran teachers retire and new graduates take theirs places, school systems can be sure that their new hires will have had experience with social media.  And a lot of these same new hires will insist upon retaining their memberships to certain sites. 

In an article entitled âI Gave Up Myspace for Lent:  New Teachers and Social Media Sitesâ, William Kist explained how he now interviews his pre-service teachers as to their participation in social media sites (Kist, 2008).  Kist stated (2008), âthe majority of his pre-service teachers are in their early to mid-20sâ and that âtheir responses to his social media inquiries could be grouped into âtwo major categories:  the benefits (and rights) of participating and ways of participating safelyâ (p. 246).  The pre-service teachers that remarked on the benefits and rights of participating in social media had no intentions of stopping.  They cited keeping in contact with friends and family as the most important benefit to social media, and they did not feel obligated to give up that ârightâ whatsoever (Kist, 2008).  On the other hand, some respondents cited that they would change their approach to social media by editing their user pages to reflect only certain content and images as a way of âparticipating safelyâ (Kist, 2008).  In essence, they would be more aware of what they posted and of what they made public in case students, parents, or administrators were to view their pages.  They argued, âItâs kind of like if a student called me on my cell phone.  I would be upset because that is my personal number, but I am not going to get rid of my cell phone because I am a teacherâ (Kist, 2008, p. 246).  

Recognizing that new educators will not easily, if at all, give up their rights to social media, what alternatives or advice can be given to them when trying to maintain a responsible image?  In an article entitled âNot Just âYour Spaceâ Educators Urged to be Careful on the Internetâ, Laura Barrett of the Massachusetts Teachers Association stated, âthat educators must always be aware that they are held to a high standard for ethical and appropriate behavior in publicâand the public sphere now includes cyberspaceâ (Barrett, 2007).  Barrett went on to explain that a fellow MTA member and new teacher suggested âI would tell them to imagine putting up your MySpace page on open house night and showing it to your parents.  Are you embarrassed? Think about that.  If a posting or image would make you uncomfortable, take it downâ (Barrett, 2007).  She explained, âTeachers need to do their homework tooâ. They should make sure the pages of their friends do not contain inappropriate images of them (Barrett, 2007).

==&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face =&quot;COURIER&quot;&gt; GUIDELINES:  THE SOCIAL MEDIA PASSPORT FOR TEACHERS &lt;/font&gt;==

Barrett (2007) listed the Massachusetts Teachers Association advisory guidelines for teachers when using social networking sites.  They included:

1.  Teachers should not use instant messaging as a means of communicating with students. IM lacks the safeguards of ordinary communication between teacher and student.

2.  E-mail communication with students after school should be kept to a minimum and should focus on immediate class-related matters.

3.  Always think and write like a teacher. Use your &quot;teacher's voice.&quot;  Use spell-checking software. Be professional, and be appropriate.

4.  Think of an e-mail message as if it is on official school stationery.  E-mail to students or to parents is never a private communication.

5.  If you use the school district's server to access the Internet, do not assume that you have an &quot;expectation of privacy&quot; in your online activities.  This is true whether you access the server at school using a school computer or access it from home using your personal computer.

6.  Your school computer and your school district's server have the capacity to track your Internet activitiesâ your &quot;Web tracks&quot; reveal where you have gone and when you went there.  (p. 11)

When trying to adhere to these ideas, many additional co-factors must be considered.  These include:  studentsâ rights, administratorsâ rights, parentsâ and guardiansâ rights, and state and local laws.  It is important to recognize that laws will greatly vary from state-to-state and even county-to-county.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#15317E&quot; face =&quot;COURIER&quot;&gt; CONCLUSION &lt;/font&gt;==


Social media is a technological phenomenon that I do not foresee dying down any time soon.  In my opinion, educators must learn to carefully balance their rights and desires to be social media users with their responsibilities to the communities, and especially, the students they serve.  School districts should diligently work to adopt policies that will allow teachers to exercise their First Amendment right to free speech (social media) while maintaining their responsibility to professionalism and credibility.  In the words of Edison Haines, âWith every civil right there has to be a corresponding civil obligationâ, and this holds true in the case of educators versus social media.

&lt;big&gt;'' &quot;The vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.&quot; &lt;small&gt;Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1960)&lt;/small&gt; ''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;










Lawsuits have become increasingly common in our society and many Americans act and speak out of the fear of being taken to court. In any environment, one must be conscious of how their words and actions will affect others. A thoughtless statement or inappropriate physical contact might land you in court. This is especially true in schools, where daily contact, high emotions and stressful circumstances can all come together at the wrong moment. As such, it is good to understand the rights of students trying to express themselves and the rights of teachers trying to keep a safe, orderly learning environment. Few people know their constitutional rights, and even fewer teachers &amp; students know how their constitutional rights change once they enter the &quot;semi-public/semi-private&quot; classroom. 

This paper will examine some of the rights guaranteed to all Americans and how those rights change once they enter school. It will also seek to answer some of the most common questions held by students. What is free speech? Is it protected in school? How safe am I in my possessions? Do I have any expectation of privacy when it comes to my things? A good understanding of students' rights benefits everyone: the students who exercise them, the teachers who challenge them, and the democratic society which lives by them.

== Learning Targets ==

By the conclusion of this article, readers should be able to:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;	identify and understand the basic philosophy of the courts when determining the extent of student's rights
&lt;li&gt;	recognize similarities and differences between Constitutional rights held in school and life out side it.
&lt;li&gt;	recognize the major court case which set the groundwork for all future Supreme Court cases involving student's rights
&lt;li&gt;	make informed decisions in real-life situations based on the knowledge presented here
&lt;li&gt;	inform colleagues and students of the information contained in this article &lt;/ol&gt;


== '''Students Rights''' ==

The founding fathers deliberated for days on end when writing the first draft of our nation's Constitution and later the Bill of Rights. They agonized over wording; argued over semantics. It is likely they had no idea just how successful this &quot;great experiment in democracy&quot; would turn out to be. Equally likely is this: they never once considered how these rights would pertain to young students in the classroom. The landmark case of ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District Tinker v. Des Moines School District]'' clearly defined the benchmark for how rights may be exercised and when they may be curtailed: 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #8B0000;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

* It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. 

* On the other hand, the Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.

 &lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &quot;Our problem lies in the area where students in the exercise of [their] rights collide with the rules of the school authorities.&quot; &lt;/font color&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

In other words, one doesn't surrender his or her constitutional rights by attending school. However the courts have recognized that the unique nature of the school environment requires that certain liberties be suppressed in the interest of maintaining a safe, orderly learning environment. According to the doctrine of &quot;in loco parentis&quot; school officials are more than government officials; they are, in a legal sense, the temporary parents of their students. Just what exactly that allows them to do and say is a matter of debate and has led to numerous legal challenges, many involving the Supreme Court. This paper will examine some of those court decisions and explore their impact on student's rights.


'''Summary''' : The balancing act between the free expression of rights and the desire to maintain order in school serves as a good example of the struggle faced by our democratic society.

== The 1st Amendment  ==
''Freedom of Speech, Expression &amp; Religion''

Perhaps the most quoted court decision on the subject, ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District Tinker v. Des Moines]'' was a battle over students' 1st amendment rights, specifically the right to free speech. High school students John Tinker, 15, and Christopher Eckhardt, 16, decided to show their opposition to the Vietnam War by wearing black armbands to school. Administrators countered by banning armbands and threatened disciplinary actions for any students violating the rule. Tinker and Eckhardt wore their armbands and were suspended, not allowed back until they agreed to stop violating school rules. Tinker's father subsequently sued and lost in District Court. The Appellate Court was unable to reach a decision and the case was passed up to the Supreme Court, who overturned the District Court's decision and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The court stated that if the student's actions did not disrupt the learning environment, or advocate or cause harm to themselves or others, it was permissible. This has been the rationale in virtually every other opinion held by the court regarding student's constitutional rights.

While a student's right to free speech is protected, it is not a blanket protection covering any form of protest. A recent example of this is ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_v._Frederick Morse v. Frederick]'', also known as the &quot;Bong Hits 4 Jesus&quot;case. This case is particularly eye-opening in that the offense occurred off school grounds. Frederick, a high school student, displayed a banner at a local parade featuring the phrase &quot;Bong Hits 4 Jesus&quot;, a reference to marijuana use.  Morse, a school official, noticed the banner and instructed the student to take it down. When Frederick refused, he was suspended by Morse and the decision was upheld by the school board. Frederick sued, claiming protection under his 1st amendment rights. This time the Supreme Court sided with the school board, noting &quot;schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use, [therefore] the school officials in this case did not violate the First Amendment&quot;. This fits with the consistent message of the courts &quot;a student's Constitutional rights will be protected only as long as their exercise does not endanger the health or academic progress of others&quot;.

Other cases regarding the Rights of Free Speech &amp; Expression:

''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_v._Barnette West Virginia v. Barnette]'', 1943 : The court ruled that is unconstitutional to require students to salute the American flag. The 1st amendment not only protects freedom &quot;of&quot; expression but also freedom &quot;from&quot; expression. 

''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethel_School_District_v._Fraser Bethel School District v. Fraser]'', 1986  : Washington high school student Matthew Fraser was suspended for using sexually explicit language in a speech given on school grounds. The court sided with the school, affirming that schools can prohibit &quot;lewd, indecent or plainly offensive&quot; language.

''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guiles_v._Marineau Guiles v. Marineau]'', 2004 : A 14-year old student in Vermont was suspended for repeatedly wearing a T-shirt depicting President George W Bush as an alcoholic and a cocaine addict. The shirt contained both written and visual depictions of banned substances. The court sided with the student, citing two factors: 1) the shirt did not advocate the use of illegal drugs and 2) the shirt did not cause significant disruptions to the learning environment.


'''Summary''' : A student's exercise of speech or expression is legal and constitutionally protected so long as it doesn't:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;	endanger the public
&lt;li&gt;	disrupt the learning environment
&lt;li&gt;	advocate the use of illegal substances or other violations of the law &lt;/ol&gt;

== 4th Amendment ==
''Unreasonable Search &amp; Seizure''

The student's desire for freedom of speech can only be matched by their desire for privacy and for security of their possessions. The right of school officials to search a student's belongings is a contentious issue, and few teachers know the limits of their authority and few students understand the extent of their rights. Just as Tinker v. Des Moines set the standard for the protection of 1st Amendment rights, so did another case set the precedent for search &amp; seizure: ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_v._T._L._O. New Jersey v. T. L. O.]'', 469 U.S. 325 (1985).

Two female high school students were caught smoking in the restroom and assistant principal Theodore Choplick confronted them. One of the two admitted her wrongdoing but the other student (T.L.O.) denied it. Choplick searched T.L.O.'s purse and discovered cigarettes, drugs and drug paraphernalia, along with a large amount of money. T.L.O. was tried and convicted in court on charges of delinquency. The student countered that the school had violated her 4th amendment rights, depriving her of protection against unreasonable search and seizure (i.e. searching without a warrant) and the evidence should be inadmissible. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating: &quot;a school official may properly conduct a search of a student's person if the official has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or reasonable cause to believe that the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce school policies.&quot; 

This is a departure from the court's usual position requiring &quot;probable cause&quot; for government officials to search someone without a warrant. This change, although appearing slight, has enormous ramifications. School officials may search someone based solely upon a well-grounded suspicion, not iron-clad evidence of wrongdoing. This is analogous to the difference between &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; and &quot;beyond a shadow of a doubt&quot;. This threshold however applies only to school personnel and NOT to law enforcement officials on school grounds. The court has been careful not to slide down that slippery slope. In the court's decision, they state that a teacher's right to protect him- or herself and the safety of their students is on par with the rights of firefighters, EMS, OSHA officials, etc. The right to privacy must be balanced against the public's right to safety. In a school, the balance is tilted toward protecting safety and maintaining order, even if it is at the expense of student rights.

The issue of locker searches has not come to the Supreme Court. As the locker is school property and therefore &quot;public space&quot; it is not afforded the same protections as a student's personal possessions. 

''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=ia&amp;vol=sc\20030716\02-0505&amp;invol=1 State of Iowa v. Marzel Jones]'' (2003) - A student whose locker was cleaned out by school personnel. Finding a small amount of marijuana, the student was charged. Marzel claimed 4th amendment protection against unreasonable search &amp; seizure but was denied by the State Supreme Court whonoted that the search occurred on school grounds, &quot;where the State is responsible for maintaining discipline, health, and safety.&quot; ((Bd. of Ed. of Indep. Sch. Dist. 92 v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822)

Another issue of concern has been the constitutionality of drug screenings for student-athletes.

''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernonia_School_District_47J_v._Acton Vernonia School District v. Acton]'' (1995) : 7th grade Oregon student James Acton signed up to play football but refused to take a mandatory urine test. Drug testing was administered to athletes after a recent &quot;explosion&quot; in drug-use and the related discipline problems which arose. Citing public health concerns and noting the prevalence of student-athletes involved in drug-related incidents, the school board deemed urinalysis a necessary requirement for participation in sports. The Supreme Court agreed and upheld their decision. Once again, the desire to protect public health overrode student's desire for privacy.


'''Summary''' : School personnel may search a student and their belongings if the health &amp; welfare of the public is at risk or they have a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed 

== 5th &amp; 14th Amendment ==
''The Right to Due Process''

These amendments protect an individual's right to a fair trial and must be considered whenever &quot;a person's good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him...&quot; (Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 1971). This includes the enforcement of disciplinary actions such as suspension or expulsion. The expectations of a fair trial are very different however, depending on the circumstances. Disciplinary expulsion is treated differently than an &quot;academic dismissal.&quot; Claire La Roche makes the point by citing Barnard v. Inhabitants of Shelburne: &quot;Misconduct is a very different matter from failure to attain a standard of excellence in studies.... A public hearing may be regarded as helpful to the ascertainment of misconduct and useless or harmful in finding out the truth as to scholarship.&quot; (emphasis added)

According to La Roche's interpretation of the courts, the following are necessary in the expulsion of a student on disciplinary grounds: &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;	a timely &amp; formal hearing
&lt;li&gt;	a detailed explanation of the charges
&lt;li&gt;	a strict adherence to the schools stated policy
&lt;li&gt;	a punishment that fits the crime &lt;/ol&gt;

She goes on: &quot;To ensure fundamental fairness, decisions must be based on the facts and supported by the evidence. Moreover, punishment should be commensurate with the severity of the offense. Consequently, it is important for schools to establish guidelines and be consistent with sanctions.&quot;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FCDFFF;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''How are college students affected by these decisions?'''&lt;/big&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Since 1970, officers on the Seattle campus have regularly patrolled the hallways of dormitories of the University of Washington.&quot; 
&lt;li&gt; &quot;[T]he state's Court of Appeals ruled that students have the same right to privacy in dormitory hallways as they do in their rooms.&quot; 
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Therefore ... campus police officers lack the legal authority to randomly patrol residence halls.&quot; 
&lt;/ul&gt;
&quot;Although the closely watched ruling bears on only one state, it reveals the tension between privacy and security in dormitories everywhere. '''Residence halls are legally complex spaces''', where crime often creeps in and where residents, perhaps more than ever, expect administrators and police officers to ensure their safety.&quot;

Hoover, Eric. (July, 2008). ''Police in the Dorms: Student Safety or Privacy Infringement?'' Chronicle of Higher Education, v54 n46 pA15. [http://eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=ERICSearchResult&amp;newSearch=true&amp;ERICExtSearch_Descriptor=%22Student+Rights%22 (link)]

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This matter has come before the Supreme Court as well, who ruled that the rights of due process vary depending on the reason for expulsion. An academic dismissal does not have the same requirements as the stricter guidelines set down for a disciplinary expulsion. This is illustrated by the case of University of Missouri v. Horowitz (1977). A student was expelled for poor academics and lack of good hygiene after being notified in writing and in person. The student countered with the fact that she had never been given a hearing to dispute the charges. The Supreme Court denied her appeal. As La Roche reiterates, &quot;Ultimately, the Supreme Court of the United States held that procedural due process did not require a formal hearing when the school dismisses a student for academic reasons&quot;.


'''Summary''' : Students are guaranteed the right to a fair trial and due process, although their rights are dependent upon the nature of their dismissal.

== Other Miscellaneous Cases ==

The following are other judgements handed down by the Supreme Court:

-	'''School uniforms''' and '''dress codes''' are intended to stop disruptions to the learning process by banning lewd, obscene or offensive clothing. As such, the courts have ruled them constitutional despite students pleading for &quot;the freedom of expression&quot; and the lesser-known &quot;freedom to see skin.&quot;

-	'''Corporal punishment''' (physically disciplining a student) barely passed a constitutional challenge in 1977 with a divided court ruling 5-4 that it is neither &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; nor a denial of due process. (''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingraham_v._Wright Ingraham v. Wright]'', 430 U.S. 651)

-	The '''censorship''' of school newspapers was upheld with the understanding that the school is not a &quot;forum of public expression&quot;. Further, the justices declared that a school &quot;need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its basic educational mission.&quot; (''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazelwood_v._Kuhlmeier Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]'', 484 U.S. 260 [1988]) 

== Conclusion ==
The Supreme Court has changed greatly through the years, sometimes leaning left, sometimes right. Throughout it all, it has remained remarkably consistent on the issue of student's constitutional rights in school. In summary, the opinion held by the court might best be summarized by the following:  [http://www.wicca.com/celtic/wicca/rede.htm &quot;An ye harm none, do what ye will.&quot;]If a student's speech or actions do not cause physical, emotional or academic harm to others, they will receive the fullest protection offered by the Constitution. By extending these rights to students, teachers offer them the greatest benefit of our democracy and in doing so, invite them to become full members of society.

== Author Response ==

Hello! This article was originally going to be written about &quot;Students' Rights &amp; Responsibilities&quot; but I chose to focus solely on the legal aspect for several reasons, but mainly because its so important. Lawsuits are a real possibility and knowing your rights as teachers, and the students rights as well, can only be a good thing. I think the deserves its own article so more information can be presented on the topic. I certainly learned a lot by writing this. The knowledge I gained has made me more confident in what I can and cannot do in my role as a teacher. While the risk of a lawsuit is still there (and very likely always will be) having a good understanding of teacher's and student's rights has made me more relaxed in the hallways where discipline is the number-one concern.
I hope you found this article as helpful as I did.

== &lt;font color=00CCCC&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;''' &lt;center&gt;The United States of America prides itself on the ability to grant rights and responsibilities to United States' Citizens. Not many nations in the world have a document like the Constitution. We are lucky to have a well organized system. Within that system there are certain rights and responsibilities that are to be upheld. The Bill of Rights is the first Ten Amendments to the Constitution. These rights correspond to many aspects of life. This article with discuss the how the Bill of Rights and other Amendments are concerned with school issues and students' rights and responsibilities. As well as addressing certain court cases that relate to those amendments.&lt;/center&gt;'''

== &lt;font color=00CCCC&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Amendments'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;'''Here are certain amendments that deal with aspects of students rights and issues dealt with in schools.'''

'''First Amendment:''' &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances (Wikipedia, 2009).&quot;

'''Fourth Amendment:''' &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized (Wikipedia, 2009 &amp; Hardin, 1996).&quot;

'''Eighth Amendment:''' &quot;Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted (Wikipedia, 2009 &amp; Hardin, 1996).&quot;

'''Ninth Amendment:''' &quot;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people (Wikipedia, 2009 &amp; Hardin, 1996).&quot;

'''Fourteenth Amendment:''' &quot;'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws (Wikipedia, 2009 &amp; Hardin, 1996).&quot;

== &lt;font color=00CCCC&gt; &lt;big&gt;'''Supreme Court Cases'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;'''Within each amendment certain elements of it have been brought up in court. Over the years many Supreme Court Cases have addressed many issues of students' rights. Here are some examples that have been taken to court concerning the First and Fourth Amendments.'''

=== &lt;font color=00CCCC&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;First Amendment Cases&lt;/u&gt;:''' ===
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;The First Amendment has many clauses and elements to it; freedom of religion, of speech, of press, of assembly, and of petition. Below are a couple Supreme Court cases that were decided under the freedoms of the First Amendment.

==== &lt;font color=00000&gt;Establishment of Religion/Free Exercise Clause ====
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #00CCCC;border: solid 5px #3300CC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''&quot;Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country. Amen.&quot;''' (Wikipedia, 2009)

&lt;font color=000000&gt;The prayer that was said that was in question in the Engel v. Vitale case.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;In this clause it is stated that there will be no established religion in the United States. It presents the commonly known subject of separation of church and state. Everyone will be able to exercise whichever religion they may choose.

A case that questioned whether or not public schools should have prayer in school was the 1962 case, '''Engel v. Vitale''' (Hardin, 1996). In this case it was a question of the determination of if it was &quot;unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and require its recitation in public schools (Wikipedia, 2009).&quot; The plaintiffs said that the prayer compromised their religious beliefs. The decision said that it was in fact unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause (Wikipedia, 2009). Therefore, it is a student's right to not participate in prayer in school if their religious beliefs do not correspond. But for the most part, prayer in public schooling is pretty extinct.




==== &lt;font color=00000&gt;Freedom of Speech Clause ====
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;This clause addresses many issues with the freedom of speech. By &quot;speech&quot; it means not only vocal speaking but symbolism as well. Freedom of speech means you can express your opinion in everyday speech, the way you dress, your everyday hobbies, and so on.

A case that was landmark that deals with freedom of speech was the 1969 case, '''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District''' (Hardin, 1996). In December of 1965, adults and students decided to wear black armbands during the holiday season and were to fast on December 16 and New Year's Eve to demonstrate their opposition to the United States involvement in Vietnam (Tinker v. Des Moines). Des Moines, Iowa principals decided to ban the armbands and would suspend any students who wore them to school. The issue at hand was whether or not the wearing of the black armband as a political protest as a form of freedom of speech was violated when school officials banned them (Tinker v. Des Moines). The decision made said that it was a violation of their freedom of speech because it was a &quot;symbolic act and therefore a form of 'pure speech'&quot;(Tinker v. Desmoines). This precedent is still in effect in today's schools.

==== &lt;font color=00000&gt;Summary ====
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;All in all, there are many Supreme Court cases that are affiliated with the First Amendment that deal with students' right. Many aspects of the Amendment are protected and students should know their rights.

=== &lt;font color=00CCCC&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Fourth Amendment Cases&lt;/u&gt;:''' ===
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;The right to privacy is a major right in our nation. No one wants to be spied on or searched at any given time, it would be very invasion. It is second nature to citizen's to protect their belongings. Here is a case that was very big dealing with search and seizure.

==== &lt;font color=00000&gt;Freedom from Unreasonable Search and Seizure Clause ====
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;On school grounds many issues concerning search and seizure come into question. Many students think that, although they are on school grounds, they will not get in trouble if something is found in their possession if they did not give consent for the search. This case proves this reasoning wrong.

In the 1985 case, '''New Jersey v. T.L.O.''' the question of under what circumstances can a school official search a student's belongings came into question (Hardin, 1996). A female student (TLO) was caught smoking in the bathroom and was sent to the Vice Principal's office. T.L.O. then proceeded to say that she was not smoking and said she didn't smoke at all. The Vice Principal then searched her purse and found cigarettes and rolling papers (New Jersey v. T.L.O.). After finding this evidence, the Vice Principal then searched the purse more &quot;thoroughly and found some marijuana, a pipe, plastic bags, a fairly substantial amount of money, an index card containing a list of students who owed T.L.O. money, and two letters that implicated her in marijuana dealing&quot; (New Jersey v. T.L.O.). T.L.O. said that her Fourth Amendment rights under unreasonable search and seizure were violated. 

Issues: 
(1) Does the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures apply to searches conducted by school officials? 
(2) If so how far does that Fourth Amendment protection extend? 

Decision: 
Yes, the Fourth Amendment applies but the protection does not extend very far. The U.S. Supreme Court stated that the standard needed to justify such searches is reasonable suspicion, not probable cause. Reasonable suspicion was defined by the Court as reasonable suspicion that a search will reveal evidence that the student violated the law or school rules. (New Jersey v. T.L.O.)

==== &lt;font color=00000&gt;Summary ====
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;It is evident that there are rights to privacy for students, but they do not extend too far. It is important for students and teachers to know these rights because they need to know if they are being violated or violating.

=== &lt;font color=00CCCC&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Other Cases&lt;/u&gt;:''' ===
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;I have just offered a little insight to the array of cases that address school issues and students' rights. Here is a link to an article that offers many other case studies to research and read. 
http://www.fleurdelis.com/lre/conright.htm

== &lt;font color=00CCCC&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
&lt;font color=3300CC&gt;'''After researching and reading the rules and regulations I am very much more aware of students' rights in the United States. I believe all of the rights presented are very reasonable and appropriate. It is good to see how our United States Constitution is flexible in its meanings and meets issues regarding the schools and its students. I hope that you are more informed and see how the Bill of Rights and other Amendments correspond to the rights of students. It is very important for future teachers to know the rights of students, so that they will never violate them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''What does it mean to be an ethical teacher?'''

By: T. Burrell


===Introduction===


----



âIn teaching, as in life more generally, core principles relating to virtues such as honesty, justice, fairness, care, empathy, integrity, courage, respect and responsibility should guide conduct and interpersonal relationsâ (Campbell, 2006, p.32).  These virtues are a good description of what an ethical teacher should be, but the use of these virtues can be a difficult task when a teacher is faced with so many unpredictable situations in the classroom and in the school system.  The teacherâs knowledge of what ethics is and the practice of it, will aid the teacher in making the best decision when ethical predicaments arise in their daily teaching lives.





===Knowledge===

----




Ethical knowledge is an intrinsic feature of awareness between moral and ethical principles.  A teacherâs possession of these principles will allow teachers to display moral and ethical values, which includes a sense of right and wrong, treating others with respect, being objective, patient and compassionate.  Embodying ethical knowledge gives the teacher the ability to practice their teaching skills with morals and ethics and not just viewing their job as being teaching only.  It goes beyond the curriculum, assessment and technical conditions of the profession.  The practicing of ethical knowledge by the teacher can be modeled by returning graded papers to the student in a timely manner, by being sensitive to the use of classroom materials that may offend some students, using precaution when displaying a studentâs work or by selecting student achievement without bias.  The use of ethical knowledge by a teacher can be expressed by the way a teacher projects the tone of his/her voice towards the student, by avoiding student embarrassment and by reminding students of how their behavior can affect other classmates.  There are many ways to show how a teacher can demonstrate their ethical knowledge, but a teacher can only do but so much to implement moral and ethical behavior on a daily basis.  As we may know, teaching can be a very demanding profession, with moments of chaos, frustration and unexpected events of the day.  This tells us that a teacherâs reaction to these situations cannot be choreographed and why the practice of ethical knowledge can help teachers become aware of their âethicalâ behavior when such events occur (Campbell).





===Personal===

----




The personal ethics for each individual teacher varies according to the teacherâs belief of what is ethical.  Each teacher may believe that their interpretation of ethics is being practiced in their behavior and in their personal lives and if this is true, then he/she is demonstrating âethical principlesâ and âvirtuesâ of a âmoral personâ and a âmoral professional (Covaleskie,2005,p. 134).â  By demonstrating the characteristics of ethics and virtue in the classroom with the use of actions, attitudes and words will make a positive impact on the many students that the teacher will come into contact with throughout their teaching career.  This demonstration of ethics will also let the student know, âthat if I respect you, then you can respect meâ (Campbell). 





===Classroom===

----



Classroom ethics involve issues the teacher comes into contact with on daily basis concerning their students within the classroom.  A teacher is placed in the position of deciding what is the ethical thing to do when issues such as student consideration, content coverage and assessment arises.  The assessment issue or better âknown as gradingâ should have âfair standardsâ that shows the studentâs knowledge of the curricula.  The teacher has to decide what impact the grade given, will have on the studentâs future career choices, the schoolâs reputation and the parents of the student.  The teacher also has to decide the best way to explain to a student why they received an unsatisfactory grade on a specific assignment.  The explanation may not be an easy one, but it is only to help improve the studentâs academic performance.  The content the teacher brings into the classroom questions the teacherâs ethics of what âsubject matterâ they want to include in their instructions.  The teacher has to decide whether there will be enough time to cover each skill of the content area and if there is, âShould some critical thinking skills be included even though my school does not require its coverage?  Or, should I just leave out the difficult parts of the course content, even though the students will need it (Kienzler)?â The teacher also has to decide which actions to take, especially when considering the emotional needs of the student.  Content of a subject matter that is being discussed in the classroom may reflect upon the home-life of a student whose mother and father maybe going through a divorce or the loss of a parent.  How does a teacher deal with these issues in the classroom?  And how certain subject matter is taught?  Each of these questions requires âthat one is not only doing the right thing, but doing it in the right way, at the right time and for the right reasonsâ (Covaleskie, 2005, p.134).




===School===

----



The ethics of the school may not agree with the ethics of a teacher.  A teacher may be faced with numerous moral problems when it concerns the schoolâs leadership practice of disciplining students.  The teacher may question the reason behind the discipline and whether or not it will deter or increase future student behavior (Colnerud,2006,p.378).  Ethical tensions do exist within schools among individual teachers (Allison,2003,p.124).   A teacher may see a colleague mistreating a student and try to make a decision of whether or not to intervene in the situation.  âThe teacher cannot bring himself/herself to intervene; the teacher says that fear is the reason for their silence and that intervening is considered to be a breach of loyalty (Colnerud, 2006, p.378).â  This is a clear example of what teachers deal with on a daily basis in relation to the ethics of their colleagues.

''The National Education Association's preamble for its code of ethics.''
&quot;The Educator, believing in the worth and dignity of each human being, recognizes the supreme importance of the pursuit of truth, devotion to excellence and nurture of the democratic principles.  Essential to these goals is the protection of freedom to learn and to teach and the guarantee of equal educational opportunity for all.  The educatior accepts the responsibility to adhere to the highest ethical standards.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




===Dilemmas===


----



Teachers encounter ethical dilemmas throughout their teaching careers.   This brings up the question, âHow do teachers deal with deciding what is the right or wrong thing to do when such dilemmas arise?â  When a teacher is faced with ethical and moral dilemmas concerning their students and profession, they use specific codes of ethics written by many educational organizations to help them make ethical decisions.  Teachers do need a guide when they are faced with the decisions of what to do if a child has a learning disability, what content matter should be taught, what should be done in defense of a student and a number of other events that will require ethical decisions.  The National Education Association (NEA) has created a code of ethics for the different occupational needs of the teaching profession.  The NEA created their code of ethics in 1975, which is divided into two sections.  The first section lists eight ethical commitments the teacher has to the student and the second section also lists eight ethical commitments the teacher has to his/her profession(Brady, Buchotz and Keller).  


===National Education Association Ethics Indicators for Educators:===



===Commitment to the Student===

----

Restraint of individual action and pursuit of learning

Access to varying points of view

Do not distort subject matter

Protect students from harm

Do not embarrass or disparage

Do not discriminate

Do not use professional relationship for private advantage

Do not disclose confidential information




	
===Commitment to the Profession===

----

Do not make false statements in application of a position

Do not misrepresent qualifications

Do not assist someone unqualified gain entry into the profession

Do not make false statements concerning a candidateâs qualifications

Do not assist a noneducator in the unauthorized practice of teaching

Do not disclose personal information about a colleague unless required by law

Do not knowingly make false statements about a colleague

Do not accept any gift or favor that might influence professional decisions






===Conclusion===



Possessing what is takes to be an ethical teacher can be a difficult task for many teachers, especially when he/she encounters unsuspecting events on a daily basis that will require an ethical decision, which may not be the exact right answer.  Hopefully, it will be the ethical answer. This decision making is a great responsibility placed on the teacher, no matter how long one has been in the profession.  One can only hope that the years or months of teaching has taught you enough to know what to do when ethical dilemmas occur in the classroom or within the school system.

*1.  Readers will be able to understand the definition of ethics.

*2.  Readers will understand the qualities of an ethical teacher and be able to examine their own classroom (or future classroom)and decide if they are &quot;ethical teachers&quot;.
 







&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the definition of ethics is the discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation or  a set of moral principles : a theory or system of moral values (Merriam Webster Online Dictionary, 2009). Teachers everyday must deal with what is good and bad in the classroom. They have to make the call on their own everyday and they hold the children's wellbeings in their hands. Teachers decide on a daily basis what they will allow in their classroom and what they will not. 


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Ethics in The Classroom'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) '''code of ethical conduct''' gives teachers guidelines for the classroom. 

'''â¢ Appreciate childhood as a unique and valuable stage of the human life cycle.'''

'''â¢ Base our work on knowledge of how children develop and learn.'''

'''â¢ Appreciate and support the bond between the child and family.'''

'''â¢ Recognize that children are best understood and supported in the context of family, culture, community, and society.'''

'''â¢ Respect the dignity, worth, and uniqueness of each individual (child, family member, and colleague).'''

'''â¢ Respect diversity in children, families, and colleagues.'''

'''â¢ Recognize that children and adults achieve their full potential in the context of relationships that are based on trust and respect.'''

(NAEYC, 2005)


Eventhough NAEYC's code is aimed toward early childhood education, the principles are universal and apply to public school teachers.

&quot;Good teaching involves enriching, not impoverishing, students' understandings of self, others, and the world. It means expanding, not contracting, students' knowledge, insights, and interests. It means deepening, not rendering more shallow, students' ways of thinking and feeling. And it entails paying intellectual and moral attention as a teacher(Hansen,2001).&quot; 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''What An Ethical Teacher Looks like'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

A ethical teacher is fair, they use the same standards for every child and they are not bias. Being a teacher is a job but being a ethical teacher is a duty. Teachers not only must be ethical in the way they treat the children in their class, but in the way they grade and what they teach. In my opinion EVERY child deserves our BEST. A passion for teaching is an essential part of being an ethical teacher. An ethical teacher will strive to better themselves in any way so that they can impart that knowledge onto their students. 




&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Problems and Issues A Teacher Might Face'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Teachers face many tough ethical dilemmas and circumstances where an individualâs own moral code is contested by that of colleagues, administrators, the school community, and the union to name a few (Scheopner, 2005). Teachers will face many different types of problems and issues throughout the course of their work. Having a code by which you work will help you when you have an issue that your not sure how to handle. Handling behavior problems in an ethical way can be one of the most touchy issues. Problem behaviors come in a variety of forms and no matter what the issue, know how you are going to handle it(Richert, 2009). I know that as for myself being a assistant Kindergarten teacher problems can arise in the blink of an eye. Not knowing how to handle problems is usually the most frustrating part.


&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Final thoughts'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

In conclusion as a teacher, you must decide what is right for your classroom. Having a set of guidelines to look back to in times of trouble is always a good idea, but essentially it is up to you as the teacher and head of the class to make the right decision. Teachers are going to face many problems and probably never the same one. ALWAYS remember that anyone can be a teacher but only someone committed to what they do can TEACH. The most important of being a teacher is being an ethical one!

==Introduction==

While parents are their childrenâs first and most important teachers, as children enter school, teachers join in the process of shaping childrenâs minds, attitudes, and behaviors (Brannon, 2008). Children, after all, spend a huge chunk of time in school, away from their parents and guardians and in close proximity of their teachers and fellow students. Shouldnât it seem obvious then that teachers have a role in contributing to the ethical teaching of todayâs students?  In this article I will explain the different thoughts and ideas of incorporating ethics education in classrooms, and programs that are happening now to teach ethics in schools.

==Character Educationâ¦A new term for ethics?==

What does ethics education mean? In a survey, when asked this question, the majority of teachers said, âcharacter educationâ (Zubay, 2007). So, what is character education? The results of Zubayâs surveys show that character education and ethics education are used interchangeably in the context of solving social conflicts over issues such as bullying, diversity, and sexuality (Zubay, 2007).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#7F4E52&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;âThroughout history and in cultures around the world, education rightly conceived has had two great goals: helping students become smart and helping them become good. They need character for bothâ (Davidson, M., Lickona, T., Khmelkov, V., 2007, p.30).
.&lt;/big&gt;
|}


When exploring character education it should be noted which personal qualities are involved. The âsix pillars of characterâ are trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship (Zubay, 2007). Character education doesnât just produce an honest and kind child; it can also produce a child who wants to work hard and do his or her best (Davidson, M. ''et al.'', 2007).The âsix pillarsâ are qualities that teachers can exhibit themselves and incorporate in their curriculum as well. Teaching itself is considered a moral responsibility and thus can have a direct impact on the attitudes, behaviors, and achievements of students (Falkenberg, 2007).

==Approaches to Teaching Ethics/Character Education== 

In the school setting, teachers have the most influence on a studentâs ethical learning (Zubay, 2007). It is teachers who are around the student during most of the day and have to deal with issues that come up with the students and among the students, thus lending them to more opportunities to teach ethics. How schools are incorporating ethics in their curriculums can be broken down into two categories: informal and formal programs. Informal programs include no formal statement as to how ethics education should be implemented; it is left up to the individual teachers to fit ethics education into the curriculum, whereas a formal program would include a definitive, age-appropriate curriculum with a mission statement, and would include such programs as honor code seminars, monthly ethics themes, or student/faculty ethics committees (Zubay, 2007). In Zubayâs surveys, most of the schools fell into the âinformalâ category.

==Incorporating Ethics/Character Education in the Classroom==

The two most popular strategies for teaching students about character are modeling and taking advantage of teachable moments (Brannon, 2008). Weâve all heard the expression, âtreat others the way you would want to be treated.â This is exactly what modeling is all about. It is well known that children learn from watching others. They learn from one another and they learn from adults. This is why it is so important for teachers to set good examples for their students and to point out good examples when they are seen (Brannon, 2008). 

When volunteering in a kindergarten class at a nearby elementary school one day, I noticed that a child (with the help of his mother) had brought in an aquarium of tadpoles. The tadpoles had nothing to do with the teacherâs current unit, but she took advantage of this new and unexpected teaching tool and turned it into a lesson about caring for animals. The children watched the tadpoles grow and took care of them until they became frogs.

Other ways to incorporate ethics in the classroom include getting students to help write class rules, role playing, songs, and projects. According to Thomas Lickona (1997), teachers can also create a classroom that provides a supportive moral community, use discipline as a way to teach about moral reasoning, encourage democracy in the classroom, teach character across the curriculum, utilize cooperative learning when teaching, provide opportunities for moral reflection, teach students abut conflict resolution, and encourage students to take pride in their work (as cited in Brannon, 2008).

In my six year old sonâs first grade class, the students are expected like in all schools, to follow the rules. The first week of school, his teacher asked the class to come up with the classroom rules. In doing this, she made it their responsibility to think of what good behavior encompasses. She then organized the rules and gave each rule a color. Whenever a student breaks one of these rules, he or she has to take the appropriate colored card and place it in his or her rule folder. At the end of the week, every student with less than five cards gets to participate in âgood citizenship dayâ.  This involves a special activity which the children normally are not allowed to do, like climbing on the rock climbing wall on the playground. Those children who received five or more cards get a note sent home and do not get to participate in the activity. In addition to the rule cards, his teacher hands out âgood behaviorâ tickets whenever she sees a student performing a good act. Once a child has seven red tickets, he or she may trade them in for a prize from the treasure box. It doesnât matter how many rule cards the child may have; he or she will still be recognized when doing something good. 

===Caring===

Baron (2007) stated, âDeveloping and maintaining concern for the welfare of those who are less fortunate is achieved through the development of the habit of using oneâs heart wellâ (p. 51). How do teachers show students they care and why is this important in teaching ethics in the classroom? When middle school students were asked how they know when a teacher cares about them, the response was when the teacher teaches well and the teacher treats them well (Davidson, M. ''et al.'', 2007). A survey of teachers, teacher candidates, and college faculty showed that the top seven qualities of caring teachers are:  offering help, showing compassion, showing interest, caring about the individual, giving time, listening, and getting to know students (McBee, 2007). When children feel that their thoughts and ideas are heard and matter, they are more inclined to participate and behave better. In her article, Robin McBee (2007) states, âTo care deeply and to demonstrate that care, teachers must know their studentsâ needs and interestsâ (p. 34). A teacher that is sensitive to the individual needs of his or her students will be considered more caring than one who is not. By showing care the teacher not only boosts the childâs self-confidence and drive, he or she models a behavior worthy of the child repeating.

===Parental Involvement===

Studies show that many teachers think ethics education is a joint responsibility between parents and teachers (Brannon, 2008).  While parents have their own ways of teaching ethics to their children outside of school, there are ways to be involved in their ethics teachings at school as well. Some ideas on how to include parents in character education programs are:

*family participation with homework assignments specifically about character education

*sharing class information in newsletters to parents

*informing parents of class rules and consequences

*inviting parents to volunteer in the classroom

*planning events related to character education (Brannon, 2008).

===Roots of Empathy===

Roots of Empathy is a nonprofit group who brings ethics education to the classroom in a unique way. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, it is âa decade-old program designed to reduce bullying by exposing classrooms to âempathy babiesâ for a whole school yearâ (Wingfield, 2008). In the program, founded by Mary Gordon, the babies are brought into the classrooms to help children, grades K â eighth grade, learn by observing the emotional connection between the babies and their parents and it is designed to boost the âemotional literacyâ of children by getting them to recognize and talk about their feelings instead of acting out aggressively (Wingfield, 2008). According to the article, studies have shown that there has been a drop in aggressive behavior among students who were in classrooms with empathy babies, while there were increases in aggressiveness in groups that did not experience the empathy babies (Wingfield, 2008).

==Making Ethics/Character Education a School-Wide Effort==

While teachers can incorporate teaching ethics in their classrooms, it doesnât have to be just a classroom occurrence. Schools as a whole can support their teachers by implementing plans and ideas for teaching ethics. In a recent study, Brannon (2008) interviewed teachers who came up with five elements schools can use to positively influence students:

*Reach out to the community. (i.e. Hold parent education nights.)

*Provide materials to help teachers teach character education.

*Allow time each day or at least several days a week, for character education to be addressed.

*Set consistent school-wide expectations regarding character and values.

*Value character education as important as other academics and test scores (p. 64).

==Problems with Teaching Ethics==

Teachers in schools that do not have ethics-based curriculums stand to face problems with some parents and even administrators. While most people would agree that ethics/character education should be taught in schools, some parents are uncomfortable with teachers doing this. They donât like the idea of teachers using their roles as authority figures to influence their childrenâs character development (Brannon, 2008). Likewise, some administrators have a problem with teachers incorporating ethics in their curriculum as they feel it may take away from core subject areas (Brannon, 2008). While teachers may encounter this type of opposition, it should not discourage them. Author Dinana Brannon conducted a survey (Brannon, 2008) in which most teachers said they faced problems with time, materials, parents, and the curriculum, but they all felt that character education is important and helpful to their students and society.

==Conclusion==

In my opinion, no matter how a teacher decides to do it, ethics education should be incorporated in the classroom for those children who do not get it at home and to reinforce it to those who do get it at home. I feel that regardless of whether they get support from their school or whether or not their school has an ethics education program implemented, teachers should always, at least, incorporate it in the classroom by setting good examples and be caring and nurturing.

== How Should Teachers Teach Ethics? ==

                      &quot;I never thought ethics was something that could formally be taught. 
                       I thought ethics was something you learned growing up at home, 
                                      in school, and in church.&quot;
                                         -- Robert Fomon
  
'''&lt;u&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/u&gt;'''

After reading this article, 
the reader should be able to:
*identify the pros and cons of teaching ethics
*describe the different techniques to teach ethics



'''&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;'''

Teaching ethics in the classroom, and how to go about doing so, has long been a topic of debate. Everyday society is shifting, and thus more problems are arising that once did not have to be dealt with. Places that were once thought to be places of ethical learning: home, church, and other organizations, are slowly decreasing in importance and are taking a backseat to more &quot;unethical&quot; venues. Our children, on a count of peer pressure, the media, and other everyday influences, are losing the hindsight of the importance in ethics. Teachers, who spend an average of 1,260 hours per year in the classroom working with children, are faced with the difficulty of coming up with new strategies of teaching necessary ethics to their students. The debates, however, are what are the pertinent ethics that should be taught, and how the teacher should go about doing so.

'''&lt;u&gt;What is Meant by Teaching Ethics&lt;/u&gt;'''

The practice of teaching ethics in the classroom is also known by the term &quot;character education&quot; (Kohn, 1997). In the broad sense, it refers to almost anything that schools might try to provide outside of academics, especially when the purpose is to help children grow into good people. In the narrow sense, it denotes a particular style of moral training, one that reflects particular values as well as particular assumptions about the nature of children and how they learn (Kohn, 1997).
In summary, teaching ethics and character education is a way for the teacher and education systems to provide knowledge in how to be what one would consider a good person; one of upstanding morale and ethical beliefs. This approach moves beyond the regular courses offered, such as mathematics, biology, or history, and deals with teaching the students these pertinent lessons of character, such as trustworthiness, caring, and reliability, in addition to the regular curriculum.

'''&lt;u&gt;Where to Start&lt;/u&gt;'''

Schools, being required and the common ground for every child, is the obvious choice of place to incorporate ethical training. Home life for children may be a place full of immoral character, and some do not have, or do not share, a religious belief. School is the one place where the students can have an environment full of different beliefs while all being taught to have a similar moral character. 

The question, then becomes, how should the teachers actually teach these morals. Many different approaches have been tried, and many have been denounced, as well. One approach would be simply for the teacher to model acceptable behavior and provide an example of an honest, patient, caring, unbiased person, etc. This approach is known as Teacher as Role Model, but falls short of being a perfect method because the teacher's personal beliefs, be it religious, ethical, or moral, may make certain students partial to certain ethics or offend others who do not share the same beliefs. Another approach would be to reward good behavior demonstrated by the students. As simple and easy as this approach sounds, however, there are of course drawbacks. The drawback to this certain approach is that children will act, although in genuinely, good to only win the reward (Fabes, 1989). If there is no reward in the end, the children will less likely be provoked to do the good deed (Kohn, 1997). A third approach would be to have an actual class catered to teaching ethics. In this approach, you would have a regular classroom environment, with a qualified teacher, teaching the importances and differences of a moral and ethical character versus one that is not. Again, there is always drawbacks to certain approaches. This method poses the problem of which ethics to teach; which ethics are important and which ones aren't? Also, who is to say who is qualified to teach on this subject, and where, in the students already busy schedule, do you find time to include this class?

'''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;'''

In today's society, there are many, many reasons and necessary situations where a moral and ethical character is vital. Schools were founded with the intent of making good, moral citizens, and this intent is still being focused on today. There are several pedagogical approaches in terms of teaching ethics and how teachers should go about doing so, but there are always problems that arise for each approach. The teacher as a role model seems to be the most promising, with less drawbacks or inconveniences. However, like most educational problems, this seems to be a subject that is still being discussed and debated over, and we are still far from finding an answer.

== &lt;font color=&quot;009999&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

&lt;font face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;
*&lt;big&gt;Readers will be able to identify different types of technology that is used in classrooms today.&lt;/big&gt;
*&lt;big&gt;Readers will understand the advantages and disadvantages of classroom technology for both students and teachers.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;



== &lt;font color=&quot;009999&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt; ==



&lt;font face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;When a person pictures a classroom, usually he or she would think of a black or green chalkboard that comes with different colored chalk. Within the last decade or so, chalk has turned into a keyboard and chalkboards have turned into drop-down screens known as âsmart boards.â  Today technology is infiltrating classrooms everywhere; the traditional classroom setting that we have come to know is now becoming obsolete. However the question is: Are the new state-of-the-art classrooms really beneficial for teachers and students, or are they obstructing lessons?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


== &lt;font color=&quot;009999&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;'''What's New in Classrooms?'''&lt;/font&gt; ==



&lt;font face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;The first thing that is noticeable about a state-of-the-art classroom is the teacherâs desk. Over the years that has changed quite a bit; there used to be just books on it or maybe a desk calendar. Now a computer can be seen on almost every teacherâs desk in each classroom. Each teacher's computer comes with a few things such as: a âsmart board,â or a large white screen that the teacher can either pull down manually or automatically pull down with the press of a button, and finally a projector that is connected to the computer to show images on the smart board. The images that are shown on the smart board can range from Microsoft PowerPoint presentations to videos of the content that is being taught. For example in a college philosophy class, the teacher may use a PowerPoint presentation as a way to summarize point-by-point what he or she is lecturing while students will copy down notes, or sometimes the teacher may show a historical video about Socrates. So not only are the students receiving their lesson, they are also watching a historical reenactment of something that Socrates did, and all of this is done through the computer. Not only does the computer play a role in teaching a lesson, but it also helps teachers take attendance and calculate grades. In fact, some college teachers post their grades on what is known as âBlackboard,â which is a website that helps students keep in touch with their teachers on what is happening in class. Another way technology is used is though computer laboratories, where each student can sit with a computer to do research, or perhaps work on an in-class assignment.

'''Click &amp; Clone''': http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/tech/cloning/clickandclone/&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Some classrooms are still basic in some ways, yet they are still using some form of technology. This primitive form is usually known as the textbook-and-lecture lesson, and some teachers still use this form, but with new technology in it. For example, in a 5th grade lesson on science the students might learn about electricity through a textbook but they will also have a chance to watch a video on how electricity works, or maybe they will go to a computer laboratory to research information on that topic. Sometimes teachers may find online or interactive games to show their students and to help them get involved in the lesson. For example, in a high school biology class, a teacher could use what is called âClick and Clone,â or an interactive game that has the students clone an animal through step-by-step instructions. The game teaches the student about cloning while providing fun animations to watch as they clone the animal. Teachers can lecture with a textbook if they choose to do so, but they can also use technology as part of a lesson- this depends on how each teacher wants to present his or her lesson. The technology may often be available to teachers, but that does not mean they will need to use it every time.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


== &lt;font color=&quot;009999&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;'''Advantages'''&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Several advantages come with this new classroom, but the first advantage is that it promotes a whole different way of learning: project- based learning (Lohr, 2008). This allows students to take a hands-on approach to learning. Instead of learning from a textbook, the students can almost experience what is written in the textbook. For example if students were learning about a current issue with rising oil prices, then they would have to make a new energy policy (Lohr, 2008). This kind of assignment promotes leadership, organizational skills, and computer skills which leads up to another advantage of educational technology: students will have a greater chance of getting hired for a job someday. Leadership and organizational skills are two main characteristics that employers look for when hiring. Aside from achieving those skills, students can also get hired for simply knowing how to use a computer because according to the U.S. Department of Education, about 60% of jobs require computer skills (2003). Educational technology also helps students to make better quality work, especially in their writing. When students work with word processors they tend to feel more comfortable because it takes less time to write what they are thinking, and gives their writing a professional feel once they have printed their work (Dorricott &amp; Peck, 1994). One last important advantage of using technology in the classroom is that it motivates students to go to school everyday. Schools that use more technology show better attendance rates and lesser dropout rates compared to past reports (U.S. Department of Education, 2003).&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color:#99CCFF;
border: solid 7px #003366; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;The U.S. Department of Education reports that students who use technology in school did better than their peers on standardized tests of basic skills by 30% (2003).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;009999&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;'''Disadvantages'''&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;While educational technology may have its advantages, it also has its disadvantages. One important disadvantage is how some teachers are reacting to this change in the education system. Many teachers do not know how to use the computer or have few computer skills; this makes teachers a bit uncomfortable. Some teachers even feel scared because they fear that this will make them feel embarrassed if they make mistakes with using the computer while teaching. Many teachers are also fearful of technology because they feel that it will change their way of teaching; they will have to use unfamiliar things in their lessons. A very good way to solve this is to have the teachers take computer classes to help motivate them to get used to this change (J. Bitner, 2002; N. Bitner 2002). Another disadvantage could be the use of PowerPoint. Some teachers use PowerPoint so much that it actually makes the student bored, and it does not help the student memorize the content due to lack of interaction (Klemm, 2007). If a teacher shows a PowerPoint but does not stop to elaborate and get the class involved, then students will not feel motivated to learn what is being taught. One last disadvantage is that sometimes computers can have problems, which may cause a disturbance in a lesson. If the computer freezes while a teacher is presenting a slideshow then the lesson will be delayed until it is fixed.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color:#99CCFF;
border: solid 7px #003366; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;Research shows that slide-shows can actually be less effective than the traditional learning when a teacher uses a blackboard(Klemm, 2007). This is due to lack of interaction with students as the computer screen becomes their new source of notes.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== &lt;font color=&quot;009999&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;'''Conclusion and Thoughts'''&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;font face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Classrooms certainly have changed over the years, but what counts the most is its efficiency. Educational technology has its moments, but at the same time it can open studentsâ minds and help them to achieve great things that will help them in the future. I like seeing technology in the classroom but I think that the only way it can be effective is if the teacher knows how to use it well. If the teacher relies on just the technology as their way of teaching, then it will not get through to the students. A teacher should still be a little old-fashioned, even in this new age. Teachers can lecture and use textbooks, but they should still show important videos and allow students to participate in interactive games. Students will gain knowledge from textbooks, but gain experience through technology.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== Introduction ==

Technology integration in the classroom is becoming as common as reading and writing. Teachers in schools today are either using technology in their classrooms or learning how to use technology in their classroom. In the last five years there has been a big push for teachers to become technology savvy or at least technological competent so they can use it in their classrooms. And we are not just talking high school level classrooms. Technology is becoming part of everyday life for first and second grade classrooms 
just as much as it is becoming a part of high school and college classrooms.

== Help ==

There are two sides to the use of technology in a classroom. One side is that the use of technology involves activities that encourage students to become involved and directly active parts of their lessons. (Frye, Dornisch, 2008) Students, for the most part, favor activities that allow them to be interactive in the classroom. In fact, when given a choice, a high school psychicâs class chose to read their material for the course using interactivity that allowed them to become personally involved in their work rather than simply reading the material out of their textbook and listening to a lecture. (Frye, Dornisch, 2008) This in turn makes researchers and teachers realize that technology is a positive thing to have in a classroom because it helps students become involved in their school work. Using technology can give students a firsthand look at what they are studying and gives them more control over their work. 

There are many examples of technology that use student interaction to teach lessons rather than simply writing down notes so students can simply &quot;copy and listen&quot;. A Webquest is an activity that is taking the classrooms by storm and has been for a while. It is completed usually by the teacher and involves a sort of adventure that incorporates technology. (Dodge 2007) Students are given a task and they go through the Webquest and its activities in order to finish that task. In the end, they learn a lesson in an interactive way that allows them to feel that they have been a vital role in their learning experience. These lessons involve tools such as PowerPoint and Dreamweaver, and students can point and click and go to different websites and sources in order for them to finish the task. 

Another technology friendly tool that teachers are using are interactive games that are used to teach students lessons. There are so many websites that cater to teachers and give them the tools or sources to use these games. Many of them involve the student playing alone or with a partner or small group. These games teach subjects from math and reading to science and history.
 
Another aspect of using technology in classrooms that many think is helpful for students is the use of video cameras, which allow for streaming live to different classrooms across the country and the world. Although this is not something that is done in every classroom across the country and does require certain equipment, it is said to be a very positive activity for students. Instead of learning about other regions of the country or world, they get to see it first hand in other classrooms. They can talk to the teacher and students in those classrooms and ask them questions about where they live and how their lives are different or the same as theirs. 

All these activities, technology advocates say, foster a child's need to be interactive in their learning and in turn helps them become more involved and they are more excited about being involved. According to Dr. Kimberly Moore Kneas and Dr. Bruce Perry, the technologies that benefit young children the most are the ones that allow them to be interactive and allow them to develop their curiosity and thinking skills. (Kneas, Perry, 2008) They also point out that students like to have a reason for doing a task or assignment other than &quot;just because the teacher said so&quot;. The use of technology allows students to feel that they have a real purpose for what they are learning and in turn, they perform better. (Kneas, Perry, 2008) 

It appears that word has gotten out about the use of technology in the classroom. According to Education Next, taxpayers, corporations and other contributors have spent over 60 million dollars to provide schools all over the world with computers, and this is only in the last two decades. (Christensen, Horn, 2008)

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;BROADWAY&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
&quot;Children are already accustomed to a world that moves faster and is more exciting than anything a teacher in front of a classroom can do&quot; Major Owens &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Hindrance ==
:

While there are many arguments and facts that point to the benefits of using technology in the classroom, there is another side to the story. There are many examples, arguments and statistics that bring out the not so beneficial side of using technology in classrooms. 

While many teachers are accepting technology in their classrooms and trying to embrace it with enthusiasm, there are just as many teachers who are putting their foot down and arguing that technology is not a necessity in the classroom and should not be treated as one. In response to an article posted by Jim Holland on the Techlearning website titled âWhen Teachers Donât Get It: Myths, Misconceptions and other Taradiddleâ, a teacher argues with the logic that number one, technology is a great thing to have in classrooms and is essential, and number two, that teachers who donât involve technology in their classrooms are rather lazy and unwilling to change.  The arguments are that teachers have state standards they must help their students reach. (Johnson, 2006)That is just a simple fact that no teacher can argue. These standards are usually taken very seriously and are probably the most important factor that school boards and states look at. While teachers are trying to make sure that their students are mastering these skills and passing the state tests, there is little time for trying to integrate technology into every part of their classroom. Many teachersâ jobs depend on making sure that the students meet the goals required. The teacher argues that until technology skills are a part of the state standards they will not be essential to the classroom. (Johnson, 2006) Another argument that some teachers might have is that their schools do not equip them with the proper equipment to even use technology in their lesson plans. Some teachers only have learning labs and they can use them at a very certain time during the day. These labs sometimes donât even have enough computers for each student in their classroom, forcing some students to share which can cause problems in their lesson plans. 

Technological equipment such as computers, cameras and even Ipods can offer great learning tools. They can help students research a topic or find information from all over the world, they can help a student listen to a lecture in their own time and they can give students access to classrooms in other parts of the country. On the other side of that, they can help students cheat on exams and help students get access to harmful and inappropriate information and material streaming on the net. 

Teachers must be very careful when giving their students access to the internet. Although most schools have blocks on any website that is inappropriate, sometimes this can slip by the system. Students can get pictures, information and videos that are extremely inappropriate and harmful to them. This is where technology can be quite scary. At home a lot of children have access to the internet and there are some homes that do not regulate the use of the internet very well. This can not only lead to problems at home but at school. If a student knows where this information is and wants to show it to some friends at school, there might be ways to get around the schools strict internet policies and get to this information. This is where teachers must regulate their studentâs use of the internet and promote the internet for academic research.

Another side of technology that can be troubling is the use of an IPod. While many teachers, even in high schools, have allowed IPods in their rooms to record a lecture, it can cater to cheaters. (Carstairs 2007) In Meridian, Idaho and at other schools around the nation, IPods are being forced out of classrooms. These devices can be hidden under clothing and a tiny wire and an ear piece can be transmitted to the ear without a teacher ever knowing. They can be used to download formulas and a student can actually record all the answers to a test and simply download it into their music list and listen to it during the test. (Carstairs 2007)

In an argument defending more traditional teaching and shying away from overusing technology in the classroom, Lowell Monke points out that in classrooms with very young children, there is a need to see, feel and relate to a subject at hand. Computers, he states, simply cannot offer this type of experience. The need to get hands on experience, like touching a plant while learning about them, and the experiences that come with that cannot be offered by a machine like a computer. (Monke, 2004) Only hands on, teacher to student and student to subject interaction can offer this experience to young students. This is an experience that is said to be critical to young children's learning.

In the year 2000 (yes 2000!) the National Center for Education Statistics revealed that 99% of teachers had access to a computer! And that was eight years ago! &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== So What's the Verdict?==



As you can read and see, technology in the classroom has many promoters who believe that technology can only help students in their learning and help them become more active in the classroom.  There are also others who simply say that technology brings on bad practices and can give students access to information they should not be seeing and can take teachers away from the standards that 
they are taught to teach by. 

Either way you look at it, technology clearly has its advantages and disadvantages but if classrooms today are any indication on which way the educational world is leaning, it looks like the promoters might be winning right now.

== A Personal Look ==


In my experience as a student and as an aspiring teacher, I must agree that technology in the classroom can have many benefits for the teacher and the student. It can open the students world to so many new things without ever leaving the classroom. Who can say they traveled to Spain in class today if they did not have access to the computer where they could see real pictures of places as if they were there? I think that is something that must be incorporated to classroom because it can only add enrichment to students everyday activities and their learning. However, I know that there are problems with technology that must be taken care of. Student should not and cannot have access to inappropriate material and technology should not be used to promote cheating and other harmful behavior. 


Now, after reading this, what's your opinion?

===&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;===

This article intends to address what exactly Web 2.0 Tools are and what exactly &quot;Web 2.0&quot; refers to, specifically in an educational realm.  This article will also address why educators are addressing the issue of Web 2.0 tools, and why there is debate about the usefulness of these tools or lack there of.  The article will briefly discuss opposing viewpoints from either side of the fence regarding using web 2.0 in the classroom. As we delve deeper into this idea of âweb 2.0â we will learn how we can use web 2.0 in the classroom.

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;What is Web 2.0?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

According to Dan Fost, O'Reilly lists '''seven key components''' to web 2.0:  

-- &lt;u&gt;Using the Web as a platform&lt;/u&gt;, where anyone can write software that anyone else can use, instead of having to use Microsoft's Windows platform; 

-- &lt;u&gt;Harnessing collective intelligence&lt;/u&gt;, such as the way Google links to the most-popular pages and Amazon offers popular books, and the way Wikipedia and blogs use &quot;the wisdom of crowds&quot; to come up with information; 

-- &lt;u&gt;Enriching data for a deeper online experience&lt;/u&gt;, as seen in mashups like www.housing maps.com, which combines Craigslist apartment data with Google maps; 

-- &lt;u&gt;Software as a service&lt;/u&gt;, which gets constantly updated online rather than sold in shrink-wrapped packages; 

-- Software such as Apple's iTunes, which &lt;u&gt;works seamlessly onl&lt;/u&gt;ine, on PCs and on iPods; 

-- &lt;u&gt;Rich user experiences&lt;/u&gt;, so that Web sites often feel like the software that runs on a PC.
(2006)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Barsky describes, Web 2.0 is ultimately a social phenomenon of usersâ experience of the Web and is characterized by open communication, decentralization of authority, and freedom to share and re-use Web content (2006). Web 1.0 is best summed as the browsers, software, and applications as the most important part of the internet (O'Reilly 2005). Web 2.0 is the change in viewing people and collaboration as the biggest factor of the internet (O'Reilly 2005).  The term Web 2.0 was coined and popularized by Tim OâReily (Voithofer, 2007). These technologies include but are not limited to [[An Introduction to Weblogs|blogs]],[[Podcasting|podcasts]] and, [[Wikibooks:Welcome|wikipages]] (Alexander 2006). The term refers to the application of the technologies that were created for social uses in different arenas such as business and education.   Web 2.0 refers to an evolution of usability of internet applications.  Blogs, Wikis, and Podcasts have all become extremely easy to produce due to the fact that to use them one no longer needs to understand intense html coding (Geraci 2007). Web 2.0 is collaborative in nature, and is a mindset that we are the integral part of these technologies, not the html, coding, and machines (Geraci, 2007).  Web 2.0 also refers to micro content and the idea that now we can access many different items from one single source due to an open sharing among domains, and servers (Alexander 2006). Web 2.0 is a term that encases an idea of using internet technologies for socioeconomic concerns. The term is ambiguous web 2.0 is a new idea, however let the ambiguity assist us.  I mention Blogs, Podcasts, and Wikis, however we can become more creative and apply this idea to other technologies.  Some of those could be online chats, a digital television recording device, and even [[XML - Managing Data Exchange/RSS|RSS]] feeds (really simple syndication).

Three structural tools of Web 2.0:  '''Blogs''', '''Podcasts''', &amp; '''Wikipages''' 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=OXL_e51dcwg Web 2.0 according to Michael Wesch]&lt;/center&gt;

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Why Web 2.0?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==
Why is there a push towards Web 2.0 in the classroom?  Remember that web 2.0 in majority is an idea not just one thing (Alexander 2006).  Web 2.0 refers to all of us and how we access our internet, our world.  The idea now is to use web 2.0 to our advantage, specifically in school systems.  The school of thought that is for the usage of Web 2.0 in the classroom believes that it is an asset to education.  Web 2.0 is how âmillennials[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/08/60minutes/main3475200.shtml]â are accessing the majority of their social world already (Voithofer, 2007). Another idea behind the push for usage in the classroom, is the fact that web 2.0 tools are what we use everyday to access our world (Voithofer 2007).  The thought is that students need to be aware of these tools, and knowledgeable of how to use them correctly and responsibly. We use web 2.0 tools everyday, and we probably donât even notice.  When we express ourselves on our blog pages, when listening to RSS feeds, when we upload photos to a Flickr account we are accessing web 2.0 .  Our world is changing; we are becoming more collaborative and more creative due to the enlarging capabilities of the technology around us. 



According to the Digital Media and Learning Fact Sheet published by the MacArthur Foundation, which sponsors a $50 million program study focused on the successful integration of digital technologies into the nationâs education system, 87% of Americaâs teens have home access to the Internet, and most spend up to 8.5 daily involved with some form of digital technology.  The sheet also sites information gathered from  2005 Kaisor Family Foundation survey that states âthe typical 8-18 year-old lives in a home with 3.6 CD or tape players, 3.5 TVs, 3.3 radios, 2.9 VCRs/DVD players, 2.1 video game consoles, and 1.5 computersâ
Giving further proof to the inundation of digital media in the lives of U.S. youngsters, MacArthur cites that suggests that  64% of  8-18 year-olds are download music online, 32% have there own Webpage,  66%  instant message; 39% own cell phones; 18% MP3 players; and 13% possess handheld technology with Internet connectivity, and 8 in every ten youth participate in online gaming.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot;&gt;''Criticism''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
There has been some debate about employing Web 2.0 tools in the classroom. Some feel that Web 2.0 is merely a scheme to market âhot web-start upsâ (Geraci, 2007). Corporate businesses use the term &quot;web 2.0&quot; to target millennials to help publicize new web domains.  Alexander notes,(web 2.0 tools) They are the creations of enthusiasts or business enterprises and do not necessarily embrace the culture of higher education (2006). Another problem presented by Web 2.0 is maintaining intellectual integrity as information is more easily shifted and moved from domain to domain (Alexander 2006).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot;&gt;''In the classroom''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
How can we as educators use this technology in our classrooms?  The one true answer to this question is creativity.  We need to embrace these technologies in our classroom, so that we can enhance our studentsâ access of knowledge, and teach them evaluation skills that will be crucial when using these new applications. Dodge defines, A WebQuest is an inquiry-oriented activity in which some or all of the information that learners interact with comes from resources on the internet, optionally supplemented with videoconferencing (1997). Webquests[http://webquest.sdsu.edu/about_webquests.html] are a great way to involve web 2.0 in the classroom and keep students on task with the content. Webquests can use several different web 2.0 tools to demonstrate knowledge of content.  For example, the unit being studied could be the lifespan of a butterfly for third-grade science.   The webquest assigns specific tasks to the students using applications found on the internet.  One task may be to observe a video of the life-span of a monarch butterfly on that was downloaded from unitedstreaming[http://streaming.discoveryeducation.com/index.cfm].   Another quest after the video could be posting a blog about oneâs interests in the life-span of the monarch butterfly.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot;&gt;''Finding Web 2.0 Tools You Can Use in the Classroom''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Dr. Bernie Dodge who works for the San Diego State University, Department of Educational Technology  has created a Webquest.Org site that teaches how to create Webquests.  In addition the site provides a search engine to find pre-designed Webquests you can use in your classroom that are grade level and subject specific (Dodge, 2007).  Click on http://webquest.org/index.php  to view the site.  

In addition to Webquests, another cooperative Web 2.0 tool that you can use in your classroom is a blog.  The classroom blog is a service created by David Warlick and the Landmark Project.  It is free to all teachers working in an Educational Institution.  It designed to let a teacher create a classroom blog that is completely secluded from the outside world.  You will be able to enter your studentsâ names, and have the students write articles and reports that are posted for you and their peers to review and comment on (21st, 2008).  To access the Landmark site, click on http://classblogmeister.com/index.php.

Another fun idea is video sharing.  You and your students can download and uploading educational video from Google video (21st, 2008).  Your class could create a video science project on the Monarch butterfly that could be uploaded to Google video.  Producing something that a world-wide audience could view could be a huge motivator for your students.  To access the Google video site, click on http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Monarch+Butterfly&amp;sitesearch=.

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0099&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==
Web 2.0 is best described as a new version of the internet that focuses on the web as a platform of usability; it also refers to viewing people and the partnership between them as the important part of the web, not machines and codes (O'Reilly 2005).  The world is evolving and we are entering a new frontier where through use of technology (web 2.0 tools) we are able to become more collaborative, communicative and creative. We are embarking on a new era in which many social formalities are completed online. Education of responsible and appropriate use of these tools is a needed area in the classroom.  The children of today and tomorrow will and are becoming more technology saturated.  As educators it is our duty to teach our students integrity and make them accountable for themselves.  We need to adapt to students learning capabilities, and using web 2.0 tools in our classrooms as teaching strategies is the best way to do this.

&lt;p style=&quot;font: 14pt Garamond, Georgia, serif;color:#006600;&quot;&gt;'''''by: Ashley Crooks'''''&lt;/p&gt;

== &lt;p style=&quot;font: 20pt Cooper Black, Georgia, serif;color:#006600;&quot;&gt;Learning Targets -- How do we become ''Web 2.0 Natives''?&lt;/p&gt; ==

This article will allow students to identify the various applications and groups of technology that make up Web 2.0.

Students will be able to differentiate between traditional learning versus Web 2.0 learning.

Students will identify the potential of Web 2.0, but consider the many challenges schools face in regard to funding Web 2.0 based learning.

Students will be introduced to Wikiversity and learn how to determine legitimacy of web based content.

==&lt;p style=&quot;font: 20pt Cooper Black, Georgia, serif;color:#006600;&quot;&gt;''Web'' what?&lt;/p&gt;==
The phrase âWeb 2.0â was coined by Tim OâReilly, founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media, Inc. and open supporter of the free software movement promoting user's rights to access and modify software.  Web 2.0 was created or ''coined'' in 2004 to describe the design patterns and business models for the next generation of web software following the dot-com bubble and technology market crash in 2001 (OâReilly, 2005).  According to the July 16, 2006 Los Angeles Times article, ''Will the dotcom bubble burst again?'', the dot-com bubble crash wiped out $5 trillion in market value of technology companies from March 2000 to October 2002.  This was the foundation for the introduction of Web 2.0 applications.   

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #666666;border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''''&quot;The next generation web promises to make the web a way of life and turn software development upside down.  The web moves from simply being sites and search engines to being a shared network space that drives work, research, education, entertainment, and social activities - essentially everything people do&quot; (Storey, 2006).'''''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 

Web 2.0 consists of various technological components including, but not limited to, blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, and podcasts.  
Anyone is able to interact in a social cyber network using Web 2.0, deliberating on topics of interest where one can contribute one's own content and knowledge or comment on others content and knowledge.  A Blog is a type of website usually run by an individual who contributes regular commentary for anyone to discuss or comment on.  A Wiki is a collection of webpages where anyone can access, contribute, and edit the content.  RSS (Real Simple Syndication) Feeds are used to publish frquently updated materials to the Internet, like news headlines or the weather.  A podcast is a digital audio or video file that is available to download.  More familiar examples of Web 2.0 is the social networking sites of Facebook and MySpace.  There is also Wikipedia (from the term Wiki) that we are all ''quite'' familiar with and using right now.  This peer created textbook is an excellent example of digital native user interaction for education and knowledge.  What is a ''digital native''?  According to Wikipedia, a digital native is someone who has grown up using digital technology such as camera, computers, cell phones, and the Internet.

==&lt;p style=&quot;font: 20pt Cooper Black, Georgia, serif;color:#006600;&quot;&gt;Collective Wisdom&lt;/p&gt;==

Everyone can relate to the scene of a classroom with the teacher up front lecturing on that days topic while the students scribble down notes.  In this 20th century classroom students were given basic answers of right and wrong and almost never given the opportunity to challenge those right and wrong answers.  Students studied what the textbook and teachers taught for upcoming tests. &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #6CC417;border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt; '''''In the 20th century students were given basic answers of right and wrong and almost never given the opportunity to challenge those right and wrong answers.''''' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;What if the teachers and professors decided to stop teaching?  Instead, now imagine a much different classroom where the students work together, discuss, problem solve, and ''construct their knowledge'' (Staley 2009).  We would still have teachers, but not lecturers.  The teacher would serve more as a supervisor.  Each day this ''supervisor'' would do something like hold a meeting where students would receive a definition of duties and responsibilities and they would start their shift, so to speak.  The supervisor makes their rounds, keeping everyone on track and that's class.  Sounds a lot like the workplace.  Possibly a good start assuming students will be future workers.

== &lt;p style=&quot;font: 20pt Cooper Black, Georgia, serif;color:#006600;&quot;&gt;The Critics &amp; Funding Shortfalls&lt;/p&gt; ==
There is always going to be the reluctant few who are skeptical of change and prefer the traditional way of doing things.  There is also the few who choose to abuse technology and Web 2.0 applications.  âTraditionalâ teachers have a sense that if they allow their students to have a certain amount of technology access they will abuse it and waste time.  MySpace and Facebook are two examples of social networking sites that may steer students in the wrong direction in the classroom.  Many will argue that it's not the social sites that steer students in the wrong direction, but it's the content of the classroom that doesn't engage a students proper attention.

Possibly the biggest concern is; Where's the money for these Web 2.0 applications going to come from?  Every school is judged on a large scale in the terms of funding.  &quot;They must meet the needs of a large number of school districts, but all school districts vary considerably in their student characteristics and needs&quot; (Augenblick 1997).  Most high valued property areas don't face much of a problem considering their schools funding is based on the cost of the local housing and commercial community.  Also these higher school markets have better student testing results thus leading to more funds and a better education.  It's the lower costing communities that lack the funding for their school to keep up with the rest of the digital natives out there.  They have lower test results and, as a result, less funding.  All this poses a problem for Web 2.0 learning equality.

== &lt;p style=&quot;font: 20pt Cooper Black, Georgia, serif;color:#006600;&quot;&gt;Wikiversity&lt;/p&gt; ==
August 2006 was the most recent merge of a Web 2.0 application into higher education.  The development of [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page Wikiversity] from the founders of Wikipedia.  David Stanley, an adjunct associate professor and Director of the Goldberg Program for Excellence in Teaching in the Department of History at The Ohio State University and the Principal of The DStaley Group, a strategic futuring consulting firm, describes this new platform university as a collaboration of learning materials produced by volunteers like the ones who contribute in Wikipedia (Stanley 2009).  The great thing about Wikiversity is that anyone can attend and there's no tuition.  All the learning materials are produced by the Wikiversity ''students'' and can be edited by each user.  All the course material has its own electronic jargon.  Traditional universities each have separate course departments referred to as &quot;colleges&quot;, like the Darden College of Education.  At the Wikiversity they say &quot;portals&quot; or &quot;faculties&quot; and there aren't any &quot;professors&quot;, but &quot;course leaders&quot; (Stanley 2009).  It's virtually just like creating or editing an article in Wikipedia.  Anyone is able to add course knowledge or create a faculty and school, or be a course leader (Friesen &amp; Hopkins 2008).  Many colleges, MIT being one, actually give Wikiversity students college credit.

== &lt;p style=&quot;font: 20pt Cooper Black, Georgia, serif;color:#006600;&quot;&gt;What defines an ''Expert''?&lt;/p&gt; ==
How does one qualify to be an expert?  If someone calls himself or herself an expert on a subject are they still continuing to learn on a particular topic or do they feel they have accomplished all they need to know?  Fortunately, in a Web 2.0 approach, dated or past knowledge and expertise will quickly be updated by a slew of peers.  Web 2.0 may encourage teachers and students to continue learning on a topic of interest in order to keep up with the many voices out there.  I imagine an expert would receive much satisfaction blogging and teaching various peers new aspects of knowledge.

'''Student Written Text Materials'''
By Pauline Thorson
==Learning Targets==

To understand what a Student Written Text Material is.

To understand that the student written material can be considered as credible material.

To understand the effects of students writing their own textbooks.

==Introduction==

As technology advances, so does the way we learn.  Now we as students on the university level and in a more technologically advanced age have the chance to write our own text. Not only is this affordable but can be used in the future. One may think we have been thrown into the deep end but, with this class we have the chance to walk through the steps of writing our own textbook for future teachers to reference. Individually we are responsible for one article and critiquing our fellow classmates. As a group we have responsibility of informing the future pre-service teachers.

==Brief history of textbooks== 

The start of written language could be traced back to cavemen. These cavemen would write on walls of caves with rocks, clay and sometimes blood. They did this to &quot;teach&quot; others where to find animals for food.

The Ancient Egyptians were among the first to develop a formal language, hieroglyphics, and writing utensils, which included papyrus and a primitive ink. They would also use scrolls to record information. These scrolls could be considered, the first textbook, in my opinion. However, according to John Wakefield, University of North Alabama, textbooks were invented by Aelius Donatus, in 4 A.D. in a catechism style. This style was where the student would answer a question posed by the teacher (Wakefield, 2008 p 5).

We then used the quill and ink on parchment for almost a thousand years. 

With a great big jump forward in history, we now have our modern style of pen and paper, typewriters and currently computers with which to compose our thoughts. There is not much of a jump to make from composing thoughts on a computer to a group of students publishing a textbook.

==What is a student written text material?==

What exactly is a student written text material, you may ask. Well, it is exactly as it sounds. A group of students, either in grade school or in the university level, with guidance from a teacher or professor, collaborate together to produce a text from which others can learn.

==Do the students write these articles within the textbook?==

Yes, the students write articles within the textbook as part of a course in which they are enrolled. This is usually under the guidance of a teacher or professor. As most teachers and students eventually find that they learn the most from watching others take in the information they are trying to convey.

As for the process, the students choose an article or two to write and with other classmates and guidance from peers, they try to get current and relevant information out, to better educate themselves and their fellow classmates.

But if you wish to know more about the authors, you can look their information up in the About the Authors section of the book.

==Are these student written textbooks a credible source of information?==

One would think not. After all, what would a bunch of students know about writing a textbook? They are just learning the basics. You would be surprised, because when one person becomes a master of some idea or profession they also have to go through a trial in which they learn a great bit and in turn can teach what they have learned. How many times does a child fall before he or she learns to walk? How many of us still stumble or stub a toe every now and then? With these analogies one could say that we are learning all the time. It is with this continual learning process that we eventually do become masters of what we are learning thus, being able to teach others through our own experiences.

Also the students get to learn with their fellow students and provide peer reviews. Peer reviews are the chance for students to advise, suggest and guide their classmates into producing the best work they can.

We as a class get to learn and critique our peers in order to help them learn things about themselves as well as ourselves. This is a new way to get ourselves and fellow students thinking and exercising our minds (Nodding 2008).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF8C6;
border: solid 7px #C11B17; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''&quot;Any subjectâbe it physics, art, or auto repairâcan promote critical thinking as long as teachers teach in intellectually challenging ways.&quot;(Noddings 2008)'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Effects of students writing their own textbooks?==

There is no cost to the college student in purchasing a text for a course that employs this method of learning. This is a big plus for most students considering that most students have a budget and really do not want to have to shell out 100's to 1000's of dollars if they do not have to. The Washington Post recently reported that &quot;Sales of used textbooks last year grew 15 percent to $2 billion, with double-digit growth expected through 2011, according to Simba Information, a market research group. Meanwhile, sales of new textbooks have grown by 4 to 5 percent annually, with the market this year expected to reach $3.6 billion.&quot;(Mui &amp; Kinzie 2008, para 120). This can be quite the daunting figure for the students of the future.

&quot;Of course, the most immediate benefit of classroom teaching and textbook writing is that they allow you to mold the minds of students.&quot;(Mankiw 2007) Mankiw, a Harvard Professor, continues to say that as one writes a textbook one can begin to understand their weaknesses and how to strengthen them with the correct information (Mankiw 2007).

This textbook will also give future pre-service teachers, students learning to teach, an up to date reference, in which to learn how we all can teach each other and some of the stumbling blocks along the way. Which Kevin Hunter found that in a NEA survey that &quot;39 percent of teachers said they do not have enough textbooks to assign homework to their students, and 32 percent reported their oldest textbook was more than 10 years old.&quot; (Hunter, 2006).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF8C6;
border: solid 7px #C11B17; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''http://www.nea.org/nr/nr021008.html;'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


After it is all written, the student (with fellow classmates) get the honor of being able to say they wrote a textbook, which will look good on a resume'.

As with this modern age of technology we do have cheaper ways of getting books online but, why pay for something when you can learn so much more by writing it?

==What happens if all courses start having students write their own books?==
There is a debate that if students start writing their own books then the textbook companies will lose money. This might be a blessing to some. However, the publishers make money from republishing the same information year after year. They may change a picture or chapter here or there, but not the information

I think they should only reprint when there is new information or an outstanding new discovery. This is right up the alley for most history textbooks as there is new information every year, but not for something like math which is pretty cut and dry. There is no real way to change the fact that a+b=c.

==Multiple Choice==

'''1. Which is not a reason for students to write an online textbook?'''
   a. They get to use it in a resume'
   b. It in turn helps the student to learn the material
   c. It is cheaper than buying a textbook
   d. The information provided is out of date.

'''2. What is one effect of writing a textbook? '''
   a. to learn ones weaknesses
   b. to prevent publishers from profiting
   c. to learn wiki-code
   d. to make a teachers job easier

'''3.Tim, who is trying to be frugal, has six classes to take, what would be the most cost effective option? ''' 
   a. Buy all the books required for each class, and not look at more affordable options
   b. Buy books over the internet, which may take weeks to come in
   c. Find a courses that allows him to write as he learns
   d. All of the above

'''4. Advice to future teachers could include which piece of advice? '''  
   a. Do not try to learn things a new way, old ways are tried and true.
   b. Students should be students and teachers should teach.
   c. The best way to learn is to teach.
   d. Why try to teach something when you don't understand it yourself.

==Answers==
1.D, Because the textbook are written by the current students, they can be considered currently accurate.

2.A, Though we did learn a lot about wikicode in the production of this text, the best answer is to be able to understand ones weakness, and improve yourself.

3.C, Though Tim may not be able to avoid some of these options, the most affordable is to find a course with a curriculum to write its own book.

4. C, Most of these are just silly, the best way to learn is to teach.

==Conclusion==
Textbooks have been around for a great deal of time. As time has changed humans, we have evolved our way of learning to fit the surroundings we have created. We have learned to develop ideas that led to the invention of the computer. It is the computer, we now use to compose a textbook for future teachers to read. The computer and classes, like this one, allow us to develop our techniques and forgo the cost of buying yet another book and in turn to learn a great deal from fellow classmates.

'''Student Written Text Material'''
By Luis Batista

== Learning Targets ==

Readers will understand what Student Written Text Material is.

Readers will be able to distinguish the credibility of Student Written Text Material.

Readers will be given insight on the use and future of Student Written Text Material.

== Introduction ==

Since the days of Aristotle and Plato, the establishment of student-teacher relationship was a key component in the success of rising scholars. There has always been an understanding that those who instruct are those that have experienced enough to be considered credible to teach. As the world step deeper into the 21st century, change in the flow of information has deeply changed the school of thought. The question must arise; can students teach other students?


== What is Student Written Text Material? ==

Student Written Text Material is exactly what it sounds like. Students take the responsibility of writing their own textbooks and information on specific subjects and topics. This take at the reigns usually begins at a University level, but in some cases students as early as high school are beginning to write their own learning material to pass on to further generations. 



== What is the Process Students Take? ==

Students usually begin the process of their written text material under the guidance/supervision of a professor and his or her Teaching Assistants. Students choose one of the given subjects to investigate and complete their research before they begin to write an article on the chosen subject. The students article is then chosen by another student for peer review. After the review is complete, the author is given suggestions for revision and taking those into account revisions are made. 


== Are Student Written Textbooks Credible? ==

The credibility of students is always in question when it comes to writing a textbook. What does a student know about writing a textbook? Aren't they the ones who are supposed to learn? How can they write a textbook when they are still buying them? It is only in time and experience that one can master his/her work. That being said, where is line that draws between the experienced and the novice? It is not without mistakes that we can learn to become the best at what we do. 

When creating a student written textbook, his findings and work is peer-review to create the most accurate and reader friendly material. Some believe that the conventional style of corporate companies writing textbooks has lost its value. Scott Jaschik claims that &quot;faculty members need to move beyond an assumption that writing quality is the key way to evaluate textbooks. When writing quality is high, students who read the textbook appear to have benefited with a correlation in predicted exam scores&quot; (Jaschik, 2008). 

On the other hand some say students are not ready for this type of responsibility. In a study that compared a table of contents edited by students against those of a commercial, one said that &quot;studentsâ priorities about ed psych may not coincide either with the typical contents of commercial textbooks, NOR with instructor-held impressions about what students' priorities &quot;actually&quot; are. This may be a problem when trying to use a commercial text that aspires to be universally relevant&quot; (Seifert, 2008). 


== The Use and Future of Student Written Text Material ==

With the added bonus of a book that is cost nothing at all, it seems like student written texts are closer than ever. There is some displeasure with the way today's textbooks are written. One source claims that, &quot;Students frequently complain that they have a difficult time sorting through the overabundance of content and technical jargon. Sadly, the tone of textbooks--impersonal, authoritative, and objective--fails to engage student interest&quot; (Shibley, 55). Another source that agrees with a feeling of displeasure says &quot;students normally don't read the textbook in conjunction with classroom activities, but rather use it as an adjunct to solve problems, picking out what they perceive to be useful solved problems and useful pieces of information&quot; (Kalman, 77). 

Although some textbooks may be difficult to follow, read, or comprehend, it is up to the writer to consider its readers. In the hands of a student, it might be more beneficial to a fellow student. What better way to teach than in the same language? While some agree that students may not have all the experience of today's textbook writers, the future in which students write books for fellow students seems brighter than ever. 


== Multiple Choice ==
'''1. What does the future hold for student writers?'''
   a. No one will believe what is written
   b. There will not be enough money to publish it
   c. The future seems closer than ever
   d. Very unpredictable to us

'''2. What was one reason stated that some are displeased with conventional textbook writers? '''
   a. Both B and C
   b. Students can not understand them
   c. Students do not read them
   d. Students do not like the prices

'''3. Which is not a reason why students should use student written text? ''' 
   a. It is free
   b. It is easier to understand
   c. The information in the text has been peer reviewed for accuracy
   d. The text is very credible

'''4. Which is not a part of the process of a student written text? '''  
   a. Assessing what is true and what is opinion
   b. Peer review
   c. Revision
   d. Writing under the guidance of an instructor

== Answers ==
1)c. The future seems closer than ever
2)a. Both B and C
3)d. The text is very credible
4)a. Assessing what is true and what is opinion

== Conclusion ==
Textbooks have always given us insight into the knowledge we hope to obtain. Some believe that students are not up to the task of writing their own textbooks. Some believe that it is time for a change. The debate is still up in the air and the decision is not for us to make, but for those of a later generation. It is classes like this one that are taking the first step towards the future.

&lt;u&gt;'''Foundations to Virtual Learning'''&lt;/u&gt;


Although virtual schools seem like a new concept in education today, the &quot;independent study&quot; course is one precursor to virtual learning that has existed for many years.  Independent study courses operate under the concept of a teacher supervising the student outside of the traditional classroom.  Intermittent meetings would be arranged for the student and teacher to discuss the learning progress.  Granted this concept does not include a computer, however, it does set a foundation for a crucial factor related to independent learning where the student rarely interfaces with a teacher;  the objective being self-motivation.  Studies are being conducted that highlight the advantages and disadvantages of virtual schools.  Studies have also been conducted that focus on the upside and downside of independent study as well.  The results from both types of self-motivated learning yield very similar results.  For example, several Computer Science faculty members at the University of Calgary in Canada conducted a two-year study that involved 600 students learning format.  Some were in traditional lecture courses for a particular class and others were independently studying the same course.  The study was performed because they did not have the capacity to meet all of the students' needs for traditional lectures.  The student performance results are as follows for 1997-98 semesters:  In the 1997 semester, the percentage of students with a grade of &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; was similar across sections but a significantly greater percentage of lecture section students obtained a grade of &quot;C&quot; (43% vs. 21%); whereas a significantly greater percentage of independent study students obtained a grade of &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot; (41% vs. 18%). In their written comments, the 1997 independent study students expressed concerns that inadequate information regarding exam content, lab expectations and marking criteria had negatively affected their performance. For the 1998 semester, a more senior Teaching Assistant was hired and optional project-based assignments were introduced (8 of 50 students chose to do a project).  As a result, a significantly larger percent of the independent study students received a grade of &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; in the 1998 vs. 1997 term (57% vs. 38%). During the 1998 semester, the independent study students also outperformed the lecture students - receiving more &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; grades (57% vs. 42%), fewer &quot;C&quot; grades (29% vs. 39%) and fewer &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot; grades (14% vs. 18%) (Fremont, Giesbrecht, Loose).  



'''GROWTH OF VIRTUAL SCHOOL'''


Virtual School, the name sounds like a science fiction term from the year 2030; however these schools have been in existence for 12 years. To understand the future one must look to the origins of virtual schools. The modern mail-based &quot;correspondence school&quot; is said to have been invented at the University of Chicago in 1891. The delivery mechanism subsequently evolved from mail-based correspondence courses and radio programs to television and satellite broadcasts to today's           
Internet-based virtual schools, which were launched in the 1990sâ (HART). In 1995, nine district teachers are credited with creating the âCyberSchool Projectâ in Eugene, Oregon.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;. Education is the only business still debating the usefulness of technology. Schools remain unchanged for the most part, despite numerous reforms and increased investments in computers and networks. - Rod Paige U.S. Secretary of Education&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  
The project offered supplemental high-school courses. The project became a overnight success, â&quot;The teacher was spending half her day helping other kids,&quot; said her mother, Ann Lindbloomâ¦Lindbloom thought the virtual school not only would allow her daughter Jerynn to accelerate her studies, but also let her other daughter, 8-year- old Regan, who was in Title I reading and math classes, work at her own pace, too.â (BILES).  

By 1997 Virtual schools began to spread,

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

âVirtual schools are growing so quickly that a good count of them remains elusive. But the excitement is palpable, even if hyped. Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of U.S. News &amp; World Report, has opined that, with distance learning and its accompanying &quot;digital revolution ... [w]e are on the threshold of the most radical change in American education in over a century.... Here with the Web is the way for America to use the marvels it created to end the regression in our competitive and academic performance.&quot;, (HART). 

'''VIRTUAL SCHOOL GOOD OR BAD?'''

	So far virtual schools and online classrooms have mixed reviews from the public. First letâs look at the '''pros'''&lt;u&gt;underline text&lt;/u&gt; of the virtual school; 

2005 - 2006 School semester in the state of Colorado 116,820 students were expelled or suspended from school, reasoning being everything from drug related, vandalism, alcohol, fighting and petty thief to repeat offenders. Board of education members are seeking information into virtual school programs that may offer to theses students the chance to continue their education but in a different environment. 
 
In the state of Texas, âlegislature passed Senate Bill No. 975, authorizing the Texas Education Agency to invite interested schools to submit an application to join the Virtual School Pilot Program aimed at benefiting at-risk studentsâ (RUSHTON 2002). Southwest Preparatory of Texas joined the program last spring, âA strength of the Southwest Preparatory application was our schoolâs strong history of working with at-risk students. It is a favorite quote of Southwest Preparatory director of operations, Wes Roberts, that we ânot make the kid fit the system, but the system fit the kidâ (RUSHTON 2002). 
Orange County California, young manâs attendance began to drop and he missed his middle school graduation due to he was a young actor starring in a movie being filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. He faced the dilemma of giving up his acting career for his education until his mother discovered the Orange Lutheran High School Online (OLO) This young man now can continue his acting and still âread background material, engage in discussions with other students, take test, ask questions of his teacher and hands in assignmentsâ (RUSHTON 2002), OLO is not for the just for the wealthy children, for instance a young man living Tennessee is a only child whom must stay at home and help his mother run the family farm, while his father , Army Lieutenant stationed in Iraq, is away. He takes courses through OLO, currently he has grades of straight Aâs. He has even sent his fellow classmates photos of life on the farm including claves being born. âThe OLO student body consists of a mix of kids who have turned to eLearning for a variety of reasons. Some â called âblended studentsââgo to Lutheran High School, or one of many schools across the country, and use OLO to supplement their regular courseworkâ (RUSHTON 2002).

'''Cons'''&lt;u&gt;underline text&lt;/u&gt; of Virtual Schools;

West Salem Superintendent Jamie Skjeveland said, âFor a student to be successful in the virtual school system, they have to be highly motivated, self-starting, intelligent peopleâ According to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, Appleton eSchool serves a population that could include, but is not limited to, students who are expelled, homebound students, incarcerated students, transient students and students with extraordinary needs, to name a few.  âThe virtual schools that are in Wisconsin do a good job of marketing their product,â Onalaska Director of Instructional Services Fran Finco said, âThere are pros and cons to any system, the cons to virtual schools is we teach kids life skills as part of a curriculum, Iâm not sure you can get that sitting in front of a computer.â âCore curriculum is based on Wisconsinâs approved high school curriculum. The core courses of English, math, science, social studies and physical education meet the requirements of Wisconsinâs Department of Public Instructionâ  (COULEE 2006).  USA Today surveyed parents in Jan 2004 on their opinion of virtual schools, majority of the parents liked the flexibility of virtual school, however âThe Wisconsin Education Association Council thinks parents are taking the place of teachers in virtual schools â a violation of state law that requires all public school teachers to have a valid teaching licenseâ (COULEE 2006).  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC0987,#CC7864;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;BLUE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;. âWe cannot assume that our schools will naturally drift toward using technology effectively. We must commit to staying the course and making the changes necessary to reach our goals of educating every child. Together, we can use technology to ensure that no child is left behind.â -President George W. Bush
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

âTime magazine predicted the end to teaching as an occupation to be replaced by online educationâ. One Teacher in Wisconsin disagreed with the article stating âOnline education is a completely different paradigm than traditional, face-to-face education. It isn't for everyone. A different kind of &quot;teacher&quot; is required to make online education work. Online education is also different because it demands a high level of interaction to be effective. Students don't just read their textbooks or read materials placed online. They manipulate that material, reject some of it, replace some of it, constantly adding to the richness of the materials. Creating an interactive atmosphere is a complex skill. That interaction, though, is the most exciting element for students, as they work through an online class.

'''CONCLUSION'''&lt;u&gt;underline text&lt;/u&gt;
	
Virtual Schools are not seeking to eliminate the need for human Teachers. They are a new means that Parents, Teachers and the Boards of Education including the President to reach out to more children. The internet is here to stay, as peers to future generations of children and students we should harness the valuable resource and use it to our advantage and educate not just our back yard or our neighborhood but the entire world.

'''REACTION'''&lt;u&gt;underline text&lt;/u&gt;

I believe that Virtual programs are on the right path to expand the âNo child left behindâ program. Many rural schools are now able to offer children the same education as urban city schools. A school program in Mississippi that could not offered PCâs for the classroom and turned to other resources and now the students are building their own PCâs for the school to use. The online programs and opportunity to study classes recently not available have become motivational incentives for students to use. State Senates also see the positives of funding virtual school programs however, they have faced strict opposition from fellow senate members and School Board members. The biggest is the funding for online programs. The opposition feels that funds will be diverted from public and private schools and redirected to the online program.  If the two sides sit down and let cooler heads prevail than funds could be acquired through such ideas as the students in Mississippi, or possible collection drives asking owners to donate old PCâs and laptops to schools, to be reformatted and reused by future students. Another key complaint of virtual school is the losing out on âface timeâ and the interacting with fellow students, experiencing proms and football games. These people are seeing virtual schools with blinders on. The programs are intended to off another source to receive an education, the opportunity to pickup a class that their respective school does not offer.  Virtual school is not trying to eliminate real schools. If the doubters of the world would stop for a moment and see the whole picture, they too would see the positive sides to virtual classroom and online learning.

&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL&quot;&gt;
Virtual learning is the newest form of education in America. The Virtual High School, one of the first pre-college level virtual schools, was started in the state of Massachusetts back in 1996.  Started by the Hudson Public School System, this schools system currently services over 800 students in 400 schools spanning over 14 other states. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;RIGHT&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #E0FFFF;

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
&lt;B&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;     
&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
  
As technology improves, school districts have integrated it into their curriculum.  Problems such as bandwidth, available software, and shortages in technical support staff have diminished as the individual states have bought into this new form of learning. One recent report claims that half of courses in Grades 9 to 12 will be delivered online by 2019 (Hoover Institute).


Virtual Schools are online learning centers that allow students from varied backgrounds to enhance their learning.  Nearly 2/3 of all states have some form of online learning technology.  In Virginia the Virginia Virtual Advanced Placement School (http://www.virtualvirginia.org/) allows students to prepare for college as well as take AP courses on foreign language.
&lt;BR&gt;
There are many different types of online opportunities throughout American school systems including online AP and foreign language courses, Algebra, web design, Photoshop, desktop publishing, and CAD (Computer Aided Drawing) among many others.  The following link allows for further information for each states approach at online training.  http://mb2.ecs.org/reports/Report.aspx?id=1752&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''Advantages of online learning'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
There are many advantages to online education.  As fuel costs skyrocket, students can stay at home and learn allowing school districts to cut back on their bus routes.  One of the main concerns for parents in at risk neighborhoods are gangs and bullying.  With students studying online there is no peer pressure to wear the &quot;right&quot; clothes, join a gang, or be disruptive and threatening.  

High achievers can progress throughout the curriculum without having to wait on the rest of the class to &quot;catch up&quot;.  Online learning also allows students to spend more time with family and friends and less time waiting at bus stops in the cold and rain.  

Online learning can be either synchronous or asynchronous.  The ability to return back to a lesson and set your own schedule is another advantage of the virtual classroom.
&lt;BR&gt;

The state of Florida has been recognized as the #1 online experience.  It serves more than 50,000 students across the US. Students from K-12, as well as adults have the opportunity to take more than 90 courses, including GED, honors, and advanced placement classes. 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''Disadvantages of online learning'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#8B3626&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL&quot;&gt;
There are without question some disadvantages to online learning.  The student never gets to speak face to face with the instructor which inhibits mentoring.  The students are primarily responsible for staying motivated and on task.  Teachers cannot know if the student is watching a lecture while also watching TV and listening to their IPOD.

Also because students are not present, teachers cannot readily alter the method or approach of instruction, plumb for understanding, or try to further explain concepts by using new examples and illustrations which live-in person training allows.

The ability to socialize with peers is a major concern for online education.  Students who do not interact with one another on a daily basis do not learn skills such as conflict management, compromise, or social awareness.  Students who learn at home never get to interact with girls and boys of different ages, backgrounds, or cultures.  This could lead students to develop unhealthy attitudes towards people who are not like them.

Some medical professionals are concerned that students that do not interact with one another will not build up resistance to viruses at an early age which may make their later introduction to these germs much more dangerous.
Many families do not have the ability to purchase a computer with the technical requirements and networking necessary to participate in streaming video courses.  Also some school districts require the students to purchase workbooks and textbooks.

Some subject matter just cannot be adequately taught in an online format.  Music, art and many of the sciences cannot be fairly represented.  Some courses offer online simulations where normally a student would do lab work.  This is not a suitable substitution.
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''What is the future of online learning?'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
As technology continues to be developed children will continue to be comfortable using the latest tools in education.  Teachers and school divisions must use the most effective means of instruction to help the students succeed.  Instructors will need to remain technologically savvy and eager to implement these new methods into their training curriculum.
&lt;BR&gt;
Many educators are now calling for universal standards for online education.  To date there is no organizational association or national bureau that has effectively produced the essential principles necessary for online education to be effective.  Many are quite concerned that some children will be left behind in the new digital wave of instruction.  As these and other decisions are made about virtual schools, teacher will need to remain flexible and willing to learn and incorporate new technological advances into their teaching philosophy.

I agree with all the disadvantages you said about online schooling but the biggest concern that I think onlince schooling would have is cheating. How would the instructor ever know if the student is cheating. They say no one learns if you cheat and if the students are cheating then they won't fully understand the material the is to be understood. I do believe in the future that technology is going to be so advanced that students probably won't have to physically go to school. I didn't know it was so popular until I was doing my observation and the teachers were tellin me about how it works. I think the most effective way to teach is inside a classroom personally. The article was very interesting because I know a lot of people don't know how big the online classstroom courses are, I was interested in what you had to say about the topic.

As a typical 80's child, I understand better than most how to find something, almost anything, on the Internet. Many people throughout the world have even resorted to Christmas and grocery shopping via the World Wide Web. I check my personal email more than ten times a day. Like many other employees today, my work depends on email communication. Not only are office based businesses accessing their email multiple times throughout the work day, educators are using email for accessing information involving students, parents and school activities on a regular bases. As a parent you can now communicate directly with your childâs teacher in two or three clicks of your mouse. Each teacher has their own website, which includes homework assignments, the class schedule, syllabus, test dates and other pertinent information. Parents and students can now sign up to receive school updates via the text message feature on their personal cell phone. At the college level, students are required to sign up for this service in case of emergencies, i.e., school closings or in extreme cases a shooting.&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #56A5EC;border: solid 3px #CCFB5D; padding:1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;&gt; âThe first generation of 'Digital Natives' children who were born into and raised in the digital world- are coming of age, and soon our world will be reshaped in their image. Our economy, our politics, our culture and even the shape of our family life will be forever transformed.&quot; (John Palfrey &amp; Urs Gasser, 2008)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; An example of our generationâs transformation into &quot;digital natives&quot; is the news coverage of the 2007 Virginia Tech Shootings. Local news agencies used student video footage from their cell phones to update viewers with the events. One student caught others fleeing from a building via his cell phone and others took pictures of themselves and classmates while waiting inside the building. This is just one example of where technology has taken us. Another more obvious example is we are writing the curriculum for our class, i.e., articles etc. via Wikibooks, an online technology newly developed in the last couple of years.
In elementary school, my generation gained the ability to learn fractions and multiplication through computer programs like Mathblaster. Mathblaster ran on the now obsolete MS-DOS system, the Microsoft operating system used in the 80's. In middle school, my parents signed up for the infamous dial-up Internet connectivity, which didn't allow us to use the Internet and the phone at the same time. In high school, my generation gained the ability to go wireless. We used the computer for all of our library research, began communicating with friends in the same classroom, sitting in the seat next to you via chat rooms. Librarians informed us about popular search engines like Yahoo, Google and Dogpile to find sources for our papers. College professors suddenly started giving lectures about how to find &quot;legitimate&quot; information on the Internet for research purposes. They anticipated our use of the Internet as a source, but there was always a maximum placed on the amount that could be found from there. I strongly believe educators are worried students will not be able to do &quot;normal&quot; research without the aid of the Internet. Many of our jobs now depend on the Internet for communication and knowledge. One large field that has resorted to a wide amount of Internet use is journalism and other media related fields. In journalism, the Internet is used to find information on previous articles concerning topics, statistics on government, test scores on school websites and general background information on sources before an interview. It's now an understood requirement for journalists to understand how to blog and use the web for distributing their stories. Not only are they printed in a newspaper, but they are also posted online, which brings along the necessity of pictures and video.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Maiandra GD&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;A âdigital nativeâ is typically categorized as someone from Generation Y, a person born between the late 70's and early 90's. They are considered ânative speakersâ of common technological advances like the computer, IPod, cell phone, computer programs like Adobe Photoshop and gaming systems like Xbox 360, (Prensky, 2001). Blogs like MySpace and Facebook and video sites like YouTube are the digital nativesâ best friend and common means of gathering and disseminating information.  The other common categorization for someone in tune with the digital world is the term âdigital immigrantâ. A digital immigrant is someone who is familiar with everyday technology, but they werenât born in the 1980âs, an example would be parents and grandparents who are tech savvy, (Prensky, 2001).  Prensky clarifies the difference between the digital native and the digital immigrant by referring to the âdigital immigrant accent,â which basically informs us that a digital immigrant will hold onto their past way of doing things, (2001). &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #56A5EC;border: solid 3px #CCFB5D; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&quot;They have spent their entire lives surrounded by and using computers, videogames, digital music players, video cams, cell phones, and all the other toys and tools of the digital age. Today's average college grads have spent less than 5,000 hours of their lives reading, but over 10,000 hours playing video games (not to mention 20,000 hours watching TV). Computer games, email, the Internet, cell phones and instant messaging are integral parts of their lives.&quot; (Marc Prensky, 2001)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; âThe 'digital immigrant accent' can be seen in such things as turning to the Internet for information second rather than first, or in reading the manual for a program rather than assuming that the program itself will teach us to use it. Todayâs older folk were 'socialized' differently from their kids, and are now in the process of learning a new language,â (Prensky 2001). Today, teenagers, children and even adults have resorted to other means of entertainment, technological means specifically. Elementary age children are now indoors playing Halo with a foe from Australia or China on their new Xbox 360 through an international network called Xbox Live. My church uses video footage from YouTube to relate to younger attendees. I can update all of my friends and family with pictures of my daughter via email, MySpace and Facebook with a click. The ability to Photoshop a person or object into a photo and modify it to make it look like a photo someone took is a piece of cake for my younger brother. In the article, ''What makes a digital native different,'' Marta Strickland said, &quot;The digital natives of today have been born into an always-on culture. For many children that are growing up with early adopters for parents, they have never known a time without cell phones, they have never known a time without wireless internet buzzing through the walls of their home. Connectivity flows in the air.&quot; This statement is true of all of us in the digital era, what would we do without our technological advances?




&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Maiandra GD&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#56A5EC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apple education, Digital tools for digital students states:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/Font&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Digital students are hypercommunicators: they are in contact with their peers and technological world via multiple venues&lt;li&gt; Digital students are multitaskers: it's not unusual for a digital student to watch TV, surf the internet, talk on their cell phone, complete homework and download music onto their MP3 player all at the same time&lt;li&gt;Digital students are goal oriented: with the aid of their multitasking, they complete multiple taskings with no issue, they want to succeed and they expect to.

==&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Maiandra GD&quot; SIZE=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#56A5EC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issues &amp; Problems involving Education&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/Font&gt;==



-----



&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Maiandra GD&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt; One of the largest issues teachers and instructors are coming in contact with in the classroom is plagiarism and cheating. The digital native is so comfortable with the &quot;copy and paste&quot; function that the amount of plagiarism cases in schools and universities has gone up noticeably, (McNeely, 2005). &quot;Plagiarism is the academic infraction of choice. How can it not be, though? Information is easily available from the Internet, especially from sites like Wikipedia [and] old term papers are being sold online,&quot; (McNeely, 2005). Another issue that education will be facing in the very near future coincides with how digital native's learn; &quot;interactivity&quot; in the classroom between the student and the teacher, (McNeely 2005). Another large issue schools are facing today is a miscommunication in translation between teachers, the digital immigrants and students, the digital natives. âOur Digital Immigrant instructors, who speak an outdated language (that of the pre-digital age), are struggling to teach a population that speaks an entirely new language,â (Prensky, 2001). &lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Maiandra GD&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #56A5EC;border: solid 2px #CCFB5D; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&quot;Our students have changed radically. Todayâs students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach.,&quot; (Prensky, 2001) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; Ben McNeely, a contributing author in the book, ''Educating the Net Generation,'' tells us that the digital native generation learns differently than past generations, i.e., through, social interaction, teamwork, peer engagement and action and visual aids, (2005). &quot;Traditional lectures are not fulfilling the learning potential of typical students today. Distance education and online courses donât work well with Net Genersâthe social component of learning is required,&quot; (McNeely, 2005). Along with evolving technology comes how students learn, which in this generation is through contact and social interaction. The overall environment in the classroom will need to adapt to this onslaught of new learning and reasoning. Technology is going so far that itâs designing childrenâs toys that mimic advance everyday technology, such as the cell phone. ''Texting made easy for your tot: At least new LeapFrog toy will keep 'em off your cell!,'' said, âToddlers can soon obsessively text and type like their parents on a pint-sized personal digital assistant made by LeapFrog,â (Melago, 2009). As disturbing as this is, itâs true. Iâm constantly pulling my cell phone out of the hands of my sixteen-month-old toddler. Not only is the education industry starting to cater to the digital native, but even the toy industry. Two large, intertwining issues that have an effect on technology in the classroom are computer access and available funds. Access to the Internet coincides directly with funding. Not everyone can afford a computer or the monthly bill to obtain Internet access. The classroom teacher I am currently observing informed his students that if they needed to stay after class to type their business letter on his computer, they could do it that afternoon. The idea that high school juniors don't have access to a computer, even without the Internet, is appalling. &quot;The inability to move between platformsâand the lack of accelerated fundamental skillsâis a major hindrance to learning technology,&quot; (McNeely 2005).

==&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Maiandra GD&quot; SIZE=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#56A5EC&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/Font&gt;==



-----

&lt;p&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Maiandra GD&quot; SIZE=&quot;3&quot;&gt; Technology in the classroom will always be growing and changing. Educators and students alike will need the ability to adjust to current and future changes in the digital world. The digital native population is growing every year, along with the digital immigrant population. Working together to move forward in this ever changing relationship and environment will not only aid the student, but education as a whole. Digital natives are now integrating into the school systems, so another change will happen soon. Original digital natives will educate the new generation of the &quot;digital native&quot;. As an original digital native, I will be educating new digital natives, students that understand information and technology that I am currently adjusting to. It's a never-ending circle that requires finesse, understanding, and the willingness to learn.

'''Learning Targets'''

Readers should be able to define the terms âdigital native âand digital immigrant.â

Readers should be able to describe the differences between a âdigital nativeâ and a âdigital immigrant.â

Readers should be able to identify at least one argument against educational reform for digital natives.



'''Introduction'''

Ideally, the field of education strives to meet the needs of all students. Educators use tools such as, research, assessment and training, to build a foundation for teaching. However, more and more teachers are finding it difficult to keep students engaged in the classroom. Topics such as violence in schools, differentiated instruction, No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and standardized testing have all been critically evaluated with regard to student performance and engagement in the classroom. However, there is also another theory being discussed and that is the idea that this newest generation is completely different from past generations and teaching methodologies need to change. This new generation of students being taught was born roughly between the years 1980 â 1994 (Carey, 2006). Some of the terms used to classify this generation are, generation Y, the net generation and digital natives. For the purpose of this article, the focus will be on digital natives.






'''Digital Natives'''

What is a digital native? A digital native refers to the current generation of students (born between 1980 and 1994) that have grown up with technology and are âânative speakersâ of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internetâ (Prensky, 2001, p. 1). This term was first used by Marc Prensky, founder and CEO of Games2Train (Prensky, 2002). To explain further, in their paper, The 'Digital Natives' Debate: A Critical Review of the Evidence, Sue Bennett, Karl Maton and Lisa Kervin (2008) describe the characteristics of digital natives as follows: 

1.	Young people of the digital native generation possess sophisticated knowledge of and skills with information technologies. 

2.	As a result of their upbringing and experiences with technology, digital natives have particular learning preferences or styles that differ from earlier generations of students. (Bennett et al., 2008, p. 777). 

It is these differences in learning preferences and styles that have been the focus of most research.


'''Digital Natives [[Image:Microsoft_Keyboard.jpg|75px|]] vs. Digital Immigrants [[Image:Triumph-gabriele25.jpg|75px|]]'''  

Prensky (2005) believes that there is a fundamental difference between digital natives and prior generations. He describes those individuals born before 1984, which have knowledge of a world before technology, as digital immigrants. He explains: 

I refer to those of us who were not born into the digital world as digital immigrants. We have adopted many  aspects of the technology, but just like those who learn another language later in life, we retain an &quot;accent&quot; because we still have one foot in the past. (p. 9) 
Prensky sees the differences between digital natives and immigrants as a major deficiency in education. Although Prensky and others have been discussing these ideas centering on digital natives prior to 2001, the topic has become even more prevalent.


Noting Prenskyâs and otherâs research, Gregor E. Kennedy, Terry S. Judd, Anna Churchward, Kathleen Gray and Kerri-Lee Krauseet (2008) explain the perceived opposition seen between digital natives and immigrants: 

[Prensky] labeled lecturers in higher education âDigital Immigrantsâ; foreigners in the digital lands of the Net Generation, and regarded the disparity between the Natives and the Immigrants as the âthe biggest single problem facing education todayâ (p. 2). The preferences and skills that characterise the Digital Natives were said to be incompatible with the current teaching practices of the Immigrants. Prensky and other commentators (Oblinger, 2003; Frand, 2000) suggest that because of this disparity educators need to adjust their pedagogical models to suit the new kind of learner they are encountering in this new generation of students. (p. 109)

They go on to explain that the above ideas are made on the âgeneral assumption that students coming into universities have had a comparatively universal and uniform digital upbringing. It is assumed that the technological experiences of students are more or less homogeneous and that most, if not all, incoming university students are Digital Nativesâ (Kennedy et al., 2008). Because Prenskyâs research focuses on the gap between the natives and immigrants, there is little consideration with regard to the consistency of access to technology among digital natives from a variety of backgrounds.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

'''Comparisons taken from Marc Prenskyâs article, Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants.''' 

'''Digital Native Students'''				

â¢	used to receiving information really fast

â¢	like to parallel process and multi-task

â¢	prefer their graphics before their text

â¢	prefer random access (like hypertext)

â¢	function best when networked

â¢	thrive on instant gratification and frequent rewards

â¢	prefer games to âseriousâ work


'''Digital Immigrant Teachers'''

â¢	teach â slowly, step-by-step, one thing at a time

â¢	donât believe their students can learn successfully while watching TV or listening to music

â¢	think learning canât (or shouldnât) be fun
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''Digital Natives and Education'''

While Prensky and others continue to cite research in support of their argument for restructuring education to meet the needs of digital natives, not everyone is convinced that reform is the answer. Bennett, Maton and Kervin argue that more evidence and discussion is needed before action is taken (Bennett et al., 2008). They explain, âWithout critical rational discussion, little progress can be made towards a genuine debate about digital natives. Neither dismissive skepticism nor uncritical advocacy enable understanding of whether the phenomenon of digital natives is significant and in what ways education might need to change to accommodate itâ (Bennett ''et al.'', 2008). 


In his article, Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants: Some Thoughts from the Generation Gap, Timothy VanSlyke (2003) also questions Prenskyâs idea of education reform. He states: âBut before we discard all of our digital immigrant notions of teaching and learning, and before we turn to video games and simulations as the primary modes of instruction, we should answer a number of questions. First among these is whether all of today's students fit Prensky's definition of digital natives. Are all students, for example, exposed to information technology and video games to the same extent? What are the demographic differences?â (VanSlyke, 2003). Van Slyke explores Prenskyâs native/ immigrant analogy to give further details about his questions. He is critical of Prenskyâs assumption that students arenât capable of learning from traditional methods. He explains:


We can learn much from looking at the digital natives and immigrants as diverging cultures, but we need not take the analogy too far. Education does need to adapt and evolve with the times, and educators need to understand the learning styles of their students, but we do not have to assume that our students are incapable of learning from or communicating with the digital immigrants even if we suspect that their thought patterns are different from our own. (VanSlyke, 2003)

'''Quoted from Timothy VanSlyke's Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants: Some Thoughts From the Generation Gap

''One of the most significant problems I see with Prensky's description of the digital native culture is the g
eneralization that all of today's students fit the stereotype of the kid glued to the computer or the television 
20 hours a day. A typical classroom is much more diverse, with students coming from a range of backgrounds. Many 
do not have computers at home, some have disabilities, and some are simply not interested in computer games. Can 
a computer game adapt its lessons to this diverse population?'''''





&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;






While Van Slyke (2003) understands that technology can play an important part in education, he also recognizes that teaching goes beyond equipment (2003). He stresses the following points about good teaching:

1.	it aims to improve students' ability to engage in higher-order thinking; 

2.	it recognizes the diversity of learners' abilities and needs; 

3.	it reflects an awareness of both the complexity of the learning process and the need to make adjustments in different circumstances

In a sense, Van Slyke is arguing that there is already a kind of educational restructuring taking place in the classroom everyday and it is called teaching.










'''Conclusion'''

If this new generation is so different from previous ones, to the point that even the learning style is different, how does this affect teaching? And if itâs true that todayâs teachers are indeed digital immigrants, what does this mean for education? At the very least, education will continue to implement and meet technology standards as required. As for an entire restructuring of the education system for the sole purpose of meeting âdigital nativesâ needs, there seems to be a need for more data to justify such a significant action. There are too many questions concerning the accuracy of statements that insist that everyone born to this new generation is indeed a âdigital nativeâ and that they can no longer learn through the same teaching strategies by which past generations were taught.


As Prensky and others continue to focus their arguments on education reform to reach digital natives, others will continue to sift through all of the research to gain a better understanding of this unique generation. One thing is certain; as technology advances, and our world continues to change, this topic will continue to gain popularity.

== Introduction ==
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
Education is evolving so rapidly in the way of technology which makes it hard for the world to keep up.  J. Johnson, C. Chapman and J. Dyer (2006) state, âThe past three decades have seen the rapid development of new and emerging technologies revolutionizing the way we live, work, and learnâ (J. Johnson, C. Chapman and J. Dyer, 2006, P.1).  Education started off as a traditional classroom and is now integrating more toward technology based learning.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;

== Traditional-Centered Classrooms ==
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
Traditional classrooms are reserved teachers who have a system.  Reserved teachers have their own way of thinking and like to teach things a certain way.  The classroom is set a certain way, the students read from the book, and there is little or no technology.  Perhaps this does not have to be a bad thing.  There are a few subjects that are difficult to learn through the computer, like math for example.  Patrick Suppes, a great educator, gives his expert opinion on traditional classrooms:  âHearing lectures and listening to someone elseâs talk seem to be almost psychologically essential to learning complex subjects, at least as far as ordinary learners are concernedâ (Suppes, 1969, par. 4).  Also a traditional classroom seems to be more regulated.  Some teachers are not willing to change the way they teach, perhaps some students do not want to change the way they are taught by learning new technology.

On the other hand, traditional classroom lacks the technology aspect of education.  Certain students need individual attention to learn or understand the material.  In a traditional classroom, students who require more individual attention may be left behind.  The opportunity for a customized learning experience is not as possible as it is in a technology integrated classroom.  The use of technology allows for students to learn at a comfortable pace while integrating more collaborative learning tools, like group projects, that better simulate a real world environment.  This classroom also frees the teacher to give more personalized attention to those who need it.  âWe need to continue moving teacher education away from the traditional sink-or-swim model of field experienceâ¦â (Zeichner, 2006, P.9).&lt;/font&gt;

== Technology Integration ==
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
This integration of technology makes it more possible for teachers to grow and more importantly, possible for students to grow.  What is technology integration?  âTechnology integration is using computers effectively and efficiently in the general content areas to allow students to learn how to apply computer skills in meaningful waysâ (Dockstader, 1999, P.1).  Incorporating technology into the curriculum does not mean just teaching the students how to use the programs, but how to apply these softwareâs to real-world situations.  Technology integration is having instruction drive technology, not technology drive instruction.  In other words, technology should be used as a tool for teaching, not the focus of the lesson.  Holland (2005) explained how a third grade teacher needed to teach her students to distinguish between fact and opinion according to the core curriculum (Holland, 2005, par.4).  So she taught the concept using a digital camera and a simple processing activity.  The students took pictures of them, printed them out, and wrote five facts and five opinions about the picture.  Her students got so much out of the lesson, like using analytical skills to decipher the difference between what fact is and what opinion is.  This is an extremely necessary real work tool they were taught in an entertaining way.&lt;/font&gt;  
 &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #56A5EC;
border: solid 10px #CCFB5D; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''Click the link below:'''  The following picture displays a technology integrated classroom whereas the teacher had one of his/her students come to the front of the class to work out a problem on the smart board to better her understanding in a subject.  A '''smart board''' is a computerized screen that functions just like a computer and allows you to touch the pull-down screen and write on it.  http://cobbcast.cobbk12.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/mtb_21cc_2.jpg
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
Some people however, not just teachers, find it harder to adapt to the new technology.  âFor many adults, all this digital activity is a source of high anxietyâ (Tapscott, 1999, P.7).  For the younger generation who grew up with the technology, it is easier for them to make this transition.  According to Hollandâs article, some teachers that have been teaching in the traditional fashion for most of their career refuse to learn advanced technology.  Not because these teachers do not want to prepare their students for the future, but because they find it difficult to incorporate technology into the curriculum.  One teacher in Hollandâs (2005) article writes, âI am not a computer person.â  Then Holland goes on to say,âWell maybe youâre not, but face it-we live in a digital age-an age for which we must prepare our students.  We werenât all born knowing to double-click a mouse any more than we exited the womb reciting multiplication facts.  We all learn in baby stepsâ (Holland, 2005, P.3).  To some degree, people focus too much on the debate of how the student should be taught.  The teachers are forgetting why they are here and are taking time away from the students learning by fighting the integration.&lt;/font&gt;

The link below is from '''TeacherTube'''.  It is a video on integrating smartboards into the classroom.

== Author's Opinion ==
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
I believe technology will make education far better than anyone could have imagined.  I remember trying to keep myself awake in class because the teacher did nothing to keep me engaged in the material.  I will incorporate much technology into my classroom so that my students will be able to experience hands-on and will be inspired to collaborate with other classmates.  I think Suppes (1969) expressed it best when he said, âI would claim that the wise use of technology and science, particularly in education, presents a major opportunity and challengeâ (Suppes, 1969, par. 1).  However, just because I feel so strongly towards the use of technology and think it is the future of education, does not mean there is not more to be done.  Technology is growing so quickly, there is still much we do not know and bugs to be worked out.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;

== Conclusion ==
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
Education has progressed immensely over the last fifteen years.  It has gone from lectures and textbooks to digital cameras and computers in the classroom.  Everybody is working together to make this transition from a traditional-centered classroom to a technology-integrated classroom.  The future of education is the key to our childrenâs learning process and their opportunities ahead.  âIt is difficult to predict how education will change over the next decade let alone the next century, but there will most certainly be changes in pedagogies which more readily recognize the way young people learn with new technologiesâ (J. Johnson, C. Chapman and J. Dyer, 2006).&lt;/font&gt;

==Introduction==

In almost any school across the country, you are bound to find at least one piece of technology that is being used in the classroom.  Society is flooded with the latest technological expansion that assures to make our lives easier. âIn 1965, Gordon Moore, predicted that the capacity of a computer chip will double every 18 monthsâ (Hofsterrer, 1995). When he made this prediction, he surely didnât expect it would become literally true. Living in a world of constant change is not easy, and predicting the environment of the coming changes brings about the acceleration pace of technology advances.  From classroom settings to home use, technology is now a part of how children learn, play, and communicate.

===Integrating Technology in the Classroom===


The word integrate, according to The Merriam-Websterâs Dictionary (2001, p. 401)  is defined as âto form, coordinate, or blend into a functioning whole.â It is obvious that if the world depends on technology, children should be educated in how to use this technology and educators should teach using this technology.  Sprague, Kopfman, and Dorsey noted that technology integration occurs when a teacher draws content knowledge and instructive knowledge to provide a learning experience (1998). Technology integration involves effective computer use in the general content areas so that can computer skills in meaningful waysâ (Dockstarder, 1999).  Much of the discussion about schools and information technology in the 1980s and 1990s has focused on how the technology could be integrated with the existing well thought-out life in schools (Dias 2001). If the mission  is to plead with teachers to use them, then it is reasonable to try to position them  into schools as they are now.


Professor James J. OâDonnell quotes on his idea of integrating technology in the curriculum  âIt should support student performance of an authentic task and it should be integrated in activities that are a core part of the classroom curriculum&quot;(OâDonnell, 1997).  When schools first introduced technology into the classroom, it was basically for drills, practice, games, and busywork.  As the demand for K-12 technology use increases, many teachers feel unprepared to integrate technology into the classrooms (Rodrigues, 1997).  Technology integration is a necessity in preparing teachers for todayâs and tomorrowâs world.  Teachers must learn to use technology and must allow it to change their present teaching paradigm.


Sandholtz, Ringstaff, and Dwyer (1997), produced the Stages of Instructional Evolution, an adoption model for the use of technology in the classroom.  The model illustrates the five stages of the thought and practice exploits when integrating technology.  The five stages are entry, adoption, adaptation, appropriation, and invention.


â¢Entry- Teachers learn the basics of using technology

â¢Adoption- Teachers use technology to support traditional instruction

â¢Adaptation- Teachers integrate new technologies into traditional classroom practices and students use technology, such as, word processors, databases, and computer-assisted software for instruction.

â¢Appropriation- Teachers begin to recognize the helpfulness of technology and students work at computers regularly as cooperative, project-based instruction 

â¢Invention- Learning becomes more student-centered. Discovering new uses for technology occurs.


===Future Technology in the Classroom===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;The best way to predict the future is to invent it.&quot; 
-Gordon Moore, Intel's Chairman, 1965

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Schools are aware that buildings need to replace aging structures and/or to support increasing student enrollment.  Classrooms are also needed to not only meet the teaching and learning needs of today, but are flexible enough to adapt to new pedagogies, learning technologies and instructional tools (Community Learning Network, 1996).  


With an ongoing debate as to what role technology should play in the classrooms give school administers a tough decision. Administrators and teachers should realize that waiting to apply a technology plan only deceives students of important learning opportunities.  Administrators should support their teachers by formulating a strategic planning committee and find ways not only to provide their schools with hardware, software, and networking tools but also to provide all staff with much-needed technology training. As Joel Baker states in Discovering the Future âThose who say it canât be done should get out of the way of those who are doing itâ(Barker, 1993)!


The technologies currently available now will change and merge, at an increasingly rapid pace.  Referring to acceleration, many practices from the past are now rarely used or even considered, because there are now faster, more proficient, and interactive ways to complete the same responsibilities (Herdman, 1995). Traditionally, schools and classrooms have tended to discourage many forms of collaboration.  In contrast, success in school relies on collaboration and teamwork. A number of schools in the nation have invested in technology such as: overhead projectors, VCRâs, computers, digital cameras, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), and etc. Johanson from Western Illinois University states that we should now expect to prosper and develop with collaboration applications between desktop computers, which may be hooked to a projection system so that many people in the same location can participate (1994).  All desktops will be connected through the Internet.  An instructor will be able to sit at a desktop workstation and communicate with a â classroomâ of students, each of whom has workstation in front of him and a connection to the Internet.  The students no longer have to be in the same room; they can interact with other students and teachers in different locations (Lick, 2001). 
 

No one can accurately predict what new technologies will appear over the next 15 years.  But Storslee, Yohe, and Matte 2003, defines the basic and advanced classroom.  The basic classroom has the least amount of technology accessible for every classroom.  Faculty will have contact to media from the Internet and from standard video sources.  The classroom is designed for subjects that do not require advance technology on a daily basis. The room has the capability of adding new technology as needed for instruction (Storslee, Yohe, and Matte, 2003).  The basic classroom will consists of various type of equipment such as the ones listed below.


&lt;u&gt;''Basic Classroom Equipment List''&lt;/u&gt;

â¢     Wireless Internet Access

â¢     Projection Overhead Projector  or Digital screen 

â¢     Instructor Computer or Computer Docking station will the connections for new technologies

â¢     DVD/CD/Cable TV access

â¢     Tables and Chairs: Will be movable so they can be rearranged for different types of collaboration.  The table can be rectangular or circular in shape.


The advanced classroom includes all the technology of the basic classroom except these rooms will be setup for videotaping and direct access to various educational material at your fingertips.  These rooms have tables, wireless access, and a large video screen.  Each table is wired for polling while still being able to move.  The room includes a protected area able of storing laptops for circulation to the students.  The room is prepared to handle distance-learning classes with live video broadcast capability and a wide variety of educational classes.  The class can be used for seminars, workshops and a wide variety of special events. The equipment for these classrooms are listed below (Storslee, Yohe, and Matte, 2003).


&lt;u&gt;''The Advance Classroom Equipment List''&lt;/u&gt;

â¢	Wireless Internet Access

â¢	Projection: Overhead Projector or Digital screen built into the wall for each section   of the room.

â¢	Computing System: Instructor Computer or Computer Docking station with all the connections.

â¢	DVD/CD/Cable TV access (through projection system)

â¢	Laptops for each table (stored in a secure area for distribution)

â¢	Printer

â¢	Video camera for TV based distance education programs

â¢	3D Holographic Projection (displays an image floating in space)
 
â¢	Display system (capable of 3D representations of people or objects)

â¢	Tables and Chairs: The tables and chairs will be movable for different types of collaboration.  The table can be rectangular or circular in shape.  The room can be divided in several rooms or opened for large group interaction.

==Conclusion==

Computers, the Internet, distance learning, and other educational technologies are a fact of life.  Traditional textbooks and worksheets, along with traditional learning environments may soon fade away.  Administrators, teachers, and parents that hope the technology trend will pass them by because they do not understand how technology can be integrated into the traditional educational system. The longer they delay, the more they are depriving their childrenâs futures.  One thing is clear: âTime waits for No Man.â

'''My name is Jill Newhart-Fortner.''''' 
 
'''About Me:'''
I live in Chesapeake, VA with my husband Brian and my two daughters, Alexandra and Allison.  I also have a Golden Retriever named Zoe.  My older daughter is 12 and in 6th grade and my younger daughter is 8 and in the 3rd grade.
I have lived in Chesapeake all my life except for two years when I lived in Germany.  I loved living there and traveled with my swim team all over Europe. It is my hope that I will be able to take my daughters and my husband to Germany one day to see where we used to live.

I am a Recreation Specialist for the City of Virginia Beach in Parks and Recreation.  I work in the Aquatics Department and I enjoy my job.  As part of my job, I go to Virginia Beach Elementary Schools and teach children about Water Safety.  I have been a lifeguard for 15 years, a swim instructor for 12 years, and I teach lifeguarding courses to certify lifeguards.  I also help to coach a recreational swim team and in my spare time I officiate High School swim and dive meets.

I am attending ODU in pursuit of my degree in Teacher preparation, PK-6.  It is difficult to work full time, have a family and go to school but achieving my goal to receive my degree is very important to me and my family.  To set an example for my daughters is also a motivation for me to finish.

'''My Education Philosophy:'''
I believe that education is the key to all doors.  Everyone should have the chance to establish the foundation that education provides.  I think that it is important for educators to understand that students learn in different ways, it can take new ways to introduce knowledge to have the ability to reach the diverse learner. I believe that all children have the potential to be successful in their educational endeavors, it is the job as an educator for us to do our very best to get to know our students and by doing that we know their strengths and weaknesses so that we are able to relate to them on their level. It has been my experience as an aquatics teacher that students learn better when they trust their teacher.  I know that many students come from very diverse backgrounds and experiences, teaching gives educators a chance to be a positive role model while providing knowledge. I can honestly say that teaching would be fulfilling a lifelong dream.  There are many ways that I have already had the pleasure of seeing how my hard work and dedication to students can make a difference. By teaching someone to swim and watch them have the ability to actually swim the length of the pool or teaching a lifeguard and taking my family to the beach and seeing one of my guards in the stand.  Those are days that make all the struggles worth it and I know that teaching in an elementary setting will also have those great rewards.  I have had many positive experiences in education and each teacher that has been influential in my life in a positive way, always made learning interesting and exciting.  I hope that I can also have that influence on my students one day.

== &lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;''' Sexual Education: Reducing teen pregnancy and raising awareness or promoting &quot;safe sex&quot; activity among the youth.'''&lt;/center&gt; ==
&lt;center&gt;''By Bianca N. Penny-Harley''&lt;/center&gt;




= '''Learning Targets:''' =

*To have a clear understanding of what sex education implements in the school system.

*Understand the targeted objective of the sex education course. 

*Determine for yourself if sex education has a positive or negative influence on students.



== '''Introduction''' ==
So what exactly is sex education suppose to teach the students in our schools today? Sex education started in 1963 as an extended biology class.  The main goal was to increase the knowledge of our children about their bodies and how the sexual organs worked.  At this present day are we aiming towards the same objective? The sex education curriculum has shifted from being an introduction to sexuality and the idea of abstinence to a more explicit class about how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, abortion, contraception, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, birth, drugs, alcohol, dating and marriage due to the major sexual activity we see among the youth of today.  What is the message we really are conveying to the students teaching this class? Are schools taking over the roles of parenthood discussing in detail sexuality in the schools.  The focus of sex education has come a long way and whether you are in favor or against it, you should be able to develop a better understanding of what effects it has on students.

&quot;I am convinced that it's of primordial importance to learn more everyday than the year before. After all, what is education but a process by which a person begins to learn how to learn?&quot; Peter Ustinov&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== '''Schools and sex education: Does it work?''' ==
by James W. Stout, MD and Frederick P. Rivara, MD, MPH

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Sex education curriculum has come a long way, from having as main focus the promotion of abstinence, decrease of masturbation and prevention of intercourse to adjusting it's point of view to the culture of the schools today promoting safe sex. Along the years the development of the sex education curriculum has been looked at a positive instruction for students not only to gain the knowledge to be able to refrain from inappropriate sexual activities but also as a diseases prevention matter.  The implementation of sex education curriculum was thought to be directly linked to the increase of sexual activity in the younger population but this has not been fully proven. It is more likely to believe that there are other more influential factors such as parental sex education and socioeconomic status.

== '''Condom Nation: Government Sex Education Promotes Teen Pregnancy''' ==

As she is confirmed into the Clinton Administration, Dr. Joycelyn Elders has a problem with the sex education classes offered in our public schools. She believes that they are not providimg enough information to our students. These courses have helped to increase the use of contraceptives, but they have also increased the rates of sexual activity, sexually transmitted diseases, and teen pregnancies.


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;30%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFCC00;

*'''Contraceptive education increased the odds of 14-year-olds, starting intercourse by 50 percent.'''    Government Family Planning Study
 
*'''By 1993 the number of school based clinics grew from 12 to 325.''' according to the Center of Population Options. 

*'''Between 1987 and 1991, during Dr. Elders time as director of Public Health in Arkansas, the teenage-birth rate rose 14%''' 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


In the midst of these facts presented to our government, the Clinton administration still urged an expanding sex education from kindergarten through college. The Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) launched in 1964 helped form the bases of the sex-ed guidelines of the curriculum in public schools. By the time children got to second grade they were thought to mold with clay genital organs as well as practice fitting condoms on cucumbers. As sex education develops to meet the needs of our society the topic of alternative forms of sex expression such as oral sex, anal sex, masturbation and homosexuality are added. With the accessibility of this information the need of clinics, abortions without parental consent and accessible contraceptives grew. State and federal expenditure rise from $350 Million to $645 million dollars in 1991. This amount of money was invested in contraceptives alone. Government family planning argues that even thought there is evidence that sex education has increased the amount of sexual activity in students, it has also increased the use of contraceptives and there for the need of continuing sex education programs. 

The Guttmacher Institute, research affiliate with Planned Parenthood states in a published article that, &quot;the existing data did not yet constitute consistent, compelling evidence that sex education programs are effective in reducing teen pregnancies&quot;. The author ponders as to why the persistent push of these government programs to promote sex education? Despite all the facts, the Government still believed that if women did not have easy access to condoms and contraceptives, they were more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. As a solution she does not suggest cutting sex education but the cutting subsidized programs such as free contraceptives and condoms to adjust people’s behavior. With the passing of parent consent laws it has been proven in many states such as Massachusetts and Missouri that when minors are no longer able to get abortions and purchase contraceptives without adult consent the percentage of risky behavior decreases. Two programs that have shown some progress in slowing down the rate of sexual activity among students are: Sex Respect and Teen-Aid. These programs not only teach about abstinence as the healthiest sexual lifestyle but also discuss the emotional side of sexual activity. After this debate and the evidence presented the author arrives at the conclusion that sex education does corrupt the youth.

== '''Diversity: Classroom Practice and Law''' ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #4E9258;
border: solid 10px #387C44; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
How well do you handle diversity in your everyday life?  Would you be scared to work with disabled children? How would you approach a student who is dealing with gender identification problems? Would you be able to teach a non English culture student American history without offending his or her original culture? How would you be able to help a code switching student with a grammar problem? You should be able to come with answers to these questions after reading this chapter. 

Schools are a miniature replica of the type of people our world consists of. Throughout the chapter you will be introduced to topics such as: inclusion, ADHD children, non American cultured students such a code switcher, students with gender issues and the challenge of the gifted. Like the real world, schools have laws by which they should abide by. Some of these laws are made to protect the student’s best interest during their educational years. Some laws are to protect the teachers, administrative, and principal personnel so that they are able to manage effectively the educational environment for students.  

The objective of this chapter is to introduce to you school practices and law information that are used to handle the students mentioned above. After reading this chapter you should be able to develop a better understanding on how to handle and manage types of students within legal guidelines and school practices if ever encountered in a classroom during your teaching career. No matter what subject you will teach, you will be faced with at least one or more types of diverse students within a classroom. It would be in your best interest to gain the knowledge to be able to manage the situation and offer a positive learning experience for all.  As teachers we are encouraged to become chameleons throughout our career. Learning for and from our students is the best achievement we should meet to become the facilitator they need to succeed.
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

      <comment>/* For Mac OS X */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Where to get a compiler ===
When you select your compiler you must take in consideration your system OS, your personal preferences and the documentation that you can get on using it.

In case you do not have, want or need a compiler installed on you machine, you can use a WEB free compiler available at http://ideone.com (or http://codepad.org but you will have to change the code not to require interactive input). You can always get one locally if you need it.

There are many compilers and even more IDEs available, some are free and open source. IDEs will often include in the installation the required compiler (being GCC the most common).

==== [[w:GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] ====
One of most mature and compatible compilers is GCC. Also known as The GNU Compiler Collection is a free set of compilers developed by the Free Software Foundation, with [[w:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]] as one of the main architects.  

There are many different pre-compiled GCC binaries on the Internet; some popular choices are listed below (with detailed steps for installation).You can easily find information on the GCC website on how to do it under another OS.

{{NOTE|Is often common that the implementation language of a compiler to be C (since it is normally first the system language above assembly that new systems implement). GCC did in the end of May 2005, [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.devel/114407 got the green light] to start moving the core code-base to C++. Considering that this is the most common used compiler and an open source implementation, it was an extremely positive step to the compiler and the language in general.}}

==== IDE (Integrated development environment) ====
[[Image:Vim.png|right|caption|thumbnail|300px|Graphical Vim under [[w:GTK+|GTK2]]]]
[[w:Integrated development environment|Integrated development environment]] is a software development system, that often includes an editor, compiler and debugger in an integrated package that is distributed together. Some IDEs will require the user to make the integration of the components themselves, and others will refer as the IDE to the set of separated tools they use for programming.

A good IDE is one that permits the programmer to use it to abstract and accelerate some of the more common tasks and at the same time provide some help in reading and managing the code. Except for the compiler the C++ Standard has no control over the different implementations. Most IDEs are visually oriented, especially the new ones, they will offer graphical debuggers and other visual aids, but some people will still prefer the visual simplicity offered by potent text editors like [[Learning the vi Editor/Vim|Vim]] or [[w:Emacs|Emacs]].

When selecting an IDE, remember that you are also investing time to become proficient in its use, completeness, stability and portability across OSs will be important.

For Microsoft Windows, you have also the Microsoft Visual Studio Express, currently freely available (but with reduced functionalities), it includes a C++ compiler that can be used from the command line or the supplied IDE.

In the book [[C++ Programming/Weblinks#Compilers_and_IDEs|Appendix B:External References]] you will find references to other freely available compilers and IDEs you can use.

# When the &quot;Select Packages&quot; window appears, scroll down to the heading &quot;Devel&quot; and click on the &quot;+&quot; by it. In the list of packages that now displays, scroll down and find the &quot;gcc-c++&quot; package; this is the compiler. Click once on the word &quot;Skip&quot;, and it should change to some number like &quot;3.4&quot; etc. (the version number), and an &quot;X&quot; will appear next to &quot;gcc-core&quot; and several other required packages that will now be downloaded.
# Click &quot;next&quot; and the compiler as well as the Cygwin tools should start downloading; this could take a while. While you are waiting, go to http://www.crimsoneditor.com and download that free programmer's editor; it is powerful yet easy to use for beginners.
# Once the Cygwin downloads are finished and you have clicked &quot;next&quot;, etc. to finish the installation, double-click the Cygwin icon on your desktop to begin the Cygwin &quot;command prompt&quot;. Your home directory will automatically be set up in the Cygwin folder, which now should be at &quot;C:\cygwin&quot; (the Cygwin folder is in some ways like a small Unix/Linux computer on your Windows machine -- not technically of course, but it may be helpful to think of it that way).
# Type &quot;g++&quot; at the Cygwin prompt and press &quot;enter&quot;; if &quot;g++: no input files&quot; or something like it appears you have succeeded and now have the gcc C++ compiler on your computer (and congratulations -- you have also just received your first error message!).

''MinGW + DevCpp-IDE''

# Go to http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html ,(Severly outdated last update 2005)(http://orwelldevcpp.blogspot.com/) (Updated Branch project) choose the version you want (eventually scrolling down), and click on the appropriate download link! For the most current version, you will be redirected to http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html
# Scroll down to read the license and then to the download links. Download a version ''with Mingw/GCC''. It is much easier than to do this assembling yourself. With a very short delay (only some days) you will always get the most current version of MinGW packaged with the devcpp IDE. It is absolutely the same as with manual download of the required modules. 
# You get an executable that can be executed at user level under any WinNT version. If you want it to be setup for all users, however, you need admin rights. It will install devcpp and mingw in folders of your wish.
# Start the IDE and experience your first project!&lt;br&gt; You will find something mostly similar to MSVC, including menu and button placement. Of course, many things are somewhat different if you were familiar with the former, but it is as simple as a handful of clicks to let your first program run.

===== For DOS =====
''DJGPP:''
* Go to [http://www.delorie.com Delorie Software] and download the GNU C++ compiler and other necessary tools.  The site provides a [http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/zip-picker.html ''Zip Picker''] in order to help identify which files you need, which is available from the main page. 
* Use unzip32 or other extraction utility to place files into the directory of your choice (i.e. C:\DJGPP).
* Set the envionment variables to configure DJGPP for compilation, by either adding lines to autoexec.bat or a custom batch file:
*: &lt;code&gt;set PATH=C:\DJGPP\BIN;%PATH%&lt;/code&gt;
*: &lt;code&gt;set DJGPP=C:\DJGPP\DJGPP.ENV&lt;/code&gt;
* If you are running MS-DOS or Windows 3.1, you need to add a few lines to config.sys if they are not already present:
*:&lt;code&gt;shell=c:\dos\command.com c:\dos /e:2048 /p&lt;code&gt;
*:&lt;code&gt;files=40&lt;code&gt;
*:&lt;code&gt;fcbs=40,0&lt;code&gt;

'''Note:''' The GNU C++ compiler under DJGPP is named ''gpp''.

===== For Linux =====
* For [[w:Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], GCC C++ is part of the system core (since everything in Gentoo is compiled)
* For [[w:Redhat|Redhat]], get a gcc-c++ [[w:RPM Package Manager|RPM]], e.g. using Rpmfind and then install (as root) using &lt;tt&gt;rpm -ivh gcc-c++-''version''-''release''.''arch''.rpm&lt;/tt&gt;
* For [[w:Fedora Core|Fedora Core]], install the GCC C++ compiler (as root) by using &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Yellow Dog Updater Modified|yum]] install gcc-c++&lt;/tt&gt;
* For [[w:Mandrake|Mandrake]], install the GCC C++ compiler (as root) by using &lt;tt&gt;[[w:urpmi|urpmi]] gcc-c++&lt;/tt&gt;
* For [[w:Debian|Debian]], install the GCC C++ compiler (as root) by using &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Apt|apt-get]] install g++&lt;/tt&gt;
* For [[w:Ubuntu|Ubuntu]], install the GCC C++ compiler by using &lt;tt&gt; sudo apt-get install g++&lt;/tt&gt;
* For [[w:OpenSUSE|openSUSE]], install the GCC C++ compiler (as root) by using &lt;tt&gt;[[w:ZYpp|zypper]] in gcc-c++&lt;/tt&gt;
* If you cannot become root, get the tarball from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ and follow the instructions in it to compile and install in your home directory.

===== For Mac OS X =====
[[W:Xcode|Xcode]] (IDE for Apple's OSX and iOS) above v4.1 uses Clang ( http://clang.llvm.org/ ), a free and open source alternative to the GCC compiler and largely compatible with it (taking even the same command line arguments).  The IDE also has an older version of the GCC C++ compiler bundled. It can be invoked from the Terminal in the same way as Linux, but can also be compiled in one of XCode's projects.

{{NOTE|Clang is not the only alternative or even the only free alternative to GCC. Some other possibilities are included in the [[C++ Programming/Weblinks#Compilers and IDEs|External References section]] of the book. Clang has gained increased adoption as it permits better code optimization and internal indexing that enables support to more complex features in IDEs, like code completion, highlights and other modern commodities that programmers now increasingly rely on. Those are also possible on GCC but require building and extra tools making them slower. While GCC is the still the default standard as the free, open source C++ compiler, Clang seems to be gaining momentum. Binaries are available for Linux (Ubuntu), FreeBSD, OSX and Windows (mingw) and can be downloaded from http://llvm.org/releases/download.html. }}

      <comment>Undid revision 2478365 by [[Special:Contributions/85.12.76.63|85.12.76.63]] ([[User talk:85.12.76.63|discuss]]) (Average) force will be constant and independent of interval, if firing is continuous.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Apollo_15_launch.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Apollo 15 launches itself to the moon by means of the change in momentum of its fuel.]]
We have already seen that force is the rate of change of momentum. This applies to continuous flows of momentum as well as to collisions:

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{dp}{dt} = v\frac{dm}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

If I have a machine gun, explosions give the bullets of mass m momentum, causing them to move at a velocity v. This occurs several times each second - the momentum of the bullets is changing, and so there is a roughly continuous force acting on them. Momentum, of course, must be conserved. This results in a change in the momentum of the gun each time it fires a bullet. Overall, this results in a roughly continuous force on the gun which is equal and opposite to the force acting on the bullets.

If I have a tank of water and a hose, with a pump, and I pump the water out of the tank, a similar thing occurs - a force pushes me away from the direction of flow of the water. This force is equal to the flow rate (in kgs&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the water multiplied by its velocity. Bear in mind that 1 litre of water has a mass of about 1kg.

Rockets work on this principle - they pump out fuel, causing it to gain momentum. This results in a thrust on the rocket. When designing propulsion systems for rockets, the aim is to give the fuel as high a velocity per. unit mass as possible in order to make the system fuel-efficient, and to get a high enough change in momentum.

==Questions==

1. A machine gun fires 300 5g bullets per. minute at 800ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What force is exerted on the gun?

2. 1 litre of water is pumped out of a tank in 5 seconds through a hose. If a 2N force is exerted on the tank, at what speed does the water leave the hose?

3. If the hose were connected to the mains, what problems would there be with the above formula?

4. The thrust of the first stage of a Saturn V rocket is 34 MN, using 131000kg of solid fuel in 168 seconds. At what velocity does the fuel leave the tank?

5. Escape velocity from the Earth is 11km&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the velocity of the rocket after the first stage is used up, if the total mass of the rocket is 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kg? How does this compare to escape velocity?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A machine gun fires 300 5g bullets per. minute at 800ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What force is exerted on the gun?'''

&lt;math&gt;F = v\frac{dm}{dt} = 800 \times \frac{300 \times 0.005}{60} = 20\mbox{ N}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. 1 litre of water is pumped out of a tank in 5 seconds through a hose. If a 2N force is exerted on the tank, at what speed does the water leave the hose?'''

The flow rate is about 0.2 kg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;2 = 0.2v&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{2}{0.2} = 10\mbox{ ms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. If the hose were connected to the mains, what problems would there be with the above formula?'''

The force would not be exerted on the tank, but would instead be referred back through the pipe - it is not gaining velocity at the nozzle.

'''4. The thrust of the first stage of a Saturn V rocket is 34 MN, using 131000kg of solid fuel in 168 seconds. At what velocity does the fuel leave the tank?'''

&lt;math&gt;34 \times 10^6 = v\frac{131000}{168}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{34 \times 10^6 \times 168}{131000} = 43600\mbox{ ms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. Escape velocity from the Earth is 11km&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the velocity of the rocket after the first stage is used up, if the total mass of the rocket is 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; kg? How does this compare to escape velocity?'''

&lt;math&gt;ma = 34 \times 10^6 - mg&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{34 \times 10^6}{3 \times 10^6} - 9.81 = 1.52\mbox{ ms}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = at = 168 \times 1.52 = 255.92\mbox{ ms}^{-1} \approx 0.256\mbox{ kms}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

This is 0.002% of escape velocity, hence the need for the other stages of the rocket.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Ingredients''' ==
* 4 cups (32 oz) basmati or long-grain rice
* 1/4 cup salt
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 2 split chicken breasts, skin removed
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter
* 1 cup (8 oz) dried barberries (also known as Zereshk) or dried cranberries
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 tsp powdered saffron

== Cooking Instructions ==


Rinse rice 3 times, then soak in warm water with 1/4 cup salt for 5 hours. Drain.

In a large (8 qt) pot, bring 8 cups water to a boil. Add rice and cook 8 to 10 minutes until slightly soft. Drain in a colander.

Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a large skillet. Add onion and sauté until soft. Add chicken, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Cover and simmer over low heat 60 until chicken is cooked through. Remove from heat. Pull meat off bones; cut in 2 in. pieces and return to leftover cooking broth. Cover to keep warm.

Rinse barberries (if using) 3 times. Melt butter in a small pot; add barberries and sauté 1 minute. Add sugar; sauté 1 minute more. Dilute saffron in 1/2 cup hot water and stir into barberries.

In the large pot used to cook the rice, heat 3 Tbsp oil. Add rice, using a large spoon and fluffing rice. Pour barberry mixture over the rice.

Cover pot and cook over low heat about 30 minutes. For a crisp, golden layer on bottom of rice (called ‘ta-dig’), cook another 15 minutes.

Using a large serving spoon, place rice in a large flat serving dish, gently mixing the barberries with the rice. Top with the chicken and serve.

==Activities that build leadership skills among members==
An organization is nothing without its leaders. In order for the student organization to continue operation, new members must come in and take over the roles of the outgoing and graduating students. There are several traits that are seen as important to being able to lead effectively, and it is very true that there are “natural” leaders, or those who possess those traits naturally, as part of their personality, however this is not true for most people. Therefore, in order for the club to ensure survival, it is often necessary for the group to actively work at preparing new leaders for the tasks involved in taking over the organization. One solution in achieving this are events specifically designed to help bring these traits out in those who otherwise wouldn’t have displayed them in order to prepare them for their future leadership roles. For example, in the Scottish Country Dance Club, during an interview with Rebecca, she said that before she was even considered a leader, she did things with new members before class to help them learn the steps. In turn, the new members grew to respect her and listen to her. As the groups respect for her grew, she naturally became a leader of the SCDC. As members and leaders come and go from these clubs, it is important that members continue to pass down their skills and attitudes to the new members. This way, the clubs will continue to grow in members, experience and knowledge.

There are many activities that groups can do to develop and prepare leaders.  By organizing games and challenges where a strong leader is a necessity, people can develop their skills as leaders and become more comfortable being in charge of a group.  An example of one such game is done with a large group where each person is given a number in succession.  The group is then blindfolded and must organize themselves in a line by their numbers.  In this activity, because one's sense of sight is removed, someone must become a leader and organize and work with the others.  Simple activities such as this are very beneficial in getting people comfortable with being in charge and build camaraderie within a group.  There are also texts that can help hone a leader's skills.  These books discuss how leaders should interact with the people they are in charge of, how to present themselves, and how to be an effective leader.  Being an effective leader is not easy, and it is more than just telling others what to do.  A leader must work with others and lead by example.

==Challenges of Leadership/Communication==
Effective leadership is the backbone to any group or organization. The leader acts as a facilitator for the group and without it the group has little chance for success. A groups communication is only as good as it's leader's. There have been many groups that couldn't make it past the first six months because the leaders were not equipped to guide them through the trials that a young club encounters. Challenges can occur when there is no definitive rules or chain of command to follow. There can be a fall out if two or more individuals cannot work together for the betterment of the club. The leadership must put aside their egos in order to fully actualize what they hope their club to be. They must follow the words of Ghandi and &quot;be the change they want to see&quot;.  

Effective communication is a necessary and difficult aspect between any clubs members and their operations within the club. With many people doing different jobs and being in charge of many different activities it is in many cases difficult to effectively and timely communicate with all members in the club because of various obligations and duties that each member is in charge of. However despite how difficult effective communication can sometimes be, it is a vital and necessary part of each successful club. Having a leader of the club who can organize activities and obligations can greatly assist in avoiding the confusion between club members and contribute to good communication in a given club. 

===Ways to communicate effectively===
Communication is one of the most important aspects in the effective management of a club. Without communication, even poor communication, club members wouldn't know when to come to meetings or what events were being organized. There are many different ways people can communicate. Contact through student email ensures a large number of people are exposed to important information, especially as most students are required to check email frequently. Social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace also provide clubs a free and easy way to inform people, without having to constantly update an email list. The prevalence of cell phones provides a variety of options for communication as well. Clubs can call members, send out group text messages, send and receive email or access social networking sites via the internet depending on the phone. Posting fliers or having members pass them out in public places can be effective as well.  Any one of these options can have some degree of success, however, for the greatest amount of exposure, clubs should use as many of these options as time and resources will allow.

In addition to understanding the different mediums available for communication, it is essential that club leaders (and/or members) are able to communicate effectively in terms of content. Not only must clubs reach members or potential members via posters, emails, facebook, etc., but they must present information in a way that positively impacts the club. This may seem obvious, but clubs who are having trouble in recruitment or member involvement may need to re-assess the content of their communications - a club who sends out a weekly email that is boring, vague, too informal/formal for the clubs purposes, etc. may not see the results they would expect from providing a regular means of communication with its members. Communication within the club-meeting setting is equally, if not more, important. It is important for club leaders to use skills in communication to create dialogue with members and to tailor the club to members' wants and needs. Some clubs focus on subjects which require special attention to the way information is presented and shared among members.

Strong leadership positions are crucial to the success of an organization. Leaders not only host events and manage the logistics of a club, they help bring in members and get people excited about a club. However, the most important thing they do is communicate to group members or people interested in the club in safe and contusive ways. Sexploration, a controversial club that is focused entirely on issues that many believe to be taboo, the leaders work very hard to make sure that they are communicating in a way that makes participants feel safe and free to open and have real talks about extremely personal issues. The leaders: Grace and Ashley want to make sure that no one feels it is not okay to be open about topics such as sex, and that this club is a safe environment to have such talks. Sexploration is not the kind of club you want people attending if they do not plan to participate or take the discussions seriously so it is important to make sure that people attending meetings are not just there for mess around. Like the YES!+ club, Sexploration communicates to previous participants via Facebook, which has been effective at getting people to come to meetings.  

Throughout our service learning project it is apparent that organization is a key component within clubs here at Western that can lead to effective leadership and communication. Specifically creating individual positions with each focused on a separate job or goal within the club allows for a time effective highly productive club. For example in my analysis the A.S. club, LEAD, I state “LEAD’s overall organization and promptness are due to all of the group member’s dedication and passion for the environment and to their club’s success as well as clear and concise expectations of one another.” Through dedication to specific areas of expertise and interests, effective communication towards the community and within the club can occur. A student from the Harry Potter club states, “Although the president can get meeting events organized in the beginning, everyone has a hand in leading the club.” It is evident that effective communication comes from organization that focuses on assigning club members to their specific interest areas which ensures prompt deadlines and passionate communication. Jordan Yentzer from the A’capella club states, “Organization allows a functional routine for the group to follow, which hence allows for better productivity.” By allowing club members to focus on their specific interest area, clubs are ensuring better more detailed communication between club members and the community due to club members dedication to their job or interest area.

With the constant development of technology and the overwhelming increase of its use for communication, its no wonder it has become an effective way of communicating information among group members, especially in younger generations. The leaders of the Photography club shared that they've found Facebook to be the most effective way of communicating with each other because it is so commonly used by people (especially college students), so it is checked and updated very regularly. The Photo club also uses their Flickr website to share their work with each other. The Men's Ultimate Team, which is a club sport, uses Google Groups to facilitate contact between members of the club. The variety of functions within Google Groups allows members to regularly check the specific group for new posts as well as receive an email to any desired email account whenever there is a new post to the group. These multiple ways of receiving important information allowed the Men's Ultimate team to stay in constant contact outside of meetings and practices.  Students researching the Students for Renewable Energy club noted that they felt SRE &quot;must work on updating their website to reflect their meeting changes&quot; and that by keeping it updated it &quot;might help in their quest for new members.&quot; Technology has become key to the way the world communicates today, and through its use, groups could greatly improve their organization, as well as recruitment, and involvement of existing group members. By being updated with the use of technology, groups can be more efficient and on top of things, enabling themselves to move forward as they learn and grow.

While technology can be a very helpful way to communicate on a broader spectrum much more efficiently, it can also cause problems. Because there are so many different ways to network, (some being, Facebook, Myspace, text messaging, or regular email) things can become confusing and information can get lost in the see of technology. As mentioned by the Croquet club, they send out information via facebook and text messaging which could pose a problem if people do not check either of these things regularly. As for the YES! club, this club is in fact not even a club any more and has since merged in with the Meditation club. The problem with this is that through Facebook and other modes of social networking, not everyone got the memo and some people still believed there to be a YES! club in existence.

While many groups have come to rely heavily on technology as a form of communication-via e-mails, Facebook and myspace announcements- it is important to note that these forms of communication can also be ineffective. In some cases, relying on technology alone, as opposed to other means such as word of mouth and speaking to group members in person, can lead to a breakdown of communication. Even though this new found technology can lead to the cause of misinforming of communication breakdowns, it is still much better than when things just got by via word of mouth or making home phone calls. Having a website with any at all information about a club is still better than no website at all, even if it is a little out of date. If someone isn't reliable to look at their cell phone once a day to see a text message, there is no way they would effectively communicate better via word of mouth. As ineffective as these means of communication seem to be, they are still the best possible option.

Many clubs may be too large or too spread out to effectively be able to regularly hold meetings in order to communicate.  For clubs that have members that do not often see each other and operate individually or apart from the rest of the group meetings will not be efficient as well.  In the busy world of today everyone has their own schedules to keep up with so the larger the number of people in a club the harder it is to keep it together.  For example the WWU Bodybuilding club is so large that most members do not even know each other.  In this case it is very important that the leadership communicate effectively through means such as email, a website, or a facebook group.

Although it is crucial for groups to be able to communicate about events and gatherings it is also important to know how communicate when everyone has come together. An effective organizational strategy displayed within the Dead Parrots Society is their high level of communication with one another. They communicate beyond what is shared in a normal conversation. They play many improv games to start their meetings including eye contact, body language, and reading each other’s implication of movement and verbal comments for their humorous response. The fact that this group shares a common passion and is meant to be funny there is a relaxed vibe with the group however they can still comfortably criticize their peers’ craft. They communicate on many different levels with each other, creating a comfortable and welcoming community within their environment.  
This kind of communication can be related to Jilian Murdock’s report of the Scottish Country Dance Club.  She speaks of how the club accepts all students, regardless of their dance experience and adjusts teaching/communication styles to challenge experienced dancers and avoid overwhelming the new dancers. 
Once you have created a welcoming environment and adjust your teaching for different group levels and forms of communication result in a solid and comfortable foundation for a group to succeed.

Facebook has changed the world of communication.  As we can see from the examples, it can help any club.  Unlike email, facebook has the ability to create groups.  When a change is made in the group section by a leader of the club, then every member of the group is notified.  Leaders of any club should take advantage of facebook groups and create a group for their student club, if they haven't done so already.

As you can see there are varied types of ways to communicate effectively. Wither it be through facebook, in person, over the phone or even in e-mails. Bodybuilding club, Dead Parrots Society and LEAD are only several examples of clubs that use effective communication in many different ways.  Depending on what kind of club it is, the communication may be differently. For example, for a smaller club communication may happen through phone conversations, however with a larger group it is much more likely that communication may happen through facebook or through emials. The best way to use communication throughout the groups is to use many different types in order to be most effective in order to communicate to the biggest amount of people in order to spread the necessary information.

===Working together===
In one person's life, they will encounter many different people from many different backgrounds and they will in one way or another, talk to them, encounter them, or have to work with them. Therefore, it is very important for clubs, who represent and incorporate people from various situations to represent them properly. The following are ways for student organizations to better accomplish this task. 

As the research continued with the Hui O’ Hawaii club, it was brought to the interest group’s attention that the previous year had been under the authority of someone else who had graduated that last spring. This meant new leadership at the beginning of this academic year with little guidance. During the interview one member stated that because of this situation things have been vastly different than in the years past. The strategy of leadership this year has involved the cooperation and involvement of all members, where the group appears to be less reliant of one person and more dependent on the group itself. The current welfare of Hui O’ Hawaii and its recent changes with leadership has been affected in a positive way—bringing the group closer together, creating a strong bond of friendship, and establishing a warm, affectionate atmosphere.

While attending a meeting of the Hui O' Hawaii club, the interest group noticed that when one member brought up a matter to be discussed. She asked the rest of members to be respectful and share their ideas with other members. With her the other members shared their opinions and voted on the matter. Later the interest group learned that the group does not have an actual leader of the club because everyone is effectively participating in the club related matter. No one in the club seemed to feel left out, but work together as a group.   

Although the Student- Homeless Outreach Team (SHOT) has and is currently facing setbacks, they remain strong and open minded about their club. Their biggest asset is their leadership ability. They may only have four members, but they spread out the work and come to meetings with a general plan for discussion. Leadership in SHOT is pretty equally divided amongst the members. Each person contributes in some way during the week and come back the following week to report their success. Their leadership abilities lead to a more cooperative club, which has helped them increase their turn-out rates for their “Be Our Guest” event.

The Harry Potter club has found that the most effective way to communicate is to have each member of group have some say in what direction the Harry Potter choices to take. In this system, each member has some influence over what the club does or does not do. This allows everyone to communicate what they want clearly and efficiently, without one person overruling everything. They have found this to be extremely effective in making sure everyone feels free to not only participate, but also knowing that their opinion is valued. The technique is different than that of the SHOT club. The SHOT club only has four members and each of them has a ¼ of the power in the club. This club is also similar to the Harry Potter club because each member (although there is a different amount) is allowed and even encouraged to communicate. The Harry Potter does have a president to help keep order and work out the logistics, but everyone is still encouraged to speak their mind. 

The Rugby Club is very effective when it comes to communicating and working together as a team. The team captains name is Jason who happens to be a senior and four year Rugby player here at Western. Leadership is mainly on his shoulders as well as the few other seniors on the team, like Rowan. Senior leadership is key in keeping this club working together and organizing functions to help the team become more profitable and more noticed by the public. The 8 students of Optional Clothing group is a very new club but already demonstrates similar leadership qualities. A member of the group quoted that their main strength was leadership. Leaders in that group, as well as the regby club, are held responsible for gathering the group and bringing everyone together at events.

The members of the Croquet Club are always working together. Once a member of the club, that person will go and spread the word to all of their friends to bring in more people to play. Ben Spencer, the leader, relies heavily on Facebook, but they still do a great job of telling people that aren’t members of the Facebook page when tournaments and meetings are going to be. The members know how important word of mouth is and they don’t want any of their players left out of the loop or clueless about an event, so they are always talking to one another. Because the people in the Croquet Club are all such good friends, they aren’t afraid to always be chatting between each other. That may be the problem with one of the bigger clubs, lack of communication and leaving people out of important messages and updates.

The Student Coalition for Immigration Rights is a new club that started last quarter with the help of their leader and president Maria. A definite asset that SCIR possesses is that it is a very specific group with a common goal. Their focus is on undocumented youth and students furthering their education.  This gives the group an advantage in that students joining have specified passions and interests hopefully giving more commitment and work to this group. Another asset is that they have is an excellent president, Maria. Although she is only a freshmen, she has not only been able to form this group but also to put it to action with the workshops they have been forming and the one they have already offered. From the meeting I attended, she showed that she is extremely organized and prepared to produce the optimal influence on this world. The issues that Maria has expressed involve delegation. A strong leader is very important in a group but the president can't be the only one taking action. It is important to make sure members are contributing actual time and work towards making a difference. In the coop club that I am a member of, we have had lots of experience with this issue. In our case we decided to have a weekly note-taker at each meeting writing down who said they will do what and then posting those notes on our group website. It is very important to have a strong leader but in order to make change the leader needs help from committed individuals and in order for this to happen members need to be held accountable for their responsibilities.

The Korean Club works together very well. Unlike groups with many members this club relies on working together with the few members it has. Members and leaders of the group alike work together to set up get togethers, group meetings, and the themes discussed. There is not much to be said about the leadership since there is no clear distinction between group leaders and members or any concrete establishment of a hierarchy. Every year the group gets a fresh start as new leaders are assigned the roles of president and vice president. This is due to the fact that most members are exchange students and leave Western after a year. This way new ideas are always able to be produced. The only set back is that themes may repeat over the years as information of pervious meetings is lost.

The Western Strong Man club has had some trouble with working together in leadership. Stephanie Singer, a founding member, is the group's only active leader. She organizes and runs the entire club on her own. Because of this one of the biggest worries of the club is continuing after she graduates from WWU. Her leadership position and hard work, however, sometimes goes unnoticed because she usually works off the grid from making countless phone calls, writing emails and organizing events. The members of the club enjoy the benefits of her hard work but sometimes don't fully realize the intense time and effort that goes into maintaining such a club.

Working together allows groups to maintain strength through the weakest times and makes progress go more smoothly. Communication is key in compromise as well as leadership. A common, effective way these groups have worked together is letting everyone have some say in what is being done and showing respect for one another. Working together isn't always the best idea because sometimes you need a leader that can take control of the group and have everyone on the same page, because if everyone is just saying their ideas then how are you going to get the best ones down.

===Maintaining Member Diversity===

A possible barrier in recruiting more diverse members may be an issue of where and how clubs are promoting. Widening where your club promotes its events may help get more diverse members. If your club operates mainly on a school campus, talking to the administrators in charge of on-campus promotions would be an excellent first step in expanding your options for where you can advertise your club. Such administrators are not only knowledgeable of the many locations that are available for advertising on campus, but they will also be able to inform you of any specific requirements or restrictions involved in the location or content of promotional materials. Many clubs may seem by their title to be geared towards one sex only. If this is the case, it is very important to advertise the club to other sexes. Even a simple strategy such as adding footnote on promotional materials that advertises that your club is open to all genders can act as an effective first step to expanding the diversity of your club.

The most important part of any club is its members. Devin Spencer is the leader of the Croquet Club and he has made a point to allow everyone that is interested to have the opportunity to join the club. Members sign up via facebook or simply go to the tournaments with friends that are already part of the group. It is an extremely friendly and relaxed environment. Devin explained that the club is full many different types of people from different backgrounds. He has made a lot of really good friends through his organization because there is such a wide range of different personalities. The Hui O Hawaii Club also has a good recruitment plan as well. They have a huge event at the beginning of every year aimed towards incoming freshman. Both clubs welcome anyone that is interested to join.

Diversity is a big key to having successful clubs. Swing Kids does a great job of that, there is a wide variety of ethnicities within the club. Members are excited to join the club because they know that no matter their race or beliefs they will be welcomed into the group. For example, the girl that we interviewed that participates in Swing Kids has bonded immensely with her roommate through this club. She is white while her roommate is from the Philippines so it has brought them together by a common interest when they are from two different societies. When going to this club, everyone was very enthusiastic, making it easy to feel comfortable no matter the color of your skin. I think that is what keeps this club so diverse is the attitude and openness of the leaders.

Diversity is one of the most important components within on campus clubs. It help the groups to be well rounded and well represented. For example, in the group Swing Kids, there are various culturally diverse groups represented. The girl we intervied (Caileen) is white while her roommate is Asian. They have been able to use this common interest of theirs, to help each other bond. It is also very similar to the Tango dance club on campus. They are also very culturally diverse. And this is especially great to see considering that Tango originated from the Latino culture.

Anytime you are participating in a group or team setting you can encounter many different problems. In order to solve these problems and develop a solution that is the best for the greater good, everyone must participate in the problem solving. Diversity through out clubs is extremely important. With a diverse group you can have many people thinking in many different ways and you can develop many different solutions to choose from or incorporate.  The cycling club says it is sometimes difficult to recruit  diverse members however, they realize the importance.

===Leadership positions===

Possibly the most important aspect of any club or organization are the leaders. Obviously the members play a crucial role in the formation of the club but with no one in a leadership position, nothing would get done. We have learned through past experiences that the most effective way to form a structured group of any kind, a leader is a necessity. There can be one leader or multiple, as long as there is a designated person to take the majority of the responsibility, the club or social group should succeed. It becomes much clearer when doing research on these clubs at Western that the ones with a dedicated and focused leader have the best results.

Throughout a group there is always varying ways of how the group is lead or who is in charge. You can either have a group of people in charge or have one specific leader. Each group has to make this decision in order to succeed. With the groups at Western, I studied how the Dead Parrots society went about running their club. It seems to me that with their club and even other clubs people studied it was usually beneficial to have a specific leader because it leaves less people with too much power. In the Dead Parrots society Kris was the leader and he was there to help assist in ways to improve each individuals skills. He didn't take advantage and everyone in a way looked up to him for acceptance. With Creators of Visual Arts and Literature there was definitely a leader and because the club focused on individuals art work it wasn't completely necessary to have a leader. In the end the members felt a sense of comfort when they have a leader because it kept them together and focused each day. Whether each club has lots of leaders, no leaders, or one leader its definitely necessary to experience one or the other. The impact of a leader can make huge differences within each club.

The Dead Parrots also had multiple leadership positions available. As was mentioned in the last paragraph, Kris Erickson was the &quot;leader&quot; of the Dead Parrots. Officially he is called the Artistic Director and everything goes through him. However, they have other jobs as well. The Dead Parrots are very good at internal organization. They have one person to handle the funds, another to handle publicity and yet another to handle anything online. Each position is respected as they are voted on at the end of the year at a barbeque. The rehearsals are required, so every member attends and each leader is respected also for pulling their weight in the group. Unlike the South Asian Students Association who seemed to have difficulty getting the leaders to attend the meetings, each leader attends each rehearsal.

Like sexploration, and the stand, women in the woods, also has two great leaders which both host and plan events that take place within the club. Being the leaders of this club comes responsibility, that responsibility is to find future leaders like the sexploration club if this is not able to happen, then the lack of involvement will also decide the future of women in the woods. The difference between women in the woods, sexploration, and the stand is that women in the woods is in need to look for more than one or two leaders, the more leaders that they have the better. the club needs strong women leaders that peple look up to, and will be willing to folllow.

Like the other clubs mentioned, the Harry Potter Club has a couple of defined leaders, the President of this school year and the President of next school year.  Both of these people lead the club very well and make all the meetings run smoothly.  In order for this club to gain campus attention, the leaders have the role of putting up posters and announcing the existence of the club at the Information Fair at the beginning of each fall quarter.  Like the members of the Dead Parrots Society, that was mentioned, the members of Harry Potter Club have a sense of organization and comfort because there is a leader or leaders present.  This way, the m meetings are almost guaranteed to start on time and to accomplish what needs to be accomplished during that certain meeting.

What I found to be most interesting about the leadership positions among the CCF club (Campus Christian Fellowship) was the link between student leadership and full time non student leadership. In the CCF group, there are people in leadership with a link to the AS, like the president whom I interviewed and so forth. Also there are full time members of the Bellingham community who raise their own funds to work with CCF full time on staff. Furthermore, WWU students, Skagit students, and WCC students weekly contribute money to CCF.  The Hillel Jewish group and found a slightly similar situation with their leadership. Although most of the leadership is from within the student body, they report to the community director about the groups issues and status. The way these leadership roles balance together leads to a really strong organization in the group. This also leads to a very strong retention ofuseful strategies over time. 

The Tango Club, which teaches the Argentine Tango, faces similar problems as many of the above groups in finding leaders to follow in the footsteps of current leaders. Following the trend, the Tango Club has two members who are very talented, passionate, and involved with the club's material (in this case the Argentine Tango). There is a huge gap between their skill level and the other members who might be able to take over after the current leaders have graduated. From this trend it becomes obvious that a better system of leadership is needed to keep a group running in the long run. Depending heavily on just a few individuals for leadership and meanwhile not having a system for finding new leadership will lead to problems and if not effective at all. So what is an effective way to ensure the continued quality leadership of a student organization? 

A good example is the Cycling Club. They have a system where they will elect a group of active officers at the end of each season. Thanks to this system the Cycling Club does not have to face the issue of unknown leadership--hence possibly even the death of a club. By trying to even out the responsibility of the leadership it becomes more reliable. However, it is not to say that this tactic would work for every club. Some clubs, such as the Tango Club, require a special amount of expertise to teach. The two current heads of that club both studied abroad in Argentina. So it is not a quick fix for them to install a system of electing new leadership because it is not guaranteed, or even likely, that other members will be at the same skill level as them and capable of teaching the class.

It seems that most of the aforementioned groups thrive in maintaining multiple leaders, which makes sense, as organizations are wholly meant to be collaborative efforts. In order for an organization (student or otherwise) to function properly and flourish, it is absolutely necessary that said group has [an] appointed administrator(s). Otherwise, the members, regardless of how intent they may be in the given activity/common interest, are liable to lose that proverbial glue which allows them to band together and perpetuate their organization. My group generally found that WSSF has become irrelevant over the past couple of years due to lack of leadership skills that the current moderator possesses. The role of leadership has been scrutinized and universally perceived as requisite, however some would argue that the leadership role is increasingly beneficial if it is divided amongst a few particularly responsible individuals, so as to avoid unnecessary burdensome responsibility. Nina Rabins points out that the given number of members in a group should directly affect how many appointed leaders there are: “After reading through my group members' responses, I found that a common deficiency was that nearly all of the administrative/organizational work is done by only one member, Stephanie, and the majority of the knowledge about bodybuilding is held by Rory. By having so much of the responsibilities for this group concentrated in these two members, it becomes difficult for all 70+ members to become actively involved in the organization.” This, I suppose, makes sense to an extent. However, the division of work should not be all too bothersome if those responsible for coordination are truly passionate about the nature of their organization.

A'capella club is facing to lose 2 members in the end of spring quarter. Matt Bell is the leader of the club also worry and concern about get new members. This club was formed by Matt since fall quarter, due to the lack to motivations from other group members it's gradually become a big issue after 3 quarters has passed by. They sure need to be concerned about the leadership roles, and the lack of constant involved members the future of A'capella club once when Matt Bell graduate is uncertain.

Sometimes, the leadership position within a club may not be obvious, but is still vital to the structure and integrity of a club. Take KUGS radio station at WWU for example. There are many different DJ positions, but not many leadership roles. What many DJ's may not realize is that each and every one plays the part of a leader, as they influence the music scene, and inspire new recruitment's to the station. These are the roles of a leader in an organization such as a radio station that keep the station a busy and live place. University radio stations are constantly struggling to replenish the graduating, more experienced DJ's, and it is up to them to find and train DJ's adequate enough to replace them. This is yet another example of upholding the leadership role. These examples may not be apparent, or written down on a contract, but they are important and necessary for the continuation of a radio station. Despite this different leadership role, there are some more traditional roles within the radio station.  There are seven positions at the radio station that students can fill. They are the Program Director (decides on programming  and other similar decisions), Operations Coordinator (maintains logs on the activities going on at the radio station as well as making and receiving Public Service Announcements), News and Public Affairs Director (directs the news and public affairs portions of the programming at the station), Music Director, Specialty Music Director, Maintenance Engineer (helps maintain the technology at the radio station including the music CDs), and Marketing and Development Director (directs the marketing and promotions part of the radio station). The Music Directors make sure that music comes into the station whether it is more the Music for the Masses show or for the specialty music shows during the day. A person must apply for these positions and be a DJ at the radio station.

While the low numbers and sometimes the planning is an issue, Jewish Hillel is said to have key core member which have kept the club alive for such a long time. Their strength has been the passing down of club positions to people who will stay active and promote events and new membership. These dedicated few are what keep up with the paper work each year to keep Hillel a club on Western's campus. They are also in charge of moderating the Facebook group and finding funds for the various events held each quarter.

In a lot of clubs like the biology club having more than one leader is smart. When it comes to running meetings, if the president cannot make it, its important to have a designated person to take charge. If Taylor the president of the biology club cannot make it, Anne takes the role of running the meeting as smooth as possible. A problem comes when neither of them can make it because of other work they must complete. This results in canceling of a meeting or a very unstructured meeting ran by the members alone. This is a problem that results in losing members because they don't have a leader to run their club.

Some clubs also lack leaders, which poses a large problem amongst organizations. The Associated Students club Women in the Woods has two current leaders. Yet they are both graduating this year (Spring '09 and Fall '09). This is a large issue for many clubs because leaders of their organization ultimately graduate from Western. Whether it is this year or in the years to come leadership positions have to be passed on to other members amongst the club. Without the passing of leadership positions after graduation club statuses could be lost and the legacy will be discontinued. It is very important for that leader to choose a new director with the qualities that will benefit the club and keep the fire burning. These qualities include organization, dedication and excitement for the club. Without these qualities clubs suffer and information is lost.

One of the main ordeals of being a leader is see how the club does once you leave. How will a new leader be chosen? Will they be just as ambitious as the current leader is? Will the club survive under this new leadership?  These are all questions that need to be answered with a transfer of leadership.  In Western Men Against Violence the leader was worried about what would happen when he left.  He just filled in the role of moderator and meeting organizer after the last leader left.  Currently he does not know if he should try to hand the leadership position off to someone or just let it be taken over once he leaves.  One of the largest fears that small group leaders have upon them leaving is that all the work that they put into recruiting and putting on events will go to waste as the club sinks and eventually disappears.  The general feeling with the other clubs that we saw is that it generally works best to let the club decide on a new leader before the current one leaves. This way the current leader will be able to impart some experience on to the new leader before the current leader leaves.

==Qualities of strong Leaders==
Leadership is a position that is very crucial to the success of an organization. To host a successful event, there needs to be someone in charge that can take control of a group of people and figure things out logistically in order to have a production run smoothly. People in charge that are leading a group need to possess a variety of positive attributes and qualities in order to be a strong contributor to the group or event at hand. Leadership not only helps to organize a group, but it allows those in a group look up to someone who is committed to their interests and passions. There is much more to being a good leader then just leading a group to more money or more fame, a good leader must teach their group and leave them with something more than just a shell of a group. 
  
Leaders are both born and made.  Some people have a natural instinct to step up and be in control.  Others are taught that “leader” is a respected title associated with success.  This positive association often makes those who aren’t natural leaders want to take on a leadership role in order to reap the benefits of the high position.  By taking on extra responsibilities you gain control and power and are able to gain inside knowledge from being so closely involved.  The qualities that make a truly great leader are for the most part universal, although they may be applied differently depending on the exact position in a group that a leader holds. Some characteristics that strong leaders possess include knowledge about organizing meetings, enthusiasm,  a positive attitude, dedication and commitment, the ability to maintain confidentiality, the ability to adapt and function in times of uncertainty, the ability to plan and goal set effectively, trustworthiness, a high character, passion, tolerance, and logic. 

One last and crucial attribute of a good leader is to know when to step down to let someone else lead. A good leader understands that others in the group will have good ideas that they would want to contribute. A good leader would step down to allow the idea to be shared by the ideas owner instead of trying it to do it themselves. This allows other group members to get their say in and also to have an experience in which they lead a group.

===Organizing meetings===
Of all the responsibilities that a leader of a club must have, the job of organizing meetings is among the most important. There are several different kinds of meetings that clubs utilize, including meetings with administration, group meetings, meetings with community members, and many others. Each type is important. Meetings with the administration often leads to funds being allocated to the club or getting the &quot;ok&quot; on a campus-wide activity or permission to use a room on campus. Meetings of the group are usually weekly, bi-weekly, or at least on some sort of schedule. These type of gatherings are essential to keeping club members invested in the club as well as a way to organize events and achieve group goals. Each meeting is has a purpose, even if its purpose is just to have fun, but the key to having a successful meeting rests in the hands of a club leader and requires time, effort, dedication, passion, and organization.

A meeting can either work very efficiently or it can be a complete waste of time. More often than not this is determined by how well the meeting is organized. Organization starts with letting the other members know when and where the meeting is being held. The people or person in charge of leading and orchestrating a meeting should come up with an agenda and a list of topics prior to the meeting. This could very well be the most important part of organizing a meeting; if there is no agenda there is no way to know which direction the meeting will go. It is important to have one or multiple people taking notes during the meetings so that the group can look back later on to see what was all said if need be. 

The Student- Homeless Outreach Team meets every week, and are very organized with exactly what needs to be done in order to insure their event is a success. Each member comes to the club with ideas and things they believe need to be done within the next week to insure that they are on track for the &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; event. The organization has lead to a mass amount of advertisement downtown as well; the club is constantly trying to find new and better ways of getting their event publicized so the community can get involved as well. Their meetings are always focused with each member contributing to the next actions the club must take in order for the word to be spread about their event.

An effective organizational strategy this club or group excels at is advertising when and where there are events like guest speakers or fundraisers. They advertise this through fliers around campus or by having members of the group stand around populated areas like red square and hand out info booklets or fliers. The ‘Student Coalition for Immigration Rights’ group puts on workshops to host information about their cause, while Students for Disability Awareness hosts guest speakers and events of that nature. Both of these groups use effective organizational strategies like clearly advertising when and where an event or fundraiser will take place. This is essential to have a clear organized strategy like spreading awareness of the group’s event so that people will know when and where to come support the group. Both groups put on an awareness week in which events, fund raising and education about their specific group or cause is established and promoted.

The A'capella Club, since just recently being created in 2008, they are finding themselves in turmoil when it comes to scheduling and also some problems with leadership in that they find it difficult to manage when to schedule meetings. As college students, every member has a life outside of the club with work, homework, etc. so finding times that everyone in the club can meet is a challenge. Especially in a club that requires the participation of every member for it to work, it is important to have a steady meeting time. The best the club can do is to find out every member's daily schedule and find times that work best for the majority of the club. From there it's left up to the members to both show up and keep the leaders informed if they are not able to make it.

Another group that has exceptional organizational skill is the Dead parrots Society. As seen an interview the dead parrots say “We have an artistic director, a business director, a person to handle our money, a person to handle our online website/face book, and a person to handle our publicity”. I also found that everything is always organized and the artistic director is very good at making sure things get done and separating the work throughout the different jobs. Through looking at other groups on the discussion board I found that other groups throughout campus have acknowledged the DPS’s organizational skills. In an interview with the Homeless outreach group conducted a group member said that “What I've learned so far from observing the Dead Parrots is that they are very organized. They meet every week for open rehearsals and they have created an environment that is comfortable for newcomers. They have official rehearsals every week that are focused and they work on skills useful during performances.” This shows that even other groups are recognizing the dead parrot’s society’s ability to stay organized and it is definitely a huge asset to the group as well as to other groups looking to follow suit and be more organized as well.

As seen through the 'Student-Homeless Outreach Team,' the 'Student Coalition for Immigration Rights,' the 'A'capella Club,' and the 'Dead Parrots Society,' effective organization is essential to the success of a club. Holding club meeting allows members to discuss club fundraising, leadership, future events, and everyday club business. Effective organization for clubs has led to increased popularity and overall membership, a lowered stress among those in leadership positions due to the equal distribution of work and overall a much smoother running system. As seen in the A'capella club, issues with holding organized meeting can lead to several major problems within clubs. But with the resources and information found in this WikiBook, future clubs will be able to benefit and organize into successful efficient groups.

===Enthusiasm===
Enthusiasm is essential in a club or organization. Without enthusiasm very little would be accomplished; the club would not be able to recruit members because if it looks like the current members aren't interested in what they are doing. Getting members of the club enthused about the clubs activities makes it easier on the leader as well because the members of the club will be more inclined to help out with club activities. The more help a leader can get, the better it is for the club. This takes pressure off of the leaders shoulders and increases the members feelings of helping and belonging. Enthusiasm is not only important to members, it is very important that the leaders themselves be excited about what they are doing.  Having a leader who is not committed fully to the cause hurts the whole organization. Enthusiasm vital to keeping an organization going and for to be successful. 

One of the most valuable traits in the leadership of any organization is a passion, and enthusiasm for the group. Leaders should be chosen who have a passion for the actions of the club, not just for the pleasure of being part of a group. The Dead Parrot Society votes their leaders into place based on who is good at what, and who wants to do it. A member of the Dead Parrot Society, Jessica Young, pointed out that &quot;usually it's pretty obvious [who should do what] so it's not difficult to choose the positions.&quot; This natural assumption of leadership roles contributes to the general success of this group's organization. Tom and Rosemary Read who organize the Scottish Country Dance Club, are very dedicated to carrying on this traditional style of Scottish dance. Their passion and concern for maintaining this valued tradition gives the club a welcoming feel and really allows new members to feel that they are part of a great tradition. Without a passionate leadership, any organization is unlikely to have a passionate membership; members begin to feel that there is no reason for them to care, because the leaders don't even care. Without the members passion, the organization is unlikely to last long.

It is only when the leaders of a group are passionate about the goals of a club that the other members will be able to share that enthusiasm.  No matter how passionate a person is about a subject, without a leadership team who is outwardly excited and encouraging, that passion cannot come through.  Campus Christian Fellowship has a diverse team not only of student leaders, but also older leaders who know more and have had more time to develop their knowledge on the focus of the group, which in one word is Jesus.  One of CCF's student leaders attributes the success of CCF's ministry as a Club, to the members, who she claims are &quot;flat out passionate for people.&quot; From being in contact with these leaders, the passion spreads throughout the community of the club, which for CCF, consists of between 300-400 people.  The Students for Disability Awareness Club also must keep their people passionate through the leadership of the group because they are dealing with people's lives and the struggles they face.  Their goal is to empower the people in their group about things they are passionate for and teach them the skills to be successful in addressing those things. But it is only through an enthusiastic leadership team that these goals can be achieved.

In order for a student club to be successful, there is a strong need for enthusiastic and spirited leadership. The Croquet Club has Devin Spencer who is the driving force behind organizing the events, founded the club and is the long-time president. He encourages the rest of the club to participate in the activities and brings them together. Everyone in the Croquet Club is welcoming, warm and hospitable which makes it so easy for outsiders to participate in the club's activities and encourages future members. Zoë Moore and Nathan Juarex, who studied the A'capella Club, agreed that the spirit and energy of club's is the greatest aspect. To have an effective organization everyone in the group, especially the leader, must have a passion and vigor for the club.

A successful leader of any organization must contain passion to achieve the goals that they and their group are striving for. Passion gives the leader enthusiasm and motivation they need to keep the club going. In Photography Club, the enthusiasm for photography is what brings the leaders and the club members together each week. Even though they have a small amount of people attending the meetings, the leaders do not let that hinder the amount of fun they have with the few committed members who share the same interests as they do. Without a devoted and excited leader, it would be difficult to maintain a consistent group of people to attend the meetings. The Dead Parrot Society understands the importance of a passionate leader because they vote in the leader who they see best fits the position. Therefore they can choose a person in the group that has the natural zest a leader must contain in order to make the group successful. If the leader is not passionate at what they are doing then most likely the members of the club will lose interest because they are not enjoying themselves. That is why enthusiasm and passion in a leader is crucial to a club's existence.

Just like in the Photography Club, the Croquet club's main reason for success is the enthusiasm that all of the members and leaders have for the game. The members of the club are so enthused that many dress up for the tournaments based on what the theme of each tournament. The enthusiasm of the group needs to start with the president and the Croquet Club's president does a great job of getting everyone excited for all of the croquet tourneys. If the leader of the club is not enthused then it would be very hard for the members to become enthused, thus destroying the whole mood of the tournaments. Without enthusiasm there is a very little chance that the club will be able to stick together and succeed in the long run.

In most clubs and organizations an enthusiastic leader is the key for success. However, in the Harry Potter club, not only are the leaders very passionate about their organization, the members are as well. When they plan events, they make sure it is something all of the members along with any guests will be interested in, thus creating enthusiam throughout. For example, we were able to observe Jeopardy night, where all of the questions were from a certain Harry Potter book. All of the members decided together to have this event, so no one would feel left out and it would be something they all would enjoy. The way the Harry Potter club is run causes enthusiasm without much effort. They all love the subject of their club with a passion, and they all are able to agree on events or activities in which they are excited for.

Enthusiasm thrives from inspiration. AS Pop music needs a lot of it in order to reach out to the whole community. Without a certain amount of enthusiasm or inspiration, success will not fall into their path. One of the biggest challenges AS Pop music runs into is training all the new-comers from the summer and eventually hitting something called &quot;the Wall.&quot; The Wall is mental road block where thinking of greater ideas no longer occur. They get through this by being positive and keeping each other inspired. When a group lacks enthusiasm, the best outcome does not show and strength is weakened. The submarine team lacks this enthusiasm with building their sub for the next race. Half their sub is built, letting them slack off, resulting attitude that does not give much hope for this sub. Enthusiasm, attitude and hope are some things that help keep a group organized and very alive.

In the Croquet Club, enthusiasm is probably their best quality.  On the day of the Alice in Wonderland tournament it was raining out, and it seemed that there were not really any new members in attendance.  Honestly, I would not have been surprised if the group would have decided to just reschedule the tournament to a later date.  But, not only did the Croquet Club decide to go on with the tournament anyways, they were still really excited about it.  This definitely surprised me, as I do not think most clubs would have made this same decision.  This is what keeps their club from falling apart or not happening.  The Cycling Club also seems to share this passion.  The Cycling Club seems to be under similar circumstances, as their club is pretty small, but the people that are members are die hards.  This is important, because as long as there is a small group of people are dedicated to a club it is will stay together, and maintain a strong foundation even as it may grow.

For Hillel, the way we organize events is a very modern way to organize events. Besides going out and gathering all the items necessary for the events such as food, arts and crafts or activities, we advertise our events on facebook. Hillel has created a Facebook group to explain and advertise our events. Before each quarter, the board meets to plan all events. We sit down with a master calendar and plan out all our Tuesday night events and our Shabbat and special events. Next year we will be adding more to our calendar, adding in Thursday and Friday night events. After the events have been put on the calendar, we plan what items we would like at the events including food and activities. Some of the events include movie nights and arts and craft night. Hillel has a very organized way of organizing the events.

Without enthusiasm and genuine passion for the cause or activity a club has little chance of survival. As you can see from the entries above enthusiasm plays a crucial role in the success of clubs across Western Washington University's campus. Enthusiasm and excitement is the driving force behind getting a club off the ground and without it no organization will ever get off the ground because enthusiasm is the fuel for the determination and hard work required to turn an idea into a reality.

With some clubs, like the South Asian Student Association, enthusiasm is one of the few things holding the group together. When the leaders remain determined and enthusiastic about their groups it becomes easier for the current members to remain strong and passionate. If there are any issues with membership or anything else with the club then a strong and enthusiastic leader can help pull the club through the rough patches. Enthusiasm can help do this because it helps show the members that it is still a functioning group. If the members believe that any problem is a little problem, then they will feel more confident of the groups success and that in its self will help the group succeed.

===Attitude===

Effective leaders must have an optimistic attitude when running their club.  People tend to feed off of other's attitude. If people see the person who is in charge very excited about the club and its intentions, that will naturally draw people in. Even if the club is struggling at the moment or enduring a hardship, the captains/presidents/co-presidents/coordinators must be optimistic about getting past the hard time, or else it will be difficult for the members to also. If the leaders of the club have a pessimistic attitude, then it will influence the attitudes of their members negatively, and the club will not survive.  Having an optimistic attitude shows the members that their leader believes in the club's success and its members' success.  It also makes recruiting more successful because it shows the potential members that the club and its leaders have something beneficial to offer. Having a negative attitude will automatically cause people do not want to attend because students in college already have a challenging time balancing attendance and academics. Along with holding a positive attitude for the goals of the group and its members, it is also important that the leader is very willing to work with and as a team. Oftentimes, the leader takes on too much responsibility and acts more as a dictator than a leader and it is important for that not to transpire. The leader cannot have a 'boss' attitude otherwise nothing will be accomplished and the club members will feel intimidated and inferior. Overall, it is important to keep in mind what kind of attitude not only your leaders give off, but also your club.

Although one's attitude is very crucial,I disagree with the fact that an optimistic attitude is the best one. Sure, being optimistic is very helpful at times, especially when thinking about the goals the group wants to achieve or looking at the overall picture, but I think that being overly optimistic is often where groups can fail. When it comes down to the technical stuff like money and time and scheduling, these are the times when group leaders and participants need to crack down and be realistic without setting their standards too high. Being realistic does not necessarily mean negative, I just think it is a much more beneficial technique to approach the group with. Many time if a group is to positive they might miss on what they have to improve on or make changes in the commmunication within the group.

Even though the Rugby Club has a difficult time keeping their members for long periods of time, their attitude toward this sport and club is what carries them on to make Rugby noticeable even more. This club is very team oriented is always looking for new recruits. Friendships are made between the teammates, and that shouldn’t stop others from joining in because the Rugby team offers a friendly attitude too towards the recruitment of any and all new players. Their attitude towards the future of this sport is positive seeing as in an interview with one of their members said, “We think that rugby is a sport that is building on a successful club based on commitment and success. And we are determined to see more players in the fall”. This year especially has turned around for them, in regards to new recruits. Overall, the Rugby Club’s attitude towards this club is strong and they are not going to give up when keeping new members fail. They are committed to make this club successful and also to make it better known. Another club such as the Making Western Diverse club also has the strong outlook that next year and the years to come will have an increase in new members. These attitudes can be the direct result in the success of clubs.

Another example is that even though the photography club had very few people attend the meetings every Monday, all members still have a positive attitude. It takes a special kind of person to keep up the enthusiasm and passion for the club even when numbers are small and money is low. The leaders of the Photography club were able to stay positive and keep it enjoyable for the rest of the members. This clearly shows how attitude is one of the most important things that keep a club alive. Devin Spencer is the leader of the Croquet Club and he tries very hard to make sure everyone has a good attitude. Sometimes tempers will flare when they have a heated game of Croquet but if it gets too out of control he always asks the members of the club to appologise and say something nice about each other. This keeps everyone happy. The club is a new club that just got brought back to Western Washington University. So it is up to the leaders to try and keep it going and to get more people involved. I think they know that they have to stay positive and have a great attitude in order to do so. Attitude is a very important issue, especially in a club like environment. Negative attitudes could bring the group down and ruin it, but with positive attitudes the club is able to proceed forward and hopefully improve problems later on in the future.  Another club that has a leader with a great attitude is the croquet club, because they are short on supplies but the leader keeps postitve and they try to work and do the best that they can.

Even though the Harry Potter Club only has a few members like the Photography Club, everyone there still has a great attitude. The leaders of the club all do there best to make the club fun and enjoyable, which then causes the members to be happy and they continue to come to the meetings. It is always hard to keep a good attitude when your club is small. The Harry Potter Club is no stranger to this. Following its first year dropped from around 30 members to about 10 to 15, a very easy situation to have sour attitudes that could cause the club to fall apart completely. However CCF has up to 400 students who attend which is why they have a staff to plan for Friday nights and all of the other events. Most western students would not be able to find the time to plan for 400 people every week. But despite that, they all still have a very positive attitude about the club, which helps keep it together. Like the Rugby Club, they are very team oriented in the sense that the leaders care what everyone is thinking. Leaders want and encourage members to express there opinions about what they want to do at upcoming meetings. Harry Potter is also always looking for new members, like most other clubs on campus. Their main goal is to just have a fun time.

For most of groups to survive on campus they’re in need for more funding. That led all these group members either to create a showcase, art gallery or producing CDs as part of the fund raise. These groups have to be exposure more in public for other wwu students to recognize them. Without knowing their talent it is hard for others to join them either financially or even people have the same interest. By compare with the Visual Art and Literature Society they are facing the same financial problem as the A’capella club on wwu campus. The lack of motivation need to be more active in actions to create fund raises. Every club were created as a group of people with common interest, but not every will be able to survive in the end. Therefore they need a leader to motivate other group members, but if the leader is not spending his or her time on their group then there isn’t much to talk about it. As the leader of A’capella club, Matt Bell ha contributes hours and hours to practice with others and also looking for all chances to perform as much as they could.

===Dedication===
Dedication is very important for any club member including club leaders. If you are going to commit to being in a club you need dedication to participate in events, outings, fundraising, and advertising. If you are a leader you need to be dedicated to plan events and show up for your fellow members. For the women in the woods group although memberhip is small when meetings are planned they depend on the leaders to be there and take them through the planned event. If you show a lot of dedication as a member you could one day become a leader for a group and show the new members how hard work and dedication paid off.

What seems to be the driving success of a lot of organizations is a group of dedicated people. When you attend the Student Homeless Outreach Team’s meetings, and read their interview transcripts it is clear how passionate all of the members are. They are putting a lot of time and effort into their ‘Be Our Guest’ event, because they truly believe in what they are doing. There are a few other clubs that claim to have some passionate members. An interviewer of the Strong Men’s club said, “I believe that their success here is due to the passion that they show”. It seems apparent that passion and dedication are what make the strongest clubs. Other groups, such as the A’capella group say, “it's important to us to keep our passion going and share it with others”. Many groups are full of members that are not just in their club for their own enjoyment, but to share what they are doing with others. From the SASA interviews it seems that their club is struggling a little but is holding on thanks to “a few dedicated members”. When clubs can increase their foundation of dedicated members it will increase their success.

Sexploration's creators are highly dedicated to the continuation and success of their brainchild. Created nearly four years ago, Sexploration has advanced as a direct result of its leaders. Sexploration reportedly started as a small group of girlfriends eating ice-cream and discussing sex on leader Grace's bedroom floor. Because of her dedication she was able to create a wonderful safe space for Western students to discuss sex. She plans to continue (and hopefully expand) Sexploration upon graduation; thanks to a huge amount of dedication, Sexploration has been made available to all students at Western.

The leaders of the Tango Club are very experienced and dedicated to the art of the Argentinean Tango. They both studied abroad in Argentina and said that they danced almost every night, spending long hours in learning the Argentinean Tango while they were there. They said that they’re no experts on the dance but feel confident in teaching it to other students to inspire them to learn more and possibly travel to Argentina one day. They want to instill their dedication onto their group members because it is hard work and takes time to become skilled in the dance. They always welcome new people to their meetings and this keeps their enthusiasm up because they are teaching new people to dance every week. They want their members to have the basics of the dance down first which is mainly what they teach at the meetings to inexperienced dancers. The leaders of Swing Kids are also very similar to the Tango Club leaders because they also have to be dedicated enough to make sure they teach their members the dance from their own experience.

Some organizational strategies are not always having dedication because if a club demands too much time it will eventually lead to being stressful.The needs of the biology club included an officers duties being a little time consuming. Some of the members cannot make it to all the meetings. This is more of a laid back club. The members come and go as they please because it is just a casual thing so its lacking on the organization.Yet this is not neccrssary a bad thing because although the dedication is not there the passion for learning is. This is in the end what keeps the club going.Women in the woods club suffers also from members coming and going as they please and not taking the club serious, yet it was said that the club is very important to the members.

Dedication is an important aspect of the Harry Potter club because they do not have a high enrollment. Dedication is what makes it possible for them to put on and attend events. They spend their time and effort working extra hard. Without the dedication of the members school, homework, and other activities would take priority over their club. It is purely dedication that keeps them together and active as an AS Club.

The homeless outreach team only has four members but each one is incredibly passionate about the social issues, seeing communication between groups of people, and empowering students to break down walls, that prevent communication. There is a lot of work that goes into the Be Our Guest event each quarter. If the members are passionate, they are equally dedicated. Each member is assigned a task to be completed by the next week in order for the event to be a success; tasks such as, designing a shirt, space reservation for tabling, publicity on campus, publicity downtown, getting students and guests to sign up, going to the AS for funding, and security. Another club I saw with a similar dedication was the disabilities awareness club. This club is also new, but stepped up to fill an entire week of events and recruited 60 volunteers to accomplish this. This club shows great promise just as the homeless outreach team does, both driven with their passion for what they are working towards. Dedication from club members is a powerful tool that can be used in lots of areas such as fundraising, recruitment, and events.

Western Men Against Violence (WMAV) is able to create an open environment for students to talk openly about sensitive issues and they encourage group members to be committed role models of the club’s values to others in the community. This is similar to the bodybuilding club in the WWU Rec Center. In an interview with a young bodybuilder, David McDonald, Laura Heydrich uncovered that David “was asked to join the club because some body builders saw my strong work ethic.” Now he feels that he is “inspirational and someone to look up to because [he’s] so young.” The WMAV has similar group members who join the club as freshman and promote the values as role models in the community. David also said that his club is dedicated to being “a supportive group that teaches others how to lift weight properly and reach goals.” In this way, the bodybuilding club has created an open environment for people to learn new things about lifting. It’s good to see that other clubs are taking the time to create an inviting atmosphere like the one found in WMAV meetings.

STAND does not have a leadership voting system within their club, just like in the club Men Against Violence, Cameron who is just a facilitator of the club for three years believes that when he graduates and leaves the club they will have someone fill in the position as needed. He is not too worried about a president position because all their members are strong and dedicated. STAND is similar in this way “We do not have a president; the club was co founded by two anthropology majors in the fall of 2006- Kathryn Young who is the advisor, and Karena Rounsaville who is the main contact for questions or issues. Our club shares ideas among everyone.” Both clubs have few, but very passionate and dedicated members and both rely on strong members to step up in the following years.

'''SRE (Students for Sustainable Energy)'''

The clubs members are incredibly dedicated to the cause.  Even though the club was not able to reserve a room for this year, 2008-09, they still meet every week.  Not every project that the members work on get approved by the Western Washington University Administration, however, they keep moving forward.  They are aware of the way the administration works and the hard work that is takes to get projects approved.  For example, most of the projects involve research, detailed proposals, and working with people outside of the club.  Their passion is evident.  Another group that shows passion for their work is the club, &quot;Be Our Guest,&quot; which is essential for the type of work that both club do.

===Maintaining Confidentiality===
We strive to feel safe, confident, and relaxed in our everyday lives. So in order for members of an organization to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, experiences, and stories a safe environment is necessary. Confidentiality is essential for a student organization to be effective. The club is a way to meet people that share the same interests as you so do not stray away because of being uncomfortable, the clubs are welcoming.

When asked about one of Sexploration’s greatest strengths, the club coordinator responded with the clubs confidentiality. Because Sexploration discusses topics on sex, it is very important that the members feel comfortable and therefore feel that what they share at meetings will be kept secret. Sexploration’s effective strategies in keeping their members secrets confidential include not giving out any names of their members. Also, they encourage everyone at the meeting to speak as well as participating themselves because the more members that speak up the more comfortable other members will be to tell their secrets. I found this pattern as well during another interview conducted with Sexploration’s co-coordinator. The co-coordinator was sure to not let out any member information. She also said that the club leader’s main job is to begin dialog and make their meetings and events feel like a safe place to tell their stories. As for other AS clubs, not many seemed focused on confidentiality being an important strength or an important thing to improve on.

===Adaptability===

If you want a lot of people to join your club, it is important that the group and leaders can adapt. Whether it is adapting to a time to meet or altering club goals and events, it is important to be flexible so everyone in the group has a say in what the club does. As time goes on everything changes and evolves including clubs so when leaders recognize this, it allows their clubs to grow and expand. By taking in new ideas and making small changes everyone will feel involved in the group and make your club more efficient in general. And besides it is a club, so people should be open to new ideas because who knows, they could be better than the old ones.

A great aspect of leadership along with the others listed is adaptability. Leaders should incorporate being flexible within their strategies because as students graduate and take their experience with them. It is essential for the remaining and new leadership to embrace the change and be able to adapt to the new changes. Campus Christian Fellowship has established a strong leadership community. This community has allowed it to keep CCF running over the years and has worked hard to overcome past obstacles. A member of the staff said that flexibility and adaptability were aspects of the staff that allowed it to run smoothly and effectively. He said that the CCF staff was able to accept change and change for the better, whether it was regarding a new idea or a new staff member. For example, the meetings had a democratic system and he explained their approach as coming into meetings with their ideas as pens on the back of their hands instead of clutched in their palms. Thus, each member of the leadership team comes prepared to change their ideas and accept new challenges and ideas. Members of the other organizations such as Hui o Hawaii Club expressed frustration pertaining to leadership. A member stated, “It’s kind of whoever is brave enough to take it on. We try really hard to get people involved who are juniors and sophomores so they can have some experiences for the next year, but our club is kind of relaxed so it’s just whoever has the initiative to do it. The hard part was in years past one person did most of it, and when she left she didn’t give us much direction so we kind of had to remake the club. But we’re in the process of getting more organized. Next year should be better.” The response shows how there are still issues with establishing key leaders within the club and when those leaders are found it is hard to replace them. It seems that the leadership of CCF has learned to deal with change and these types of changes because adaptability is a key part in their approach to running the organization. It is important to try and make the best of the situation even if that means changing and adapting a new way of operating.

===Goal Setting and Planning===
It is important for a group to create different goals to achieve. Goals are what unite a group and provide something for everyone in that group to strive towards. Groups that succeed in achieving substantive goals first collaborate in defining those goals as well as the method they will use to achieve them. A club flows better when all its members are in agreement with the set goals, so planning them out as an entire group is crucial. Effective leaders must be role models for the rest of the organization but also balance their responsibilities by delegating responsibilities to others.

However, setting goals is only the first step. Any club can set a goal but it is planning out ways to achieve that goal and ultimately completing it that is of importance. For example, a club could decide that their goal for the year is to put on 3 big events for the year. The fact that they are setting a goal is great. However, what they do with that goal after they set it that is what's important. They would need to make a list of what events they want to put on and set dates and assign group members to certain tasks regarding each event. They would need to set deadlines so that each step will be met and each group member will have completed their specific task. By the end of the year they will have met their goal. Conclusively, goals are important for groups but following through with them is even more important.

==Leadership Positions==

Leadership positions are important for any organization to be effective. However, there are a variety of ways in which leadership positions are filled as well as a myriad of types of people that may fill those leadership positions. A leader is not only limited to the main person in charge but everyone in the club has their role as a leader whether it be by organizing the group, keeping the group motivated or just being a dedicated member. The AS clubs would not be able to run without leadership from its appointed officers but also the members of the club as well. To become a successful club everyone involved must do their part to contribute to the growth of the club. 

Three main types of leadership strategies are used by these student organizations, having a single strong leader, having a hierarchy of several leaders potentially tied to the civic or university community or having decentralized leadership where all or much the membership shares leadership tasks. Each student organization is unique in what requirements they have for their leader(s) as well as the expectations of the role the leader(s) are expected to lead.

===Types of Leadership Positions===

One of the WWU Cycling clubs greatest qualities is their well defined leadership system. Within the interview we conducted with two of the leaders of the club they said, “We have a very active group of officers (President, VP, Treasurer, and Asst. Treasurer) that we elect at the end of the race season.” A well organized system of electing people for certain leadership positions within a club insures that the club will have people who know what they are doing and are in the best interest of the club. The leaders this year are working on some other issues the club has had in the past such as, “working to get a better relationship with WWU.” I found that a well defined selection process for clubs and effective leadership is really what makes a club run smoothly. In the Dead Parrots Society, Kyle Blodgett reported that , “The interview transcripts also indicate that the DPS has a relatively natural leadership system.” Another club that showed strong leadership was FAFSA and Geraldine Massengale reported that. “I believe leadership only gets better every year. The need for leadership in FASA is essential because of the amount of members we obtain every year.” Strong leadership looks like it is a very essential part of having an effective and lasting club.

Some groups, such as the Students Against Civilization, are able to function with little to no leadership.  They structure their meetings in a way that is probably unique only to them.  Their meetings consist mainly of discussion coming from each of the groups members.  The only leadership that is conducted is at the beginning, where one of the two members who formed the group writes the definition of civilization up on a chalkboard and reads an article that they have chosen as a discussion starter.  From there, ideas get bounced off members and different concepts of civilization and the world we live in today are spoken in a healthy environment.  This brings the dialogue down to a personal level, where each member can relate to what is being said.

Stephanie is the leader of the WWU Body Building club. She created the facebook group, hosted the Stongman competition and planned various other activities. Although Stephanie puts the most effort into keeping the club running, Alex, David and Rory set the standards for aspiring body builders. The three are always in the weight room ready to answer questions one may have. Together, the four leaders are well representatives of the WWU Body Building club.  Thanks to these leaders the group is unified and function well despite their lack of regular meetings.  

Besides the more common leaderships in clubs (ex. president, vice-president, and secretary), clubs, such as Voices for Planned Parenthood (VOX), may only have one main leader within the club. In the case of VOX, they have one organizer for the entire club. The other members are all equal in terms of leadership. This position is called Coordinator. The Coordinator is a student and an employee of Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood also provides many of the physical materials, etc. The person in this position is actually hired and serves as a link between the club and the organization in order to fill in both sides on the needs and requirements of both groups. It allows for VOX to be well supported monetarily and otherwise. Sometimes people from the organization go to club meetings and help out. According to my interview because of being aligned with an organization and an immediate point of contact with the organization, they have to worry less about fundraising and have more time for event planning. Other clubs on campus, such as the World Justice Awareness club, also has outside support but not as much. Since the VOX is funded and has an employee who is part of the club, there is also no need for a position such as treasurer that other clubs, such as the Dead Parrot Society, need.

Another organization that doesn't have the common leadership positions is CCF (Campus Christian Fellowship). In this organization they have campus pastors, interns, and core facilitators (corefas). Campus Pastors are the head leaders, along with the interns that help them accomplish the many tasks and events that they run for the current members and to reach out to others. Core facilitators are members that lead small groups. They are a key part to recruiting members, but overall bringing people to Jesus. They lead cores, which make CCF a more personal club for people to grow in their relationship with God and with other members. This club is one that needs many leaders, not just a few in order to better accomplish their goals and grow as an organization.

Like many other clubs on campus, the Harry Potter club has the traditional leaders. They have a president (which they call the &quot;Minister of Magic&quot;), officers (&quot;house prefects&quot;), and a treasurer. The incoming Minister of Magic is the current treasurer, events coordinator, and Hufflepuff prefect. He was nominated to be Minister of Magic, and voted in by the rest of the club. Since membership is on the low side, members often are asked to take on more than one role, something they have no problem doing since it will keep the club running. The other members in the club are asked for their input and it is valued, something that keeps them coming back each week.

===Length of Leadership Positions===
Leadership positions shouldn't be held by one person for too long. It is necessary for each position to have someone different about every year so that the club doesn't fail because people don't know how to run positions held by students that have left.  It is also important for the current position holder to train the new position holder in all the tasks of that position.  If positions are held for too long, then there is a big chance for there to be not enough innovation in the club and no new ideas. Although one student shouldn't hold the same position two years in a row, it would be a good idea for the student to choose another position so that there is someone with a years' experience within the leadership group.

In the case of some clubs, length of leadership positions can pose a problem. In smaller clubs like Women in the Woods, there are only two leaders who will shortly be graduating, and once they have left the club there is no one lined up to fill in for them. Because of this it is important for current leaders to help make a system for the extension of the club's sake because without a leader a club will fall apart. It is important for each club to have a leader, and it is important for that leader to know the length of their leadership and be able to have someone follow up when it is their time to step down. It is important for a leader to not have their position for too long, but it is also important for leadership to continue after the original leaders are through.

Like previously mentioned, the length of leadership positions should be monitored as to avoid domination of the club by one or a few certain individuals. However, in some situations, clubs are growing each year and more leadership positions are required to sustain the growing numbers. An example of this is seen in CCF. Each year the membership count for this club increases and the need for small group leaders, also known as Core Facilitators, in dorms increases as well. In this club, many Core Facilitators only tend to hold their position for one school year, but they are currently being encouraged to remain in this leadership position for at least two years, sometimes even three. The intent of these prolonged leadership positions is to provide a more in-depth experience for the Facilitator and give new Facilitators the chance to work with and learn from the more experienced leaders.

===Passing Down Information and Tasks to New Leaders===
In order to completely understand the effectiveness the that a club has on the community a deeper observation will need to take place with the club itself. I believe that in order to fully understand what a club has to offer, one must participate in the club and actively take part in the events. This participant observation will allow for a more thorough analysis of what is really taking place; as well as seeing how their hard work and organization throughout the quarter is coming together. By having potential new leaders observe the clubs organization and goals, information and the overall tasks of the club can effectively be passed down. We, as observers, should continue to monitor the success of the clubs and note how their planning is helping or hindering the publicity of the club. New leaders should step back from time to time and allow themselves to observe what is working and what is not for the club. Other questions can also be addressed to the club members about what has worked in the past and what has not. By asking specific questions about the organization of the club we can acquire a more detailed insight into whether or not their organization and leadership are truly effective in the overall performance of the club. With this new acquired insight information from previous years can help new leaders build a stronger and more effective club, while at the same time maintaining the original goals the club established.

Information regarding the club, organization and development of club protocol is important in order to maintain consistency in club effectiveness. One effective means of creating this consistency is through the development of a club binder. The club binder should be similar to a scrapbook, and also contain information regarding set up and development of club activities. The Students for Disabilities Awareness club has an effective strategy in regards to the club binder. A binder has been developed that contains names and phone numbers of past and present members, information about specific club events, and details regarding funding and monetary information.

One of the biggest problems that can arise in the area of club leadership is when a club runs into a situation where a large majority of their club officers end up graduating within a single year. Situations such as this lead to more than just a few problems as the club will then have to transition to a completely new set of leaders the next year. Luckily, there exist a few very effective strategies that will help ease the difficulties of the changeover. The first strategy was not found through formal interviews, but in casual conversation with a couple of senior club members from the Ritmo Salsa club. Apparently, the more senior club members have gained enough knowledge and experience about how the club is run to act as unofficial sub-leaders. With this strong, broad framework of leadership, the club, which is facing the graduation of both of its presidents this year, should have no problem with a change in leadership as the senior members seem more than capable of stepping forward to aid the new presidents in running the club. 
	
Looking into the interviews of other people researching the topic of club leadership a quote from an interview with a member of the Associated Students Productions club seemed to highlight the importance of having a strong framework of individual leadership. According to the interview, “[the Associated Students Productions] have a hard time trying to find people to step up and take charge of certain events and have them stick to it”. Since the Salsa club has strong support from its senior club members to help run the club underneath the presidents, the group doesn’t seem to experience many problems with people dropping the ball or failing to pick up the slack. This same focus on student leadership outside of the leadership provided by the club officials can also be seen in the Campus Christian Fellowship. The president of the Campus Christian Fellowship addressed this topic in an interview, saying, “the leadership body of CCF is made up of full time missionaries to make every effort to incorporate student leadership”. From personal observation as a former member of this club, I can attest that the emphasis on leadership from regular club members is part of what makes a large club like CCF so successful in executing its day-to-day activities and ensuring attendance to its events. When clubs such as these, who possess well-organized frameworks of leadership, transition between club officials the impact of the change in government is dramatically reduced because these clubs are not solely reliant on the management provided by a few key leaders in order to operate effectively.

Another very effective strategy for dealing with the loss of key club officials is to have more than one official of that office at any given time. The reason why it might be an asset to have at least two club leaders was found in an interview with the LEAD club. When asking about the protocol for selecting new leaders for the club, it was explained that, “each director [of the club] serves for two years. When a new one comes in, it is always on the second year of the veteran director so that someone familiar with the system can train the next wave”. An asset of having two different leaders in a club is that it can lead to this effective staggering method of leadership, which can considerably ease the burden of transferring leadership from one year to the next. Granted, the newer leader would have to be someone who is not the same grade as the older leader, which can possibly lead to issues based on choosing who can be eligible for leadership based on grade rather than skill. Other than that, though, the method of having more than one club leader seems to generally be an asset for clubs.

Passing down leadership has also been an issue with the Western Washington University club Women in the Woods.  The two women that are leading the club this year were both appointed the club leaders in an impromptu manner. They were not elected or chosen to be a leader; they just simply took over the leader position wholeheartedly. Now that they are both seniors and graduating this year, they have recognized that passing the torch to another member of Women in the Woods has proven to be a difficult task.  Currently they have been observing younger women in the club that have the qualities of a leader. They seek a leader with a great interest in being active outdoors and furthering the Women in the Woods legacy. While Women in the Woods will definitely have a new leader next year the passing of leadership to another member is a difficult task because they want to maintain a large amount of membership with women at Western that are interested in being outdoors. With the exit of the current club leaders Women in the Woods aspires to choose new leaders with the high amount of enthusiasm that they do now. They also hope to pass down the successes that they have had as leaders of Women in the Woods so that the club will continue at WWU.

===Distributing Responsibilities and Jobs===
One trait that will ensure a club’s success is its ability to delegate leadership. This not only promotes efficiency in the club, but also keeps members interested in the success and current happenings of the club. “We have found that by trying to focus on getting leadership positions filled, and keeping projects that pertain to each individual’s interest, we are able to keep people interested in staying with the club,” stated vice president of the Students for Renewable Energy club (SRE).  The current leadership of SRE attributes the fact that they have the club broken into committees (solar, education, conservation, and wind) as being one of the major reasons why the club has been able to accomplish as much as it has over the past six years. The current vice president of SRE stated, “We went from one meeting each week, to dividing up the members into committees that met at different times throughout the week. This made it so that people had leadership and investment in the club.  This allows for members to break up into different committees for which ever projects they are interested in.” It is this act of breaking the club into smaller interest groups that allows for members to feel personally involved in the club. Numerous other clubs, such as Harry Potter Club and Campus Christian Fellowship (CCF), also utilize delegated leadership to better run their club and maintain interest in the club. One anthropology student observed that in Harry Potter Club, “Although the president can get meeting events organized in the beginning, everyone has a hand in leading the club.  Opinions are openly expressed and everyone has the club’s best interests in mind.” This was also expressed by an anthropology student who observed CCF, “One more thing that is strength to CCF is the small group divisions called Core. What this does is help students get closer together as friends since CCF is such a large organization.” Regardless of the goals of the club or organization, it is helpful to delegate leadership and break larger groups into smaller groups. This not only allows for each individual to feel a personal commitment to the club, but can allow for more efficient meetings and completion of projects.

KUGS is very organized. Each member of their team has specific tasks that they carry out and certain positions they hold. Being in a leadership position at KUGS holds many responsibilities, but they are very clearly defined for each individual. The KUGS team works together very efficiently to complete their goals, and this is due to each person contributing exactly what is asked and expected of them. It is also helpful to them that one member also puts out a daily schedule, which helps them to stay on track. A daily schedule is a great idea, because completing daily goals and tasks is easier to manage at the station since there is always so much going on.

One of the strengths that the Student Homeless Outreach Team has is its leadership. The group is currently led by Anna. Though Anna is considered the President or leader of the club, the club runs more like a collaboration much like how the Harry Potter Club is run.Each group member is given a task to accomplish during the week after each meeting and to report the progress of their task at the next meeting. Joe said during his interview that this way works well. If the group did increase back up to the original number of 12, this method would still work.


===Sharing Leadership===

In situations involving groups, the role of a leader is often shared between members of the group. With effective leaders, this can greatly reduce the amount of work each leader does. There are groups that share leadership equally and there are those that have a type of hierarchy of power over the group. Both of these types can be effective depending on the type of club and how you organize it. The leaders must also make sure that once they step down from that position, that it will be filled the following year by someone who is capable and knows the inner workings of the club. This is often someone who has been attending the club regularly,and has an interest in becoming a leader

An important part of working with a group of people, is providing the most effective mode of leadership possible. In many cases this involves sharing the power of leadership amongst other members of the group. In the A'capella club, Matt Bell discussed in an interview that though he is considered the leader of the group, the power is shared fairly equally among the members.&quot; Well, as far as the mens group goes, I lead rehearsal and choose music, Ben and Chris have done most of the arranging that has been done, and Chris heads up the business side. ''But we always discuss everything as a group before it becomes definite''&quot;-Matt Bell. There are no set offices in the group yet, but this informal democratic ruling appears to work most effectively for them. However, the Dead Parrots Society does have running officers that change from year to year and this system works extremely efficiently for them. So in conclusion it really depends on the type of club and scenario that depicts the most ideal club leadership. But in any case, the leadership roles must be shared to be successful.

One way to keep a club going through time is to ensure that when one president leaves that the person that steps up to take their place is fully prepared. One way to ensure this is to share leadership between members. One club that does this very efficiently is Ritmo Salsa. The way the club meetings are designed actually promotes this idea of shared leadership. At meetings, the club members separate into a three-tiered system consisting of beginners, intermediate, and advanced dancers. Each tier then, has its own individual leaders. The leader of the beginner tier is the person that I interviewed, Rose Brockmeyer. She thinks the separation of the skills is great for the club because it ensures that each person in the group gets more attention than they would if the entire club learned together. There is two leaders to each group, and the co-presidents of the club are the leaders of the advanced group. By letting other members in the club teach in the beginning and intermediate groups, it ensures that there is always somebody that has teaching experience in the club. Though this is not exactly the same as A'capella club, the ideas are similar. Both clubs share power between the members, which ensures that the club will not fail if one of those people leaves because there is other people with experience to take their place. I would compare the two co-presidents, Rachel and Sarah, to Ben and Chris, who chose the arrangements for the club and then allow the club to figure out how they are going to run them. Rachel and Sarah teach the moves that the members should know and give helpful tips to guide, but they allow members to choose how they wish to perform. This makes everybody feel like they have more power and more influence because they have total control over all of their routines. Sharing power is a very effective strategy that many successful clubs implement. This is similar to the Photography Club. Carmen Daneshmandi, the current leader of the club, not only had her position passed on to her from an older student, as a freshman, she had relatively little experience with the club. This is where the current, older members of the club came into the picture so to speak, to offer advice and help her lead. Carmen feels not like a leader, but an organizer and point person for the club. She no doubt will hone her skill very quickly and be an excellent leader.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{center|This category contains books on '''[[Subject:Electronic games|electronic games]]''': games that employ electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. The most common form of electronic game today is the video game, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Books include information on the cultural significance of specific electronic games, and application of electronic games as learning and education tools. For games part of the same series, one book is preferred. Wikibooks is not for walkthroughs and strategy guides&amp;mdash;use [[strategywiki:|StrategyWiki]] instead.}}

Books on this bookshelf include information on the cultural significance of specific electronic games, and application of electronic games as learning and education tools. In addition to the listing here, the books can also be browsed through Wikibooks' [[:Category:Computer and video games|categories]]. For games in a series, each game may have its own individual book, however it is preferred to have one book for the entire series of games.

For writing walk-throughs and strategy guides see [[StrategyWiki:Main Page|StrategyWiki]]. You may want to consult the [[Wikibooks:Game manual guidelines|Game manual guidelines]] before adding a new Wikibook to this category, or before developing similar content, in order to avoid deletion later.

                                                             Computer Information System - Videoconferencing

Using videoconferencing has definitely afforded opportunities to students of this generation that have not existed before.  In the past, for a student to see a foreign country they would have to travel to that country, see it on TV or in a magazine, but now with the power of technology, students do not have to leave the classroom.  Everything is at their fingertips.  Videoconferencing has become increasingly popular.  Personally, I believe that videoconferencing is an excellent way to connect students and professionals from across the world and to take them to places that they cannot even imagine while having fun and learning at the same time. 

Polycom is a videoconference base software system that the Funeral Services Education program will be implementing into their program by August 2009 to expand their delivery options. The implementation of this software system is part of the major renovation of the Embalming Lab. The goal of the implementing this software system is to allow for live body preparation (embalming) demonstrations to broadcast across the state of South Carolina for students and Funeral Service Professionals for their professional development.  If someone misses a videoconference, it will be able to be viewed at a later time at a pass coded site.

Analysis Phase

In the Analysis Phase, the ad hoc committee will evaluate the results that are yielded from the planning phase of the project.   During this time, it is important to make sure that this software system works with system that it will be implemented.  Also, the committee has 

What are the benefits to using this software?

Multiple users can meet, share, edit documents/spreadsheets and communicate synchronously 
If an attendee misses the meeting, the meeting can be recorded and be viewed later by the user.
What is the total cost of this project?  

$19, 303
 

 
Design Phase

During the Design Phase, it is important for the ad hoc committee to determine to proper placement of the system to maximize its’ potential.  The equipment will be installed in the Preparation Room in V Building at Piedmont Technical College.

 
 

Equipment

2 Flat Screen TVs 

Implementation Phase

During the implementation, the Information Technology Department of the college will oversee the installation of the videoconferencing system.  Once the system is installed, the IT Department will be responsible the training of the users, the maintenance and the security of the system.

 

 
Assessment

True/False

Polycom is videoconferencing software system? 
Polycom allows for a videoconference to be recorded and viewed later by a user without a pass code? 
Piedmont Technical College will be using Polycom to offer continuing education programs. 
It will take 1 year for Piedmont Technical College to implement the Polycom software system. 
Only one user at a time can use the Polycom system.

== Editor Duty ==


Writing a textbook involves two processes: authoring and editing. You will participate in both. As an author you will make substantial contributions to the content of our textbook. You will write a wikibook article: either a content article or a special feature. As an editor, you will help edit that content, deciding what gets into our official text. Additionally, as an editor you will help to summarize the content of our text to make reading and reviewing the contents easier for readers. 

'''The Editing Process'''

You will sign up to edit a specific chapter. You will select a specific Editor Duty to complete within that chapter. 

You will read and rate all of the articles in that chapter which will determine which articles become part of the official text and which will also determine students' grades on those articles. 

After you read and rate all the articles in the chapter, you will perform an Editor Duty which will help to summarize the content in that chapter.


== Editor Duties ==


There are three Editor Duties for each chapter. You will select one to complete. 

*Chapter Introduction
*Chapter Review
*Additional Resources

'''Chapter Introduction:''' 

This Editor Duty includes two parts: writing a 1-2 paragraph introduction and adding a chapter picture.

Write 1-2 paragraphs that introduce the reader to the main topic of the chapter. You may want to start with an attention-getter, perhaps a quotation, question or scenario. Present some of the topics that will be discussed in the chapter and give an overview of what the reader can expect to learn.   

Select and post a picture/image for the chapter. The picture/image should correspond to the content of the chapter. If appropriate, provide an explanation or description. In addition to photographs, the image could be a cartoon, drawing or other visual image. Remember, like all images posted to Wikibooks, you must have made the image yourself or used an image from the public domain.

'''Chapter Review'''

Write 1 paragraph briefly summarizing the issues discussed in the chapter highlighting important terms, concepts or ideas and drawing some conclusions regarding the main points teachers need to understand on the topic.

Copy and paste all the learning targets from the officially selected articles (this includes the content articles AND all the Special Feature articles) into the Chapter Review. Edit these learning targets as needed to make them well-defined, measurable objectives.

Copy and paste all the multiple-choice questions from the officially selected articles (this includes the content articles AND all the Special Feature articles) into the Chapter review. Edit/remove questions as needed. All included questions should be of high quality, meaning:

*they test important information (the learning targets)
*they are clearly worded
*they have one correct answer and three reasonable distractors (incorrect response options) 
*they adhere to the guidelines for writing multiple-choice questions.
These questions will be entered into the Quiz database and used in the Quizzes and may be selected to be on the midterm or final exam.

Remember, as you modify multiple-choice questions, you must be sure to modify them not only in the Chapter Review, but also in the content articles from which the questions were drawn.  Likewise, you must be sure that your modifications to multiple-choice questions do not conflict with the information in the content articles from which the questions were drawn.

'''Additional Resources'''

Provide links to additional resources students can refer to on this topic if they have questions or would like to learn more. These resources will most likely be web links but could also be print sources or people to contact. For each link provided, write a short description explaining what the resource is and why students may want to access it. The resources should either help students understand material related to the topic of the chapter or provide additional related information that may help students in their path to licensure or later in their own classrooms.</text>

== About the Author/Educational Philosophy ==


You will create your user home page in our course Wikibook and link it to our &quot;About the Authors&quot; table of contents discussion page.

Assignment Value: 50 points

1-2 paragraph description of yourself (About the Author): 20 points

2 or more paragraphs describing your philosophy of education: 20 points

Posting a link to your user page on our &quot;About the Authors&quot; Page: 10 points


== Technical Instructions: ==


You will need to have a Wikibooks username to complete this assignment. Please see the directions for creating a Wikibooks username if you do not already have one.

*Log in to Wikibooks and navigate to our course text

*Go to the &quot;About the Authors&quot; section (there is a link on the title page)

*Find the letter that your Wikibooks username begins with

*Click &quot;edit&quot; on the right hand side of the screen that is directly across from your letter

*When the editing page appears, type four tildes underneath your letter. Four tildes is wikicode for your user name.

*Click &quot;Save page&quot;

*Your username should now appear on our &quot;About the Authors&quot; page.

*On the &quot;About the Authors&quot; page, click on your username. This will open up a new page.

*When the page opens you may begin adding content to your page. Remember to hit &quot;Save Page&quot; any time you make a change you want to keep.

== Assignment Directions: ==


'''About the Author description--'''

On your user home page you should write a paragraph or two (or you can use bullets) introducing yourself. You can use only your Wikibooks user name or you can include your first and last name. You may want to write what city you are in and what you plan to study/teach. You can tell us why you want to be a teacher and/or what inspired you to be a teacher. You may include other information about yourself e.g. family members, hobbies, pets etc. if you like.

'''Your Educational Philosophy--'''

On this page you will also include your initial philosophy of education statement. We expect this will change over the course of the semester and over the course of your entire pre-service education. We don't expect you to have cemented all your ideas about education this early in your academic career. Instead, we are looking for you to start thinking about what you believe and why.

You do NOT need to do any research for this assignment. Instead, write from the heart. What are some of your thoughts and ideas on what makes a good teacher? What kind of educator do you want to be?

Your philospohy of education should be at least two paragraphs long and address two or more of the topics listed below:

*Diversity (e.g. How should students with special needs be handled? Should boys and girls be taught differently? Should students be grouped by ability? Should there be Bilingual education or English only? What about Ebonics? Will you treat “at-risk” students differently?)

*Instructional strategies (e.g. Will you use mostly lecture or group assignments? Will all students have the exact same requirements?)

*Classroom environment (e.g. How do you picture your future classroom? Consider, for example: student interactions, student-teacher interactions, parental involvement, collaboration with other teachers, the students’ level of engagement, motivation, and the classroom management techniques you plan to use)

*Technology (What kinds of technology will your students use?)

*Assessment (How will you find out what your students know and can do? Will you ask students to be involved in the assessment process by doing self-reviews, peer-reviews?) 

*Curriculum (What's the purpose of schools? To teach strict academic content or to pass on values and culture? Should we focus on the basics, critical thinking, creativity, reading? Should secondary schools emphasize college prep or vocational programs? How should we deal with art, PE, sex ed, creationism? Should we have a national curriculum or should schools reflect their communities?

*Other issues that are important to you.</text>

== Colors ==

[http://html-color-codes.com/ Here's a link to a webpage that lists the codes for lots of different colors]

== Fonts ==

&lt;font color=&quot;#6600FF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot; font size=4&gt;To change the font type or font color, see my code here. You can type font color=&quot;#type the six-digit code&quot; to change the color and face=&quot;Type in the name of the font here&quot;. FYI not all fonts will work. All this code needs to be inside carrots &lt;&gt;. If you don't want a font to be used for the entire paper you need to &quot;turn the font off&quot; by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; when you want it to go back to normal. '''I suggest using normal black font for all of your text''' except for sidebars or other parts you might want to highlight. Don't just write your text in purple and green for fun. Our eyes would hurt!! &lt;/font&gt;

== Sidebars ==



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Come to the

Salem Witch Trials: An exciting blend of entertainment

for the entire family will be provided including

dunking, exorcism, and hanging.&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;
To make a side bar like mine, hit &quot;edit this page&quot; and scroll down until you see the coding surrounding the Salem Witch Trials content. You can then copy and paste this code directly into your Wiki article and modify it in the ways I describe below. You can also copy the coding from other Wiki articles you like.


If you would like your side bar to use different colors than these, check out this website which lists the codes for a wild assortment of colors:http://www.computerhope.com/htmcolor.htm


Once you find a color you like, copy the color code and paste it over the background (or border) color code # I have listed. 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Copy this code if you would like your side bar to be a little more subdued and look like this! 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

If you would like to have a thinner (or thicker) border around your side bar, you can adjust the number in &quot;border: solid 10px&quot;. For example, change it to 1px for a very thin border.


If you would like to change the color of the text, see my note above. 


I made the text in my sidebar larger than normal. You can change it back to regular size by deleting the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; that is listed right before and after my sidebar text. 


You can decide how big to make your side bar (by changing the width percentage --mine is at 60%) and whether you want to center it or align it to the left or right (ALIGN=CENTER or ALIGN=RIGHT, etc.).


I centered the text in my sidebar by writing &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; before my text.  &lt;/font&gt;</text>

&quot;When the verb starts in a vowel, we don't add an extra vowel to the beginning of the stem:&quot;

: If the form '''ítie''' is authentic it actually shows that a sundóma prefix '''''is''''' is added to stems beginning in a vowel -- resulting in a long vowel, indistinguishable from stem vowel lengthening, only it is shortened again if followed by two consonants.  Or to put it otherwise sundóma prefixation and stem vowel lengthening conspire to give the same result, so who can say which of them happens and which doesn't?

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;Welcome to Elie Matar's Wikipage.&lt;/big&gt;

Elie Matar is an Astrophysicist specializing in the formation of molecules on interstellar dust grains and in Laboratory Astrophysics. At the time being, he is living in Paris, France and working in the LERMA (Laboratoire d'Etude du Rayonnement et de la Matière en Astrophysicque) at the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon and the university of Cergy-Pontoise. He was born on March the 5th 1980 in a small lebanese town called Nahmeh or Naameh (meaning &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot;). In the year 1984 his family moved to Jezzine (South Lebanon) to a small village called Bkassine where he stayed until before his university studies in 1999, where he went to Beirut, the capital, and stayed there for 5 years. He majored in General Physics at the Faculty of Science II at the Lebanese University. He then went to Lyon, France where he got a Masters in Astrophysics from the university of Claude Bernard Lyon 1). After that he went to Paris, France in 2006 to conduct his Ph.D. studies in the LERMA where he is working at the time being.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organizations==
In sociology '''organization''' (or '''organisation''') is understood as planned, coordinated and purposeful action of human beings to construct or compile a common tangible or intangible product. This action is usually framed by formal membership and form (institutional rules). Sociology distinguishes the term organization into planned formal and unplanned informal (i.e. spontaneously formed) organizations. Sociology analyzes organizations in the first line from an institutional perspective. In this sense, organization is a permanent arrangement of elements. These elements and their actions are determined by rules so that a certain task can be fulfilled through a system of coordinated division of labor.

An organization is defined by the elements that are part of it (who belongs to the organization and who does not?), its communication (which elements communicate and how do they communicate?), its autonomy (which changes are executed autonomously by the organization or its elements?) and its rules of action compared to outside events (what causes an organization to act as a collective actor?).

By coordinated and planned cooperation of the elements, the organization is able to solve tasks that lie beyond the abilities of the single elements. The price paid by the elements is the limitation of the degrees of freedom of the elements. Advantages of organizations are enhancement (more of the same), addition (combination of different features), and extension. Disadvantages can be inertness (through co-ordination) and loss of interaction.

=== Pyramids or hierarchies ===
A hierarchy exemplifies an arrangement with a leader who leads leaders. This arrangement is often associated with bureaucracy. Hierarchies were satirized in ''The Peter Principle'' (1969), a book that introduced ''hierarchiology'' and the saying that &quot;in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence&quot;.

An extremely rigid, in terms of responsibilities, type of organization is exemplified by Führerprinzip.

=== Committees or juries ===
These consist of a group of peers who decide as a group, perhaps by voting. The difference between a jury and a committee is that the members of the committee are usually assigned to perform or lead further actions after the group comes to a decision, whereas members of a jury come to a decision. In common law countries legal juries render decisions of guilt, liability and quantify damages; juries are also used in athletic contests, book awards and similar activities. Sometimes a selection committee functions like a jury. In the Middle Ages juries in continental Europe were used to determine the law according to consensus amongst local notables.

Committees are often the most reliable way to make decisions. Condorcet's jury theorem proved that if the average member votes better than a roll of dice, then adding more members increases the number of majorities that can come to a correct vote (however correctness is defined). The problem is that if the average member is ''worse'' than a roll of dice, the committee's decisions grow worse, not better: Staffing is crucial.

Parliamentary procedure, such as Robert's Rules of Order, helps prevent committees from engaging in lengthy discussions without reaching decisions.

=== Staff organization or cross-functional team ===
A staff helps an expert get all his work done. To this end, a &quot;chief of staff&quot; decides whether an assignment is routine or not. If it's routine, he assigns it to a staff member, who is a sort of junior expert. The chief of staff schedules the routine problems, and checks that they are completed.

If a problem is not routine, the chief of staff notices. He passes it to the expert, who solves the problem, and educates the staff – converting the problem into a routine problem.

In a &quot;cross functional team&quot;, like an executive committee, the boss ''has'' to be a non-expert, because so many kinds of expertise are required.

=== Organization: Cyclical structure===
A theory put forth by renowned scholar Stephen John has asserted that throughout the cyclical nature of one’s life organizational patterns are key to success. Through various social and political constraints within society one must realize that organizational skills are paramount to success. Stephen John suggests that emphasis needs to be put on areas such as individual/ group processes, functionality, and overall structures of institutions in order to maintain a proper organization. Furthermore, the individual's overall organizational skills are pre-determined by the processes undertaken.:

=== Matrix organization ===
This organizational type assigns each worker two bosses in two different hierarchies. One hierarchy is &quot;functional&quot; and assures that each type of expert in the organization is well-trained, and measured by a boss who is super-expert in the same field. The other direction is &quot;executive&quot; and tries to get projects completed using the experts. Projects might be ''organized by regions, customer types, or some other schema.
matrix management''

=== Ecologies ===
This organization has intense competition. Bad parts of the organization starve. Good ones get more work. Everybody is paid for what they actually do, and runs a tiny business that has to show a profit, or they are fired.

Companies who utilize this organization type reflect a rather one-sided view of what goes on in ecology. It is also the case that a natural ecosystem has a natural border - ecoregions do not in general compete with one another in any way, but are very autonomous.

The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline talks about functioning as this type of organization in [http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,1294443,00.html this external article] from The Guardian.

=== &quot;Chaordic&quot; organizations ===
The chaordic model of organizing human endeavors emerged in the 1990s, based on a blending of chaos and order (hence &quot;chaordic&quot;), comes out of the work of Dee Hock and the creation of the VISA financial network. Blending democracy, complex system, consensus decision making, co-operation and competition, the chaordic approach attempts to encourage organizations to evolve from the increasingly nonviable hierarchical, command-and-control models.

Similarly, emergent organizations, and the principle of self-organization. See also group entity for an anarchist perspective on human organizations.

Organizations that are legal entities: government, international organization, non-governmental organization, armed forces, corporation, partnership, charity, not-for-profit corporation, cooperative, university.

==Leadership in organizations==
===Leadership in formal organizations===
An organization that is established as an instrument or means for achieving defined objectives has been referred to as a '''formal organization'''. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work structure. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Each employee receives a salary and enjoys a degree of tenure that safeguards him from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher his position in the hierarchy, the greater his presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position. &lt;ref name = &quot;Cecil&quot;/&gt;

===Leadership in informal organizations===
In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the '''informal organization''' that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal objectives and goals of the individual membership. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life — the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cecil&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Cecil A Gibb|title= Leadership (Handbook of Social Psychology)|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1970|pages=884–89|isbn=0140805176 9780140805178|oclc=174777513|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prehistoric times, man was preoccupied with his personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now man spends a major portion of his waking hours working for organizations. His need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging continues unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.&lt;ref name = &quot;Henry&quot;/&gt;

Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization. Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain cooperation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.&lt;ref name = &quot;Henry&quot;/&gt;

===Leader in organizations===
An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of his position. However, he must possess adequate personal attributes to match his authority, because authority is only potentially available to him. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry P. Knowles; Borje O. Saxberg|title=Personality and Leadership Behavior|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1971|pages=884–89|isbn=0140805176 9780140805178|oclc= 118832|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hybrid organizations ==
A hybrid organization is a body that operates in both the public sector and the private sector, simultaneously fulfilling public duties and developing commercial market activities. As a result the hybrid organization becomes a mixture of both a part of government and a private corporation.

== Learning Targets ==
&lt;font color=&quot;6666FF&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=2&gt;
Readers should be able to:
*recognize and understand the concepts of the original R's
*grasp the basic concepts of writing
*understand the differences between phonics and whole language
*decide if a piece of work is plagiarized

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;9933CC&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=4&gt;

== Introduction ==
&lt;font color=&quot;6666FF&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=2&gt;
Back in the 1800's, Sir William Curtis an alderman later dubbed Lord Mayor of London made a toast to the Board of Education(Sir William) about &quot;reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic&quot;(American Heritage). It is unknown if he pronounced the words inaccurately on purpose due to illiteracy or if he was trying to be ironic. Either way, the phrase was found intriguing and used by others. However, there are more subjects in today's schools, more and different jobs that involve technology and other medias than there was in the 1800's, so it's smart to say that the 'Three R's' have changed or expanded from just reading, writing, and arithmetic. Because of this teaching has changed as a whole, instead of focusing on teaching the original 'Three R's' we are now teaching multiple subjects. 
&lt;br&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;9933CC&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=4&gt;

== Original Three R's ==
&lt;font color=&quot;6666FF&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=2&gt;
When Sir William Curtis introduced the 'Three R's', it was from then on assumed that reading, writing, and arithmetic would be the basis of education. One had to master these three subjects before he, and sometimes she, could move on in life and be successful. From there he could go into a profession and learn other subjects such as science, history, literature, etc. In modern times we are taught first how to count, recite the alphabet and recognize it. Afterwards, we expand to applying this knowledge into reading literature, studying history, investigating science, and others. From there we choose different electives to study more in depth leading us to our chosen careers. 

Students should be able to absorb the 'Three R's' knowledge and use it. Basically being able to recite, recognize, and write letters' then form them into words. Finally, these words can become sentences, paragraphs, papers. Students also need to know how to count and calculate. From there they can solve mathematical problems that can help with medical, scientific, and technological breakthroughs. However there are certain rules and steps they need to follow in order to do these things properly. 

=== Reading ===
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #9966FF;
border: solid 5px #0000FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Click here to go to a kid friendly web page that helps in teaching to read. Uses phonics and whole language. http://www.starfall.com/
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
The ongoing debate on how to teach to read is whether to use phonics, pronouncing the word by each syllable, or whole language, emphasizing the use and recognition of words in everyday context (whole language). The debate is whether to stress technique and mastery, phonics, or meaning and context, whole language (Roy). There are three sides to this, those supporting phonics, those in favor of whole language, and some who believe that reading should involve both ideas. &quot;Research evidence also shows that a balanced approach works better for children learning to read&quot; (Early).





=== Writing ===
Writing follows precise rules such as grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling.

:Grammar includes:
::*Person, Place or Thing
::*Subject, verbs and their agreement
::**&lt;u&gt;Fluffy&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Babydoll&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; my pets.
::*Pronouns
::**I, You, He, She, It, We, They
::*Adjectives 
::** Describe Nouns
::***&quot;sweet apple&quot;; &quot;ugly color&quot;
::*Adverbs
::**revise any word except for nouns and pronouns
::**answers how, when, where
::***&quot;swam quickly&quot; 
:Punctuation includes:
::*Periods, Quotation Marks, Question Marks, Exclamation Points
::*Colons, Parenthesis
::*And many more  

Along with the writing rules, there is also a '''legal''' rule. Plagiarism, the use of one's words or ideas as your own without crediting them, in education betrays trust in the student and teacher, creates liars and dishonest people. Plagiarism is also theft, if caught you could face charges from failing the paper being arrested, having a record, and paying a fine. However, some may not realize that they are plagiarizing. Here are some tips on how to avoid it, always give credit when (Overview):
:* another person's ideas, opinions, or theories are used
:* facts, statistics, graphics, drawings, music, etc.,is used and did not come from the government
:* quoting 
:* paraphrasing 
:* giving a fact that is not common knowledge

=== Arithmetic ===
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;10%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #9966FF;
border: solid 5px #0000FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
[[Image:clock.svg]]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Math is important because we use it in everyday routines, such as(Importance): 
:* Problem solving
:* Budgeting money
:* Time management
:* Calculating tips and tax
:* Memorizing phone numbers and locker combinations
:* Estimating distances or weight

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;9933CC&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=4&gt;

== Fourth R and Beyond ==
&lt;font color=&quot;6666FF&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=2&gt;

In today's classrooms reading, writing, and arithmetic are still the basis for learning everyday subjects such as math, literature, history and science. However, knowledge in the classroom does not stop there but continues on into saving the environment, forming relationships, and expanding the creative side of your brain. If you were to go out into the world today and ask people what they thought the &quot;Three R's' were you might be told multiple different things such as Relief, Recovery and Reform from the Great Depression; or Revenue, cost Reduction, and Regulations from a businessman (Three Rs). Although, these 'Three R's' do not relate to education another set does and that is reduce, recycle and reuse (Waste Hierarchy). 

=== Reduce, Recycle, Reuse ===
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #9966FF;
border: solid 5px #0000FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Click here to go to a kid friendly web page about Reduce, Recycle, and Reuse. http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/recycle.htm 
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
It may not seem to be apart of education, however teachers are always trying to teach their students to conserve and be apart of repairing the environment. Some schools, such as Southeastern Elementary in Chesapeake, Virginia will have each grade level plant at least one tree every year. The students are being taught how to use scissors correctly and are praised when they waste as little paper as necessary. Teachers even come up with art ideas such as using old scraps of paper to form a collage. 




=== Relationship ===
Teachers today not only want their students to be successful in technology and knowledge, but to be able to go out in the world and form a relationship with friends, family, boss, co-workers, future children, and future husband/wife. 

=== Rhythm ===
Music is apart of everyday life. People listen to it in their car, at home, in movies, while trying to relax, at concerts, and much more. Music is a stress reliever and helps increase energy. Music cannot be made without rhythm. As a fourth R, Rhythm can also be used to help memorize a poem, or make a story interesting like in the movie &quot;Renaissance Man&quot;. 

=== Art === 
Art, Fine Art, is important because it brings knowledge to your brain, senses, and emotions, basically educating your soul. Art teaches many things such as observing reality, making judgments,understanding the human conditions, expressing values, training the mind, and uniting reason and emotion(Fourth R).   



Some educators believe that one or more of the above should be added on to the 'Three R's'. 

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;9933CC&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=4&gt;

== To Answer the Question ==
&lt;font color=&quot;6666FF&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=2&gt;
In my opinion, the basics of learning reside in the original &quot;Three R's&quot;, however as time goes on we expand our knowledge. Since we are expanding our knowledge there are more lessons being taught. Some of these lessons have SOL's, Standards of Learning tests (state of Virginia)such as a being able to read the amount of liquid in a tube whereas others do not such as Recycle, Reduce and Reuse. Just like in the debate of phonic and whole language, it is the combination of all these things and more that make up education.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;9933CC&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=4&gt;

== Quiz ==
&lt;font color=&quot;6666FF&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=2&gt;

== '''Is There a &quot;Hidden Curriculum&quot;? Where is it Hiding?''' ==
'''
by Aubrey W. Bibbs, Jr.




'''

== '''Learning Targets''' ==

'''


1. Reader should be able to recognize various types of hidden curriculum/character education.


2. Reader will be able to identify reasons for implementing a hidden curriculum/character education into an existing curriculum.


3. Readers are expected to distinguish the differences between the goals associated with hidden curriculum/character education from those of a traditional/formal curriculum.




'''

== '''Introduction''' ==
'''
 



The Random House College Dictionary (1988) defines curriculum as: âthe aggregate of courses of study given in a school, college, etcâ (p. 328).  The term âhidden curriculumâ comes from the concept that such an aggregate of courses is comprised of a curriculum which is both formal and informal, also known as written or directed curriculum and unwritten or undirected curriculum respectively. Formal curriculum is traditionally an explicit lesson plan, either produced by the individual teacher or created by the school/school district intended to address intellect and/or vocation, and teach lessons in areas of study such as: mathematics, science, reading, writing and art. Informal curriculum, commonly referred to as hidden curriculum, due to its implicit nature, addresses behavioral and character aspects of life which include, but are not limited to: social responsibility, personal relationships, competition, respect for authority and time management.  These aspects are taught by such methods, techniques and procedures as class bells, restroom passes, dress codes, classroom etiquette, class rank charts, etc.

The general consensus is that hidden curriculum has the potential to teach, stimulate and foster good or bad lessons, behavioral pattern and character traits respectively.  Some educators feel that hidden curriculum is creating more negative repercussions for students and society, than it is positive results. John Taylor Gatto (1992) expressed his concern during a speech by stating, ââ¦these are the things you pay me to teach. 1. CONFUSIONâ¦2. CLASS POSITIONâ¦3. INDIFFERENCEâ¦4. EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCYâ¦5. INTELLECTUAL DEPENDENCYâ¦6. PROVISIONAL SELF-ESTEEMâ¦7. ONE CANâT HIDEâ¦â (p. 2-12).  His main argument was that hidden curriculum was âdumbing us downâ (Gatto).  This was a popular sentiment echoed throughout school systems and communities in the U.S. over the past thirty to forty years.




'''

== '''Teaching Character''' ==
'''




Recently, in the past ten to fifteen years, there has been a collective effort by parents, educators and politicians alike for schools to look into placing more focus on areas of hidden curriculum such as, character education; also referred to as value education or moral education intended to help students âto acquire certain character strengths: sound judgment, a sense of responsibility, personal courage, and self-masteryâ (Ryan &amp; Bohlin, 1999, p. 207), and realize both the individual benefit and the benefit to the greater good of society when they âinternalize these lifelong habitsâ (p. 207).  This movement was brought on by obvious indications that our nation's youth was lacking sufficient moral fiber as demonstrated through âfrightening statistics about youth homicides and suicides and by soaring numbers of teen pregnanciesâ (p. xiii), staggering high school drop out rates and gang affiliation. As a result of the movement to create formal programs which propagate positive outcomes by focusing on the potential that hidden curriculum has to influence character development, the term âhidden curriculumâ has become synonymous with character education.  Another point presented by advocates for character education is that a value/moral driven curriculum was deemed a necessity by our nationâs founding fathers, such a Thomas Jefferson, who believed that formally teaching virtue early on was integral to the ultimate success of our nation and its established structure (Lickona, 1991).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;âTo educate a person in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to societyâ (Lickona, 1991, p. 3). 
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



 
'''

== '''Criticism''' ==
'''



One would be hard pressed to find a teaching philosophy, idea or technique that was introduced without some form of criticism, skepticism or opposition. So, despite concerns from educators in regards to the countless challenges that students face beyond the scope of academics, an air of skepticism still lingers among many. Taking into consideration the enormous pressures placed on educators to create and implement lesson plans in accordance with No Child Left Behind legislation, consequently forcing many teachers to make drastic adjustments to their preexisting curricula and teaching styles; many educators find it unfeasible to introduce and implement a character driven curriculum while simultaneously maintaining a traditional academic driven curriculum (Allred, 2008, November).  Another source of pessimism stem from claims that character education âamounts to imposing particular values or personality traits on young people or crude manipulations of children by dominant powers in their livesâ (Ryan &amp; Bohlin, 1999, p. 140).  Simply put, some educators feel that character education is nothing short of âbrainwashingâ (Ryan &amp; Bohlin, p. 140) children.  Aside from fear of a decline in academic standing, failing to meet academic benchmarks or indoctrination, educators are open to and optimistic about employing a curriculum that encompasses both academic advancement and character development.




'''
== '''Character Education Programs''' ==
'''




There are dozens of character education programs in practice today, making it unfeasible to discuss each one individually. Instead, an overview of some of the key overlapping points from the numerous character education programs currently in use is a more practical approach. Most programs adopt a curriculum centered on a structure that promotes a synergy among the individual student, community and society.  Essentially, these programs expect to teach students to make positive decisions not just for self benefit, but for the well being of others.  Due to the nature of such programs and their goals, they are often divided into components or levels.  Some programs consist of more components than others (components within components), but essentially share three similar components: the school, the family and the community.  Additionally, these programs rely heavily on a philosophy that encourages students to use a three division cycle of self-reflection in order to develop good character habits.  This cycle is comprised of a continuum of moral knowing/thoughts/thought, moral feeling/feelings/emotion, moral actions/actions/response.  Supplemental lessons/techniques common to character education programs include: leading by example, moral literature, storytelling, and cooperative learning to name a few.


Positive Action, a character education program which has been widely used in the state of California for over five years is an example of a program that has successfully incorporated a synergistic structure in its lesson format combined with a self-reflecting philosophy in efforts to build good character traits and behavior while maintaining, and in many cases improving academic standards.  In fact, âit was recognized as the only program in the nation to simultaneously improve academics and behavior in character educationâ (Allred, 2008, November, p. 27) by the U.S. Department of Education What Works Clearinghouse.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;âOnly a virtuous people are capable of freedom.  As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of a masterâ¦Nothing is of more importance for the public weal, than to form and train up youth in wisdom and virtue&quot; (Ryan &amp; Bohlin, 1999, p. 220). 
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




'''

== '''Conclusion''' ==
'''




Hidden curriculum, more specifically, character education has been revered by many as an essential educational element since the birth of our nation and the development of our nation's educational system. Despite mild criticism, character education has an abundance of benefits on an individual, communal and societal level having both immediate and long term pay outs.  Additionally, taking inventory of the moral issues associated with our nationâs teenage demographic couple with evidence that character education has the ability to simultaneously instill strong morals and values, creating good character and improve academic performance is proof positive that there is an ever present need for a curriculum that incorporates character education into traditional academic driven education.

'''The Effects of Standardized Testing on School Curriculum'''

Studies show that intensive supervision of instructors âplays a key role in promoting student achievementâ (Glanz, 23). &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




















'''I. Introduction'''
	
How do you know when a child has mastered a subject matter? Is it when the child can regurgitate the information on a test formulated by the teacher, or is it when the child can apply the knowledge learned to a broader test such as the SAT?  These are the questions that one must consider when determining the usefulness of standardized tests.  As the title suggests, standardized testing refers to the use of a standard test on a given subject matter that is dispensed and scored in a uniform manner. Whether it is the No Child Left Behind initiative at the federal level or the Virginia Standards of Learning at the state level, testing has become an important measure in establishing what students have learned in their school curriculum.  School curriculum plays a major part in what information a child will learn in the classroom.  When shaping school curriculum one must consider many aspects of learning such as the teacher, coursework, textbook, work sheets, lesson plans, and grading guide.  All of these factors come together as a means of teaching children new information.  A standardized test serves as a means of determining if this information has been successfully retained by the student.  The importance placed on these test determine how the results will be used.  For the purpose of this paper the focus will be on the effects that standardized testing has on school curriculum. 
	


'''II. Positive Influence of Standardized Testing on Curriculum'''
	
Supporters of standardized tests note that there are several positive aspects of testing students in a uniform manner.  Since school curriculum plays such an important role in a childâs learning, there has to be a way to hold the creators and facilitators of the curriculum accountable.  The idea of accountability establishes a sense of responsibility to those that participate in the learning process (Guifgoyle, 5).  This includes teachers, students, administrators, and the school system as a whole.  In theory if everyone effectively plays his or her part, then the desired outcome of learning will be achieved.  For example if the teacher draws up the lesson plan and teaches the information, the teacher gets supplies from the administration, and the students study the material, the  students should be able to pass any test on that subject matter.  If there is a breakdown at any of those levels then a standard test can determine the cause and hold those accountable. Studies show that intensive supervision of instructors âplays a key role in promoting student achievementâ (Glanz, 23).  Not only do standardized test hold educators accountable, they also provide data about student strengths and weaknesses.  Supporters of standardized tests argue that the tests help determine if students are âinternalizing the information presentedâ (Fisher, 1).  If it is determined by the tests that students are not learning the specified information then steps can be taken to rectify the situation. For example the United States Department of Education came to the conclusions that as a nation student in grades 3-8 were behind in mathematics and reading. To resolve the situation legislation was passed which stated that students in grades 3-8 must be tested every year to insure that they are learning the desired material (Guifgoyle, 4). Holes and Gaps on the curriculum can also be identified by standardized tests.  Testes offer an inexpensive way to âprovide a wealth of information that teacher can use to improve instructionâ (Guifgoyle, 5).  Standardized test also serve as a ârelatively inexpensive way provide visible resultsâ (Camacho, 4).   


'''III. Concerns of Standardized Testing'''
	
While Standardized test have many good qualities there are still those that oppose the idea of having standardized tests. One such argument centers on narrowing school curriculums to the test. Both educators and parents have raised the issued of âtest based teachingâ (American Federation of Teachers, 10). By focusing on only on what will be on the test students miss out on the opportunity to gain a broad body of knowledge.   Just because a certain subject matter is not on a test does not mean that that information is not important.  Research also suggests that narrowing the curriculum would eliminate challenging coursework.  By limiting challenging coursework, students will be ill prepared for the future.  Students need to learn more than information on a particular test.   Students need to focus on the concept knowledge so that it can be called upon later on in life. Not only do students need to understand the concepts learned in a classroom for a test (American Federation of Teachers, 10). They must be able to apply that knowledge.  Along with narrowing the curriculum, tests also cater to certain subjects.  When tests focus mainly on a few subjects, the test does not fully measure what a child has learned.  The arts are a good example of the kinds of courses that are ignored by standardized tests.  Standardized tests can also yield results that are not always accurate.  For example, after the first year of a standardized test, test scores seem to go up, giving impression that students are learning more.  The reality may be that teachers are âre aligning their lessons and curriculum to better match test objectivesâ (Camacho, 4). Not only do administrators and teachers feel the pressure of test taking, but students also feel a tremendous amount of pressure to perform.  With students being subject to numerous tests at the state and local levels, students may feel test fatigue. Standardized tests can also be disproportionately unfair to minorities.  There are many socio economic factors that effect test scores. For example, studies showed that there is a âdisparity in standardized mathematic test scores between Mexican-origin and White studentsâ (Morales, 350).  School districts that are in low income areas are at a disadvantage when it comes to preparing schools.  They may lack the resources to compete with other schools. 


'''IV. Standardized Testing effects on Preparation for College and Work'''
	
While standardized tests may have its strengths and weaknesses, but the question remains how will standardized tests help prepare students for life post secondary education.    In todayâs technology driven society we rely heavily on âquantitative proof that our public schools are meeting the expectations of the stakeholdersâ (Camacho, 3).   Instead of focusing on just one standardized test many schools are shifting their curriculum focus to college preparedness.  This is the case for the Poway Unified School District in California which has âadopted the goal of preparing all students for collegeâ (Camacho, 9).  While the school district continues to use standardized testing to measure the achievements of its students, the curriculum is not based on the standardized test.  The Poway district asserts that if the goal is to prepare students for college then the âinstructional program should be designed backwards from this goalâ (Camacho, 9).  Whether the intended path is college or entering the workforce, each school district must adopt a successful path for students to be âprepared to reach their intended goalâ (Camacho, 11). 


'''V. Conclusion''' 
	
In his article, &quot;Testing: The Good, The Bad, and It Could Get Ugly!&quot; Professor Ronald A. Berk discusses the pros and cons to standardized testing. Mr. Berk is a professor and Assistant Dean for Teaching in the school of Nursing at The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He points out that there are an equal amount of negative and positive aspects to the common standardized type of testing, to any testing really. However, as with many aspects of life, our education system will never be able to satisfy everyone. Some people will always see the bad in certain parts of education while others will be more willing to accept change. Mr. Berk shows his audience this exact theory. âIt is impossible to please everyone.â The fact is, standardized testing has shown its benefits, which seem to weigh out its complaints. In any case, the best interest of the students should be considered. Whether one supports or opposes the use of standardized tests the ultimate goal is to effectively educate students so that they become successful adults.  For good or for bad, test results generate media attention.  This media attention can in turn be used to shine a light on problems facing school curriculums.   While it is beneficial to point out these problems it is also important to solve them in an effective manner.  In an ideal situation tests would be used to promote the learning process instead of driving it.

National standards play a critical role in todayâs educational community. These standards shape what is taught to students, and more importantly, how teachers teach. National standards have a profound impact not just on the regular education classroom, but also the advanced programs including Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate.

=='''National Standards'''==
In education, there has always been a debate over what to teach our students. In addition, it is important to remember that how something is taught is as valuable as what is being taught. The top programs in todayâs American school system are the Advanced Placement program and the International Baccalaureate program. When creating national standards, these programs must be held in high regard. The brightest students along with the best teachers participate in these programs. National standards should be developed that can challenge not only students but teachers as well. 

=='''International Baccalaureate'''==

The International Baccalaureate Organization states that educational standards are a key part in the development of sound students and teachers (IBO.org). The IB student completes a rigorous program and is challenged on a daily basis. While the students work their way through the program they are forced to meet objectives. Within the IB program, students reach above and beyond what is typically expected of them. IB students must understand how the learning system is not compiled of separate parts, but is the sum of all parts together. National standards can unify students and objectives together as one. 


âThe International Baccalaureate Theory of Knowledge program provides students a complete view of educationâ (High Performance). Students have the chance to examine each area of education. Students begin to realize that while learning is different for each area, the basic methods used are the same. In this way students are pushed to understand how each content area interacts. Within each way of knowing is an intermittent part of the others. Each area in and of itself directly affects the others. Once students understand the standards they achieve a better understanding of their learning experience. These standards which can be transferred directly to the national system enhance the learning experience. In this portion of the program students begin to breakdown the walls that divide learning, and view the educational instrument as a whole. Through this portion of the International Baccalaureate program, students understand that each standard directly affects the others.

=='''Advanced Placement'''==
Advanced Placement program also provides students with an opportunity to challenge themselves at a higher level. In the Advanced Placement program students are given college level work, and upon completion, they are given the chance to receive college credit for their efforts. Since these advanced students are learning on a college level they are exposed to college-level material. Being that national standards must push the envelope in the world of education, it is pivotal for advanced placement to play a role in the creation of these standards. As students study in the AP program, they are constantly forced to look outside the box, and approach problems full circle.  This skill proves to be vital in the forming of any type of national standard. If they are allowed to only approach problems from the most obvious viewpoint they are denied the experience of seeing problems through. Also they do not gain the chance to observe these from different angles, and achieve solutions which shy away from the norm. More often than not educational problems canât be solved with the most obvious solution. By taking the Advanced Placement outlook students see problems in different way, and thus find more complete solutions.


Standards are a vital part of education. In every educational community standards can vary, and students are taught differently. This leads to varying educational levels across the country. In recognizing this problem, it is easily understood that national standards need to be established in order to form a more complete educational plan. With both the International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement programs, students are challenged to bring out their fullest potential. With this in mind, we can see that national standards should be shaped around these programs. Not all students are capable of performing in advanced programs, but all students should be challenged to their maximum potentials. When standards are made that require students to reach inside themselves, the ultimate result is students that are better than before. These standards create students who not only solve problems, but understand the issues surrounding the problems.


=='''Conclusion'''==
In the creation of national standards, teachers and students must understand that these advanced programs provide an excellent base to build an educational program. Students who are taught within these standards develop as complete packages in the worldâs eye. Teachers who teach with these standards not only better students, but better themselves. In teaching on a higher level, teachers inspire students and provide a much needed advancement in the national educational standard. Students pushed to be better themselves ultimately become people who push for a better tomorrow. In establishing a national standard largely influenced by advanced programs there can only be an improvement in education as a whole. With teachers and students constantly pushed to better themselves the entire nation will improve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''College Preparation vs. Vocational Education'''
'''By: Cassaundra Lewis'''

==I. Introduction==
Every year thousands of students graduate from high school and go on to college. Every year hundreds are not as successful. What can be done to assure that more high school students go on to college? What can we do to prepare students for life after high school?  The United States has been debating these questions not only on state levels, but national as well. In this article I will discuss some of the benefits, hindrances, advances, and the content of vocational education and college preparation courses.
==II. College Prep vs. Vocational Education==
First we should define college preparation and vocational education. College preparation is a course or series of courses that help students adjust to many college-level requirements. William Tierney writes, âImportant objectives of most programs are the smoothing of the transition from school to college, improvement of study habits, increase of general academic readiness, and expansion of academic optionsâ (Increasing Access to College, 2002, pg 3). Vocational education is a course or series of courses that give students work related experience to express the nature of careers and help them learn skills that will assist towards careers in the future. According to Unger, âthe basic purpose of vocational education is to get a jobâ (But What Ifâ¦, 2006, pg 33). âIn no other area has greater emphasis been placed upon the development of curricula that are relevant in terms of student and community needs and substantive outcomes.â (Curriculum Development, 1999, pg 3).

Did You Knowâ¦?

Did you knowâ¦

Education for work began 4,000 years ago? According to Finch, â(the) earliest type of vocational education took the form of apprenticeshipâ (Curriculum Development, 1999, pg 4).
|}

==III. Main Targets of College Prep and Vocational Education==
One of the main targets of college preparation courses are low-income students and minorities, who make up a very small percentage of students attending both two and four year colleges directly after high school (Preparing for College, 2005, pg 3). âEducational institutions, state and federal governments, and local communities have committed significant resources to the development of a wide array of outreach activities designed to identify and assist underrepresented students in their pathways to collegeâ (Preparing for College, 2005, pg 1). Vocational education targets those who are even less likely to attend college immediately after high school. âMillions of students all over the world are not suited for and have no interest in traditional academic schoolingâwhich is why alternative career education was developed: to teach students the skills they need to get a good jobâ (But What Ifâ¦, 2006, pg 4). Both college prep and vocational education attempt to enlighten students about career choices and assist them with the transition from high school into the adult world.
==IV. Positives and Negatives in College Preparation==
According to Anne Lewis, of the Education Digest, âmore students are taking upper-level math and science classes and more are enrolled in Advanced Placement classesâ (College Prep, 2004, paragraph 1). By this, she means that more students are enrolled in classes to help them prepare for college. She goes on to state, unfortunately, âthe likelihood of ninth-graders completing high school and enrolling in college by age 19 (â¦, having graduated from high school within four years and directly entered a higher education institution) has declinedâ(paragraph 2). Another major negative in college preparation is that the population targeted is not always the one assisted. Tierney writes, âPrograms such as MESA, Upward Bound, AVID, (etc.)â¦ are well intentioned, (but) minority students remain underrepresented on college campusesâ(Preparing for College, 2005, pg 1).

Did You Knowâ¦?

Did you knowâ¦

The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education grades each state, on a scale of A to F, on ability to effectively prepare students for college? Seven states received an âA,â Connecticut, Colorado, Massachusetts (who scored the highest), Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Utah. Louisiana and New Mexico were the only states to receive a âFâ(College Prep, 2004, paragraph 7).
|}

==V. Positives and Negatives in Vocational Education==
There are many benefits of vocational education. According to Unger, âEmployers generally respect the credentials of graduates from vo-tech schools, which usually have strong job placement services and close ties with employers. Vo-tech students emerge stronger in academics as well, because students learn English, math, science, and other subjects in conjunction with their vocational education and, therefore, find these areas more interestingâ(But What Ifâ¦?, 2006, pg 20). Two negatives associated with vocational education are that, âUnfortunately, there are only about 325 vo-tech schools across the United Statesâ and there is a rising inability to keep students interested (But What Ifâ¦?, 2006, pg 20).

Did You Knowâ¦?

Did you knowâ¦

âItâs easy to get into college, but not easy to finish and graduate? More than 40% of students who enroll in American colleges and universities quit without graduatingâ (But What Ifâ¦, 2006, pg 3).
|}

==VI. Curriculum Content==
What all is included in the curriculum for college preparation and vocational education? What factors help in considering whether or not a program should be added or subtracted? âCurriculum materials are resources that, if used properly, can assist an instructor in bringing about an intended desirable behavior change in individual studentsâ (Curriculum Development, 1999, pg 208). Unfortunately, there is no fool proof way of being able to tell what is going to help and what isnât. There are many things to take into consideration when choosing what programs to keep and eliminate (Increasing Access to College, 2002, pg 3). As far as college preparation is concerned, a lot of the learning occurs in advanced classes. Many different approaches are used, such as computer-based assessment and writing assessment. With vocational education, you must determine: What will the student want to study? What does the community need as far as work experience? What will motivate the students toward life after high school (Curriculum Development, 1999, pg 92)?
==VII. My Personal Experience with College Preparation and Vocational Education==
While I was in high school, I was fortunate enough to experience both college preparation and vocational education. In my opinion, college preparation did very much to help me familiarize myself with what college would actually be like. I attended all honors classes and college preparation meetings. During my time as a vocational education student, I had hands on job training and was able to get my license as a cosmetologist when I graduated from high school. Vocational education did just as much for me on an overall level as college preparation. I do understand that not everyone was as fortunate as I and may not have had the same type of support that I received. One contributing factor, that is very often overlooked, is the influence of home life on attending college directly after high school.
==VIII. Conclusion==
In conclusion, college preparation courses and vocational education courses are both designed to promote success in the community but use different avenues. College preparation is focused on getting students to college. Vocational education is focused on providing an alternative to a college education for those who might not be as interested capable. When used properly and effectively, these means of education can provide options after high school for all students.

==&lt;u&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/u&gt;==


This article is designed to help the reader form their own opinions on College prep or Vocational schools for students in secondary school preparing to further their education.  The definition of College prep as defined by Wikipedia is &quot; A university-preparatory school or college-preparatory school(usually abbreviated  to prep. school, or college prep school) is a secondary school usually private designed to prepare students for a college or university education.&quot;  For all intents and purposes of this article we are going to assume that these are U.S. High Schools and the real target is going to be their curriculum.  A vocational school is defined by wikipedia as follows, &quot;a school in which students are taught the skills needed to perform a particular job.&quot;  We will be exploring the advantages and disadvantages associated with both paths students take after graduation from high school.

''''' &lt;br&gt;

&quot; According to a recent report from Stanford University's Bridge Project, which included a surevey of nearly 2,000 students 88% of eigth graders expected to participate in some form of post secondary education. {MDRC 2008}


&lt;/div&gt;






=='''&lt;u&gt;Advantages to taking College Prep or A.P. courses.&lt;/u&gt;'''==

The biggest advantage to going the college prep route is to prepare the student for classes when he or she finally arrives at the college of their choice.  According to Karen Arenson of the New York Times, without the core curriculum recommmended for college prep, only fourteen percent of students are ready for college work in all four areas {Math, Science, English, Social Studies.} and thirty six percent were not ready for any.  This statistic shows the need for any student who is interested in persuing a college education to be enrolled in either A.P. {Advanced Placement} courses or the college prep curriculum.  Another big advantage to taking this path is that it saves the individual money in the long run especially if they take A.P. courses that are approved by the University or do dual enrollment.  Dual Enrollment &quot;allows the student to enroll in college courses and apply the credits to both high school and college graduation.&quot;{Quint pg.32}.  Dual enrollment gives the students a broader range of courses to choose from as well {Quint pg.32}.  Currently in the United States there are 2,900 colleges that give credit for high scores on A.P. tests and A.P. exams have grown from only eleven in 1950 to thirty-three by 2002{Erekson, Thomas. Shumway, Steven}.  


=='''&lt;u&gt;Advantages to Vocational or Technical Schools.&lt;/u&gt;'''==


Not all students want to pursue a four year degree from a college or university.  Sometimes these students enroll in a Vocational or Technical school to learn a trade.  However as stated by Eileen Knight, John Donahue and Patrick Knight &quot; Tech ed is beneficial for students who are preparing for college as well as those who are not{ACE TECH: The Fourth Year of CTE and Academic Integration.pg 22}.  Students who attend a vocational school are looking for specialized training that can be applied to a career when they graduate.  Students are able to make workforce connections through internships, job shadowing, and supervised trips{ACE TECH: The Fourth Year of CTE and Academic Integration.pg 22}.  These types of connections can be invaluable when students get out of school and are looking for jobs in the workforce. Some other skills that the students learn such as &quot;various ways of assesssing,  oral presentations, connections of subjects and understanding the importance of aligning skills they learn with what colleges and employers are requiring&quot;{ACE TECH: The Fourth Year of CTE and Academic Integration.pg 22} help to make the individual well rounded.

''' It is estimated that by 2014 eighty-seven percent of new jobs in high wage occupations will be filled by people with some post-secondary education. {U.S. Department of Labor 2006}

''' ''' &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




=='''&lt;u&gt;Disadvantages to College Prep or A.P. courses.&lt;/u&gt;'''==

Despite all the good that college prep and A.P. courses do there are some unfortunate drawbacks as well.  According to the MDRC students taking college prep and A.P. courses may need access to specialized and supplementary materials for courses including but not limited to sophisticated lab equipment.  Unfortunately in a lot of school systems this is not a viable option and it costs the district more money.  Karen Arenson of the New York times writes &quot; only one fourth of high school students who take a full set of college preparatory courses - four years of english and three years of mathmatics, science, and social studies are well prepared for college; according to a study of last years high school graduates released yesterday by ACT, the Iowa testing organization.&quot;  She later goes on to add that an additional nineteen percent were not prepared for courses at the college level.


=='''&lt;u&gt;Disadvantages to Vocational or Technical School.&lt;/u&gt;'''==

As with the college prep route there are drawbacks to Vocational or Technical school as well.  Jack Elliot writes that secondary CTE or Career Technical Education suffers from a negative stereotype among students, parents, teachers, and policy makers that CTE is ONLY for non-college bound students.  One of the reasons for this as Elliot points out is generally CTE students do not do as well on high pressure testing due to learning style and other characteristics.  Erickson and Shunway seem to be in agreement when they state that &quot;as long as {negative} perceptions exist, college bound students will be less likely to enroll in technology education classes&quot;(Technology Education as College Prep pg.13).  Elliot then moves on to state that &quot;tests define school priorities causing more focus on core subjects and cut backs on CTE and fine arts programs {Who is Smarter.pg 50}.  That being said CTE students may not have the same types of opportunities that college prep students may have.


==&lt;u&gt;'''Summary'''&lt;/u&gt;==

Hopefully reading this article has helped the reader form an opinion as to whether Vocational School or College Prep is the better road, maybe a mix of the two is the best combining  a little real world work experience with high level challenging course work.  In the authors opinion it doesn't matter which path the student takes, some are more interested in the mechanical nature of things while others are more interested in the theory, what really matters is continuing their education.  As long as they continue to learn and better themselves everyone wins.

by Angela Marcotte

==&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt; By reading this article, future educators should be able to==

*distinguish between benefits and downfalls of standardized testing

*know how standardized tests are utilized

*determine who is being held accountable by standardized testing

==&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt; Introduction==

Testing students has been around since the time of Socrates. For instance, in order to better guide a student in his or her learning, the teacher would ask students questions to measure what has been absorbed from his teachings. Since the first World War, standardized tests have been used to &quot;sort, track and stratify individuals and groups... for employment, higher education and the professions.&quot; (Scherer, 2005). More recently, as an admission requirement for colleges and universities, the SAT and ACT standardized tests are claimed to be useful tools in determining college readiness (Giuliano, 2006, 80).

Within the past decade, state and national governments have made annual administration of standardized testing mandatory. The original goal of standardized testing was to help administrators and government officials determine if progress was being made in the education of our youth.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==The View of the Supporters ==

Some believe there are pros to standardized testing. Because many standardized tests consist of true-false or multiple choice questions, the scoring can be done expediently and rather inexpensively. Many of the exams given to students today are scored by computers rather than by people (K12 Academics). Scantron sheets are fed into a machine and read, grading papers in a reasonable time period. Computers can grade multiple tests with minimal errors. It would likely take a teacher longer to grade exams by hand, with an opportunity for errors and bias. Rather than measuring the students' mastery of the subject, a teacher may take into account his or her personal feelings of the student when grading an essay or free writing. Another example would be human error. If the person grading the exam is distracted, he or she may mark something incorrectly.

Many supporters believe standardized assessments are the best way to guarantee high principles of learning and accountability. It is believed that the tests convey what is expected of students and education professionals. Exams measure levels of progress and where it is being made. The reasoning behind accountability is that educators should be making progress and the improvements should be apparent in the results of the studentsâ exams(Giuliano, 2006).

==The View of the Opposition ==

Opponents to standardized testing feel that a single test is not an accurate assessment of performance. Some argue that because of the pressure put on accountability testing, children are denied access to a more challenging, diverse curriculum. Others believe that rather than using a more sophisticated thought process, which may call for more of an explanation, students are given test questions that are based on rote memorization. While this form of testing will evaluate knowledge, it does not evaluate how and why the students came to their conclusion.(Popham, 2004). 

According to Alfie Kohn, author of ''The Case Against Standardized Testing'', the content and format of instruction are affected by standardized testing in that what is tested becomes the focus or curriculum for the school year. Furthermore, Kohn explains that many people feel that standardized testing has caused a âdumbingâ down on the American education system (Kohn, 2000, p29).

Due to the pressure put on teachers for their students to succeed, many educators do not spend time on curriculum that is not going to be covered on the standardized tests. A teacher may instead fixate on the test rather than focusing on the meaningful learning of the tested material. If the students do poorly on the exams, it affects the amount of school funding provided by the government, in addition to affecting the employment of many qualified teachers. (Popham, 2004, p.167-168)

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6A287E&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;If instruction focuses on the test, students have few opportunities to display the attributes of higher-order thinking such as analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and creativity, which are needed for success in school, college and life.&quot; (Neill, 2006).&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6A287E&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;While state accountability tests are important, they do not give a full picture of student learning... there are usually some important educational goals that aren't easily assessed in a large-scale, standardized way&quot; (Jay McTighe, in an interview by Judith Richardson, 2009).&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==In Summary==

There are many conflicting views regarding the validity and necessity of standardized testing. While there is a serious need to measure the progress and capabilities of a school, its teachers, and its students, there are more opportunities available than one year-end test. 

==Author's Comments==

As a parent and future educator, I have mixed feelings regarding standardized assessments. I believe that all schools, teachers, and students must be evaluated to ensure that proper instruction and an understanding of material is being put forth. However, I feel that one test should not be the final judgment. I am more concerned with the importance placed on a single group of tests than I am with standardized testing in general. There are many options for evaluation and many different factors that affect the way students test.

&lt;center&gt; &lt;font color=#CC33FF&gt; 
'''&lt;big&gt;Objectives:&lt;/big&gt;''' &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;  &lt;font color=#CC33FF&gt; '''&lt;big&gt;Letâs Figure Out What Weâre Dealing With First: &lt;/big&gt;''' &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
 
  
&lt;font color=#009933&gt;In an age where results matter and statistics rule, we have the educational system at the center, building and emphasizing the role of these results on how schools are run. Ever since the beginning of universities in the Middle Ages, learning was an end unto itself. There was no standard, just a desire. But in the 21st century where learning isnât just a social standard but a governmental requirement, certain standards are needed in order to govern how well these specific schools are doing on achieving this goal. Thus, standardized tests were born.

Now, these tests shape the teaching of almost every subject, not just English and math, and itâs beginning to reach even into how we apply for college, who gets the most money for schooling, and how a subject is taught. Colleges look at these tests to accept studentsâ applications, considering their SAT or ACT scores. As well, schools look at these to see if a student should pass the class and move onto another grade. Teachers use these to improve their students learning for the next year, and the students use them to determine success of understanding the basic material. 

These tests affect a lot of the curriculum of the schools in the US, and especially Virginia, as well as a number of other states with their own specific tests. âA standardized test is any examination that's administered and scored in a predetermined, standard mannerâ (Popham 1999). For instance, in the SOLâs, the student is assessed on whether they retained the content related to the subjects stated that they need to learn in the Standards of Learning. The VA Department of Education states that âthe Standards of Learning for Virginia Public Schools describe the commonwealth's expectations for student learning and achievement in grades K-12 in English, mathematics, science, history/social science, technology, the fine arts, foreign language, health and physical education, and driver educationâ (Standards of Learning Currently in Effect 2007).  
&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;center&gt; &lt;font color=#CC33FF&gt;  '''&lt;big&gt;The Advocate's View:&lt;/big&gt;''' &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
 
  
&lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''''Uniformity of knowledge:''''' 
The content of all standardized tests are precisely as they suggest: standard. SATâs, SOLâs and the like are used to measure the amount of standard knowledge a child has retained or can retain in the future.  Therefore by including these tests, the state and federal governments are ensuring that a local school district and their teachers teach a wide variety of information that they deem necessary to know. The VA Department Of Education site states on SOLâs, âThese standards represent a broad consensus of what parents, classroom teachers, school administrators, academics, and business and community leaders believe schools should teach and students should learnâ (Standards of Learning Currently in Effect 2007).  The government can be assured that all children in the range of these tests are learning the same things, regardless of socioeconomic status or whether itâs an urban or rural school. As well, they are assured that itâs a broad education regulated by the government, but not made by the government. 
  
'''''A teacherâs methods are refined:''''' 
When the students get their results back, so do the teachers. Most states have a minimum pass rate on these specific tests for school accreditation, including VA. This means that the results of the tests are important to both the school (with all its members) and the parents, who may choose to make an out-of-district transfer for a child given that their school is non-accredited. To improve scores, these results are posted, and therefore the teacher is shown where their students fall in accordance to their peers across the school, district, and usually state. We, as teachers, can use these results to know where we need to improve the teaching of our students, especially for the next year. It also shows the schools where to improve, as well as able to inform where and which students need more assistance (Herman and Golan, 1990). &lt;/font&gt;


&lt;center&gt;  &lt;font color=#CC33FF&gt; '''&lt;big&gt;The Critics View:&lt;/big&gt;''' &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''''Teaching to the test:''''' 
The bulk of critics of standardized testing believe that it forces teachers to teach to the test, therefore losing a teacher's creative license to teach their own way. These critics also state that children are inadequately prepared for the real world, as most students are made to memorize the minimum to pass the test (Fairtest, 2007). Usually it can be said that this kind of teaching focuses on the bottom level of Benjamin Bloomâs Cognitive Taxonomy theory: knowledge. Although in some instances, itâs also focused on comprehension, especially in English and often in math and science. 

This effect on the cuuriculum is showcased in Virginia high schools mostly during the month of April, where most core classes (History, Science, Math and 11th grade English) are using review booklets, games, essays and practice exams to review the information taught throughout the year so the student can have the information fresh in their minds for the exam. This often results in a loss of overall information being able to be taught in most levels, as the end of the semester is the only part left to cover the last chapters of the book, due to the placement of the test. The student is often limited on modern topics to discuss in subjects such as history and science. Generally, the instruction can either be limited, or become busywork after these tests are done. &lt;/font&gt;




&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=#CC33FF&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;An Individual Standard:&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 
  
&lt;font color=#009933&gt;As Marion Brady states, âThe short answer is that for many people, the main purpose of educating isn't to improve students' thinking skills but to âcover the materialâ in math, science, language arts, social studies, and other school subjects. Covering the material is, of course, importantâ¦ Covering the material makes good sense, then, in terms of contributing to social stability and transmitting useful, important insights. The problem lies in assuming that these are the main purposes of educationâ (Brady 2008). In many rural areas and urban areas, there are many different opportunities that children can experience in learning, such as farms, museums, etc., that standardized education does not specify learning about. For example, in a city such as Norfolk, field trips are able to be taken to a local beach to learn about the SOL that states: 
âStandard BIO.9 b, c - The student will investigate and understand dynamic equilibria within populations, communities, and ecosystems. Key concepts include b) nutrient cycling and energy flow through ecosystems; and c) succession patterns in ecosystems.â (VA Board of Education, 2003)

In this, the child can learn firsthand the animalâs ecosystem and food web, and construct it themselves. This will teach them not only knowledge, but critical thinking, application, and a number of other key skills needed other than just the absorption of knowledge. 

The key to this concept of an individual standard is to take the already existing concepts presented in the SOLâs and apply them to real life application in and outside of the classroom, so that not only can a child retain the information needed for the necessary test, but to also enjoy learning and develop their mental skills. &lt;/font&gt;


&lt;center&gt; &lt;font color=#CC33FF&gt; '''&lt;big&gt;My perspective:&lt;/big&gt;'''  &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
 

&lt;font color=#009933&gt;When I began this paper, I admit I was quite bias. I did not like standardized testing at all. I felt it took away from the teaching time at the end of the year, and that my creative efforts in my future classroom would be diminished. But as I thought of the actual reasons behind my reasoning, I realized that these reasons could be reconciled even in my own classroom by my teaching methods. I plan to take this into the class as a reality and use the tests to access knowledge and comprehension, but luckily due to my subject area (English), I will only have one year of students that are taking the test. I want to take the world into my class, and use practical teaching tools to help my students. Hopefully I will get the chance to use this new viewpoint to add a positive attitude to the testing reality. &lt;/font&gt;

Our comprehension of our vast universe grows each day.  With every new discovery and information gathered from researchers across the globe, we continue to come closer and closer to our understanding of the universe we live in.  Not long ago, we believed that the world was flat; however, today we have access to real time pictures taken from satellites orbiting our world to prove its true form.  What we teach our children today may be far advanced from what we learned as children ourselves.  New discoveries may lead to future generations treating the knowledge of today as obsolete and outdated.  

Perhaps equally as important to what we teach our students is also how we teach them to learn the material.  As we grow in our understanding of how the human brain operates, we must also use this understanding to help us learn more efficiently.  One of the more widely accepted methods of learning that is being applied in today's classroom is that of cooperative learning.  This method differs in many ways to that of traditional lecture methods of learning.  In this article, we will explore the many ways to effectively apply cooperative learning, the advantages, and the possible challenges of this method.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;What Is Cooperative Learning?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

 [[Image:Funny_Kids1.jpg|150px|left]]

The traditional classroom often consists of classes in which children of similar ability levels are taught together.  Nearly all classrooms in the United States are taught by grade level specific to the age of the student rather than his or her ability.  Many schools also group students according to their apparent ability levels, but this risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for each respective group.  By placing students into group in this way, we run the risk of those placed in low-level learning groups perceiving themselves as unintelligent or slow-witted. Grouping students together with varying levels of ability and backgrounds can help eliminate this threat.  A very popular method of learning in this way is called cooperative learning.  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;27%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC99FF;

'''Cooperative learning''' is the collaboration on a task by a small group of students who resolve differences of opinion, share responsibility, consider one another's ideas, and work toward common goals. (Berk, 2008)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''Cooperative learning''' is defined as &quot;the collaboration on a task by a small group of students who resolve differences of opinion, share responsibility, consider one another's ideas, and work toward common goals.&quot; (Berk, 2008) Unlike traditional methods, cooperative learning lets students enhance the weaknesses of their peers with their own strengths.  Students feel a part of a team rather than isolated and students deemed as having low-ability can benefit from those considered higher.  In a symbiotic relation, higher level students also tend to do better by teaching the learned material to their peers.

According to Robert E. Slavin of Johns Hopkins University, there are four major perspectives on cooperative learning, which are motivational, social cohesion, cognitive development, and cognitive elaboration (Slavin, 1995).  The '''motivational perspective''' focuses on the reward for the group in achieving their objective, and that the only way for the group to achieve this goal is to learn how to work together.  The theory that students want each other to succeed is more in keeping with the '''social cohesion perspective''', but is similar to the motivational perspective in that the members of the group are motivated to succeed, but instead of goal oriented, it is more motivated by compassion.  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;35%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC99FF;
border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Four major perspectives on cooperative learning:'''
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;u&gt;motivational&lt;/u&gt; - group focused on common goal   
 
&lt;u&gt;social cohesion&lt;/u&gt; - group wants each other to succeed   
 
&lt;u&gt;cognitive development&lt;/u&gt; - the human brain simply learns
better in a group environment    

&lt;u&gt;cognitive elaboration&lt;/u&gt; - the best way to 

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The '''cognitive development''' perspective takes a very different approach to cooperative learning in that it contends that the interaction of students with their peers stimulates the mind and increases the ability to learn.  Unlike being motivated by a common goal or by compassion for their peers, those who follow the cognitive development perspective feel that the human brain simply learns better in a group environment than on its own.  

A variation of this is the fourth theory of '''cognitive elaboration''', which contends that the best way to enhance the knowledge already present in the brain is to in turn explain it to ones peers.  This slightly differs from cognitive development perspective in that the members of the group must already have some knowledge of the material before entering the group.


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;What are some Cooperative Learning examples?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

For almost a quarter of a century, Dr. Spenser Kagan has been developing teaching structures of learning based on cooperative learning, called Kagan Structures, to help in the classroom as well the business world.  (Kagan, 2008)  

[[image:Scotty_n_CeCe1.jpg|right|150px]]

One of Kagan's most widely used method of cooperative learning is that of '''RoundRobin''', purposely spelled as one word to differentiate the term from the standard definition of round robins, a type of athletic tourneyment.  In a RoundRobin group, each learner takes a turn orally presenting the material that they have learned, helping them to better organize their thoughts on the material.  Kagan says that labeling methods of cooperative learning like RoundRobin are beneficial to the student because &quot;students know exactly what to do&quot; when instructed to use a specified method.  According to Kagan, this is also helpful to instructors in that it helps facilitate communication among peers in learning from each other how to teach.  

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;35%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC99FF;
border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Examples of Cooperative Learning:'''
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;u&gt;RoundRobin (Kagan)&lt;/u&gt; - the group takes turns orally presenting the material.   
 
&lt;u&gt;Jigsaw (Aronson)&lt;/u&gt; - learners are split up into groups, assigned portions of 
the material to learn, meet with learners from other groups assigned the same
portion, and then return to their groups to teach the material they have learned.

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Another method that is fast becoming a popular form of cooperative classroom learning is that of the '''Jigsaw''' method.  Elliot Aronson, Professor Emeritus at the University of California in Santa Cruz, first implemented his Jigsaw method in 1971 initially as a way to deal with the sudden desegregation of schools in Austin, Texas.  By placing students into groups with various social and ethnic differences each with the same goal to succeed, the hostility became muted as the students were forced to work together to achieve success.  

The Jigsaw method gets its name because each student is a vital piece of the overall puzzle that is the learning task.  Students are first divided into groups and assigned various portions of the material to become an expert on. Then, each student meets with students from other group assigned to the same portion of the material and discuss what they have learned.  This allows for the student to share what he or she learned on their own while also hearing other students perspectives.  Eventually, these students return to their original groups and in turn teaches the members of their group the material that they learned.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Advantages and Possible Challenges of Cooperative Learning&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

As mentioned earlier, there are many advantages to cooperative learning supported by empirical evidence.  Students who participate in cooperative learning programs have outperformed students in traditional learning programs at the elementary, secondary, and collage levels, as cited in Boling and Robinson's article on how cooperative learning is used in lecture-based distance learning. According to the journal article, students have been shown to increase social skills, perceptions of their own ability, and the relevance of the material they are learning (Boling 1999).  

Although cooperative learning can be highly effective, there are also some possible challenges in this style.  One of the major criticisms of cooperative learning is that it tends to hold back the learning potential of those students who are naturally gifted.  Oftentimes, students who are prone to social anxiety and prefer to work alone may suffer a negative effect of cooperative learning.  Instructors must understand that cooperative learning is not for everyone and must compliment or supplement some material to students who thrive in a less socially active environment. 

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Conclusion&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

In conclusion, cooperative learning is a very different style of learning than how traditional school systems have taught student.  There are a number of theories behind why this method tends to be effective; however, there are still a number of unknown variables out there that make cooperative learning hardly the absolute best way to present material.  Still, learning methods like Kagan's RoundRobin and Aronson's Jigsaw techniques have proven to be very helpful and have empirical evidence that supports the increase in participants learning ability.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Andy&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Answers to the Quiz!!!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

Ok, let's see how we did.....

'''1)''' -  A) According to Berk, the definition of cooperative learning is &quot;collaboration on a task by a small group of students who resolve differences of opinion, share responsibility, consider one another's ideas, and work toward common goals.&quot; (Berk 470)

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Students should be able to: 

1. Define and identify the components of cooperative learning.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt; ==


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF6699;
border: solid 10px #009966; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=right&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;SEGOE PRINT&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;Group members must work together as a team to accomplish a common goal&quot;(Jigsaw Classroom)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

For many years, teachers have placed students into groups to complete tasks and assignments.  We all remember that dreaded feeling of having to work with the labeled class slacker or with someone we didn't know.  Once the groups were formed, everyone had a role that was connected to produce a final product.  Without each other, our small portions would have been meaningless.  Whether we realize it or not, our teachers were using cooperative learning to help us flourish academically and socially .  Some experts believe that cooperative learning encourages students to learn while fostering a sense of community.  When students are put into groups, they often have to work with classmates that they are not familiar with.  When teachers form student groups, students have the opportunity to share their skills and knowledge.  Cooperative learning has emerged as a widely used teaching practice that is used by many classroom teachers.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''What Is Cooperative Learning?'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Cooperative learning is more than putting students into small groups, because it gives students the opportunity to learn from each other.  According to the Jigsaw Classroom, &quot;group members must work together as a team to accomplish a common goal&quot;(Jigsaw Classroom).  Cooperative learning is much more than group or center time, it is a time for students to share in the learning process.  Cooperative learning helps students thrive in social and academic setting.  &quot;Unlike typical  classroom instruction, during which students tend to have only casual and  rather superficial contact, cooperative learning processes have students working together to achieve a common goal. This produces more meaningful  interactions between the students and a sense of positive interdependence.  As these work groups change over time, the students collaborate with a  variety of students in the class, leading to better peer relations in the class  and an increase in students' friendships&quot;(Stevens &amp; Slavin).   Cooperative learning consists of the following components:  face to face promotive interaction, positive interdependence, individual accountability/personal responsibility, interpersonal and collaborative skills, and reflection/group processing of interaction(A Guide to Cooperative Learning).  

1.  Face to face promotive interaction forces students to talk openly with each other about their topic.  &quot;Cooperative teams help students learn to value individual differences and promote more elaborate thinking&quot;(A Guide to Cooperative Learning).

2.  Positive interdependence allows students to depend on each other.  &quot;Students must feel that they need each other in order to complete the group's task, that is, they sink or swim together&quot;(A Guide to Cooperative Learning).  

3.  The individual accountability/personal responsibility portion ensures that each member of the group is responsible for their portion of an assignment.  &quot;Ways to build in individual accountability include: students take individual quizzes; each student is responsible for a specific portion of a task; each must be able to summarize another's ideas; any student may be called on at random to answer for the team&quot;(A Guide to Cooperative Learning).

4.  Interpersonal and collaborative skills are &quot;skills for working together effectively (staying on task, summarizing, recording ideas) as well as group maintenance skills (encouraging each other). Ways to foster skill development include teacher modeling, brainstorming characteristics of &quot;good&quot; skills, direct practice, process observing, and reflection&quot;(A Guide to Cooperative Learning).

5.  Reflection/group processing of interaction gives group members time to think about how well they worked together.  &quot;Processing means giving students the time and procedures to analyze how well their groups are functioning and how well they are using the necessary collaborative skills. Processing can be individual, team-wide, or at the whole collaborative class level&quot;(A Guide to Cooperative Learning).

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''What Does Cooperative Learning Look Like?'''&lt;/font&gt; ==
Cooperative learning requires participation from both the teacher and student groups. &quot;Cooperative Learning (CL)provides an alternative to competitive or individualistic classroom activities by encouraging collaboration among students in small groups.  The use of CL alters the structure of classroom activities and roles: the class organization changes to a multigroup structure, the teacher's role as an information transmitter is reduced, and the student's role shifts toward that of group participant and decision maker&quot;(Emmer &amp; Gewels).  Students may participate in three types of cooperative learning groups:  formal, informal, and cooperative based.  

1.  A formal cooperative learning group varies in the amount of time spent on a project.  &quot;Groups range in length from one class period to several weeks. The teacher can structure any academic assignment or course requirement for formal cooperative learning&quot;(Johnson, Johnson and Holubec).

2.  An informal cooperative learning group does not last as long as a formal cooperative learning group.  &quot;The teacher uses them during direct teaching (lectures, demonstrations) to focus student attention on the material to be learned, set a mood conducive to learning, help set expectations about material, what the lesson will cover, ensure that students are cognitively processing the material being taught, and provide closure to an instructional session&quot;(Johnson, Johnson and Holubec).

3.  A cooperative based group outlasts the duration of both formal and informal groups.  These groups are &quot;long-term (lasting for at least a year), heterogeneous groups with stable membership whose primary purpose is for members to give each other the support, help, encouragement, and assistance each needs to progress academically. Base groups provide students with long-term, committed relationships&quot;(Johnson, Johnson, &amp; Holubec).

== &lt;font color=&quot;#00CC66&quot; face=&quot;&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

More and more teachers should incorporate cooperative learning into their teaching practices.  Cooperative learning concepts have proven to work in the classroom.  Cooperative learning really allows students to take more from the learning experience.  It really allows students of various strengths to accomplish a common goal.  Students are able to build friendships and learn from their peers.  Cooperative learning prepares students for the future and promotes teamwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''High Expectations for All Students'''

by Kathleen Crossin


==Introduction==
Most of us are guilty of forming opinions of people based on our first impressions.  What happens when a teacher forms an opinion of a student based on first impressions, cognitive abilities, economic status, ethnicity, gender, or perceived achievement level?  Are the teacher's expectations of the student likely to have an effect on student performance?

==Pygmalion Effect and Self-Fulfilling Prophecy==
Researchers Rosenthal and Jacobson published a study of the effects of teacher expectations.  The Pygmalion effect, also known as the &quot;teacher expectancy effect&quot; (&quot;Pygmalion effect,&quot; 2008, para.1) explains that students will meet the expectations they feel the teacher has for them.  If the student feels that the teacher expects them to do well, they will meet those expectations.  Conversely, if a teacher has low expectations for a student, the teacher's behavior toward that student will ensure that the expectation was accurate (Tauber, 1998, para. 5).  The Pygmalion effect is closely associated with the self-fulfilling prophecy (&quot;Self-fulfilling prophecy, 2008).  Robert Merton is credited with this term (Tauber, 1998).  He explained the five points involved:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The teacher forms expectations.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Based upon these expectations, the teacher acts in a different manner.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The teacher's treatment tells each student (loud and clear) what behavior and what achievement the teacher expects.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;If this treatment is consistent, it will tend to shape the student's behavior and achievement.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;With time, the student's behavior and achievement will conform more and more closely to that expected of him or her.&quot;(Tauber, 1998, para. 8)

==How Perceptive are Children to a Teacher's Expectations?==

According to research studies (Rubie-Davies, 2006, para. 3), students are very attuned to the differences in which teachers teach and interact with students according to the teacher's expectations (Rubie-Davies, 2006).  In a study (Rubie-Davies, 2006) fourth graders were asked how they knew if the teacher labeled them as smart.  The students were able to discern this information from the type of instruction the teacher used, the teacher's style of assessment, and the teacher's use of non-verbal actions (Rubie-Davies, 2006, para. 3).  A further research experiment (Rubie-Davies, 2006, para. 3) illustrated that fourth graders were able to merely watch a teacher's non-verbal cues and determine if the teacher was speaking to high or low expectation students (Rubie-Davies, 2006, para. 4).  As we can see from these studies, children are very conscious of a teacher's expectations.

==Is it Possible to Have High Expectations for all Students?==

===Students with Cognitive Disabilities===

So crucial is the need for high expectations that there are two laws that deal with ensuring high expectations for all children (Quenemoen &amp; Thurlow, 2007).  No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) both &quot;require that all children count in school accountability measures so high expectations will result in high achievement for every child&quot; (Quenemoen &amp; Thurlow, 2007, para. 4).  In a national survey (McGrew &amp; Evans, 2003, para. 13), 84% of teachers questioned did not believe that children with special needs should be required to achieve the same goals as other students (McGrew &amp; Evans, 2003, para. 13).  These low expectations are communicated to students by the labels they receive in school.  Labeling puts an emphasis on the student's shortcomings (McGrew &amp; Evans, 2003, para. 50).  While it may not be possible to meet the same standards as other children, a teacher with high expectations for students with cognitive disabilities can help establish an environment that is not conducive to further inhibiting a student's achievements (McGrew &amp; Evans, 2003, para. 88).

===Income and Racial Diversity===

Do teachers have low expectations of students from low-income families?  Do minority students face bias due to stereotypes?  Alfinio Flores (2007) studied this topic in reference to the differences in math scores between low-income minority students and White students (Flores, 2007, para. 1).  Flores (2007) states that the percentage of White teachers is 88%, while the minority students make up 33% of the student population (Flores, 2007, para. 15).  Flores feels that many factors account for the differences in test scores.  Teachers, who have low expectations of these minority students and as a result do not teach students more advanced math, are one of the problems (Flores, 2007, para. 16).  Research (Flores, 2007) has shown that the achievement gap in poor and minority students is due to a lack of opportunity, not a lack of intelligence (Flores, 2007, para. 40).   He concludes that âthere is nothing intrinsic to the studentsâ backgrounds or cultures that would prevent them from achievementâ (Flores, 2007, para. 28).   Researcher, Richard Elmore, a researcher who studies schools with racial diversity and high poverty levels, found that schools that were successful, were schools in which teachers and administrators had high expectations for students (Elmore, 2006, para. 4).  In a study (Brown &amp; Medway, 2007) of a school (with 10 years of unsatisfactory student progress) with a high percentage of low-income students, 70% population of African-American students, and 34% of students in special education classes, a plan that focused on high expectations brought about national awards for their subsequent accomplishments(Brown &amp; Medway, 2007, para. 9).

===Gender===

Are male and female students afforded the same opportunities for academic achievement?  Society has clearly shown us that we expect different behaviors from males and females (Lindley &amp; Keithley, 1991, para. 1).  In the classroom, males benefit from high expectations and are encouraged to achieve their goals. Conversely, females are encouraged to be model students (Lindley &amp; Keithley, 1991, para. 7, 8).  Evidence of this bias is shown by males out-scoring females on college entrance standardized tests (Lindley &amp; Keithley, 1991, para. 9).  In an effort to address this inequality, the GESA (Gender/Ethnic/Racial Expectations and Student Achievement) Program was developed (Lindley &amp; Keithley, 1991, para. 1).  Results from this program showed an increase in classroom opportunities for females, increases in math and reading scores, and the teachers felt that the program was beneficial in raising their cognizance of the issues addressed (Lindley &amp; Keithley, 1991, para. 20).

===&quot;Average&quot; Students===

Does the &quot;average&quot; student get left out?  So much attention is paid to special needs students, but what about the average student (Gonder, 1993, para. 1)?  A variety of methods have been successfully used to engage these students (Gonder, 1993, para. 3).  One of the methods involves increasing expectations by changing the curriculum focus from basic recall to a curriculum focused on analysis and concepts. (Gonder, 1993, para. 13).  This curriculum change lets the student know that you expect more from them and you feel them capable of succeeding (Gonder, 1993, para. 13).  Another way some high schools are delivering the message of high expectations is through personalized  attention (Gonder, 1993, para. 11).  In these schools, once a semester &quot;the adviser, student, and parent meet to discusss the student's educational goals and develop a plan to meet them&quot; (Gonder, 1993, para. 11).

===Gifted Students===

Underachieving gifted students sounds like an oxymoron, when compared to the stereotypical views of gifted children (Kolb &amp; Jussim, 1994, para. 18).  For many teachers, the label of &quot;gifted&quot; means that the student is motivated to excel(Kolb &amp; Jussim, 1994, para. 18).  For some students, the lack of challenging work, causes them to behave poorly in class causing the teacher to lower their expectations of that student (Kolb &amp; Jussim, 1994, para. 20).  Some gifted children rise to the challenge of changing the teacher's new perception, but others may &quot;fall victim to self-fulfilling prophecies&quot; (Kolb &amp; Jussim, 1994, para. 21).  To prevent this cycle of low expectations leading to a negative self-fulfilling prophecy, teachers need to be aware of the ways in which gifted students react to boredom in the classroom (Kolb &amp; Jussim, 1994, para. 28).  If teachers realize these reactions for what they are, they will not lower their expectations (Kolb &amp; Jussim, 1994, para. 21).

==Do All Students Fall Victim to Low Expectations?==

As a parent, I feel strongly that all teachers should hold high expectations for their students.  I know that my children look up to their teachers and are influenced by what happens in the classroom.  I cannot imagine a better feeling than someone telling you that you are full of potential and ability.  As we have seen from various research experiments, teachers can convey these thoughts merely in the manner in which they teach.  I also feel that it is my responsibility as a parent to help my child develop a strong sense of self efficacy.  As we go through life, we are going to be faced with people who do not have high expectations of us. Should we fall victim to the self-fulfilling prophecy each time we meet someone who does not hold us in high regard?  Fortunately, not everyone is susceptible to the expectancy effects (EE).  Kolb &amp; Jussim (1994) state that &quot;it is important to realize that some vulnerable or 'at risk' students, nevertheless, are more resilient than others and seem impervious to the deleterious impact of negative EE&quot; (Kolb &amp; Jussim, 1994, para. 43).

==Conclusion==

While not all students are negatively impacted by low expectations, research (Mavi &amp; Sharpe, 2000) clearly shows that students benefit from high expectations (Mavi &amp; Sharpe, 2000, para. 15).  We are all individuals with our own unique abilities.  I will never be an impressive artist, but I can make progress to the best of my ability.  Authors Hasan and Sharpe (2000) sum it up nicely, &quot;Clearly defining success in terms of individual progress is one means to avoiding inappropriately placed standards; standards which may act to drive low expectancies placed on some students&quot; (Hasan &amp; Sharpe, 2000, para. 15).  Having high expectations for all students does not mean that we expect all students to accomplish the same goals.  We expect students to reach their own potential.  Teachers can help students obtain their goals by maintaining high expectations for all.

This reference includes all of the information give in Kathleenâs article, but one topic that should be explained is teacher efficacy. It is important for teachers to have expectations for their own performance as well as the expectations of the students. One of the difficulties that teachers run into is the number of goals they want to accomplish with such little time that they have. To overcome that issue, teachers simplify their efforts on the goals that they feel is the most important. This issue leads to important differences in the studentâs achievement. This topic contributes to Kathleenâs article because it is important to know that teacherâs expectations also rely on the expectations of their students and their performance in the classroom. âIntellectual and professional potential of teachers has been drastically underestimated by the education community as a result of the same mindset that has caused teachers to underestimate the intellectual potential of their studentsâ (Hilliard, A. (1991). Do we have the will to educate all children?, Educational Leadership, 49(1), 31-36).

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; '''&lt;big&gt;Introduction&lt;/big&gt;'''==
&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Teachers inevitably have expectations of all students.  Whether it is based on age, Socioeconomic status (SES) or past occurrences either personal experienced or read from their records, teachers are only human and therefore have certain expectations and impressions of students (Gazin).  It is up to educators to overcome the natural judgment calls and expect that all students are capable of learning and all students deserve to receive that same high expectations, regardless of race, age, SES, or anything else.  Students who are not expected to do well are less likely to achieve than those who are expected to do well. In order to improve academic achievement for all students, educators must begin to expect the same from each and every student.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt; '''Learning Targets'''&lt;/big&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; 1. Understand the difference between Golem and Galatea effects and how they are applied to students

&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; 2. Understand the different prejudices students face and how those prejudices affect each student

&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; 3. Discover ways to ehance classroom climate and help students reach their fullest academic potential

== &lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt;'''Self-fulfilling Prophecy'''&lt;/big&gt;==
The self-fulfilling prophecy is the underlying factor in student achievement.  Basically, what this describes is how teachers help or hinder the outcomes of student achievement. Prejudices that are held by teachers about students essentially lead to their own fulfillment.  Self-fulfilling prophecies change student performance in one way or another.  By sustaining a particular belief, the student's performance will not change at all. There are two major effects involved in the self-fulfilling prophecy--the Golem effect and the Galatea effect.  These two effects describe how prejudices effect student performance  (Rubie-Davies, et al.).
===&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Golem Effects===
&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; The Golem effect is what occurs when negative beliefs are held about a student.  These beliefs lead to undesirable and negative consequences in regards to the student's performance in school.  Low teacher expectations lead to low student achievement (Rubie-Davies, et al.).  This means that teachers that expect students to perform poorly due to behavioral observations, school record indications, SES, or any other prejudice will essentially lead that student to perform poorly.  The student will not try to do well in class because the teacher doesn't expect him to.  Research by Alvidrez and Weinstein show that these negative effects have a lasting impression on children.  Predictions about student cognitive ability have a predictive relationship with school achievement as long as 14 years later.  Teacher judgements are strongest among students that are given negative perceptions about cognitive ability (Alvidrez and Weinstein).  Students that are viewed as having lower cognitive ability by their teachers tend to perform at lower levels than those who are not viewed this way.

=== &lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; Galatea Effects===
&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;  Galatea Effects are just the opposite.  When teachers expect great things from students, those students will produce great things.  This effect creates desirable and positive effects from the student because the teacher approached that student with a positive attitude and high expectations (Rubie-Davies, et al.).  Students that are believed to be smart, polite, come from a well-to-do family, or any other prejudice that enhances their first impressions, will perform at higher levels than those who are not believed to be in these categories because the teacher expects them to do so.  When teachers have positive predispositions about students they transfer positive energy to that student, causing them to try hard and to perform well because that is what is expected of them. Studies have shown that students that are viewed as being more tidy, independent and intelligent are given higher expectations.  Teacher judgements regarding student cognitive ability are generally consistent with test performance (Alvidrez and Weinstein).  This research gives way to much more insight of how positive perceptions about students help these students achieve higher marks in school.

One good teacher in a lifetime may sometimes change a delinquent into a solid citizen.
--Philip Wylie

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt; Prejudices &lt;/big&gt;==
&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; As human beings, educators naturally have first impressions, judgments, and prejudices about students in their classrooms.  These natural thoughts are what lead to the self-fulfilling prophecies.  There are many different ways to judge students.  Many are unconscious acts that teachers do not even realize have occurred.  By learning about and understanding the ways in which expectations are being placed on students, educators can overcome these prejudices and help foster high achievements from all students.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; Ethnicity===
&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; Ethnicity has an interesting relationship with student expectations.  More so than socioeconomic status, ethnicity has been found to hold strong ties in relation to what teachers expect from students. Although a study done by Entwisle and Alexander showed that first-year African-American students came into school with higher standardized test results than white students, by the end of the school year, their grades were much lower (Rubie-Davies, et al.).  This is a prime example of how teacher expectations effect student achievement.  Even though the African-American students were found to have higher scores when entering school, the lack of positive influence lead to lower grades.  Another study performed by Wigfield, Galper, Denton, and Seefeldt also resulted in white students receiving higher marks in school than minority students. The academic achievement of white students was much higher than that of minority students.  Teachers also reported that the ability of minority students to make friends and do well working with them was much lower than that of white students (Rubie-Davies, et al.).

&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; These two studies show the effects that biased opinions based on ethnicity can have on children.  Although the African-American students did well on their test in the beginning of the year, those same tests resulted in lower scores due to the lack of high teacher expectations.  The white students who did receive positive expectations throughout the school year showed positive interaction with their learning.

===&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Socioeconomic Status===
Socioeconomic status may also play a role.  Middle to upper class students are perceived to perform higher in the classroom than lower class students.   Research shows that high-opinion teachers teaching in lower-class schools yielded higher achieving students than did low-opinion teachers (Fleming and Anttonen). Another study also shows that SES plays a significant role in student achievement.  When testing the correlation between teacher judgment and the ability of 4 year olds, those children from high SES homes were rated more positively and those from lower SES homes were rated more negatively (Alvidrez and Weinstein).

===&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Many Other Reasons===
&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;  There are many reasons teachers form opinions about students.  Maybe a student is expected to do well because their older sibling did well.  It is likely that biases are formed based on what is noted in the child's permanent record or what was observed the first day of class (Arganbright).  Although it has not been found to have a direct relation to academic achievement, gender may play a role (Alvidrez and Weinstein).  It is not uncommon to hear biases that boys are better at some things and girls are better at others.  The self-fulfilling prophecy provides that these beliefs essential lead to those consequences. Research shows that in some instances, teachers give higher grades to students they believe can perform better than others, and lower grades to those who are perceived to do more poorly.  Those believed to perform better are believed to do so because they are viewed as being more independent, tidy, clean, and neat (Alvidrez and Weinstein).  There are an infinite number of reasons a child is perceived as likely to do well or not so well.  No matter the situation, educators have the responsibility of overcoming these initial judgments and helping each child reach their highest potential.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt; How Can Educators Beat Prejudices and the Golem Effect? &lt;/big&gt;==


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFCCFF;

&quot;Effective schools have a common belief that all students can learn...&quot; (Arganbright)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;








&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; First impressions have a lasting effect.  With that said, it is also important that second, third, and fourth impressions do not get left unnoticed.  Despite what educators may initially feel about a student, it is their responsibility to ensure the child the best possible education.  That means helping them reach their fullest potential regardless of any prejudices that may be in mind.  Brophy and Good conducted a study in 1987 which showed that lower SES students tended to receive less or insincere feedback and did not get called upon in class compared to higher SES students (Gazin).  Labeling or grouping students may also cause lower academic achievement.

There are many ways to beat the Golem effect and achieve the Galatea effect.  This should be a main goal of all educators because it is in direct relation to high student achievement.

     -Make an effort to call on a variety of students.
     -Provide less criticism and more positive feedback to students.
     -Don't allow first impressions to make a lasting effect (i.e. &quot;Jessica never does her homework.  She is a troublemaker.&quot;)
     -Get to know every individual student.  This will make them feel special and will enhance the classroom climate.
     -Another way to enhance the classroom climate is to smile and be friendly.
     -Expect the class to work hard.  There are no shortcuts.  Expecting great things of students will yield great results.

&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Heighten Your Expectations: 5 Tips for Teachers 

    1. Don't group students by ability, but divide the class into groups with complementary talents.
    2. Clarify expectations throughout the year by asking each student to evaluate how well he or she is meeting them.
    3. Give students specific and appropriate praise when they achieve a goal. For example, &quot;Emily, I am so impressed by how you provided so many details in your paragraph.&quot;
    4. Share stories from your own life in order to inspire the kids. For example, &quot;I almost failed Algebra until...&quot;
    5. Keep in mind personal details about your students, such as their favorite books.

&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Many students fall victim to the self-fulfilling prophecy but many do not.  There are an infinite number of ways and reasons this occurs, for better or for worse.  Some students may contribute to the self-fulfilling prophecy by allowing teachers' negative predespositions to hinder their academic achievement.  Others will benefit from the predespostions because teachers may expect them to do well, therefore they do.  Educators should strive to eliminate the negative and reinforce the positive.  At the same time, teachers should also eliminate giving positive assessments of students based on prejudice perceptions, such as SES, independence, or cleanliness.  Every child is an individual with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Good educators will determine these strengths and weaknesses and work through them, providing children with the best possible education for that individual.  Not everyone can achieve the same goals.  The purpose of teaching is to help students reach their own highest potential so they may become successful in whatever their future may hold.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;big&gt;Review Questions&lt;/big&gt;==

&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;1.  Johnny is a first grade student living in a single parent home with low income.  His teacher believes that he is a troublemaker and gives him low grades on his report card.  This is an example of:

       A. Self-fulfilling Prophecy
       B. Galatea Effect
       C. Golem Effect
       D. All of the above

&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;2. All of the following are examples of good ways to overcome the Golem Effect except:

       A. Get to know every individual student's name and personal preferences.
       B. Decide what kind of student you think they are on the first day of class.
       C. Change the classroom climate by telling stories, giving feedback, and smiling.
       D. Set high classroom expectations from day one.

&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot; face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;3. Students that achieve high scores because their teacher had high expectations of them is called:

      A. Galatea Effect
      B. Pygmalion Effect
      C. Golem Effect
      D. self-fulfilling prophecy

“Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; feed him for a lifetime.” The founder of Taoism, Lao Tzu, spoke these words over 2000 years ago. (Smith, xi) Education is similar to this principle. For centuries students were “fed” information and taught to memorize facts, in the hope they would retain a portion of what was taught. Today it isn’t enough just to feed information to students. Our world is changing so fast that new information becomes available faster than it can be taught. If a nation wants to keep pace with this ever-changing world, then learning can’t stop at graduation. Students as well as teachers must learn “how to fish” for knowledge by becoming life long learners. Teachers can become life-long learners by realizing and acknowledging that life long-learning is a necessity; by learning to keep up with changes through personal and professional development; and by teaching with passion, inspiring young minds to see learning as something wonderful.

=== Life-long Learning is a Necessity ===

The last century has brought about an explosion of inventions, new technologies and new information about our world and universe. Teachers have had to keep up with all the new information and knowledge. What would it be like if they hadn’t?
Picture a classroom somewhere in America. The teacher has been teaching for many years; she might be in her 50’s. That means she started teaching during the 1970s. Think back about 30 years. What were American schools like then? What kind of things would you have found in her first classroom? Classrooms in those days had chalkboards and pull-down maps. Some schools had TVs, film-and overhead projectors that were shared between classes and could be rolled into the room. Calculators existed but were generally not used in the classroom. Now imagine for a minute what it would be like if this teacher had not adapted to change. What would it be like if she had buried herself in her classroom, not furthered her learning, not embraced all the new technologies, events and discoveries? If she had not been a life-long learner, what would she have missed? What would she not have learned, embraced, and passed on to students? Think of the things that have happened in the past 35 years. She would have missed, among other things, the hostage crisis in the late 70’s, Presidents coming and going, this country at war more than once, the attack of 9/11. She would not have seen the Soviet Union collapse, would not have heard of Aids or global warming. She would not have known much, if anything, about DNA. She wouldn’t know how to use a personal computer, the internet or cell phones. 
It is easy to see that if we stand still the world will pass us by. We live in a global society that is changing at breathtaking speed. We need to adapt and change. Life-long learning is a necessity for everyone.

=== Personal and Professional Development ===

In order to keep up with our changing environment and to stay informed, teachers make a conscious effort to continue learning. They will take part in professional training through the school district or through classes taken at universities. Most teachers read books and professional journals to keep up with the newest information about child development. They read magazines, newspapers, watch the news and surf the internet to keep up with changes that happen around the world. Teachers attend workshops to keep up with technology, the newest teaching strategies, and classroom management techniques. They are eager to take in new information about our world and look for ways to improve their teaching practices in the classroom. 
Another way a teacher can improve and move forward is to learn more about him or herself.  In the book &lt;u&gt;Those Who can, Teach&lt;/u&gt; by Ryan Cooper, a teacher is likened to a sculptor who “begins with a vision of what he or she wants to be and then sets to work transforming the vision into a reality… The process requires an understanding of … self … it takes long hours of chipping away and then smoothing the surfaces… To be a teacher, particularly a teacher who is continuously moving forward, is a lifelong commitment …” (Cooper, 473)  A sculptor needs time, patience and the ability to see beyond what is easily visible on the surface to create his work of art. A teacher uses those same qualities, just like a sculptor, to patiently reflect and look deep within him- or herself to see where changes could be made. At the end of a day it is helpful for a teacher to think deeply about the events of that day, to analyze him- or herself and therefore better understand and react to situations in the future. It is good to take time to remember happy events, a chance to feel content about good things that may have happened.  Reflection can help a person to learn and adjust to his or her environment.
As previously discussed, teachers have to become life-long learners and have to adjust to keep up with our ever-changing world through personal and professional development. They are however, not the only ones who need to keep pace with new information and technology. One of the reasons it is so important for teachers to stay informed, is so they can pass this new knowledge and information on to students. 

=== Teaching with Passion ===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;If we can have “students see our passions – it gives them proof that we enjoy learning.” (Thomas, 2007)&lt;/big&gt;
|}

Children have a sense of wonder when they are young. “Keeping the joy in learning should be a priority of every school and every teacher.” (Warner, 2006)If children can keep their sense of excitement about the world, they will love to learn and that original excitement and love of learning will most likely stay with them for life. To help keep the excitement alive, teachers aim to inspire young minds. They want their students to see how much fun learning can be. In the article “A Return to Community: Inquiry in Action” Ann H. MacKenzie wrote: “Life-long learning implies a buy-in curiosity about life... an insatiable desire to be alive in ‘the now, the future,’ and immersed in the teeming life surrounding us every moment.” (Thomas, 2007) If we can have “students see our passions – it gives them proof that we enjoy learning.” (Thomas, 2007) It is wonderful to see the sparks when students understand a concept and take off excited with their new-found knowledge. “We must model that inquisitiveness in the classrooms. Our students must see us involved in our own life-long learning… Watch us passionately immerse ourselves in our own curiosities.” (MacKenzie)

“We must model that inquisitiveness in the classrooms. Our students must see us involved in our own life-long learning… Watch us passionately immerse ourselves in our own curiosities.” (MacKenzie)
|}

When teachers model excitement about learning, students will see learning as something positive to be imitated. In turn they will hopefully become life-long learners themselves. Rafe Esquinth wrote an inspiring book entitled &lt;u&gt;Teach Like Your Hair’s on Fire&lt;/u&gt;.  He teaches in a “rough” Los Angeles neighborhood and found a way to inspire his students to learn, imagine, and eventually succeed in school. Esquinth relates a story about a day that didn’t start out well. In the course of that day he became so involved in teaching that unbeknownst to him, his hair caught on fire during an experiment. He was so involved in teaching, he didn’t even notice. That day he realized that the key to teaching was to become absorbed and excited about learning. He was determined from then on to make his goal to “teach like his hair is on fire”. (Esquinth, xii)  If we can convey to students excitement about a subject, about learning, and about life we will teach as if our “hair is on fire”. That kind of excitement will inspire children to become life-long learners.

=== Conclusion ===

As individuals and as citizens of a global economy we have to keep pace with our world. We must continue to learn and then pass our knowledge and love of learning on to the next generation. We have to inspire the next generation to find joy in continuous learning so that, even after leaving school, students will be prepared for this ever-changing world, ready to embrace a world filled with new, exciting things, ready to investigate and ready to keep learning, never giving up on their quest for knowledge. A fish is only one meal… we want to teach students to be excited about learning, excited about fishing for information; we want to give them the tools to become life-long fishermen for knowledge.

=== My Thoughts About Life-long Learning ===
by Christa Portlock

Investigating life-long learning and what it means made me think about what it means to me as a student and as a prospective future teacher. 
To me the world has always been a very interesting, exciting, and beautiful place to investigate and to learn about. I can’t imagine what my life would be like without that wonder and appreciation about learning new things. Life is so much more stimulating, rich and pleasurable when we engage our minds, use our imagination and fill our hearts with the beauty that surrounds us. I would love to pass that excitement on to someone else. It would be exciting to spark the imagination of children and watch them find the same joy that I have always felt when learning something new. 
I know I have much to learn to be able to know how to best pass on knowledge, as well as excitement about learning. I am on a learning quest right now. I want to learn how to become that teacher who can create those sparks that light up a child’s eyes and light his or her path through life with inquisitiveness and excitement. 
I will spend the next few years in school learning all I can. I have spent much time in classrooms in the past, but from this time on I will be spending time in the classroom watching with different eyes. I will have chances to observe experienced teachers. I will spend time reading about teachers that were able to make sparks and even small miracles happen, like Helen Keller. I know, however, that this is just the beginning of my journey. Most of my learning about teaching will come through the time spent in the classroom. I want to venture and say that many of my most profound lessons will be taught to me by my future students without them even knowing they’ve been teaching me. I am looking forward to those lessons and am excited about what is to come. 
As a teacher I will continue to learn. I will take advantage of the training opportunities offered to me and learn individually as well. I hope I will have the opportunity to work with a mentor, learning through observation. I am excited about all the new things to learn and embrace. 
Life-long learning goes beyond the time spent at school; it goes beyond the classroom and beyond the teaching years. Life-long learning is an adventurous journey through life. Keeping the mind active has enormous health benefits, physically, mentally and spiritually. Life-long learning has the ability to shape, influence, and determine the future.
It has the ability to influence mankind’s achievements, technologies, and ultimately our destination through individuals who never stand still and make life-long learning their quest that fuels their investigations. Who knows what sparks will fly when the imagination soars in our future classrooms? I am determined to find out!

*identify the importance of life long learning,

*identify and locate opportunities offered in life long learning.

Get over the idea that only children should spend their time in study.  Be a student so long as you still have something to learn, and this will mean all your life.  ~Henry L. Doherty. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Attending a seminar, taking a night class, and passing a test are all ways that people easily identify as lifelong learning. Lifelong learning is more than just attending organized seminars and classes, it's taking opportunities to enrich life and increase knowledge daily. The definitions of lifelong learning vary a bit depending upon who is asked to define it.

In ''Philosophical Perspectives on Lifelong Learning,'' lifelong learning is described as a slippery word being compared to terms such as 'democracy' and 'religion' and having no true way to quantify it. Overall the idea agreed upon is continual education starting directly after being slapped by a doctor and continuing until six feet under, with a strong focus on the times after leaving the structured school environment. (Aspin, 2007) 

'Lifelong learning is a continuous engagement in acquiring and applying knowledge and skills in the context of authentic, self-directed problems.' (Fischer, 1996)

Life long learning is something that educators and students may achieve alike. Life long learning is a way for teachers to enrich their lives and their classrooms.  By planting the seeds of a love of learning, teachers are able to encourage students to continue searching for knowledge through their lives.



== &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;3366FF&quot;&gt;I&lt;/font&gt;mpacts and &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;3366FF&quot;&gt;I&lt;/font&gt;mportance ==

&lt;Font Color=&quot;3366FF&quot;&gt;Importance&lt;/Font&gt;

Teaching today is a constantly changing and increasingly more important role in students' lives. An article in &lt;u&gt;Science Daily&lt;/u&gt;, looking at new science teachers explains how more and more teachers are being placed into classrooms feeling overwhelmed and undertrained. A suggestion that is made is to pair new teachers with retired teachers to help further their learning and mentor them in the classroom (GMU, 2008).  Having a mentor helping the teacher is a way to continue that instructor's education while active in the classroom environment.  The mentor helps the new teacher teach by sharing their experiences and it will show in how the students learn.

The traditional teaching of books, chalk and blackboards are still present in the education; however, there are many new things that are now involved in the classroom environment.

'A global economy hungry for customized, portable and on-demand educational platforms coupled with the Internetâs rise to dominance as the ubiquitous medium of information delivery means that e-learning is increasingly gaining respect as an innovative and viable pedagogical tool, especially for subjects that require multimedia, collaboration tools (wikis, blogs and course-management systems, for example), and other bandwidth-hungry applications prevalent today'(University of Illonois, 2008).

Knapper also touched on that topic of how many of the developed nations are using technology to learn and share information. Going so far as to suggest that if students are unable to navigate the technology they will be incapable of continuing their education in the real world. A large part of today's work force requires using the newer technology.(Knapper, Cropley, 2000) 

&lt;Font Color=&quot;3366FF&quot;&gt;Impact&lt;/Font&gt;

Teachers continuing their education can have an impact on students' education as they learn to use technology in the classrooms and learn more on the subject that will be reflected in how students learn to face the new education age and continue their learning.  It is impossible for a teacher who does not know how to use technology to teach it. ''Science Daily'' pointed out that with today's decreasing economy and more accessible e-learning many of the businesses today are using internet classes. (ICWE, 2009)  Face to Face teaching uses a lot of time and money as well as limiting a class size, where as a broadcasted e-class can reach hundreds of employees with no need to pay travel or boarding costs, while being viewed on the students schedule. In today's internet phase of daily needs for new information in some fields students need to be better prepared to surf the net, find credible sources and use technology.  Just the students need to learn so do the educators to help facilitate.

Flipping through the pages of a dusty old book, feeling the corse pages turn in your hands is still a valuable way to learn.  Technology is not the only way to continue to learn through out life and by instilling a love of reading into students when they are not surfing the internet for ideas they can be curled up with a good book that might teach them a thing or two not only about facts and figures but also about social and culture factors in the world around them. By promoting reading of books instead of passages with questions after them students will be more apt to continue to read later in life, reading is an adventure and after you've taken a few it draws you back for more.

== &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;FF9999&quot;&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;oday's Opportunities ==
[[Image:zoopic.JPG|300px|left]]

In today's day and age there are countless possibilities to further learning. There are structured classes offered at almost every university, as well as seminars and conventions.  Almost any subject possible to think about you can find a place on the internet to take a class on or listen to a speech on in a hundred different languages. Type &quot;lifelong learning&quot; into google and you get over a thousand pages most of them places of higher education. There are also thousands of physical and online libraries that almost anyone can access for free or next to nothing.  There are also a highly overlooked daily ways to learn.  Local, state, and national parks, zoos and museums are all ways to find more information most fairly inexpensive but full of information.  There are cooking exposes, college plays, high school concerts everywhere there are opportunities for further learning one only needs to look and search.  Teachers have a responsibility not only to learn for themselves to better their teaching but also to help foster and teach their students so they too can continue to learn through life. It's important to remember as well that many of the newer students will be better educated on computers and there is no shame in using students as a resource as well.

*The picture above is of a hippopotamus. I'd never seen one in real life before last week when I visited the National Zoo, somewhere I've been many times in my life, but those things are huge.  I know the stats and I've seen the nature shows but to be not ten feet away from the thing it just awed and amazed me and now I really know and can explain something I've known for years that a hippo really could crush my little Accord with ease. Visiting the zoo is just one way of practicing lifelong learning with out having to attend a class.




Below is a box with just a few websites that are examples of ways to further learning.

&lt;Font Color=&quot;660099&quot;&gt;The proverbial soap box&lt;/Font&gt;

Almost every student has encountered ''that class'' where he or she has no idea why he or she are spending his or her precious time learning about rocket science calculus, when he or she wants to be a rock star singer.  Likewise almost every teacher has had that student who asked 'Why?', where the teacher could up with no answer, besides 'I had to endure the same kinds of classes during my education'.  Mine was history, and I spent most of my early years excelling in history but never understanding why it should mean anything to me. I had absolutely no idea why dead people should be important.  They are now dead and gone how can they impact me?  I had a teacher in middle school who didn't make us memorize the dates of when things happened as long as we could put them in order and locate them in the right century.  It boggled my mind that she was less concerned about the numbers and more concerned about us learning why history was important and how it can affect our lives. I'm a naturally curious kid but if I don't see a need in the subject than it's hard to be curious about it.  Her vast knowledge and love of the discipline pored into her teaching and then into us.  I developed a love in learning about history, seeing how a choice of one or a few people can affect everyone underneath them. 

I am a firm believer that a vast majority of knowledge and wisdom we hold comes from living life, exploring our world and asking WHY a lot, and to the right people.

*Life long learning is continuing to learn after the cap has been thrown and the yearbooks go dusty.  It encompasses taking classes, reading books and in general living life. 

*Life long learning is important to educators to help better teach their subjects, for students as continuing education is required in almost any career, and for both to be able to navigate in the java script world of today.  Life long learning can impact how teachers teach and students learn.

*Life long learning opportunities are all around us and by simple use of the internet it is possible to find almost any subject, genre, or idea and where and how to learn more about it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:AlbanianLanguage}}

The Albanian language is called Shqip in Albanian (pronounced shqip). There are two main dialects: Gegë and Toskë, that are also divided in sub dialects. Toskë is spoken in most of Albania except for the northern part, in which Gegë is spoken, as well as by Albanians living in Kosova (Kosovo) and Macedonia. The two dialects are mostly mutually intelligible. This tutorial will cover the unified version of the language called Standard Albanian, taught in Albania after WWII (which was also taught in Yugoslavia from about 1960 onward). Standard Albanian uses aspects of both Gegë and Toskë and is understood by speakers of any dialect. From 1974 nearly all written texts in Albanian are in Standard.

It's also important to note that Albanian is '''NOT similar''' to any other language except the infusion of words from neighboring countries' languages: Turkish from the time of the Ottoman Empire, English, Italian, etc. The grammar, word formation and sentence structure are '''unique.''' 
Albanian is an Indo-European language that is self-standing, without connection to any other branch such as Latin-based, Slavic, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Natural Neural Networks ==

The primary difference between a natural neural network and a Distributed Processing analog of a Neural Network, is the attempt to capture the function of a real neuron and real natural arrangements of neurons in the model. From the Hebbian model used in early perceptrons to modern neural models that attempt to capture the biochemical threads that implement different forms of memory within the same cell, The idea has all along been to find a reasonable model for the neuron, and learn from implementations of that model knowledge of how natural neural systems might work. It has been a long hard road, and while neural networks have gained and lost prominence in A.I., Neuro-scientists have been forced to go back to the Neural Network model, time and time again, as the most ethical approach to learning about natural networks of neurons.

Unlike other forms of Neuroscience, Neural models do not kill animals, in order to get their neurons, they do not torture animals in order to see how they will react, they do not even involve real animals, instead they torture recyclable electrons by making them flow through computer circuits. Something that can't even be seen, and since electrons are not thought to be alive, there is no ethical reason for concern, except perhaps for the use of electricity, but modelling is not a severe use of electrical amperage, since computers are so efficient. In short there is very little ethically wrong with torturing electrons.

The problem has then become What are the best models for:

# Neurons
# Networks
# Learning Algorithms

=== Neuron Models ===

Neuron models can be classified in a number of ways:

For instance some neuron models have binary outputs, only a few have integer outputs, and most have floating point outputs. Some neurons have what is called spiking neural outputs. Some have linear outputs with regards to their inputs, and some have non-linear or dynamic outputs.

Another instance is the formula for the calculation of output, some have a  simple integration of synapses, some have a second order calculation, and some have no synapses at all. Then there is the range function, which maps the input values to the output, which can be several shapes, depending on the type of neuron being modeled, and so on.

There are many different additional complications, such as habitutation, different types of synapses that can affect the way the cell operates, beyond the vanilla inhibitory and excitory synapses. Then there is the question of whether the dendrite complexity will be absorbed into the neuron model, or externalized into the network model.

=== Network Models ===

Then there is the question of whether the learning algorithm is part of the neuron model, or part of the network model. It doesn't make sense to have a back propagation network, if the learning algorithm is internal to the neuron.

Network models include:

Feedforward models where each layer feeds the next in succession
Feedback models where at least a portion of the succeeding layers output gets fed back into the previous layer
Recurrent models, where even the same neuron can feed back into itself

Back Propagation where an &quot;Error&quot; signal is fed back from the succeeding layer to &quot;Train&quot; the previous layer.

Hidden Layer Models, were conceived of as a sop to Marvin Minsky, as a way of expanding the dynamics of a neural network without redesigning the model. Essentially they capture the complexity of the dendritic mass, in &quot;Hidden Layers&quot; since a branching of a dendrite is mathematically the same as a soma, except for the output conditioning, and threshold to firing.

At first networks were static in design, but over time it became necessary to model networks that could grow new connections and prune existing connections to get rid of the excess.

=== Learning Algorithms ===

The original Learning rule, was based on the idea that synapses got stronger the more they were used, and weakened gradually when they weren't.

A variation on this Learning rule was the Delta rule, which increased the rate of learning and responded to an &quot;error&quot; signal that had to be back propagated in multi-layer networks. Because of its tendency to overlearn, Delta rule networks were only able to learn in supervised mode.

The latest cellular Learning rule, is the two rule system, that involves a pre-synaptic rule, and a Post-synaptic rule that operate from within the neuron itself. Because it doesn't require back propagation, it can be balanced not to need to overlearn and can therefore be used in unsupervised learning.

To add to this rule however we must take into account the fact that new models of neural systems, incorporate learning threads that operate in parallel and implement short term, long term and perhaps even medium term memories. Since some models of cellular long-term memory require physical connections, modeling the growth of these connections becomes part of the model.

=== Neural Groups, and Groups of Neurons ===

Neurons never come alone. In fact small networks of neurons connect to larger networks of neurons, forming a network throughout the whole body, with centers that process specific types of information in a number of centers of the body. One of these centers is the brain, which connects literally billions of neurons together into a very complex network that we are only now beginning to be able to even think of modeling.

If we are going to deal with a system of the complexity of the brain we need new neural network models that can capture the variety in the structure of neurons, can explain the functions of Groups of different types of neurons, and explain why some similar neurons act as if they were a single solid group, where only one or two neurons fire for the whole group.

Neural Networks that model Natural Networks of Neurons, are coming back into vogue, if only because, our understanding of Neuroscience is expanding due to new tools that bring us closer than ever towards understanding what the neurons are doing. As we work towards understanding the brain it becomes possible to imagine that we could build a conscious machine sometime within the next 20 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to have your browser read Twitter updates using a text-to-speech conversion extension that is built into your browser.

== Method ==
XHTML + Voice is supported by the Opera Browser with the Voice extension installed.  In this simple application it is used as a browser-based Text-to-Speech engine.

= Twitter Radio =

This script creates a simple text-to-speech version of Twitter Search.  

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Twitter/twitterRadio.xq?search=Obama&amp;n=6 Obama]

== Limitations ==

* Window has to be active for the T2S to play on refresh
* The cleaned text to speak is held in a div which is rendered as white on white text. Initially it was output as a block in the header but it did not seen possible to apply styles. Applying a style display:none hid the text from the T2S engine as well!
* Transforming the atom content to a a string suitable to speak needs more work.
* Retweets and similar tweets could be removed using levenstein 
* Male and female voices are assigned randomly by tweet. I'd like to cache the voice assigned to a tweeter so that tweets are consistently spoken in the same voice
* The initial load doesn't seem to trigger playing, hence the play button, but this also re-fetches the page.
* This is an ideal situation to use AJAX instead of refresh
* The T2S engine is quite good at rendering the text but it needs be helped in places, for example by replacing texting abbreviations with their expanded form.

      <comment>/* Charles' Law */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Boyles Law animated.gif|thumb|right|300px|An animation showing the relationship between pressure and volume when mass and temperature are held constant.]]
[[Image:Charles and Gay-Lussac's Law animated.gif|right|300px|thumb|An animation demonstrating the relationship between volume and temperature.]]
Real-world gases can be modelled as ideal gases. An ideal gas consists of lots of point particles moving at random, colliding with each other elastically. There are four simple laws which apply to an ideal gas which you need to know about:

==Boyle's Law==
Boyle's Law states that the pressure of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its volume, assuming that the mass and temperature of the gas remain constant. If I compress an ideal gas into half the space, the pressure on the outsides of the container will double. So:

&lt;math&gt;p \propto \frac{1}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

==Charles' Law==
Charles' Law states that the volume of an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature:

&lt;math&gt;V \propto T&lt;/math&gt;

T must be measured in kelvin, where a rise of 1°K is equal to a rise 1°C, and 0°C = 273°K. If we double the temperature of a gas, the particles move around twice as much, and so the volume also doubles.

==Amount Law==
This law states that the pressure of an ideal gas is proportional to the amount of gas. If we have twice the number of gas particles N, then twice the pressure is exerted on the container they are in:

&lt;math&gt;p \propto N&lt;/math&gt;

A mole is a number of particles. 1 mole = 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles. So, the pressure of a gas is also proportional to the number of moles of gas present n:

&lt;math&gt;p \propto n&lt;/math&gt;

==Pressure Law==
The pressure law states that the pressure of an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature. A gas at twice the temperature (in °K) exerts twice the pressure on the sides of a container which it is in:

&lt;math&gt;p \propto T&lt;/math&gt;

These laws can be put together into larger formulae linking p, V, T and N.

==Questions==

1. I heat some argon from 250K to 300K. If the pressure of the gas at 250K is 0.1 MPa, what is its pressure after heating?

2. The argon is in a 0.5m long cylindrical tank with radius 10cm. What volume does it occupy?

3. The argon is then squeezed with a piston so that in only occupies 0.4m of the tank's length. What is its new pressure?

4. What is its new temperature?

5. 25% of the argon is sucked out. What is its pressure now?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. I heat some argon from 250°K to 300°K. If the pressure of the gas at 250°K is 0.1 MPa, what is its pressure after heating?'''

The temperature has increased by 20%, so the pressure will also increase by 20% (using the pressure law). So, the new pressure is 0.1 MPa x 1.2 = 0.12 MPa.

'''2. The argon is in a 0.5m long cylindrical tank with radius 10cm. What volume does it occupy?'''

&lt;math&gt;V = \pi r^2 l = \pi \times 0.1^2 \times 0.5 = 0.016\mbox{ m}^3&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. The argon is then squeezed with a piston so that in only occupies 0.4m of the tank's length. What is its new pressure?'''

The volume occupied decreases by 20%, which is equivalent to multiplying by 0.8. So, by Boyle's Law, the pressure is multiplied by the reciprocal of 0.8 - 1.25. So, the pressure increases by 25% to 0.15 MPa.

'''4. What is its new temperature?'''

If we combine Charles' Law with the pressure law, we find that:

&lt;math&gt;T \propto pV&lt;/math&gt;

Volume is multiplied by 0.8, but pressure is multiplied by 1.25, so there is no change in temperature - it remains at 300°K.

'''5. 25% of the argon is sucked out. What is its pressure now?'''

Using the amount law, if N decreases by 25%, the pressure must also decrease by 25% to 0.1125 MPa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pair Production==
Sometimes, a photon turns into a particle and its antiparticle, for example, an electron and a positron. It could not turn into just an electron, since this would leave the lepton number unbalanced. The photon must have enough energy to create the masses of the two particles. The energy required to create one of the particles is given by:

&lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where m is the mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, two particles must be created. Since the two particles are each other's antiparticle, they have identical masses. So, the total energy required is:

&lt;math&gt;E = 2mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Annihilation==
When a particle meets its antiparticle, the two annihilate each other to form 2 photons (due to conservation of momentum) with sum total energy equivalent to the total mass-energy of both particles.

Sometimes, a pair of particles annihilates, but then the photon produces another pair of particles. Also, a photon could produce a pair of particles which then annihilate each other.

==Questions==

h = 6.63 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; Js

1. The mass of an electron is 9.11 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt; kg. What is the minimum amount of energy a photon must have to create an electron?

2. A 1.1 MeV electron annihilates with a 1.1 MeV positron. What is the total energy of the photon produced?

3. What is its frequency?

4. What is its wavelength?

5. A newly produced electron-positron pair are likely to annihilate almost immediately. Under what circumstances can this be avoided?

      <text xml:space="preserve">h = 6.63 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; Js

'''1. The mass of an electron is 9.11 x 10-31 kg. What is the minimum amount of energy a photon must have to create an electron?'''

&lt;math&gt;E = 2mc^2 = 2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 1.64 \times 10^{-13}\mbox{ J} = 1.02\mbox{ MeV}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A 1.1 MeV electron annihilates with a 1.1 MeV positron. What is the total energy of the photon produced?'''

2.2 MeV = 3.52 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt; J

'''3. What is its frequency?'''

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{3.52 \times 10^{-13}}{6.63 \times 10^{-34}} = 5.31 \times 10^{20}\mbox{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. What is its wavelength?'''

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{5.31 \times 10^{20}} = 5.65 \times 10^{-13}\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. What classical physical conditions might cause a newly produced electron-positron pair to annihilate almost immediately?'''

Electrons and positrons have opposite charges, and so they attract each other. When they are created, they must have enough kinetic energy to escape each other's attraction. If this is not the case, they will annihilate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The [[wikipedia: Darpa_challenge | DARPA challenge]] project can be categorized as “[[wikipedia: prototyping|prototyping ]] from scratch”. The actual goal lies in the development of new technologies, so the most important system design driver here is the research based creation of a working prototype from scratch. Because of the fact that the technology is fairly new, ideal design guidelines or directions are not yet determined. So the big challenge for the participating teams consists of combining components, that are not (yet) optimized to function together, and so creating a whole that functions as good as possible.

==Consequences on the component level==
As an immediate consequence component costs, [[wikipedia: reusability|reusability]], [[wikipedia: flexibility|flexibility]] are of almost no importance in comparison to e.g. a commercial design process (e.g. [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example |the people mover ]]).
Another consequence is that the used components do not optimally work together because they are not (yet) designed to do so (on component level).

Also, because of the limited time span before the challenges it is sometimes necessary to sort of ‘gamble’ and use components that were not fully tested.
The lack of experience handling this new technology also implies that too much data is logged and examined simply because it is not yet known exactly which data are important or relevant and which aren’t (comparison to the [[wikipedia: Black_box_(transportation)|black box]] of an airplane, where only the most important [[wikipedia: Data_logging |data is logged]]).

==Comparison to ROBOCUP==
A parallel can be drawn between the DARPA and [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/RoboCup|ROBOCUP]] competitions, that are both competitive projects in the robotics field. An important difference, however, lies in the coordination of the robot(s), which in ROBOCUP happens via communication with the other robots on the field, where in DARPA the coordination is handled internally in one vehicle, without immediate communication to others. The vehicle creates a map of the world based on only its own observations and knowings (e.g. using [[wikipedia: Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping|SLAM]]). This again has consequences on many fields e.g. choosing to work with one or plural [[wikipedia: Computer_network |networks]], speed of communication between the components, which data is important and which not, which aspects of the sensing of the environment happens with cameras and which with lasers,…

For all of these questions there are no unambiguous correct answers at the moment so the different teams try out different alternatives and methods that lead to new developments and insights in the technology of unmanned vehicles.

Although resembling technologies are used in both competitions, it is wrong to assume that the technologies used in the DARPA project can simply be scaled down to the ROBOCUP contenders. The components that are being used are still too large and too numerous at the moment, as well as not fit for use indoor or in high-dynamic tracking.

==Do’s and Don’ts==
===Do's===
*All the participating teams have '''divided the design into subcategories''' (functionalities) that were developed simultaneously ( e.g. perception, planning, base vehicle platform). '''Continuous collaboration''' and information exchange between the subteams is of the upmost importance. Also '''continuous testing''' is a must because of the lack of information concerning some components or the interaction between them.
*Some teams that used new or innovative technologies foresaw '''backup systems''' in case of failure. These backups usually consisted of technologies that had already proven their worth.
*'''Safety''' is also very important in this context because few is known about several of the component(combination)s. Therefore the base has to be able to shut down the vehicle at any given time and implement the necessary safety precautions.

===Don'ts===
*Because of the short time available for the development, it is almost impossible to '''extensively investigate''' every possible component, scenario, … As a consequence the team sometimes has to ‘gamble’ and just choose a certain component, strategy with the risk of failure.
*There is also no time for '''optimization''' of the entire system, nor of the separate components. This may lead to a suboptimal efficiency because e.g. some components are not fully compatible with each other.
*In this stage, '''cost''' is of inferior importance. Factors that can suppress cost in commercial cycles such as flexibility, reusability, cheap components,… don’t have to be taken into account here because the main goal is creating a working prototype

In the 1970s after Marvin Minski noted the linearity of the perceptron's output the bloom came off Neural Networks, and the near miracle status that they had been hyped to, made many people think that they were no longer a valid study. Neuroscientists knew better, but those who had hoped to earn money from the new systems, abandoned them temporarily.

One Scientist called Herman Hesse, however wrote a paper, on Parallel Distributed Processing, that showed that neural networks could be seen as a method of decomposing complex tasks into simple procedures, that were manageable with only a rudimentary processing element. Since that time, Neural networks has split into two separate fields, Natural Neural Networks, and Parallel Distributed Processing which is sometimes called Artificial Neural Networks.

The primary difference between these two fields is that Natural Neural Networks is limited to attempting to model real natural neural networks, while Parallel Distributed Processing is free to make any changes it wants to the basic model, in order to get better speed for the same process, or to get a better fit to a particular processing task. Some models like Igor Aleksander's weightless Neurons, seem so far from the standard neural network that they might be mistaken for an Artificial Neural Network, but they are applied to the task of modelling a natural neural network, so they fall within that school of thought even if there is no reason to assume that there are natural neurons that do not have synapses.

Because the point of Parallel Distributed Processing is to decompose complex functions into smaller easily processed chunks, the nature of the models changes, and we no longer need both a neuron model and a network model, and the nature of the learning algorithm depends on the application.

Thus some Artificial Neural Networks lack neurons, some Artificial Neural Networks lack Networks, and some Artificial Neural Networks have customized learning algorithms. The title of Neural network seems somewhat tenuous in these cases, but the Parallel Distributed Processing people don't see calling their programs a neural network as a problem. Besides enough of the original neural networks still exist to keep them current in the journals.

As an example consider the SOM or self-organizing map. Although this simulation is meant to simulate some functions it is thought might be found in the visual cortex, The processing element owes more to topology than it does to neural models. Essentially what it does is reduce the dimensional complexity of a highly dimensional topology to a relatively small usually two dimensional topology while attempting to retain the topological features of the higher dimensional structure.

It is possible to see the Neural Network within this structure even though the neurons have nothing to do with nerves, and the network is built to fit the topology, rather than fitting the topology to an existing network.
