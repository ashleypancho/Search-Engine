      <text xml:space="preserve">Types of religion

Religions generally demand respect for parents, elders and certain wise or brave leaders. Hierarchical power structures culminate in monotheism, where a supreme, all-wise, ever-present but undetectable God monitors a believers' every thought and action. The contrary view is of polytheism, where many gods deny supremacy to any person or deity. Universal democracy is a form of this, since every elector is an individual, but the average of their collective will (eventually) reign supreme. Rather than respecting the personal wishes of a king or president, democrats require their leaders to conform to their collective will, and punish those who abuse their delegated power. Neither absolute personal princely power nor absolute democracy is very efficient, and most societies strike a balance - The United States of America and the Republic of France have powerful presidents, but their term of office is very short. Conversely the monarchs of the Kingdoms of Spain and Britain rule 'for life' but they have very little power or freedom although their experience may lend them a certain moral authority.


Needs to be reworded in line with a new heading types of religious belief. Needs to define only what each type is.  I would also suggest that the hierarchical structure of a religion has nothing to do with the belief system of the religion (e.g. islamic religion does not have a hierarchical structure but is a monotheistic religion, Christianity on the other hand can (depending on the denomination) have ecclesial structures that are hierarchical  and is also monotheistic.    I would remove the non-religious examples as they are not sound foundations for a basis of theology.

The article is actually a brief introduction to religion and not at all to theology. While there's not much wrong with doing them both, there are many problems in confusing them.</text>

[[File:VISITA A LOS SANTOS MACARACAS 039.jpg|thumb|right|You are made of matter too. So are mountains, grass, and so on.]]
Everything is made of matter. Almost everything, that is. There are two criteria that determine whether something is composed of matter:
* Matter must have mass;
* Matter must take up space.
As you know, air takes up space. Therefore, air is matter. In fact, if you were hot enough you could turn into gas too, just like air. That will be [[../Three states of matter|explained later]].

Here are some other examples of matter:
* You
* Other living things
* Your schoolbag
* Your science textbook

However, not everything is made up of matter. Here are some common exceptions:
* The light that comes out of lamps
* The sound from your radio

But how does this all link to particles? As you will learn later, matter is made up of particles. Since almost everything around us is made of matter, learning about particles is essential in explaining further topics. This book will help you begin your quest by introducing the properties of particles and explaining the types of objects made up from matter. This book is based on the curriculum of chapter 6 of form one in Hong-Kong, but you don't have to be a Hong-Kong-er to read this book!

== Using this book ==
Children can use this book in a number of ways.
* To find out more about our world and fulfill their curiosity.
*As a set of notes for studying and future reference.
* To use within the curriculum of a class.
* And pretty much anything else that you can think of.

If you are reading this book as an e-book on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main page Wikibooks], feel free to edit or modify this book! If you are reading this offline or as a pdf, the url of this book is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior:Particles http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior:Particles].

[[File:Bleu de Gex.jpg|100px|thumb|right|This chunk of cheese is solid.]]
[[File:Orange juice 1.jpg|100px|thumb|right|The orange juice is liquid.]]
[[File:Automobile exhaust gas.jpg|100px|thumb|right|This is exhaust gas and it's gas!]]
As we have found out from the introduction, anything that occupies space and has mass is matter. However, not all matter is the same. Matter, in fact, can appear as three forms: liquid, solid and gas. Water is the only kind of matter whose all three states appear in nature. Therefore, we will use water as a primary example as we go through the three states of matter. Later in the book, we will also explain the three states of matter with the particle model.

== Properties of matter ==
[[File:Frigidaire tm.jpg|thumb|left|100px|If you put water in a fridge, it freezes after a while.]]
The properties of matter are as follows:
*Solids' shapes cannot be altered, and nor can its volume
*Liquids' shapes can be altered, but not its volume
*Gases' shapes can be altered (so it's compressible), and so can its volume

These properties can be verified with a series of experiments. First, you can try to alter the shape of volume of solids. Try doing that to your pencil – it won't budge. Then try to pour some water from a bottle to a cup. The shape changes. Now, if the bottle is full, but its size reduces, will the liquid spill? The answer is yes. Therefore, liquids have a fixed volume. Finally, try gases. If you transfer some coloured gas from one container to another, whose shapes and sizes are different, there will be no problem.

== Change of states ==
[[File:Kettle decorative.JPG|right|thumb|100px|When you boil water in a kettle, some of it turns to gas.]]
Sometimes matter can change from one state to another. For example, if you blow onto the surface of glass, the water vapour that comes out of your mouth transforms into liquid. If you put the piece of glass into a freezer, a few hours later it will become ice.

There are specific names for the changes of states.

{|class = &quot;wikitable&quot; borders=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| rowspan = &quot;2&quot; |
Solid
|Melting&lt;br/&gt; →→→→→→
| rowspan = &quot;2&quot; |
Liquid 
| Boiling&lt;br/&gt;→→→→→→
| rowspan = &quot;2&quot; |
Gas
|-
| ←←←←←←&lt;br/&gt;Freezing
| ←←←←←←&lt;br/&gt;Condensation
|}

Melting, freezing and boiling happen at fixed temperatures. The temperature of distinction between different states are called the melting point, the freezing point and the boiling point. For water, these points are 0°C, 0°C and 100°C respectively. Actually, the freezing and melting points of any matter are the same.

Condensation does not take place at a fixed temperature. There is a related process called evaporation, which does not take place at a fixed temperature, although a higher temperature does accelerate the rate of evaporation. Evaporation is the process in which a solid changes into a liquid. When your wound is sterillised, it feels cold as the alcohol evaporates, carrying with it heat.

==Quiz==
# X is heated, so that transforms into another state. The initial form is not liquid. What is the current form? What is the process it went through?
# True or false? As the boiling point of Y is 300°C, it cannot change into its gaseous form at 250°C, nor change into liquid form at 350°C.

Answers:
#Liquid; melting
#False. Condensation and evaporation can happen at any temperature.

[[File:Leitz 117298 frei.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Unfortunately, this little thing cannot help us see particles.]]
The particle theory is a theory that scientists have proposed. It suggests the following points:
* Matter is made of particles;
* Particles are extremely small, and current scientific instruments cannot see them;
* Different kinds of particles have different sizes;
* There must be gaps between particles
* Particles are always in motion.

== Spaces between particles ==
[[File:Alcohol water particles.svg|right|200px]]
There are spaces between particles. Imagine you put pebbles into a measuring cylinder. The reading is 200mL. Then you get 200mL of sand, and mix it in. The result is not 400mL, as there are spaces between the pebbles, and the sand can fill them up.

So, if you mix equal volumes of alcohol and water, the result is not twice the volume of alcohol or water, but slightly less. See the diagram on the right for what the particles look like. Or, if you put sugar into coffee, the coffee level does not rise up the same volume as the sugar. This is because there are spaces between particles.

== Particles always moving ==
Particles are always moving, although they do move differently - this will be explained in the states of matter chapter later on. For example, when water is boiled, the 'steam', which are actually tiny water particles, cannot stay in one place. More about this will be discussed in the next chapter, which is about diffusion.

== Quiz ==
#Which of the following statements is true?
## Particles in solids are often stationary. (Stationary means not moving.)
## Particles can only be seen with electronic microscopes.
## Heat is not made of particles.
## The size of alcohol and water particles are the same.
# Name the rule that is not used above, and give an example of it.

Answers:
# 3
# There are spaces between particles. When equal amounts of water and alcohol are mixed together, the result is not the same as the sum of the two initial liquids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Particle theory|Next=Brownian motion}}

As we have found in the last chapter, particles are always moving. However, how exactly would they move? A common phenomenon observed from the movement of particles is diffusion. Diffusion means a kind of particles going from a place of higher concentration to a place of lower concentration. Imagine a herd of lions and a herd of tigers mixed together. If diffusion happens, lions will go to a place with more tigers than lions, and tigers will go to a place with less tigers than lions. At the end, the tigers and lions will be mixed more thoroughly. That is what particles are like during diffusion.

== Examples of diffusion ==
[[File:Diffusion.svg|left|thumb|100px|What diffusion looks like.]]

If you dip a paintbrush with a bit of red paint on the tip into a cup of water, the paint will spread all over the cup. The red will spread to places that are more transparent, while the transparency spreads to places that are redder. At the end, the paint and water will be thoroughly mixed so the water is red. (Here we assume that the paint is soluble in water.)

Another example is smell. Imagine a piece of stilton cheese is placed on a table in a corner of a room. You are standing on the opposite corner, a friend of yours is standing in the centre, and another friend is standing right next to the stilton cheese. You must be the last to smell it.

== Perfume in a plastic bag ==
This experiment is inspired from an experiment from the following source:
*{{cite book|first1=W. K.|last1=Chan|first2=W. Y.|last2=Luk|first3=S. W|last3=Kong|publisher=Aristo Educational Press LTD.|title=Understanding Integrated Science|volume=1B|chapter=Matter as particles|page=131–132}}

#Put a drop of perfume into a plastic bag, then tie up its opening.
#Sniff. You can't smell perfume yet.
#Wait a little bit, sniff again. You should be able to smell perfume now.

This experiment proves that there are spaces between the particles of the wall of the plastic bag, and that the perfume diffuses. When the perfume on the bottom of the bag diffuses, it flies to the wall of the bag. As the perfume particles are small enough, they escape through the gaps between the plastic particles and into your nose.

== Quiz ==
[[File:Diffusion particles.svg|200px]]&lt;br/&gt;
If A and B are to meet, do you think A will come to B or B will come to A? Why?

Answer:
B will come to A. This is because A is in a place of lower concentration while B is in a place of higher concentration. B will flow to A's place because of diffusion.

==Introduction on Assets==

Assets may be viewed as resources owned or controlled by an entity. They include such items as cash, accounts receivable (amounts owed to the company by customers), land, building and equipment, and supplies.
Current assets are often defined as assets that are in cash, or can be converted to cash, in a relatively short period.  In practice that is often defined as convertible within one year or operating cycle, whichever is longer.

==Cash==
Cash are currency and coins, balances in checking accounts, and items acceptable for deposits in these accounts, such as checks and money orders received from customers.

==Accounts receivable==
This is the receivables resulting from the sale of goods or services.This is treated as a current asset on the balance sheet.

==Prepaid expenses==
Prepaid expenses result from businesses making payments for goods and services to be received in the near future.

==Property, plant and equipment==
Property, plant and equipment are tangible, long-lived assets used in the operations of the business. Land, natural resources, buildings, furniture, equipment, and machinery are included in this category. They are listed under the asset portion of the balance sheet. One major component that comes into play with property, plant, and equipment is depreciation. Mostly for equipment and machinery things are depreciated on either a straight line, declining, sum of the years digits, or units of production balance. For natural resources they use a method similar, but it is called depletion. Accounting for these things is pretty simple. The item, or land, is listed on the books at its value and every year the calculated depreciation is taken off and that determines its book value. Many times there is an estimated life and salvage value if the company thinks it can resell the item. If not, it is disposed of and the gain or loss of the sale is recorded on the books as well as removal of the item from the books. 

Figuring the cost of an item takes into consideration more than just the purchase price. Added to that would be any taxes paid, less any discounts received, cost of transportation that a company pays to bring the item to where it needs to go, and the cost of getting it ready for use. The cost of land would include any attorney fees, real estate fees, title fees, back taxes that need to be paid, and the cost of preparation for the lands intended use. Buildings also have additional costs such as legal fees and remodeling fees to prepare it for use. The same goes for natural resources. Basically any costs that are necessary to get an item or land ready to use for business is included in the cost of the item.

===Questions:===
#The amount reported on the balance sheet for Property, Plant and Equipment is the company's estimate of the fair market value as of the balance sheet date. True or False?
# Initial cost of land would include all of the following except:
   A. Cost of Grading
   B. Title Search Cost
   C. Recording Fees
   D. Property Taxes for the current period
# Property, plants, and equipment are reported as current assets. True or False?
# What is the most commonly used form of depreciation?
# Would tearing down an existing building on newly purchased land qualify as a cost under property, plant, and equipment?

Answers:
# False
# D
# False
# Straightline
# Yes

==Intangible Assets==
Intangible assets are assets that lack physical substance, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchises, and goodwill.  This classification of assets generally represents exclusive rights that provide future economic benefit to the owner.

===Goodwill===
Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the unique value of a company as a whole over and above its identifiable tangible and intangible assets.  Because goodwill represents the fair value of a company over and above the fair value of its net assets, its costs can’t be directly associated with any specific identifiable right, subsequently making it non-separable from the company itself.  Examples of a company’s goodwill would be, its clientele, good reputation within its market, well trained employees and management team, its favorable business location, and any other unique features of the company that can’t be associated with a specific asset (Spiceland, Sepe, Nelson, Tomassini, Page 486).  

As previously mentioned goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of a company’s identifiable assets.  The following example illustrates how we derive the value of goodwill for a company.

Ex) The fair value of Company X’s net assets is $500,000, and can be broken down as follows; Inventory $90,000, Receivables $70,000, Property and Equipment $200,000, and Patent $140,000.  Company X’s fair value of liabilities assumed is $200,000, and the purchase price of Company X is $450,000.  By taking the difference of the fair value of net assets and fair value of liabilities assumed, the fair value of the company being purchased would be $300,000.  Because the purchase price of the company was $450,000, and the fair value of the company was $300,000, we can conclude that the difference (excess) of $150,000 represents the value of the goodwill.

Understanding how the value of goodwill is derived; it’s important to note that there is no specific identifiable cost of goodwill separate from the company itself.  That being said, one would conclude that goodwill cannot be separated from a company as a whole, and therefore cannot be purchased or exchanged separately from a company as a whole.  Without being separable from the company, goodwill lacks two key components of most, if not all other assets; those being the ability of “equating costs of an asset” as well as “exchangeability” of an asset. 

There has been great debate for some time regarding whether or not goodwill should be classified as an asset, with opposing views centering on, equating costs and assets, exchangeability of assets, and controllability of assets (Johnson, Petrone 1998, p.7).  Although these opposing viewpoints do merit some consideration, the Financial Accounting Standards board (FASB) has determined that goodwill does in fact meet the three key elements that define an asset (probable future economic benefits, obtained or controlled by an entity, from a past transaction) and consequently is to be classified as an intangible asset (FASB, 350-20-05-3).

Questions
 
1)	How is the value of goodwill derived?

2)	Does goodwill meet FASB’s requirements for classification as an asset?

3)	What are the key concerns from opposing viewpoints regarding the classification of goodwill as an asset?

4)	What type of asset is goodwill classified as?

5)	Would a company’s client list be an example or component of goodwill?

==Depreciation and amortization==

==Impairment==
An impairment loss is accrued when a sudden decrease in the value of the asset occurs.In other words, depreciation and amortization will not be able to significantly decrease the book value of the asset in accordance with its market or fair value. The codification that deals with impairment can be found at 350-10-S35 for intangible assets and at 360-10-40 tangible assets.
===Testing===

Operational assets that a finite life should be tested for impairment when a situation arises that causes the asset to lose value. An extreme example of one situation is when the asset is destroyed. Another example is if the asset is severely damaged. Generally, operational assets should be tested for impairment when one of the following occurs; market price is significantly decreased, legal factors cause a negative change in the asset, the asset is going to be disposed of before the end of its useful life, or a negative change in the physical condition of the asset. 

However, some operational assets, such as intangible assets with infinite lives and goodwill should be tested for impairment annually.


===Implementation===

When measuring the impairment of an asset with a finite life, a two step process is used. The first step of the process is called the recoverability test. The recoverability test determines if an impairment loss is needed by seeing if the undiscounted future value of the cash flows from the asset is less than the book value of the asset. If the future value is lower than the current book value, an impairment loss measurement is needed. The second step is to actually measure the impairment. The impairment loss is measured by the difference between the book value and the fair value of the asset.  

In the case of intangible assets with indefinite lives, the impairment loss is also the difference between the book value and the fair value of the asset. However, in order to determine whether an impairment loss is needed, future cash flows cannot be used, and the only determination is the current fair value of the asset. 

Goodwill is a special category of assets and is measured in a different way than other operational assets. Impairment to goodwill is measured by the difference between book value and fair value. However, the value of goodwill is only implied, so the market value of the asset cannot be used in this determination of impairment.


===Journal entries===

The journal entries for the impairment loss have the following format.

&lt;pre&gt;
Loss on impairment                     xx
Accumulated depreciation               xx
      Asset                                xx
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Independent study questions===

====Questions====

# A piece of machinery has a book value of $35 million and accumulated depreciation of $10 million. The fair value of this machinery is $10 million. The future, undiscounted cash flows estimated for the machinery are $15 million. Calculate the impairment loss on the machinery.
#Prepare the jounal entry needed for the calculation completed in question 1.
#How does the calculation of impairment for goodwill differ from that of other intangible assets?
#What are some possible situations that causes a company to determine if their assets are impaired?
#Where are impairment losses reported in financial statements?


====Answers====

#Since the book value is more than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the asset, an impairment loss is needed. The fair value of $10 million is subtracted from the book value of $35 million, less the accumulated depreciation of $10 million. The impairment loss is calculated to be $15million.
#The journal entry should be:
&lt;pre&gt;
Loss on impairment                     $15million
Accumulated depreciation               $10million
      Machinery                                  $25million
&lt;/pre&gt;
3. Goodwill is considered to be a special asset. The market value of goodwill is implied, therefore it can never be used in the calculation of an impairment loss. Instead, the implied fair value of goodwill is subtracted from the book value to determine the impairment loss.

4. It would not be cost effective for companies to measure all of their assets for impairment every year. Some situations that are used to identify when an impairment loss may be needed is when there is a major decrease in market price, legal factors cause a negative change in the asset, the asset is going to be disposed of before the end of its useful life, or a negative change in the physical condition of the asset.

5. A disclosure note is needed to describe the impairment loss. Impairment losses are also seen on the income statements, as well as the balance sheet.

==Investments==
Accounting methods for investments held by a firm vary according to whether the firm has control over the investee.

===Trading Securities===
Marked to market, and gains and losses are recognized immediately in income.  Balance sheet shows fair value.

===Held-to-maturity debt===
Recorded at amortized cost by a schedule determined at the original investment date.  Gains and losses are not recognized.  Balance sheet shows amortized cost.

===Available-for-sale===
For other debt and securities that do not meet Trading Securities or HTM requirements.  Unrealized gains and losses are not recognized in regular income, but they are recognized in &quot;other comprehensive income&quot;.  Balance sheet shows fair value.

==Significant influence==
Equity method is primarily used;  fair value option is also available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Target grade level ==

This book could be very cool.  Right now I think it's pitched a bit high for Wikijunior, but any possible redress of that is contingent on clarifying the target audience.

To start with, what is the grade level of the material that this book is initially based on?  (I know from nothing about Hong Kong's system, so &quot;chapter&amp;nbsp;6 of form one&quot; doesn't tell me anything.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:07, 30 May 2010 (UTC)
:Form 1 = Year 7 = Sixth grade [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 08:13, 31 May 2010 (UTC) &lt;small&gt;P.S. 'redress' and 'contigent on' are really tough words for me. This ''is'' Wikijunior, you know. :) Had to check the dictionary.

*I agree, the authorship seems to waiver between various agegroups, e.g. (&quot;stationary means not moving&quot; then &quot;gases are compressible&quot;).  If it's for a younger audience, I would suggest redoing the entire book as a narrative.  Something like Patty the Particle and then describing his/her activities with his/her particle friends.

==Featured Book Feedback==

To have a hope of featured book status, most vital first:
* Go to wikimedia commons and get loads loads more pictures.  Vital for a junior book.  Water/Ice/Steam.  Carbon/Diamond.  Submarines(underwater)/Hot-air-balloon(in flight).  Consider even 'inside an atom'. 
* Really serious content review...  Find and fix statements like &quot;Gas particles do not have a fixed shape so you can safely bend them and they won't even break.&quot;  Please.  
* Echoing the comments on this page about 'level': cover other simple topics like what happens when salt dissolves?  How can I separate salt, sawdust, sand and iron filings?  How big is an atom?  Why do they put salt on roads?  Brownian motion is a more advanced topic, so to me the book seems seriously incomplete for its (apparent) intended level.

[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 16:39, 3 November 2010 (UTC)

**Hm... that sounds like the easy part. :)
**I think Pi zero will handle that part.
**'''What happens when salt dissolves''': I do not see why that is more 'simple' than the info stated here. One must have a basic understanding of the particle theory to explain that. '''How can I separate salt, sawdust, sand and iron filings''' and '''Why do they put salt on roads''': Er, how is that supposed to be related to particles? (I didn't even know the put salt on roads. :P) '''How big is an atom''': I do not intend to mention atoms and molecules in the book, as it may complicate matters. '''Brownian motion is a more advanced topic''': Actually no, I don't think it's an advanced topic. In fact, I think it's quite a basic concept related to particles.
In any case, thanks for the review! [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

* &quot;Particles are infinitesimal, and current scientific instruments cannot see them&quot;.  If you mean ''atoms'' then they do have size and individual Xenon atoms can be seen with a [[wikipedia:Atomic_force_microscopy#Identification of individual surface atoms|Atomic Force Microscope]].  Please fix.  [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 20:09, 12 November 2010 (UTC)

* The book is called 'Particles'.  It looks like a kind of wikijunior introduction to chemistry and states of matter, in which case giving some notion of the difference between a mixture and a compound is called for.  In this sentence &quot;In solids, the particles are cramped together tightly in regular positions&quot;  I can only think the particles you are talking about there are atoms.  But children have heard of particles of dirt, particles of sand, particles of sawdust.  Either you have to tell them that those are not the kinds of particles you mean, and if you do you might as well mention atoms, or you have to be talking about those kinds of particles too.  Those two points at any rate should partially explain my comments about sand and iron filings.  Clearer?  [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 20:09, 12 November 2010 (UTC)

:I think the readers should understand that by 'infinitesimal' I mean 'extremely small', not literally infinitely small, which of course is impossible to reach. :) If there is a highly advanced microscope that can see some sort of particles, I don't think I will include this in the book, for the same reason why teachers tell small kids that lines are what you draw with rulers instead of an infinite set of points extending in either direction.
:About the scope of the book, this is what the message I intended to bring out is that stuff are made of particles according to the particle theory, (assuming that the reader has no previous knowledge of atoms whatsoever), which can explain things with the particle model. It's not intended to be an introduction to chemistry. About the word 'particles', I'm ready to hear your opinion and/or [[WB:BOLD|bold]] fixes. How do you think you could explain to kids about 'heights' and 'altitudes' of triangles, the 'foci' of an ellipse, etc? [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

:: Avoid the word &quot;infinitesimal&quot; when discussing particles unless you really mean &quot;infinitely small&quot;.  The concept of point particles is quite important in the history of theoretical physics, and so the word should not be used unless that's really what is meant.  Besides, &quot;infinitesimal&quot; is going to increase your [[w:Gunning fog index|Gunning fog index]]&amp;nbsp;:-).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:38, 13 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== two finite and different critical points ==

Hi,

I'm not sure if it is what you wanted, but here are [http://www.ijon.de/mathe/julia/some_julia_sets_1_en.html non-standard examples of Julia set made with IIM/J]. What do you think about it ? --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 15:23, 30 May 2010 (UTC)

:These pictures look nice - white on black background - and the creator gives interesting information. But the pictures do not bear witness of a completely developed drawing technique. The creator talks about fixed points, why not cycles? Are the pictures drawn simply by examining if the sequence of iteration converges to a fixed point? By examining 100 points for each pixel, it is really possible to make such pretty pictures in this way - but very time-consuming. Besides, they are drawn without using a Mandelbrot set. Therefore they have a &quot;casual&quot; look. I have drawn some of these pictures using different colour scales for different Fatou domains and lighting effect, and it is such pictures I advertise for.

Firearms and other weapon offences is set out in Part III of the Criminal Code.

Lawful possession of firearms is governed by the ''Firearms Act''.

On April 5, 2012, the Long-Gun Registry was eliminated removing the requirement that non-restricted firearms be registered.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Organizations Case Report: Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP)/ United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Overview/History==
The Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention has undergone several name changes since its inception in 1997, most recently in 2002 the ODCCP changed its name to its current name, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  For purposes of this case study the ODCCP will be refereed to as UNODC.  The mission of UNODC revolves around &quot;the three pillars of the UNODC work programme.&quot;

# Research and analysis to enhance understanding of crime and drug issues and provide useful data for policy makers.
# Assist member states in ratification and implementation of international treaties and assist with local law procedures related to drugs, crime, and terrorism.
# Provide useful field based assistance to member states to reduce drugs, crime, and terrorism.

The official mandate of UNDOC is to assist member states in their struggle against illicit drugs, crime, and terrorism.  At the center of UNODC's mission is reform of the criminal justice system to bring about a system that is more effective and humane.
UNODC is headquartered in Vienna, Austria and based in the Vienna International Center which opened in January 1, 1980.  This is also the base of operations for the United Nations of Vienna (UNOV).  UNOV is the third largest headquarters of the UN behind New York City and Geneva, Switzerland of the four worldwide headquarters.  UNODC employs almost five hundred workers in Vienna, its 23 worldwide field offices, and at the UN offices in New York.  The membership of the UNODC is comprised of member states that make up the UN.  

The Executive Director of UNODC is Antonio Maria Costa of Italy, who also serves as the Director-General of UNOV. Director Costa has placed special emphasis on organized crime as a threat to global security and democratic stability in UNODC's mission to diminish drugs, crime, and terrorism worldwide.  In Costa's remarks on the 2010 World Drug Report he stated &quot;strengthen integrity tackles the corruption that enables crime.  Promoting justice prevents criminals from operating with impunity.  Improving health prevents the spread of drug addiction and blood-borne diseases-particularly in the developing world.  And cutting criminal networks disrupts a range of illicit activities that carve out paths of death and destruction through some of the worlds most fragile regions.&quot;

Recently, UNODC's Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice met in Vienna from May 17 to May 21, 2010 to discuss new criminal justice challenges around the world.  Among the new emerging threats discussed were the problems of cybercrime, trafficking in cultural artifacts, and treatment of female prisoners.  The commission put forward two resolutions to strengthen UNODC work with &quot;public-private partnerships to counter crime&quot; and efforts to curb human trafficking, piracy off the coast of Somalia, and form networks of cooperation.  The second resolution calls for greater cooperation to curb criminal activity at the South Korean hosted 2011 World Summit of Prosecutors General, Attorneys General, and Chief Prosecutors.

==Local Significance==
The local significance of UNODC being located in Vienna, Austria is recognition of Vienna's importance as a world capital.  Stability and an understanding of humanitarian issues provide an environment and location suitable for the mission of UNODC.  While crime recently has been on the rise in Austria, overall crime occurs at a low rate in comparison to many counties.  Much of Austria's crimes are crimes of opportunity, for example pick pocketing or theft of personal property.  Violent crime, organized crime and terrorist activity remain at some of the lowest levels in Europe.  Also, the training, expertise, and effectiveness of Austria's police force compares favorably to police departments in large US cities.  These factors contribute to the image of Vienna as a place where global crime and drug issues can be discussed and global projects aimed at real solutions can be launched.

The Czech Republic also has a fairly low overall rate of crime.  Petty theft crimes are the most frequently encountered crimes and are focused on key tourist areas of Prague such as Wenceslas Square, the Charles Bridge, and Old Town Square with pick pocketing rings operating with a high degree of skill and coordination.  The drug trade in the Czech Republic is more of a problem then in Austria due to several factors including lower capability of monitoring money laundering, a central location for drug running, and fairly light penalties for drug crimes.

==Global Impact and Significance==
UNODC currently has at least eight major areas of focus that have a global impact and fulfill its UN mandate.  The eight areas of UNODC focus are money laundering, organized crime, piracy, drug control &amp; treatment, corruption, terrorism, trafficking in persons, and reform of criminal justice systems &amp; prisons.

In May of 2009, UNODC launched an anti-piracy campaign providing assistance to Kenya, The Seychelles, and Tanzania.  The program laid out legal frameworks to handover and prosecute piracy suspects many of which are currently housed in Kenyan prisons.  The burden of piracy in Kenya has been eased through UNODC support for Kenyan law enforcement and increased court facilities, while improving prison conditions in Mombasa' ''Shimo La Tena'' Prison.  UNODC is currently looking to build upon its work in East Africa and plans to extend its coverage to other countries in the region including Somalia.

Organized crime and its transnational impact are regarded by UNODC as one of the main threats to &quot;human security, impeding the social, economic, political and cultural development of societies worldwide.&quot;  UNODC assists member states by creating new frameworks and improved domestic legislation to cooperatively combat organized crime.  Enhancing law enforcement capability through training and technical expertise, cooperation with legal assistance allows for uniformity of enforcement.  For example, faster and easier extradition of organized crime members.  The Treaty of UN Conventions Against Transnational Organized Crime set up a framework in 2003 to combat organized crime.  The treaty not only allows for greater cooperation, but produces a free flow of information between international law enforcement agencies and analyzes new organized crime trends.

Another key issue for UNODC is Human Trafficking often a component of organized crime.  A 2009 UNODC Global Report on Human Trafficking found data hard to compile with inadequate reporting in many counties, however the study did shed some light on some statistical evidence.  Seventy-nine percent of human trafficking according to the report was for sexual exploitation with forced labor involving eighteen percent.  Women made up between 80 to 84 % of the victims.  Another finding of the report was that although the number of convictions for human trafficking is on the rise it is not keeping pace with the scale of the growing trade.  Many developing countries still lack the legal infrastructure and capability to address human trafficking and this is one example why UNODC has a significant role to play in the world today.

UNODC's program in East Africa to combat terrorism was launched in 2003.  Kenya and Tanzania have been the site of terrorist attacks in 1998 at the US Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and again in 2002 in Mombasa with the attempted shoot down of a civilian aircraft.  The program aims at providing counter-terrorism technology to prevent further attacks.  UNODC also provides training to law enforcement and elected officials to form a framework to deal with the regional threat of terrorism.

Reform of criminal justice systems and prisons are key components of UNODC.  Fair legal systems and protection of human rights based on the rule of law are essential aspects of criminal justice systems and the implementation of standards.  These endeavors will stabilize countries in conflict and UNODC works in developing countries to improve training and skills.  

The illicit drug trade is one of the most significant barriers to global security and prosperity.  UNODC recognizes many of the shortfalls of drug control however does not support the growing movement towards ''legalize and tax'' which it dismisses as overly simplistic.  UNODC urges governmental action in the direction away from punishing the user and onto treatment of the user with greater enforcement aimed at the drug runners.  By governments fine tuning their policies and focusing controls on crime and promoting health access to drug addicts the problem may eventually show signs of success.  One example of a UNODC project is that of Alternative Development.  Six countries currently (Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Lao, Myanmar, and Peru) participate in a program to provide rural farmers with legal alternatives to such crops as marijuana, popy, cocoa, etc.  The goal is to provide impoverished areas of the world with real economically sustainable crops to harvest.

Money is usually at the heart of all criminal activity.  From drug smugglers to terrorist organizations, funds are necessary to further operations but also ways of concealing money from law enforcement officials often takes the form of money laundering.  Money laundering often promotes corruption and when public officials engage in corruption , the publics trust is broken.  One of UNODC's primary goals is to interrupt and break the cycle of money laundering by strengthening financial institutions making them less susceptible to &quot;dirty money&quot;.

Going hand in hand with UNODC's money laundering campaign is an effort to combat corruption at all levels.  For example, UNODC's program in East Africa provides accounting computer software technology to track corruption in Ethiopia, Maritious, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Burundi, and Southern Sudan.  The objective of UNODC is to enhance integrity both in the public and private sectors by creating greater transparency and accountability.


== Summary ==

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is an institution of growing importance around the world as criminal activity becomes more of a cross border problem. The need for an organization to fill in the gaps becomes more apparent.  UNODC's many missions launched from its Vienna, Austria headquarters adds to the image of Vienna as a global capital and a leader in the effort to make the world a more stable and prosperous place to live.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Lymphocyte Predominant'''&lt;/big&gt;

*Lymphocyte-predominant has a different natural history (especially stages I-II) and response to therapy than classical HL. 
*Chemo is not indicated in most early stage cases, and standard is IFRT.
*LP has best prognosis of HL subtypes, but late recurrences common and long-term followup necessary.

==NCCN Guidelines==
*Stage I-IIA: IFRT or regional RT
*Stage I-IIB w/ B sx's: chemotherapy followed by IFRT
*Stage III-IVA: chemotherapy +/- RT –OR— observation (cat 2B) –OR— local RT (palliation only)  or rituximab
*Stage III-IVB: chemotherapy +/- RT or rituximab +/- chemo +/- RT

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Secure Hash Algorithm SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm), based on the MD4 (Message Digest) algorithm created by Ronald L. Rivest of the MIT. Consists in three SHA distinct algorithms labeled SHA-0, SHA-1, and SHA-2.

SHA-1 was considered a cryptographically secure one-way hash algorithm (some weaknesses have already been found). It was designed by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), along with the NSA (National Security Agency), see the [http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm Secure Hash Standard FIPS 180-1].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Numbers ==

Loglan has a set of numbers composed of 10 little words which represent a single digit each:

* 0 - ni
* 1 - ne
* 2 - to
* 3 - te
* 4 - fo
* 5 - fe
* 6 - so
* 7 - se
* 8 - vo
* 9 - ve

All odd numbers end in ''e'' and all even numbers end in ''o''. You can form larger numbers though combining words in the same way we combine digits. 

=== Examples ===

* 10 - neni
* 123 - netote

== Sequences ==

You can add ''fi'' on to the end of a number to describe a sequence such as ''first, second, third''.

=== Examples ===

* Nefi - first
* tofi - second
* tefi - third

== Letters ==

Loglan has away to refer to each letter. You might want to do this when using letters as variables. You just need to add an ending to the letter depending on weather you use a Latin of Greek letter, vowel or consonant. NB Loglan does not use the letter '''c''' or '''w''' for Greek letters as Greek has no corresponding sounds (c = ''sh'' and w = ''eu'' in Loglan).

* -ei for lower case Latin consonant letters
* -si for lower case Latin vowel letters
* -ai for upper case Latin consonant letters
* -ma for upper case Latin vowel letters

* -eo for lower case Greek consonant letters
* gao- for upper case Greek consonant letters 
* -fi for lower case vowel letters
* gao,- for upper case Greek vowel letters 

=== Examples ===

* A - Ama
* a - asi
* B - Bai
* b - bei

* Alpha - gao,afi
* alpha - afi
* Beta - gaobeo
* beta - beo

==Legislation==
{{Quotation|
344. (1) Every person who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
:(a) if a restricted firearm or prohibited firearm is used in the commission of the offence or if any firearm is used in the commission of the offence and the offence is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of
::(i) in the case of a first offence, five years, and
::(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent offence, seven years;
:(a.1) in any other case where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; and
:(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life.&lt;br&gt;
'''Subsequent offences'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), whether a convicted person has committed a second or subsequent offence, if the person was earlier convicted of any of the following offences, that offence is to be considered as an earlier offence:
:(a) an offence under this section;
:(b) an offence under subsection 85(1) or (2) or section 244 or 244.2; or
:(c) an offence under section 220, 236, 239, 272 or 273, subsection 279(1) or section 279.1 or 346 if a firearm was used in the commission of the offence.&lt;br&gt;
However, an earlier offence shall not be taken into account if 10 years have elapsed between the day on which the person was convicted of the earlier offence and the day on which the person was convicted of the offence for which sentence is being imposed, not taking into account any time in custody.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Sequence of convictions only'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the only question to be considered is the sequence of convictions and no consideration shall be given to the sequence of commission of offences or whether any offence occurred before or after any conviction.

{{Quotation|
'''Robbery to steal firearm'''&lt;br&gt;
98.1 Every person who commits a robbery within the meaning of section 343 with intent to steal a firearm or in the course of which he or she steals a firearm commits an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

}}
==Application==
===Principles===
In most provinces the case law has set the starting point for robbery in general start at 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Johnas (1982), 32 C.R. (3d) l (Alta. C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence is adjusted from that starting point either up or down based on the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the accused. The normal range is in excess of 2 years.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Wozny, 2010 MBCA 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In Manitoba, there is no starting point for robberies.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sorensen, 2006 MBCA 38 at 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alberta, The starting point for a mugging robbery is 12 to 18 months.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Nerling, 2011 ABPC 371 (CanLII) at 6&lt;br&gt;
R v Carter, [1992] AJ No 561 (CA) (no record, no injuries, low value)&lt;br&gt;
R v Nyland, [1991] AJ No 1136 (CA)(no record, no injuries, low value)&lt;Br&gt;
R v Saeed, 2004 ABCA 385, 357 AR 238 (no record, no injuries, low value)&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Robberies involving stabbings are frequently in the four to five years range.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Biln, 1999 BCCA 369 (CanLII), 1999 BCCA 369&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most robberies and break and enters, the primary focus is deterrence and denunciation, thus, characteristics of the offender may be of limited to no relevance.

In Alberta, the starting point for robbery of a bank by use of a note is 4 years incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Brennan [2003] A.J. No. 1366 (Alta. C.A.) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Jenkins, 2004 ABPC 48&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Earl, [1985] A.J. No. 168&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Trudell, [1984] A.J. No. 932&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R. v. Hung (1990), 113 A.R. 205, [1990] A.J. No. 1074 (QL) (Alta. C.A.), at 214: &quot;the starting‑point for any sentence involving robbery of a financial institution is five years in the penitentiary&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Nova Scotia, financial institution robberies are in the the range of 6 to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;R v Leet (1989) 88 NSR (2d) 161 per Chipman&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rare cases, robberies can include suspended sentences.&lt;Ref&gt;
see  R. v. Carver, [1980] M.J. No. 257 (C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Ramsay, [1985] M.J. No. 417 (C.A.) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bartlett, [1961] M.J. No. 2 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
====Home Invasion====
The term “home invasion” can be applied to wide range of offences and so can be misleading to assume they are all similar cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. A.J.C.; R. v. Joseph, 2004 BCCA 268 (CanLII) at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta has required a '''home invasion''' is a robbery to include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Matwiy, [1996] A.J. No. 134 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
# plan to commit robbery in a home where offender expects to be found in dwelling
# arms self with weapon
# enters dwelling that is reasonably known to be occupied
# confines occupants 
# threaten occupants
# steals money or valuable property

In Nova Scotia, private dwelling robberies are in the the range of 6 to 10 years. &lt;ref&gt;R v Leet (1989) 88 NSR (2d) 161 per Chipman&lt;/ref&gt;

In British Columbia, the range of sentence for home invasions involving serious violence is 8 to 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;R v DAW, [2002] BCJ 1156 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Newfoundland,the &quot;low end&quot; of the acceptable range is 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. P.J.B., [http://canlii.ca/t/27prb 1999 CanLII 18938] (NL CA), (1999), 182 Nfld. and P.E.I.R. 14 (NLCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
{{quotation|
348. (1) Every one who
:(a) breaks and enters a place with intent to commit an indictable offence therein,
:(b) breaks and enters a place and commits an indictable offence therein, or
:(c) breaks out of a place after
::(i) committing an indictable offence therein, or
::(ii) entering the place with intent to commit an indictable offence therein,
is guilty
:(d) if the offence is committed in relation to a dwelling-house, of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life, and
:(e) if the offence is committed in relation to a place other than a dwelling-house, of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or of an offence punishable on summary conviction.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
'''Aggravating circumstance — home invasion'''&lt;br&gt;
348.1 If a person is convicted of an offence under section 98 or 98.1, subsection 279(2) or section 343, 346 or 348 in relation to a dwelling-house, the court imposing the sentence on the person shall consider as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the dwelling-house was occupied at the time of the commission of the offence and that the person, in committing the offence,
:(a) knew that or was reckless as to whether the dwelling-house was occupied; and
:(b) used violence or threats of violence to a person or property.&lt;br&gt;

|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec348 CCC]
}}

==Application==

A first-time offender of good character who is charged with Break and Enter and where the offence is of a low-end nature (e.g. single incident, low value of property, property recovered), a suspended sentence may be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Davenport [1977], 1 W.C.B. 176 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, there are multiple incidents, a custodial sentence is the usual punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, [1981] O.J. No. 140 (C.A.) -- 9 months concurrent&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Aggravating '''
* whether it was a private dwelling rather than a commercial building;
* extent of planning and sophistication
* the building was occupied at the time;
* the offender was aware or reckless to whether it was occupied;
* used violence or threats of violence to a person or property
* damage to property

The maximum penalty for Break and Enter on a dwelling house is life. The maximum penalty for Break and Enter on a premises other than a dwelling house is 10 year on indictable election and 6 months on summary election.

Certain provinces have set a benchmark for residential B&amp;E's at 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McAllister, 
[http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2008/2008nsca103/2008nsca103.html 2008 NSCA 103]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Home Invasion===
In Newfoundland, courts have suggested that a range of break and enter into dwellings is between 12 and 36 months.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Walbourne, [2012] N.J. No. 171 (P.C.), per Judge Orr &lt;/ref&gt;

;Problem 3: 
For which values of &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; does this system 
have a unique solution?

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{*{4}{rc}r}
x  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;+ &amp;z  &amp;-  &amp;w  &amp;=  &amp;2  \\
&amp;  &amp;y &amp;- &amp;2z &amp;   &amp;   &amp;=  &amp;3  \\

&amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;z  &amp;-  &amp;w  &amp;=  &amp;2
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

;Answer:

When is the determinant not zero?

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{vmatrix}
1  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1  \\
0  &amp;1  &amp;-2 &amp;0   \\
1  &amp;0  &amp;k  &amp;0   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1
\end{vmatrix}
=
\begin{vmatrix}
1  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1  \\
0  &amp;1  &amp;-2 &amp;0   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;k-1&amp;1   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1
\end{vmatrix}           
&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, 
&lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt; gives nonsingularity and hence a nonzero determinant. 
If &lt;math&gt;k\neq 1&lt;/math&gt; then 
we get echelon form with a &lt;math&gt;(-1/k-1)\rho_3+\rho_4&lt;/math&gt; pivot.

:&lt;math&gt;
=
\begin{vmatrix}
1  &amp;0  &amp;1  &amp;-1  \\
0  &amp;1  &amp;-2 &amp;0   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;k-1&amp;1   \\
0  &amp;0  &amp;0  &amp;-1-(1/k-1)
\end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying down the diagonal gives &lt;math&gt;(k-1)(-1-(1/k-1))=-(k-1)-1=-k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the matrix has a nonzero determinant, and so the system has a unique solution, if and only if &lt;math&gt; k\neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The second condition in the definition, that row swaps change the

Prove that the determinant of any triangular matrix, upper or lower,

A upper-triangular matrix is in echelon form.

A lower-triangular matrix is either singular or nonsingular. If it is singular then it has a zero on its diagonal and so its determinant (namely, zero) is indeed the product down its diagonal. If it is nonsingular then it has no zeroes on its diagonal, and can be reduced by Gauss' method to echelon form without changing the diagonal.

;Answer:

&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The properties in the definition of determinant 
show that 
&lt;math&gt; \left|M_i(k)\right|=k &lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; \left|P_{i,j}\right|=-1 &lt;/math&gt;,
and
&lt;math&gt; \left|C_{i,j}(k)\right|=1 &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; The three cases are easy to check by recalling the action
of left multiplication by each type of matrix.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt; is invertible &lt;math&gt; (TS)M=I &lt;/math&gt; then
the associative property of matrix multiplication 
&lt;math&gt; T(SM)=I &lt;/math&gt; shows that &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is invertible.
So if &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is not invertible then neither is &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; If &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is singular then apply the prior answer:

&lt;math&gt; \left|T\right|\cdot\left|S\right|=0\cdot\left|S\right|=0 &lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is not singular then it can be written as a product of
elementary matrices
&lt;math&gt;
\left|TS\right|=\left|E_r\cdots E_1S\right|=

&lt;li&gt; We must show that if

:&lt;math&gt;
T\xrightarrow[]{k\rho_i+\rho_j}\hat{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;d(T)=\left|TS\right|/\left|S\right|
=\left|\hat{T}S\right|/\left|S\right|=d(\hat{T})&lt;/math&gt;.
We will be done if we show that pivoting first and
then multiplying to get &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}S &lt;/math&gt; gives the same result as
multiplying first to get &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt; and then pivoting
(because the determinant &lt;math&gt; \left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt; is unaffected by the
pivot so we'll then have &lt;math&gt; \left|\hat{T}S\right|=\left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt;, and
hence &lt;math&gt; d(\hat{T})=d(T) &lt;/math&gt;).
That argument runs: after adding 
&lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; times row &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt; to
row &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt; j,p &lt;/math&gt; entry is
&lt;math&gt; (kt_{i,1}+t_{j,1})s_{1,p}+\dots+(kt_{i,r}+t_{j,r})s_{r,p} &lt;/math&gt;,
which is the &lt;math&gt; j,p &lt;/math&gt; entry of &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}S &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; We need only show that swapping
&lt;math&gt;
T[b]{\xrightarrow[]{\rho_i\leftrightarrow\rho_j}}\hat{T}
&lt;/math&gt;
and then multiplying to get &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}S &lt;/math&gt; gives the same result as
multiplying &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; and then swapping (because,
as the determinant &lt;math&gt; \left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt; changes sign on
the row swap, we'll then have &lt;math&gt; \left|\hat{T}S\right|=-\left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt;,
and so &lt;math&gt; d(\hat{T})=-d(T) &lt;/math&gt;).
That argument runs just like the prior one.
&lt;li&gt; Not surprisingly by now, we need only show that 
multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar
&lt;math&gt;
T[b]{\xrightarrow[]{k\rho_i}}\hat{T}
&lt;/math&gt;
and then computing &lt;math&gt; \hat{T}S &lt;/math&gt; gives the same result as
first computing &lt;math&gt; TS &lt;/math&gt; and then multiplying the row by &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;
(as the determinant &lt;math&gt; \left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt; is rescaled by &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;
the multiplication, we'll have &lt;math&gt; \left|\hat{T}S\right|=k\left|TS\right| &lt;/math&gt;,
so &lt;math&gt; d(\hat{T})=k\,d(T) &lt;/math&gt;).
The argument runs just as above.
&lt;li&gt; Clear.
&lt;li&gt; Because we've shown that &lt;math&gt; d(T) &lt;/math&gt; is a determinant
and that determinant functions (if they exist) are
unique, we have that
so &lt;math&gt; \left|T\right|=d(T)=\left|TS\right|/\left|S\right| &lt;/math&gt;.

the rank of the matrix is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; if and only if
&lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the largest
integer such that there is an &lt;math&gt; r \! \times \! r &lt;/math&gt; submatrix with a nonzero
determinant.
;Answer:

We will first argue that a rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; matrix has a &lt;math&gt; r \! \times \! r &lt;/math&gt;
submatrix with nonzero determinant.
A rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; matrix has a linearly independent set of &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; rows.
A matrix made from those rows will have row rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; and thus has
column rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;.
Conclusion: from those &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; rows can be extracted a linearly
independent set of &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; columns, and so the original matrix has a
&lt;math&gt; r \! \times \! r &lt;/math&gt; submatrix of rank &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;.

We finish by showing that if &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the largest such integer then the rank of the matrix is &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;. We need only show, by the maximality of &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;, that if a matrix has a &lt;math&gt; k \! \times \! k &lt;/math&gt; submatrix of nonzero determinant then the rank of the matrix is at least &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;. Consider such a &lt;math&gt; k \! \times \! k &lt;/math&gt; submatrix. Its rows are parts of the rows of the original matrix, clearly the set of whole rows is linearly independent. Thus the row rank of the original matrix is at least &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;, and the row rank of a matrix equals its rank.

;Answer:

''This is how the answer was given in the cited source.''

The value &lt;math&gt; (1-a^4)^3 &lt;/math&gt; of the determinant is independent of the values &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;.

The same element appears in (f) changing the name-label of a rose, (g) writing a decimal integer in the scale of &lt;math&gt; 12 &lt;/math&gt;, (h) gilding the lily, (i) whitewashing a politician, and (j) granting an honorary degree.

Embroidery is the art or handicraft of decorating fabric or other materials with needle and thread. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as metal strips, pearls, beads, quills, and sequins.

The basic stitches used in embroidery are chain stitch, buttonhole or blanket stitch, running stitch, satin stitch, and cross stitch.  These stitches have been used since ancient times and are still the foundation of hand embroidery today.

Machine embroidery immitates hand embroidery, especially in the use of chain stitches, but the &quot;satin stitch&quot; and hemming stitches of machine work rely on the use of multiple threads and resemble hand work in their appearance, not their construction.

==Stitches==

Embroidery stitches are the smallest units in embroidery. Embroidery patterns are formed by doing many embroidery stitches, either all the same or different ones, either following a counting chart on paper, following a design painted on the fabric or even working freehand.

Embroidery uses various combinations of stitches. Each embroidery stitch has a special name to help identify it. These names vary from country to country and region to region. Some embroidery books will include name variations. Taken by themselves the stitches are mostly simple to execute, however when put together the results can be extremely complex.

===Straight stitches===

Straight stitches pass through the fabric ground in a simple up and down motion, and for the most part moving in a single direction. 

[[File:Running stitch.gif|center|thumb|Running or basting stitch]]

Examples of straight stitches are:

* Running or basting stitch 
* Simple satin stitch 
* Algerian eye stitch 
* Fern stitch

Image:Raised fishbone stitch.gif|Raised fishbone stitch
Image:Flat stitch.gif|Flat stitch
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some straight stitches have two journeys (generally forwards and backwards over the same path). These include:

* Holbein stitch, also known as the double running stitch 
* Bosnian stitch

===Back stitches===

Back stitches pass through the fabric ground in an encircling motion. The needle in the simplest backstitch comes up from the back of the fabric, makes a stitch to the right going back to the back of the fabric, then passes behind the first stitch and comes up to the front of the fabric to the left of the first stitch. The needle then goes back to the back of the fabric through the same hole the stitch first came up from. The needle then repeats the movement to the left of the stitches and continues.

Some examples of a back stitch are:

* Stem stitch or outline stitch 
* Split stitch. The needle pierces the thread as it come back up. 
* Crewel stitch

===Chain stitches===

Chain stitches catch a loop of the thread on the surface of the fabric. In the simplest of the looped stitches, the chain stitch, the needle comes up from the back of the fabric and then the needle goes back into the same hole it came out of, pulling the loop of thread almost completely through to the back; but before the loop disappears, the needle come back up (a certain distance from the beginning stitch -the distance deciding the length of the stitch), passes through the loop and prevents it from being pulled completely to the back of the fabric. The needle then passes back to the back of the fabric through the second hole and begins the stitch again. Examples of chain stitches are:

* Chain stitch 
* Lazy Daisy stitch, or detached chain. The loop stitch is held to the fabric at the wide end by a tiny tacking stitch. 
* Spanish Chain or Zig-zag Chain

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Buttonhole stitches===

Buttonhole or blanket stitches also catch a loop of the thread on the surface of the fabric but the principle difference is that the needle does not return to the original hole to pass back to the back of the fabric. In the classic buttonhole stitch the needle is returned to the back of the fabric at a right angle to the original start of the thread. The finished stitch in some ways resembles a letter &quot;L&quot; depending on the spacing of the stitches. For buttonholes the stitches are tightly packed together and for blanket edges they are more spaced out. The properties of this stitch make it ideal for preventing raveling of woven fabric. This stitch is also the basis for many forms of needle lace. Examples of Buttonhole or Blanket Stitches.

* Blanket stitch 
* Buttonhole stitch 
* Closed Buttonhole stitch, the tops of the stitch touch to form triangles 
* Crossed Buttonhole stitch, the tops of the stitch cross 
* Buttonhole stitches combined with knots: 
* Top Knotted Buttonhole stitch 
* German Knotted Buttonhole stitch 
* Tailor's Buttonhole stitch

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Feather stitches===

Feather or fly stitches also catch a loop of thread on the surface of the fabric but they differ from buttonhole stitches in that the catching of the loop is not at right angles or it alternates from side to side. The result is a very naturalistic looking stitch that is often used to make leaves and branches. Examples of fly stitches are:

* Fly stitch, or Y stitch 
* Feather stitch 
* Faggoting stitch, or Straight Open Cretan 
* Cretan Stitch

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cross stitches===

Cross stitches or cross-stitch have come to represent an entire industry of pattern production and material supply for the craft person. The stitch is done by creating a line of diagonal stitches going in one direction, usually using the warp and weft of the fabric as a guide, then on the return journey crossing the diagonal in the other direction, creating an &quot;x&quot;. Also included in this class of stitches are:

* Herringbone stitches, including the hem stitch 
* Breton stitch, here the threads of the &quot;x&quot; are twisted together 
* Sprat's Head stitch 
* Crow's Foot stitch, these last two stitches are often used in tailoring to strengthen a garment at a point of strain such as a pocket corner or the top of a kick pleat.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Knotted stitches===

Knotted stitches are formed by wrapping the thread around the needle, once or several times, before passing it back to the back of the fabric ground. This is a predominate stitch in Brazilian embroidery, used to create flowers. Another form of embroidery that uses knots is Candlewicking, where the knots are created by forming a figure 8 around the needle. Examples of knotted stitches are:

* French knot, or twisted knot stitch 
* Chinese knot, which varies from the French knot in that it takes a tiny stitch in the background fabric while creating the knot 
* Bullion knots 
* Coral stitch 
* Four-legged knot stitch 
* Turk's head knot 

There are also more complex knotted stitches such as: 
* Double-knot stitch
* Knotted Loop stitch 
* Plaited Braid stitch 
* Sorbello stitch 
* Diamond stitch 

Knotted edgings based on buttonhole stitches include: 
* Antwerp edging stitch 
* Armenian edging stitch

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Couching and laid work===

Couching or laid stitches involve two sets of threads, the set that is being 'laid' onto the surface of the fabric and the set which attach the laid threads. The laid threads may be heavier than the attaching thread, or they may be of a nature that does not allow them to be worked like a regular embroidery thread, such as metal threads. The stitches used to attach the laid thread may be of any nature; cross stitch, buttonhole stitch, straight stitch; but some have specific names:

* Pendant couching 
* Bokhara couching 
* Square laid work 
* Oriental couching 
* Battlement couching 
* Klosterstitch 
* Roumanian couching

==Technique==
Basically, there are two ways to do embroidery efficiently and orderly. What works better depends on the stitches and materials used, and on personal preference.

===Hand-sewing method===
The needle is brought to the upside of the fabric. For doing the stitch properly, it is inserted into the fabric and brought back to the surface in one movement. Then the thread is pulled through. The same method is used for plain hand sewing.

A thimble is usually used on the middle finger to avoid minor injury. Once the needle is inserted into the fabric, the hooded middle finger is used to push it through; the thumb and index finger grab the needle at the front as soon as possible and pull at the same time. This can speed up working when the embroiderer is used to it.

This method can be done using an embroidery frame or free-hand, but usually an embroidery frame or hoop is used to make work easier. The technique uses frames that allow for adjustment of fabric tension, as the fabric can't be too strongly stretched. in order to allow inserting the needle without pulling the fabric too much.

===Stab method or Maggam work===

This method is popular in India.

The needle is inserted into the fabric at a 90 degree angle, then the thread is pulled through. Then, the needle is again inserted, this time from the underside to the surface; again, the thread is pulled through.

A thimble is not usually required to avoid injury with this method, but is sometimes used to make pushing the needle through easier.

A frame or hoop is used. A mounted hoop or frame makes the work faster, such that both hands are free for the embroidery. The dominant hand is held under the fabric, the non-dominant hand above it, and the needle is handled by each respective hand without necessity for hand position changes.

If you think too much about how novels are written they may lose some of their magic.
As a frequent reader of novels you might want to stop reading this guide here.
A reviewer should find this guide helpful but the primary target audience are beginning authors or authors who want to reconsider the design phase of their novels.
The book also tries to offer criteria for evaluation.

      <comment>Add best way to type Vietnamese as people in Vietnam</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To type the consonants, you can use a standard keyboard. It is possible to type the accents on the vowels in Microsoft Office Word 2007; however, it is time-consuming. The accents can be typed by using the symbol function.

Step 1: Type the vowel that needs the accent. Make certain that the cursor is behind the vowel that needs the accent.

Step 2: Click on the Insert tab on the tool bar.

Step 3: Click on the Symbol button on the right-hand side. It looks like an upside-down horseshoe.

Step 4: The symbol dialogue box will appear. It will have two tabs. They will say Symbols and Special Characters.

Step 5: On the Symbols page there is a drop down menu under font. Select VNI-Times.

Step 6: Choose the correct accent and click the insert button at the bottom of the box. The accent will appear over the vowel in the text.

If you want to type Vietnamese easily, You can download the Vietnamese-type software. The best one is Unikey. Almost people in Vietnamese use this software to type Vietnamese.
You can download here : http://www.unikey.org/
 And you can choose Unicode font, so you must not install any font to type Vietnamese correctly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Overview/Statisical Background'''==

This chapter looks at sustainable development and environmental degradation in the countries of Austria and the Czech Republic.  The sources for this chapter include government reports, government databases, personal experiences from ten days of travel within the region, news articles, information provided by non-governmental organizations (NGO's), and international inter-governmental organizations (IGO's).  Some of the various topics that will be explored relating to Austria and the Czech Republic will be land development, transportation, energy usage, industrial development, water quality and the importance of the Danube River.  Also how a planned system of growth has provided a high quality of life rating for cities like Vienna, Austria. 
 
One of the key factors while looking at sustainable development and environmental degradation within any country is the size of the population and the size of the country in square kilometers in relation to how quickly the annual population growth rate is expanding.  This mathematical formula contributes greatly to the understanding of the urgency of sustainable development and its ultimate success or failure. It is important to understand the global implications of a world population which as of June 24, 2010, according to the US Census Bureau was estimated at 6,829,330,046.  With a global population soon to exceed the 7 billion mark, it is crucial that we develop strategies that are effective in creating an environment where humans can flourish and the planet's resources are not destroyed.  By studying Austria and the Czech Republic and their actions or lack of action, we can learn from some of their initiatives in trying to create a more sustainable way of life globablly.

The Czech Republic has an estimated population of 10.3 million people within its 78,864 square kilometer borders (roughly the size of the State of Virginia in the US) and has an annual population growth rate of just 0.1%, according to the US Department of State.  The largest city in the Czech Republic is Prague, its capital city with a population of approximately 1.21 million people.  Austria, by comparison, is slightly larger in terms of size in square kilometers; however, has a lower population of 8,332,000, and a higher annual population growth rate of 0.4%.  Austria's largest city is Vienna, the capital city with a population of 1.68 million people, according to the US Department of State.  Both countries have a fairly modest population growth rate, which combined with a heightened public awareness of sustainable development, provides a much brighter future for the region than the rapid urbanization that is taking place in many still developing countries. 

=='''Land Usage/Development'''==


The other part of the sustainable development formula besides population growth is land usage.  The Czech Republic launched the National Strategic Rural Development Plan in 2007 with its goals being to stabilize rural populations and improve quality of life in rural towns.  73.6% of the total area of the Czech Republic falls under the category of rural land, while about one quarter of the population reside in these areas.  The Czech Government realizing one of the greatest risks to rural development is the loss of young people who tend to migrate toward urban areas where jobs have traditionally been available has funded programs to open opportunities for young people in rural areas.  In terms of agricultrual land development, about half the country is utilized for this purpose with the size of agricultrual land decreasing every year.  Forested lands surprisingly are on the increase in the Czech Republic with approximately one third falling under this land use category.

Industrial development in the Czech Republic has soared since the &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot; of 1989 and the freedom that followed many years of communist planned economies.  At one point in the Czech Republics free market embrace it was the fastest growing economy in Europe and one of the worlds most dynamic economies only lagging behind China and South Korea in terms of expansion.  This became somewhat of a double edged sword with growth on one side and all of the social and evironmental issues on the other.  It seems as though rapid expansion and all of the issues that go along with being a magnet country in Europe have lessened to a degree as the worlds economies have slowed.

In urban areas of the Czech Republic and Austria, one of the things that struck me, while in the region, was how well a balance has been found between development and preservation of cultural heritage.  Both countries capital cities of Prague and Vienna enjoy listings as world heritage sites in their historical city centers.  Recognition by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) considers these sites as having a universal value that transcends borders.  It has been a fine line between development and preservation that Austria and the Czech Republic have found in their city centers, adding to the draw of many international visitors.  Many of the historical features of the city centers have been preserved while adding into the modern fabric of these cities infrastructure for transportation, communication, and energy delivery.  City planning has been a tradition for many years in both countries, with an excellent example in Austria being the historic &quot;Ringstrasse&quot;, which began implementation in 1858.  These cultural heritage sites represent many forms of architectural design, including Gothic, Romanesque, Baroque, Neo-Classical, and Art Nouveau almost all well preserved.

Another great example of well planned sustainability in Vienna is how well green areas are worked into the cities design.  The &quot;Weinerwald&quot; or the Vienna Woods is a huge track of open space preserved for outdoor recreations, measuring 1,250 square kilometers.  This green area within the city consists of forest, vineyards, hiking trails, and bike paths.  The &quot;Prater&quot; is another type of park worked into Vienna's cultural fabric and is an easy retreat with many family attractions, including arcades, a giant ferris wheel, and &quot;beirgartens&quot;.  The &quot;Volksgarten&quot; or &quot;peoples garden&quot; is a third type of park within Vienna, much smaller in size but set aside for residents and visitors to relax among thousands of rose bushes.  On a typical day you might find people reading a book, relaxing, or just enjoying an opportunity to get away from typical city life for a moment.  One interesting green initiative was launched in 2006 called the Austrian National Cycling Strategy, which seeks to increase the use of bicycles as a means of transportation in Austria from 5% to 10% by the year 2015.

=='''Transportation'''==

The Czech Republic on December 8, 2004 implemented the Sustainable Development Strategy.  One of the key objectives focused on transportation of people and products.  The objectives laid out in this Government Resolution 1242 were: &quot; create conditions for ensuring a quality transport with focus on its economic, social and evironmental impacts within the framework of sustainable development principles, and lay realistic foundations to initiate changes in proportions among individual transport modes.&quot;  The Resolution called for improving railway systems through technological upgrades mainly by modernizing existing systems, improving and promoting water transportation corridors, as well as several initiatives to reduce harmful emissions.  Besides the bycycle transport initiative the Czech Government introduced a tax system that penalizes fuels that lead to pollution and promote clean energy usage that benefits the environment. 

Transportation planning in Vienna and Prague is based upon the principle that if clean, efficient, and well organized systems of Trams, buses, and subways are offered as an alternative to private vehicles there will be a long term sustainable benefit.  One of the many promoting factors of using public transportation in Vienna and Prague is that one ticket allows access to buses, subways, and trolleys.  In Vienna for example, which has one of the most efficient transportation systems in the world 35% of city trips are taken through public transportation versus 32% by automobile.  Austria has increased public transportation usage outside of city centers as well with higher percentage growth in the use of rail and bus lines for holiday travel.

The Austrian Transport Master Plan focused on more sustainable practices and called for spending of 45.000 million euros with a 2/3 share dedicated to railway infrastructure while 1/3 share set aside for traditional road work.  Austria similarly to The Czech Republic has instituted a tax structure that rewards green initiatives and penalizes CO2 emission polluters.  One interesting initiative samples air quality from monitored stations and when levels of emissions are high the speed limit for autos can be lowered to reduce output of CO2 gases.  Public awareness of green issues are supported by a National Car Free Day which has become one of the most successful public awareness campaigns in Austria.

=='''Energy Usage'''==

Interconnected with the issue of transportation is the topic of energy usage in a sustainable economy.  The Czech Republic has pushed for a complete overhaul of its energy sector while overcoming two unique hurdles to its economy.  First, the country moved from a communist regime that planned all aspects of its economy, to a free market economy all in the last twenty years.  The Czech Republic has also had to overcome its separation from Slovakia in the early 1990's.  The Government has put forward its three E's of its energy future 1) Energy security 2) Economic growth 3)Environmental sutainability.  The Czech Republic currently draws half of its energy needs from domestic sources of which coal provides the largest share at 40% of domestic output.  The second largest sector is natural gas at 22% with nuclear power providing 17% with a new reactor ''Temlin'' having been brought online in 2003.  The Czech Republic is now able to export electricity through its nuclear facilities and shows a promising trend for its economic growth.  Part of the energy sectors transformation has been to close some out dated coal fired power plants and replace them with more modern and cleaner facilities.  The Czech energy transformation has been further spurred on by participation in The European Union and has set goals for reform in line with EU standards.  Currently, the goal for 2010 is to achieve 8% of Czech energy requirements from renewable sources.

Austria has stressed &quot;eco-friendly&quot; initiatives for many years however recently a European Commission study released information that Austria is one of the least effective countries in reducing green house gas emissions.  The study detailed that Austria was unable to reduce its CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2008, it actually increased emissions by 9.6%.  Only Spain and Luxemborg were bigger polluters percentage wise, in the EU then Austria and according to the Kyoto Agreement were supposed to reduce emissions by 13%.  Green jobs in Austria are a popular issue with The Government investing 760 million Euros in a sustainable future.  Austria has set a much higher bar than the Czech Republic in terms of renwable energy with goals of 34% by the year 2020.  &quot;Eco-taxes&quot; are slated to be the engine in the push for sustainable and renewable energy sources. 

=='''Water Quality/The Importance Of The Danube River'''==

The Danube River is Europes lifeline with 83 million people in ten countries enjoying its benefits.  The European Commission &quot;recognizes the Danube as the single most important non-oceanic body of water in Europe.&quot;  Many of Europes most ecologically important areas rely on the Danube.  In Austria, the Danube provides a source of clean drinking water, a clean source of water to irragate crops, an alternative transportation system, a habitat for dynamic bio-diversity, and an area for many types of recreation.  In the last thirty years special emphisis has been placed on conservation of the Danube.  Many of the past conservation problems were created by the construction of dams and shipping channels which have cut off drainage routes and creating major problems with flooding in cities like Vienna.  

The Danube was once known as the &quot;Blue Danube&quot; however much of its length has now been turned brown because of poor engineering, deforestation, and farm pollutants.  The main contributors to Danube pollution are 50% farm related, 25% industrial waste, and 25% human related waste.  In Vienna as the Danube cuts through the city it is easy easy to spot some of the threats to Europes most vital lifeline.  From a vantage point in the cities hills four sections of the Danube are discernable, the canal section, the old Danube section, the new Danube section, and the lake section which is completely cut off from its natural flow.  Only the lake section retains its famous blue color, nevertheless many Viennese rely on the wealth of benefits provided by the Danube.

=='''Quality Of Life'''==

In a recently completed survey by Mercer (based in London,UK) of 221 world cities and their respective quality of life, found Vienna, Austria as the number one city to live.  Among the many considerations factored into Vienna's top ranking were issues related to transportation, housing, air pollution, public utilities, cultural venues, drinking water, and economic conditions.  Prague ranked a respectable 70th or in the top 1/3 of world cities.  Many of the issues related to sustainable development and environmental degradation contributed to the positive results for Austria's and the Czech Republic's capital cities.    

=='''Conclusion'''==

In conclusion, many of the key issues of sustainable development are interconnected and help to reinforce each other.  For example, in Vienna by improving transportation systems, energy usage declines, air quality is improved, urban sprawl is reduced, traffic congestion is eased, and the overall quality of life is vastly improved for residents and visitors alike.  Policies and awareness campaigns are most successful when a multi-faceted approach is taken towards sustainable development.  The return on investment in a sustainable way of life ensures that for many generations to come the same high qualitity of life is possible beyond Vienna and Prague.

Dear people who know more about Wikibooks categories than I do:  If you want to use both the Dewey Decimal and LC classification systems, wouldn't it be a good idea to include as categories the terms used [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Dewey_and_Library_of_Congress_subject_classification here], such as Manufacturing and Commerce?  Thank you. [[Special:Contributions/71.198.176.22|71.198.176.22]] ([[User talk:71.198.176.22|talk]]) 02:23, 1 June 2010 (UTC)
:Frankly the DDC and LOC systems don't have much applicability to an electronic medium; we have no need to worry about shelving books back in the exact same spot on a physical bookshelf.  I'd rather do without them entirely, but I can't get enough input from others to go ahead and remove them. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:45, 1 June 2010 (UTC)
::I think controlled vocabulary identifiers are useful.  I use [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced PubMed] a lot because that's where all the secondary peer reviewed medical literature can easily be found, and I like their thesaurus-based expansion of terms which is made possible by controlled vocabulary identifiers in MeSH. Thomson-Reuters' &quot;Web of Science&quot; (formerly ISI's Science Citation Index) also uses controlled vocabulary identifiers along with uncontrolled user- and indexer-supplied descriptor terms.  Once people start calling it an ontology, sometimes people will get more interested. [[Special:Contributions/71.198.176.22|71.198.176.22]] ([[User talk:71.198.176.22|talk]]) 21:09, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Goats make great pets. They are loving and sweet. If they are bottle fed, which you should not do unless you have to, they become dog like. Bottle goats like to go on walks and be petted. Do not bottle-feed unless you have to. Goats can get something called bloat if overfed, and it can kill a goat in less than 24 hours. Another problem goats can get from being overfed is scours, or diarrhea. Scours can kill goats in less than 24 hours. If your goat has scours make sure to give it lots of fluids, goats with scours get dehydrated fast and can die from dehydration. If your goat has bloat or scours, call the vet immediately. Goats eat hay, sweet feed, and goat food. You can graze goats, but make sure they don't eat too much grass. Goats are very curious and smart. They are loving and gentle. If you don't have a goat, you don't know what you're missing! Your goat can be your best friend! Goats are truly the dogs of the livestock world.

* Automatic goat waterers?
** Duramate is a good water or you could just have a timer that turns on a small hose to fill a bucket for them
* Automatic feeders? 
** QuickFeed is a good automatic feeder but expensive
* Goat feed: quantity/week? price? where to buy?  how heavy are the bags?
** wethers need about cup of feed, does need the same amount if they are not pregnant, increase there feed by 1/2 cup for the first 6 mouths of pregnancy and another 1/2 cup for the last month   
** The type of feed you buy at the local feed store can be pellets, grain, sweet feed
* Goat &quot;minerals&quot;?  Same questions as above, plus: what's in it? 
** salt, copper, iron and other unavailable minerals that they need
* Do we need to buy hay/straw?  How much?  Price?  Where to buy? 
** you should if they don't have access to a land for browsing, about one bail and it costs about $10-$40
* What are goat &quot;worms&quot;?  How likely to get it? How bad is it?
** they are like tapeworms and can hurt the goat overtime so see the vet to deworm them and it's cheap
* How much does a hoof trimming cost?  Is there a 4-H group that will help me learn it?
** Probably, it costs nothing to a vet visit and they could teach you
* What will a goat area look like?  Find example videos/photos. 
** It should have grasses, bushes, leaves and lots of vegetation and if its small the grass won't grow in places 
* How to build a welded-wire fence?  How to add a gate? 
** Get some stakes in the ground around the area for the goat and make sure they are pretty close to give more support. Just add hinges or ask someone at homedepo
* How much do we have to worry about predators?  Find info about fencing to protect against bobcats, coyotes, etc.
** If the fence is good enough to keep them in then the predators should not be able to get in
* How to build/buy goat shelter?  Specific links.
** It should be about 20 square feet per pair, draft free, and have their loose minerals, extra hay and feed incase of rain
* How does one transport a pet goat?
* Is milking optional, or a mandatory chore?

==Introduction==
The Ocarina Method Book, or TOMB is a wikibook for learning and practicing the Ocarina.  It is our hope that with this book (when it is finished), any dedicated ocarina enthusiast can go from absolute beginner to being a skilled ocarinist.  TOMB is a detailed exercise book with practice lessons that will help you develop your skills on the ocarina.

You might be here for the wrong reasons and to save us all some trouble, we'll try to redirect you.  
*TOMB is not a guide to buying ocarinas.  The online ocarina community has a substantial presence and most questions about buying new ocarinas are or can be answered on their forums.  Two western forums which are not affiliated with any ocarina brands are [http://octalk.net/forum OCtalk] and [http://theocarinanetwork.com The Ocarina Network].
*TOMB is not an encyclopedia entry about ocarinas.  This can be found at [[w:Ocarina|Ocarina]].  
*TOMB is not a collection of sheet music, tabs or songs.  Again, such things can be found at those forums, among other places.

== Chapters of this Book ==
:[[The Ocarina Method Book/Fingering Charts|Fingering Charts]].  Charts and advice on playing various types of ocarinas.
:[[The Ocarina Method Book/Introduction to sheet music|Introduction to sheet music]].  A little about sheet music to get started on the [[The Ocarina Method Book/Exercises|Exercises]].
:[[The Ocarina Method Book/Exercises|Exercises]].  Lessons and practice.  Beginner lessons are tabbed, but a goal of this Chapter is to teach the nuances of sheet music.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The book's purpose and style (please edit this, even though I wrote it like a letter) ==
OK hi.  The basic intention of this wikibook is to make a more practical version of the Mezzetti method books available at [http://www.giorgiopacchioni.com/biblioteca.html].  He states on his site that things are creative commons (no derivatives, share alike), but to my knowledge, these method books are in the public domain.  Anyone contributing significantly to the curriculum of the wikibook should at least browse the mezzetti material if not actually do some of the lessons.

'''Our audience:'''

Ocarinists seem to be all over the map but I think the book should be conscious of the following three groups.

*young zelda/anime fans.  These people will want to practice on some video game music, maybe see some drawings that appeal to them etc.  Some video game pieces are very simple (and some is not) and it would be nice if the wikibook supplied some backtracks and a fast way to satisfy them with the ability to play a song.  Then, the wikibook should convince them to practice further and polish their skills with more advanced music.

*people with a more general interest in playing music and will play ocarina as their first (or nearly) instrument.  again, it will be important to try to get them playing a familiar song early on. They will want something more popular than anime music.

*musicians.  I expect this group to be less concerned with learning a song right away and more inclined to do fingering drills.

'''The following things about the mezzetti books should be considered'''
*the mezzetti books launch the student a bit sharply into playing sheet music without enough advice.

*the wikibook needs to have an introduction to some common styles of ocarina (4,6,8,10,12 hole, fingering styles etc).

*the wikibook should be more neatly divided into reasonable lessons, giving the student the satisfaction of finishing one and moving to the next.

*the wikibook can make use of audio, video and midi.  for example we can have midi backtracks for end-of-section projects.

==On the current todo list:==

# register and post here about how you can contribute
# figure the rest out later!
# add art work and music to make the book more attractive to young and old ocarina players
# transcribe mezzetti material into the exercise section
# recruit other editors

== Table of contents of TOMB ==
These are the sections I think we should start with
*[[The Ocarina Method Book/Fingering Charts|Fingering Charts]]
** different kinds? '''We need contributors for this'''
*[[The Ocarina Method Book/Introduction to sheet music|Introduction to sheet music]]
** redirect to another book for the moment?
*[[The Ocarina Method Book/Exercises|Exercises]]
**This is where the bulk of our work will be for the moment

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Diffusion|Next=Particle model}}

Apart from diffusion, there is another interesting phenomenon that can be observed. It is called the Brownian motion, discovered by a scientist called Brown.

== Smoke cells and Brownian motion ==
Before we start on Brownian motion, let's look at an interesting experiment. A smoke cell is a small box full of smoke and air. If you have one (or your teacher gives you one), place it under a microscope. Otherwise, there is a short clip [http://www.practicalphysics.org/fileLibrary/wmv/brownian_motion.wmv here]. As you can see, the bits of smoke move at random directions, unassisted. Or do they?

Smoke particles are larger than air particles. That's why we can see the smoke particles better than the air particles. As you will learn later, gas particles always move at high speed, in random directions. The same things is happening to the air particles. When an air particle bombards a smoke particles, the smoke particle moves to the same direction as the air particle that hit it. When another air particle hits the smoke particle, it changes its direction to that of the second air particle, and so on. This is called Brownian motion.

&lt;gallery&gt;

== The story of pollen grains ==
[[File:Robert brown botaniker.jpg|thumb|150px|A portrait of Robert Brown]]
The Brownian motion was discovered by, and named after, a botanist called Robert Brown. A botanist is a person who studies plants. In 1827, he was observing some pollen grains when he saw that the pollen grains were moving mysteriously. Do you know why the pollen grains were moving like that? The movement of the water particles causes that of the pollen grains, enabling them to move in random, constantly changing directions. This is what Robert Brown later figured out.

== Quiz ==
# Brownian motion is named after:
## Charlie Brown

## The air particles flow to places of lower concentration
## The smoke particles dodge the air particles, thereby causing the smoke particles to rotate
## The air particles hit the smoke particles, thereby causing them to move in random directions

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:19, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for your methods.  I'm trying to recruit authors in the ocarina community.  Until I get some help from some musicians, this will be a vapourbook.  Do you think I should write some of it on my talk page before making it a book? [[User:Alejandro Erickson|Alejandro Erickson]] ([[User talk:Alejandro Erickson|talk]]) 17:31, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

:You should start by contributing some content and structuring it (create the TOC and establish the scope, what will the book cover and what will it teach to readers). If you chose to do it on you userspace you will have to authorize contributions (it not seen as acceptable to edit pages on the userspace outside of the main talk without a direct instruction to do so), this will permit greater control on what you do but will reduce collaboration or and probably even interest in collaborating on those resources.
:I've noticed your attempt to establish a structure for the book on the project talk pages, there is nothing wrong with that but be extremely aware not to impose your views on others and be open for having your expectations challenged, also remember that most people will shy away from engaging in discussions. If you need to establish a more fixed framework for participation on the project, establish some book conventions (see [[C++ Programming/Conventions]]), by making proposals and adopting them as a specific framework for the book's evolution. Sometimes this is required to permit some stability and order to the creative process, but for the low content you still have on the project it may be premature.
:Mine other resources, use free content from Wikipedia and other compatible sources, remembering to ask for transclusions of the articles. You can even tag Wikipedia articles to link to the book as soon as it begins to take shape. It all depends on the level of participation you are after, make an announcement on the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], and in other books that share some commonalities, etc. (Check out the [[Wikiversity]] project also).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:02, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

PS: If the book is in the public domain and has been published ( &quot;Mezzetti curriculum&quot; ) check out the Wikisource project and ask for help importing it first there before duplicating the effort here (or change what you do import from that work). This will also enable you to reference the source on the project you are creating.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:13, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

Ok yeah, I was wondering how to get the book onto a wiki-affiliated site.  I'll look into this so that contributors don't have to chase 
it down at pacchioni's website.  As for duplicating efforts, I'm not sure what you mean.  I'm promoting the Mezzetti book as a general guideline, but I would like contributors to make more modern exercises (especially musical pieces). [[User:Alejandro Erickson|Alejandro Erickson]] ([[User talk:Alejandro Erickson|talk]]) 06:55, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:Having the book stored at Wikisource will reduce the need to duplicate it (you can reference it there) or duplicate parts of it here and alter them. For what I understood you don't want to evolve the source material but are especially interested in shaping the exercises. I also noted that the Mezzetti book only covers that particular type of ocarina and you are aiming to go beyond that limitation.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:16, 3 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Brownian motion|Next=Three states of matter}}

Before we begin on particle models, let us recall a few points from the previous chapters.
* Matter is made of particles.
* Particles are always moving.
* Particles usually move from a place of higher concentration to a place of lower concentration.
Here is one more point that we have not discussed before, but is equally important:
{| class = wikitable width = &quot;820&quot;
| &lt;center&gt;[[File:Star*.svg|25px]]&lt;big&gt;'''Heat makes particles move more vigorously.'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}

Now that these points are learnt, there are a lot of things we can explain with the particle model. But what exactly is a particle model? A particle model is basically a model which shows particles in action. You cannot find them in real life as they cannot be seen with microscopes. They can be 3-D models or 2-D ones. They can be used to explain a lot of things, such as the three states of matter, density, and thermal expansion and contraction.

== [[../Three states of matter|The three basic states of matter]] ==
[[File:States of matter En.svg|thumb|Why do they look like that?]]
Do you still remember that we learnt about the three basic states of matter earlier? We can explain the three states of matter with the particle model. You will find out why matter is compressible, and why its shape is more stable as a solid.

== [[../Gas pressure|Gas pressure]] ==
Gas is compressible; however, when compressed, the gas pressure will be different. This chapter will be all about gas and air pressure. Make sure you have read the previous chapter before proceeding to this one.

== [[../Float or sink?|Density]] ==
Density is how much of matter there is in a fixed volume. Reading this chapter does not require much previous knowledge aside from those discussed in the 'Matter' and 'Particle theory' chapters.

== [[../Expand or contract?|Thermal expansion and contraction]] ==
As you know, hotter things grow and smaller things shrink. These are called thermal expansion and contraction. But why exactly do they happen? Can they be applied in daily life?

== Quiz ==
Which of the following can be easily explained by the particle model, in your opinion?
# The water cycle
# Photosynthesis (the process in which plants make food)
# Comparison of density before and after dissolving
# Magnetic fields
# The movement of particles under different temperatures
# The respiratory system (the system by which you breathe)

Answer:&lt;br/&gt;
3 and 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
An appeal is an application to review a matter that has been decided by a Court. The appeal is directed to the &quot;higher&quot; level of court above the level of the deciding court.

The venue for the appeal depends on the venue of the original proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;s. 813&lt;/ref&gt; Matters that are elected indictably are appealed to the Court of Appeal while matters that are summary conviction offences are appealed to the Supreme Court of the province.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Edmunds, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1f5 1981 CanLII 173] (SCC), [1981] 1 SCR 233&lt;/ref&gt;  

If the accused is prosecuted indictably but convicted of a lesser summary offence, the appeal is to proceed as if by indictment.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Yaworski (1959), 31 C.R. 55 (Man. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal will assume that the election is summary unless indicated.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ashoona (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (N.W.T. S.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Gal (1985), 60 A.R. 333 (Alta. Q.B.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing a trial judge's decision, the decision should not be looked at in a piecemeal manner, but rather should be considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nichols [http://canlii.ca/t/1ffww 2001 CanLII 5680] (ON CA), (2001), 148 OAC 344, 46 CR (5th) 294&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Trial judges are presumed to know the elementary principles of law.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Burns, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frvk 1994 CanLII 127] (SCC), [1994] 1 SCR 656, 89 CCC (3d) 193&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Appeal by Offence==
The manner of appeal depends on what type of offence was charged, whether it is a summary conviction offence or an indictable offence:
* [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Appeals/Indictable Offences]]
* [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Appeals/Summary Offences]]

==Standard of Review==
* [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Appeals/Standard of Review]]

== Jury Instruction ==
An appellate court should assess a jury charge functionally. It is not an idealized approach considering whether better instructions could have been given.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jacquard (C.O.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr4h 1997 CanLII 374] (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314 at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cooper, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs5v 1993 CanLII 147] (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146 at pp. 163-164&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviewing judge should determine whether the accused, based on the review of the whole charge, has had a fair trial. It is not to look for minute errors. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Korski (C.T.), [http://canlii.ca/t/236fj 2009 MBCA 37], 236 Man.R. (2d) 259, at para. 102&lt;br&gt;
Cooper at p. 163&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Luciano, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fhtn 2011 ONCA 89] at para 71&lt;br&gt;
Vézeau v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mx4z 1976 CanLII 7], [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277 at p. 285&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kociuk (R.J.), [http://canlii.ca/t/fnl3w 2011 MBCA 85] at para 69 to 72 &lt;br&gt;
Jacquard&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court should consider whether the instructions had the ability to fulfil their purpose and not simply whether they diverted from a formula.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. MacKinnon [http://canlii.ca/t/1f971 1999 CanLII 1723] (ON CA), (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 27&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

All defences that have an air of reality are to be put to the jury, even if not raised by counsel. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cinous, [http://canlii.ca/t/51tb 2002 SCC 29], [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedial Powers of the Court of Appeal==
Part XVIII of the Criminal Code addresses the power and procedure for appeals. Appeals of indictable offences are appealed to the provincial Court of Appeal. 

The Crown can generally appeal where there is an error in law. The Crown has a limited appeal on the basis of questions of fact. This includes appeals for unreasonable verdict.&lt;Ref&gt;  R. v. Kendall, [2005] O.J. No. 2457 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 46&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Crown cannot appeal on issues of credibility unless it amount to an error in law.

The Defence can appeal both issues of fact and law.([http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec675 ss. 675 and 676])

==Grounds for Interfering with Verdicts (The Curative Proviso)==
The powers of the Court of Appeal to interfere with a verdict on a appeal are stated under s.686:
{{Quotation|
686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal
:(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that
::(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,
::(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or
::(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;
:(b) may dismiss the appeal where
::(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted on another count or part of the indictment,
::(ii) the appeal is not decided in favour of the appellant on any ground mentioned in paragraph (a),
::(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, or
::(iv) notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial court had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby;
:(c) may refuse to allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that the trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion respecting the effect of a special verdict, may order the conclusion to be recorded that appears to the court to be required by the verdict and may pass a sentence that is warranted in law in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court; or
:(d) may set aside a conviction and find the appellant unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder and may exercise any of the powers of the trial court conferred by or referred to in section 672.45 in any manner deemed appropriate to the court of appeal in the circumstances.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 686; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), ss. 145, 203; 1991, c. 43, s. 9; 1997, c. 18, s. 98; 1999, c. 3, s. 52, c. 5, s. 26.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec686 CCC]
}}

Where a defence appeal is allowed the court may either order a new trial or enter a verdict of acquittal. (s.686(2))

The court has discretion to enter a verdict of acquittal where:
* the accused has already served part or all of a fit sentence
* where there is still sufficient evidence to support a conviction
* where it would be unfair to the accused to have another trial

{{Reflist|2}}

===Unreasonable Verdicts===
Under s. 686(1)(a)(i), the defence may appeal a conviction where there was an &quot;unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence&quot;.

A verdict that is unreasonable must be one where the judge &quot;revealed he or she was not alive to an applicable legal principle, or entered a verdict inconsistent with the factual conclusions reached.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Binaris, [http://canlii.ca/t/5260 2000 SCC 15], [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 at 37&lt;/ref&gt;

An error of the trial judge in finding an acquittal, once found, can only result in a new trial being ordered where the error had “a material bearing on the acquittal”&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Graveline, [http://canlii.ca/t/1n3bs 2006 SCC 16] at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellate court may find a verdict is unreasonable where the trial judge has drawn an inference or made a finding of fact essential to the verdict that:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. R.P., [http://canlii.ca/t/fr8qc 2012 SCC 22] at para. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
# is plainly contradicted by the evidence relied on by the trial judge in support of that inference or finding, or 
# is shown to be incompatible with evidence that has not otherwise been contradicted or rejected by the trial judge 

The applicable test for unreasonable verdict &quot;requires the appeal court to determine what verdict a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could judicially have arrived at, and, in doing so, to review, analyze, and within the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Biniaris at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Or to put it another way: &quot;whether on the whole of the evidence the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Yebes, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftlc 1987 CanLII 17] (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. R.P., 2012 SCC 22 (CanLII), 2012 SCC 22, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 746
&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge's decision should not be analysed by &quot;dissecting them into small pieces and examining each piece in isolation&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Morrissey, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jtj 1995 CanLII 3498] (ON CA), [1995] O.J. No. 639 (C.A.)at para 28 (&quot;[I]t is wrong to analyze a trial judge's reasons by dissecting them into small pieces and examining each piece in isolation as if it described, or was intended to describe, a legal principle applied by the trial judge. Reasons for judgment must be read as a whole.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons should be read as a whole, and not held to a standard of perfection nor should it be the equivalent of jury instructions.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rhyason, 2007 SCC 39 (CanLII), [2007] 3 S.C.R. 108 at para. 10&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869 at para. 55&lt;br&gt; 
see also, R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17 (CanLII), [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, at para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

It is inappropriate to &quot;simply plucking colloquial elements&quot; from a trial judge's &quot;thorough reasons&quot; or to &quot;cherry pick&quot; infelicitous phrases.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Davis, 1999 CanLII 638 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 759 ( inappropriateness of “simply plucking colloquial elements [from a] trial judge's thorough reasons” )&lt;/ref&gt;

A mere misstatement at &quot;one point should not vitiate his ruling if the preponderance of what was said shows that the proper test was applied and if the decision can be justified on the evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. B. (C.R.), 1990 CanLII 142 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 737&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts are given great deference when considering whether findings are supported by the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. W. (R.), 1992 CanLII 56 (S.C.C.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, and R. v. Burke, 1996 CanLII 229 (S.C.C.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474)&lt;/ref&gt;

R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15 outlined the principles to be applied:
#A court of appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury but in applying the Yebes test is entitled to review, analyze and, within the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence.
#The test applies equally to a jury and a judge sitting alone.  In the latter case, the review may be easier because the appellate court will be able to examine the reasons provided by the judge, which may reveal a flaw in the evaluation of the evidence.  Such a deficiency in analysis may appear where a judge was not alive to an applicable legal principle or entered a verdict inconsistent with the factual conclusions reached.    
#A reviewing court must articulate the basis upon which it finds that the conclusions reached by a jury were unreasonable.  A lurking doubt or vague unease based on the court’s review is not sufficient justification for a finding of unreasonableness but may trigger increased appellate scrutiny.
#A jury does not provide reasons for its verdict.  To justify a finding of unreasonableness regarding the verdict of a properly instructed jury, the appeal court will not be able to point to express deficiencies in analysis.  It must fall back upon and articulate inferences drawn from a review of the evidence to support its conclusion that the jury, in arriving at its guilty verdict, could not have been acting judicially.
#Jury instructions attempt to convey accumulated judicial experience to the jury.  Still, in certain rare cases, the totality of the evidence and the peculiar factual circumstances will lead an experienced, legally trained, jurist to conclude that the fact-finding exercise applied at trial must have been flawed in light of the unreasonable results it produced.
#Acting judicially, in this context, means not only acting dispassionately in applying the law and adjudicating on the basis of the law and nothing else.  It means, in addition, arriving at a conclusion that does not conflict with the bulk of judicial experience.  The reviewing court’s assessment must, in other words, proceed through “the lens of judicial experience” to identify and articulate, as precisely as possible, those features of the case which suggest that the verdict was unreasonable.  There may be several causes of concern, none of which, in isolation, might have required a particular warning to the jury.

A verdict may also be unreasonable if the trial judge draws an inference or makes an essential finding of fact that:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Flores, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvxcf 2013 MBCA 4] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
See R. v. Sinclair, 2011 SCC 40 (CanLII), [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# is plainly contradicted by the evidence relied on by the trial judge in support of that inference or finding; or
# is shown to be incompatible with evidence that has not otherwise been contradicted or rejected by the trial judge.

'''Misapprehension of Evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
Appeal for misapprehension of evidence requires that the error &quot;play an essential part in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;R v Lee, [http://canlii.ca/t/27scf 2010 ABCA 1], 23 Alta LR (5th) 76, at paras 8-9 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Insufficiency of Reasons===
The judge is required to give reasons for his or her decision on verdict.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Sheppard, [2002] SCJ No 30. at para 55; &lt;Br&gt;
Pitts v. Ontario (1985), 51 OR (2d) 302 at 311;&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kendall [2005] O.J. No;. 2457 (C.A.)) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of giving reasons is to &quot;show why the judge reached his or her conclusion&quot;. The reasons are to be examined in a functional test.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The requirement of reasons is tied to their purpose and the purpose varies with the context&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dinardo, at para. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The functional and substantive manner means taking the reasons, &quot;as a whole, in the context of the evidence, arguments, and the live issues at trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which reasons are given.&quot; There must be a logical connection between the verdict and the reasons. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. T.S., [http://canlii.ca/t/fr6gh 2012 ONCA 289] at 45&lt;br&gt;
R v REM 2008 SCC 51 at 16, 35, 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no obligation upon judges to address every argument made by counsel. &lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Dinardo, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc24/2008scc24.html 2008 SCC 24], [2008] 1 SCR 788 at paragraph 30&lt;/ref&gt; Nor must the judge articulate consideration of every part of the evidence.

The Criminal Code specifically mandates judges to give reasons on certain circumstances, such as when determining the admissibility of a complainant's prior sexual history &lt;ref&gt;see s. 276.2(3)&lt;/ref&gt;; ordering the production of prior personal information (s. 278.8(1)); and when imposing a sentence &lt;ref&gt;see s. 726.2&lt;/ref&gt;.

The reason must &quot;sufficiently intelligible&quot; to permit appellate review.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. D. (J.J.R.) 2006 CanLII 40088 (ON CA), (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A verdict must be based exclusively on admissible evidence heard at trial. If a trial judge has misapprehended the evidence, including resorting to material not before him or her, and the errors &quot;play an essential part in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction then … the accused’s conviction is not based exclusively on the evidence and is not a “true” verdict&quot;. 
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Morrissey, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1995/1995canlii3498/1995canlii3498.html 1995 CanLII 3498] (ON CA) at p. 541&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lohrer, 2004 SCC 80 (CanLII), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732, at paras. 2-3&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering sufficiency, it is not the decision alone that should be considered but rather &quot;what the trial judge has stated in the context of the record, the issues and the submissions of counsel at trial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
REM at para. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Focus on analysis on findings concerning credibility &quot;should be directed at whether the reasons respond to the case's live issues, having regard to the evidence as a whole and the submissions of counsel&quot;(para. 25) This however does not require &quot;reasons to be so detailed that they allow an appeal court to retry the entire case on appeal. There is no need to prove that the trial judge was alive to and considered all of the evidence, or answer each and every argument of counsel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dinardo at para. 30&lt;br&gt; 
also referenced in R v REM 2008 SCC 51&lt;/ref&gt; 
Credibility cases require that the court sufficiently articulate how credibility concerns have been resolved. Failure to do so may be a reversible error.&lt;ref&gt;

R. v. Ball [http://canlii.ca/t/frpvx 2012 ABCA 184] (CanLII)

A trial judge's reasons should be reviewed on a &quot;standard of adequacy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

===Error on Question of Law===
Under s.675(1)(a)(ii), the defence may appeal a conviction on error of law.

Where there has been an error of law, such as the improper admission evidence, and the evidence may have influenced the trier of fact in reaching its verdict, the conviction must be quashed, irrespective of whether the admissible evidence supports a conviction.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Colpitts, [1965] S.C.R. 739&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Court may dismiss an appeal and deny any remedy under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), where the court &quot;is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred&quot;(s.686(1)(b)(iii)). 

{{reflist|2}}

===Miscarriage of Justice===
Under s.686(1)(a)(iii), the defence may appeal a conviction based on a miscarriage of justice.

A miscarriage of justice may arise in the following circumstances:
* a misapprehension of &quot;significant evidence&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jtj 1995 CanLII 3498] (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;
* improper questioning during cross-examination&lt;ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Lack of Prejudice===
Under s. 686(1)(b)(iv), the Court may dismiss a defence appeal despite irregularities at trial where the &quot;court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby&quot;.

In this context, &quot;prejudice&quot; refers to the prejudice suffered upon the accused's ability to defend himself, to receive a fair trial, and to the appearance of the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Interfering with Sentences===
Appeal of Sentence is a separate form of appeal from an appeal of verdict. 

Under s. 673, a sentence is defined as:
{{quotation|
“sentence” includes
:(a) a declaration made under subsection 199(3),
:(b) an order made under subsection 109(1) or 110(1), section 161, subsection 164.2(1) or 194(1), section 259, 261 or 462.37, subsection 491.1(2), 730(1) or 737(3) or (5) or section 738, 739, 742.1, 742.3, 743.6, 745.4 or 745.5,
:(c) a disposition made under section 731 or 732 or subsection 732.2(3) or (5), 742.4(3) or 742.6(9), and
:(d) an order made under subsection 16(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec673 CCC]
}}

Under s. 785(b), an appeal of sentence includes appeals against ancillary orders such as driving prohibitions, restitution, discharges, etc.

An appellate court has no authority to consider any issue of fitness of sentence on an appeal of verdict. There must be a specific application to appeal sentence before it can be considered.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. W. (G.) , [1999] 3 S.C.R. 597 - consideration of sentence without appeal of sentence created an apprehension of bias&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentence can only where there is an &quot;error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of relevant factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.(C.A.), [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1996/1996canlii230/1996canlii230.html 1996 CanLII 230] (S.C.C.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at para. 90&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Shropshire, [1995] S.C.J. No. 52 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1995/1995canlii47/1995canlii47.html] at para. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeal from a sentence in a summary conviction proceeding is identical to an appeal in an indictable matter. &lt;ref&gt;
By operation of section 822(1) of the Criminal Code summary conviction appeal adopts the same procedure by reference to the provisions of 687(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The governing section states:
{{quotation| 
687(1)  Where an appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,
:(a)        vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted; or
:(b)        dismiss the appeal.
}}
The decision on sentence is an act of discretion&lt;ref&gt; R. v. McCurdy, [2003] 210 NSR (2d) 33 at 36&lt;/ref&gt; and so the standard of review is one of deference. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Shropshire, (1995) 102 CCC 193 at 209; R. v. CAM (1996) 105 CCC 327 at 374&lt;/ref&gt; This deference does not change whether the sentence was after conviction or guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. CAM at 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a Court will only interfere where it is &quot;demonstrably unfit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Brown, [2004] NSJ 133&lt;/ref&gt;

To have grounds of appeal the appellant must be able to answer at least one or more of the following questions in the affirmative: &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Long, [2001] N.B.J. No. 347 (N.B.C.A.).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Is the sentence the result of an error of law?
#Did the sentencing judge err in principle in the exercise of his or her discretion?
#Is the sentence clearly unreasonable having regard to the fundamental purpose and objective of sentencing (s. 718) as well as the principles enunciated in section 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code?
#Is the sentence a substantial and marked departure from the sentence customarily imposed for similarly situated offenders committing similar crimes?

'''SOIRA Order''': only if there is an error in principle, a failure to consider a relevant factor, an overemphasis on appropriate factors, or a clearly unreasonable decision&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Redhead, 2006 ABCA 84 at para. 13, 384 A.R. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown has no authority to appeal the ordering of a particular length of SOIRA as it does not fit the meaning of &quot;sentence&quot; in s. 673.&lt;Ref&gt;

s. 686.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
'''Order to be made'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under paragraph (1)(a), it shall quash the conviction and
:(a) direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered; or
:(b) order a new trial.&lt;br&gt;

'''Substituting verdict'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Where a court of appeal dismisses an appeal under subparagraph (1)(b)(i), it may substitute the verdict that in its opinion should have been found and
:(a) affirm the sentence passed by the trial court; or
:(b) impose a sentence that is warranted in law or remit the matter to the trial court and direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted in law.&lt;br&gt;

'''Appeal from acquittal'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) If an appeal is from an acquittal or verdict that the appellant or respondent was unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal may
:(a) dismiss the appeal; or
:(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and
::(i) order a new trial, or
::(ii) except where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge and jury, enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the trial court and direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted in law.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
'''Where appeal allowed against verdict of unfit to stand trial'''&lt;br&gt;
(6) Where a court of appeal allows an appeal against a verdict that the accused is unfit to stand trial, it shall, subject to subsection (7), order a new trial.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Appeal court may set aside verdict of unfit to stand trial'''&lt;br&gt;
(7) Where the verdict that the accused is unfit to stand trial was returned after the close of the case for the prosecution, the court of appeal may, notwithstanding that the verdict is proper, if it is of the opinion that the accused should have been acquitted at the close of the case for the prosecution, allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and direct a judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Additional powers'''&lt;br&gt;
(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in addition, that justice requires.

===Ordering a new trial===

Where a new trial is ordered the provisions of s.686(5) and (5.1) apply:

{{Quotation|
s. 686.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
'''New trial under Part XIX'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) Subject to subsection (5.01), if an appeal is taken in respect of proceedings under Part XIX and the court of appeal orders a new trial under this Part, the following provisions apply:
:(a) if the accused, in his notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, requested that the new trial, if ordered, should be held before a court composed of a judge and jury, the new trial shall be held accordingly;
:(b) if the accused, in his notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, did not request that the new trial, if ordered, should be held before a court composed of a judge and jury, the new trial shall, without further election by the accused, be held before a judge or provincial court judge, as the case may be, acting under Part XIX, other than a judge or provincial court judge who tried the accused in the first instance, unless the court of appeal directs that the new trial be held before the judge or provincial court judge who tried the accused in the first instance;
:(c) if the court of appeal orders that the new trial shall be held before a court composed of a judge and jury, the new trial shall be commenced by an indictment in writing setting forth the offence in respect of which the new trial was ordered; and
:(d) notwithstanding paragraph (a), if the conviction against which the accused appealed was for an offence mentioned in section 553 and was made by a provincial court judge, the new trial shall be held before a provincial court judge acting under Part XIX, other than the provincial court judge who tried the accused in the first instance, unless the court of appeal directs that the new trial be held before the provincial court judge who tried the accused in the first instance.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
'''Election if new trial a jury trial'''&lt;br&gt;
(5.1) Subject to subsection (5.2), if a new trial ordered by the court of appeal is to be held before a court composed of a judge and jury,
:(a) the accused may, with the consent of the prosecutor, elect to have the trial heard before a judge without a jury or a provincial court judge;
:(b) the election shall be deemed to be a re-election within the meaning of subsection 561(5); and
:(c) subsection 561(5) applies, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to the election.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;

==Procedural Powers of the Court of Appeal==
The Court of Appeal is a court of inherent jurisdiction and is not recognized in common law. It is a &quot;creature of statute&quot; where its powers to hear cases and make orders must come from statute. 

Under s. 683, the Court of Appeal's main powers consist of the authority to:
* order the production of any writing, exhibit or other thing connected with the proceedings;
* &quot;order any witness ... to attend and be examined before the court of appeal...&quot;and admit the testimony as evidence. 
* order an inquiry and report to a special commissioner and to act on such a rport
* amend an indictment

The court also has &quot;ancillary&quot; authority to control its own process.
&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Zaharia (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (Ont. C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{reflist|2}}

===Disclosure Motion===

An accused may apply to the court of appeal for a disclosure, usually in the context of a fresh evidence application. 

Third party records can be obtained through application under s. 683. These production orders apply the same law as at trial level.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Trotta, [2004] O.J. No. 2439 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant must show:&lt;ref&gt;
R v West, 2012 NSCA 112&lt;/ref&gt;
#There is a connection between the request for production and the fresh evidence he proposes to adduce in that there is a reasonable possibility that the material sought could assist on the motion to adduce fresh evidence; and 
#There is a reasonable possibility that the evidence to which the production request is linked may be received as fresh evidence on appeal.

{{reflist|2}}

==Procedure on Specific Issues==

===Notice of Appeal===
Provincial rules of court set out the notice requirements for each appealing party as well as the time limit.

Rules may permit substituted service on notice, but when they do, they require a high standard of proof.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. see R v Goodhart, [http://canlii.ca/t/fv6qs 2012 ABQB 712] - substituted notice to accused quashed
&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{reflist|2}}

===Voir Dire Appeals===
A voir dire hearing can happen at any point during a proceeding before the final decision on guilt. Parties have a right to appeal the ruling of a voir dire, however, the proceeding will generally not be put on hold pending a ruling of the appeal.

A guilty plea after a voir dire will usually extinguish any right to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Chuhaniuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/2cl6p 2010 BCCA 403] at para. 45 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Carter, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fw4s 2003 BCCA 632] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bowman, [http://canlii.ca/t/21863 2008 BCCA 410] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Webster, [http://canlii.ca/t/21ls8 2008 BCCA 458]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

As best practice, to preserve the right to appeal, the accused shall admit the facts alleged by the Crown and invite the judge to convict.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Duong, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nq1g 2006 BCCA 325] at para. 8
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues of Appeal===
It is inappropriate for the appellate court to raise any issues not raised by either Crown or Defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. T. (S.G.) [http://canlii.ca/t/29vqb 2010 SCC 20] at paras. 36-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused may only raise a Charter issue on appeal that was not raised at trial where the following has been met:
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Brown, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs23 1993 CanLII 114] (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918, [1993] S.C.J. No. 82 per L'Heureux-Dubé J. at para. 20 dissenting on other grounds&lt;/ref&gt;
#there must be a sufficient evidentiary record to resolve the issue. 
#it must not be an instance in which the accused for tactical reasons failed to raise the issue at trial. 
# the court must be satisfied that no miscarriage of justice will result from the refusal to raise such new issue on appeal. 

{{reflist|2}}

===Issues Not Raised at Trial===
In certain cases, such as applications for privileged information, the failure to raise the issue at trial subsequent to a lost voir dire has been found to be fatal to a potential appeal.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Blair, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb9m 2000 CanLII 16821] (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to raise a Charter issue on appeal where it  was no argued previously, there must be 1) sufficient evidence to deal with the issue, 2) satisifed that the failure to raise the issue previously was not merely a tactical issue, 3) there is no miscarriage of justice from raising the new issue.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. Brown, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs23 1993 CanLII 114] (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918 at para. 20&lt;Br&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

=== Fresh Evidence ===
The test for the admission of fresh evidence is set out as follows: &lt;ref&gt;R v Palmer, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 at p. 775; R. v. Levesque, [http://canlii.ca/t/523w 2000 SCC 47]&lt;/ref&gt;
#The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases
#The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.
#The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief, and
#It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.

Where however, the application arises out of the Crown's failure to provide disclosure, then test is less onerous.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McQuaid, (sub nom R. v. Dixon), [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqvj 1998 CanLII 805] (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244 at 34&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Taillefer, [http://canlii.ca/t/1g992 2003 SCC 70], [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Illes, [http://canlii.ca/t/218ct 2008 SCC 57], [2008] 3 S.C.R. 134 at para. 24&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The accused must show that his right to make full answer and defence was violated by showing either &quot;that there is a reasonable possibility the non-disclosure affected the outcome at trial&quot; or that it affected &quot;the overall fairness of the trial process&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Dixon at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Sentence Evidence===
The courts are reluctant to consider fresh evidence on appeal as it is outside of the appeal court's role.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Lévesque, [http://canlii.ca/t/523w 2000 SCC 47] at para 20 &lt;/ref&gt;

There are four criteria to consider before allowing the evidence:&lt;ref&gt;Levesque, at 35&lt;/ref&gt;
#The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases.
#The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue relating to the sentence.
#The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief.
#The evidence must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.

=== Intervenors ===
A party may apply to intervene in an appeal where: &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Ross, 2012 NSCA 8 at 12 [http://canlii.ca/t/fpq5l#par12]&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the intervention will unduly delay the proceedings; 
#possible prejudice to the parties if intervention is granted; 
#whether the intervention will widen the lis between the parties; 
#the extent to which the position of the intervenor is already represented and protected by one of the parties; and 
#whether the intervention will transform the court into a political arena. 

These factors are balanced against each other and the interests of convenience, efficiency, and social purpose of moving the matter forward. The decision is ultimately a discretionary one.

{{Reflist|2}}

=== Court Appointed Counsel for Appeals===
Section 684(1) provides:
{{Quotation|684(1)  A court of appeal or a judge of that court may […] assign counsel to act on behalf of an accused who is a party to an appeal or to proceedings preliminary or incidental to an appeal where, in the opinion of the court or judge, it appears desirable in the interests of justice that the accused should have legal assistance and where it appears that the accused has not sufficient means to obtain that assistance.

===Amending Indictments or Informations===
Under s. 683(1)(g), the court of appeal may amend an information or indictment subject to the appeal. In doing so, the court should consider:

It is section 683(1)(g), not section 686(1)(b)(i), that provides an appeal court with the authority to amend an indictment or information on appeal. In deciding whether to amend, an appeal court should consider:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Fraser, [http://canlii.ca/t/1tmd3 2007 SKCA 113] (CanLII) at para. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
#the original indictment;
#the evidence at trial; 
#the positions of the parties at trial; 
#the instructions of the trial judge; 
#the verdict of the jury; and 
#the issues raised on appeal.

;Problem 1:
Give the chains of rangespaces and nullspaces for the zero and
identity transformations.
;Answer:

For the zero transformation, no matter what the space, the chain of rangespaces is &lt;math&gt; V\supset\{\vec{0}\}=\{\vec{0}\}=\cdots\, &lt;/math&gt; and the chain of nullspaces is &lt;math&gt; \{\vec{0}\}\subset V=V=\cdots\, &lt;/math&gt;. For the identity transformation the chains are &lt;math&gt; V=V=V=\cdots &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \{\vec{0}\}=\{\vec{0}\}=\cdots\, &lt;/math&gt;.

;Problem 2:
For each map,
give the chain of rangespaces and the chain of nullspaces,
and the generalized rangespace and the
generalized nullspace.
&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_0:\mathcal{P}_2\to \mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;a+bx+cx^2\mapsto b+cx^2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_1:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ a \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_2:\mathcal{P}_2\to \mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;a+bx+cx^2\mapsto b+cx+ax^2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;t_3:\mathbb{R}^3\to \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} a \\ a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
;Answer:

&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Iterating &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; twice
&lt;math&gt;a+bx+cx^2\mapsto b+cx^2\mapsto cx^2&lt;/math&gt;
gives

:&lt;math&gt;
a+bx+cx^2\stackrel{t_0^2}{\longmapsto}cx^2
&lt;/math&gt;

and any higher power is the same map.
Thus, while &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of
quadratic polynomials
with no linear term &lt;math&gt;\{p+rx^2\,\big|\, p,r\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;,
and
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t_0^2)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of purely-quadratic polynomials
&lt;math&gt;\{rx^2\,\big|\, r\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;,
this is where the chain stabilizes
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_\infty(t_0)=\{rx^2\,\big|\, n\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;.
As for nullspaces,
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of purely-linear quadratic
polynomials &lt;math&gt;\{qx\,\big|\, q\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(t_0^2)&lt;/math&gt; is the space of quadratic polynomials
with no &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; term &lt;math&gt;\{p+qx\,\big|\, p,q\in \mathbb{C}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and
this is the end &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}_\infty(t_0)=\mathcal{N}(t_0^2)&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; The second power

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\stackrel{t_1}{\longmapsto}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ a \end{pmatrix}
\stackrel{t_1}{\longmapsto}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the zero map.
Consequently, the chain of rangespaces

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{R}^2
\supset\{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ p \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, p\in\mathbb{C}\}
\supset\{\vec{0}\,\}
=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and the chain of nullspaces

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\vec{0}\,\}
\subset\{\begin{pmatrix} q \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, q\in\mathbb{C}\}
\subset\mathbb{R}^2
=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

each has length two.
The generalized rangespace is the trivial subspace and the
generalized nullspace is the entire space.
&lt;li&gt; Iterates of this map cycle around

:&lt;math&gt;
a+bx+cx^2
\stackrel{t_2}{\longmapsto} b+cx+ax^2
\stackrel{t_2}{\longmapsto} c+ax+bx^2
\stackrel{t_2}{\longmapsto} a+bx+cx^2
\;\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and the chains of rangespaces and nullspaces are trivial.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{P}_2=\mathcal{P}_2=\cdots
\qquad
\{\vec{0}\,\}=\{\vec{0}\,\}=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, obviously,
generalized spaces are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_\infty(t_2)=\mathcal{P}_2&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}_\infty(t_2)=\{\vec{0}\,\}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; We have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} a \\ a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} a \\ a \\ a \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto\begin{pmatrix} a \\ a \\ a \end{pmatrix}
\mapsto\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and so the chain of rangespaces

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{R}^3
\supset\{\begin{pmatrix} p \\ p \\ r \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, p,r\in\mathbb{C}\}
\supset\{\begin{pmatrix} p \\ p \\ p \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, p\in\mathbb{C}\}
=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and the chain of nullspaces

:&lt;math&gt;
\{\vec{0}\,\}
\subset\{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ r \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, r\in \mathbb{C}\}
\subset\{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ q \\ r \end{pmatrix}\,\big|\, q,r\in \mathbb{C}\}
=\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

each has length two.
The generalized spaces are the final ones shown above in each chain.

Check that a subspace must be of dimension less than or equal to the
dimension of its superspace.
Check that if the subspace is proper (the subspace does not equal the
superspace) then the dimension is strictly less.
''(This is used in the proof of
[[#le:RangeAndNullChains|Lemma 1.3]]&lt;!--\ref{le:RangeAndNullChains}--&gt;.)''
;Answer:

Recall that if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; then any basis &lt;math&gt;B_W&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; can be enlarged to make a basis &lt;math&gt;B_V&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. From this the first sentence is immediate. The second sentence is also not hard: &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the span of &lt;math&gt;B_W&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subspace then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is not the span of &lt;math&gt;B_W&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;B_V&lt;/math&gt; must have at least one vector more than does &lt;math&gt;B_W&lt;/math&gt;.
}}
{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 5:
Prove that the generalized rangespace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_\infty(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the
entire space, and the generalized nullspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}_\infty(t)&lt;/math&gt; is trivial,
if the transformation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular.
Is this &quot;only if&quot; also?
;Answer:

It is both &quot;if&quot; and &quot;only if&quot;. We have seen earlier that a linear map is nonsingular if and only if it preserves dimension, that is, if the dimension of its range equals the dimension of its domain. With a transformation &lt;math&gt;t:V\to V&lt;/math&gt; that means that the map is nonsingular if and only if it is onto: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t)=V&lt;/math&gt; (and thus &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t^2)=V&lt;/math&gt;, etc).
}}
{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 6{{anchor|exer:RangeAndNullChains}}: &lt;!--\label{exer:RangeAndNullChains}--&gt;
Verify the nullspace half of [[#le:RangeAndNullChains|Lemma 1.3]]&lt;!--\ref{le:RangeAndNullChains}--&gt;.
;Answer:

The nullspaces form chains because
because if &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}\in\mathcal{N}(t^j)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;t^j(\vec{v})=\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;t^{j+1}(\vec{v})=t(\,t^j(\vec{v})\,)=t(\vec{0})=\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt; and
so &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}\in\mathcal{N}(t^{j+1})&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, the &quot;further&quot; property for nullspaces follows from that fact that it holds for rangespaces, along with the prior exercise. Because the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(t^j)&lt;/math&gt; plus the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(t^j)&lt;/math&gt; equals the dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of the starting space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, when the dimensions of the rangespaces stop decreasing, so do the dimensions of the nullspaces. The prior exercise shows that from this point &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; on, the containments in the chain are not proper&amp;mdash; the nullspaces
are equal.

{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 7:
Give an example of a transformation on a three
dimensional space whose range has dimension two.
What is its nullspace?
Iterate your example until the rangespace and nullspace stabilize.
;Answer:

(Of course, many examples are correct, but here is one.) An example is the shift operator on triples of reals &lt;math&gt; (x,y,z)\mapsto (0,x,y) &lt;/math&gt;. The nullspace is all triples that start with two zeros. The map stabilizes after three iterations.
}}
{{TextBox|1=
;Problem 8:
Show that the rangespace and nullspace of a linear transformation
need not be disjoint.
Are they ever disjoint?
;Answer:

The differentiation operator &lt;math&gt; d/dx:\mathcal{P}_1\to \mathcal{P}_1 &lt;/math&gt; has the same rangespace as nullspace. For an example of where they are disjoint&amp;mdash; except for the zero vector&amp;mdash; consider an identity map (or any nonsingular map).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The purpose and principles of sentencing provide a guidance to judges in applying the available sentences for particular offenders. The sentencing regime in the criminal code and case law sets out the goals at play in all sentencings. These goals can come in conflict with each other and so must be balance against each other in every case. The principles of sentencing guide a judge to determine how these goals are balanced and how to achieve the most appropriate disposition.

Sections 718 to 718.2 codify the objectives and principles of sentencing and are intended to “bring greater consistency and clarity” to sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6] at 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of sentencing is not simply a method of imposing penalties or costs upon an offender to prevent harmful conduct, but rather the system is to impose sentences which &quot;positively instills the basic set of values shared by all Canadians as expressed by the Criminal Code.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. C. A. M., [http://canlii.ca/t/1frb9 1996 CanLII 230] (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts must bring the law, including sentencing, into harmony with the prevailing social values and so must reflect changes in these values.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Stone, 134 C.C.C. (5d) 353 citing R. v. C.A.M., supra&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Purpose of Sentencing==
The purposes of sentencing are laid out in section 718 of the Criminal Code:
{{quotation|
'''Purpose'''&lt;br&gt;
718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:
:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;
:(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;
:(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;
:(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;
:(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and
:(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718 CCC]}}

As stated, the fundamental purpose is that there be &quot;respect for the law&quot; and the maintenance of a &quot;just, peaceful and safe society&quot;. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Whicher, [http://canlii.ca/t/5kdn 2002 BCCA 336]; R. v. Priest [http://canlii.ca/t/6hxl 1996 CanLII 1381] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single &quot;sentencing objective [that] trumps the other&quot;. It is to &quot;the sentencing judge to determine which objective or objectives merit the greatest weight, given the particulars of the case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 at para. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
=== Denunciation - s.718(a) ===
Section 718(a) sets out the objective of &quot;denounc[ing] unlawful conduct&quot;. The principle of denunciation &quot;mandates that a sentence should communicate society's condemnation of that particular offender's conduct. In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender's conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society's basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v M(CA) 1996 CanLII 230, [1996] 1 SCR 500 at 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of denunciation and deterrence can sometimes be satisfied without incarceration. One of these circumstances is where the publicity of the case provides for public humiliation. &lt;ref&gt;R v Ewanchuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/506z 2002 ABCA 95] at 65; R v Ambrose, [http://canlii.ca/t/5rqs 2000 ABCA 264] at 134; R v Kneale, [1999] OJ No 4062 at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
=== Deterrence - 718(b) ===
Section 718(b) sets out the objectives of &quot;deter[ing] the offender and other persons from committing offences&quot; We refer to these as the twin objectives of &quot;general deterrence&quot; and &quot;specific deterrence&quot;.

The objective of general deterrence as a factor will normally result in the offender being “punished more severely, not because he or she deserves it, but because the court decides to send a message to others who may be inclined to engage in similar criminal activity.” &lt;ref&gt;R v BWP [http://canlii.ca/t/1nn6n 2006 SCC 27]&lt;/ref&gt;

When general deterrence is emphasized, the deterrent effect of incarceration can be somewhat speculative and so should be used with great restraint.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Biancofiore, [http://canlii.ca/t/6hjk 1997 CanLII 3420] (ON CA), (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 344 at para. 23 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthy sentence is not the only way of achieving the objective of general deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;See R. v. Morrissette (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 307 (Sask. C.A.) at 310&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

=== Separation from Society - 718(c) ===

Where a person with mental illness poses a risk to the public the court may need to resort to separating the offender from society, rather than focus on treatment.&lt;Ref&gt;
see R. v. Desjardins-Paquette, 2012 ONCA 674 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Virani, [2012] A.J. No. 507 (C.A.), at para. 16&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment in the community is generally preferred over incarceration.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Lundrigan, [2012] NJ No 231 (NLCA) at para. 20&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is less so for serious offences.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. J.M., [2008] N.J. No. 262 (P.C.) &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Taylor, [2012] N.J. No. 251 (P.C.))&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

=== Rehabilitation - s.718(d)===
Section 718(d) sets out the objective of &quot;assist[ing] in rehabilitating offenders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;see also R. v. Gill (2006), [http://canlii.ca/t/1msxn 2006 BCCA 127]&lt;/ref&gt; Rehabilitation can be seen to achieve the objective of protecting the public as it assists in preventing further offences.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Simmons, Allen and Bezzo (1973), 13 CCC 65 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In certain cases, where there is a realistic possibility of rehabilitation, the courts may opt not to impose a jail sentence where it would otherwise be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Preston (1990), _____ (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective rehabilitation has been seen by some courts as requiring an acceptance of responsibility, likely by way of a guilty plea, and an understanding of the harm done.&lt;ref&gt;
See R v Lee [http://canlii.ca/t/fnsvh 2011 NSPC 81] at 83&lt;Br&gt;
R v Seguin [1997] OJ No 5439 at 18&lt;/ref&gt;

An offender's &quot;positive potential for rehabilitation&quot; should be to the benefit of the accused on sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gouliaeff, 2012 ONCA 690 (CanLII) at para. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Principles of Sentencing==

=== Fundamental Principle: Proportionality ===
No matter what the balance between objectives, the sentence must always satisfy the fundamental principle of sentencing under s. 718.1.&lt;ref&gt;R v Nasogaluak at 40&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
'''Fundamental principle'''&lt;br&gt;
718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718.1 CCC]
}}

Where the sentence is not proportionate it is not just.
&lt;ref&gt;R v Arcand, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dnsp 2010 ABCA 363] at para 52 (proportionality is “the overarching principle since a disproportionate sanction can never be a just sanction.”)&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, it is central to the sentencing process.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Solowan, [http://canlii.ca/t/21h61 2008 SCC 62], [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 12&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 SCR 688, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp2 1999 CanLII 679] (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentence must be no greater than the offenders moral culpability.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nasogaluak, [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6], [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 40 to 42&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the “severity of sanction for a crime should reflect the...seriousness of the criminal conduct.”
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Arcand, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dnsp 2010 ABCA 363], para. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
And when the sentence is not adequate to address the seriousness of the offence then it is not proportionate.
&lt;ref&gt;R v Arcand, at para 54&lt;/ref&gt;

From this, it is well established that sentencing is a highly discretionary endeavour. Each sentence is to be custom tailored to match the particular offender.
&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Bottineau, [http://canlii.ca/t/fkgld 2011 ONCA 194](sentencing “is a fact-sensitive process. Imposing a sentence depends very much on the facts of a particular case and the circumstances and culpability of the particular offender. That said, the sentence imposed must be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the purposes and principles set out in 718 and 718.2, sentencing is a highly individualized process that takes into account the offence, as well as the offender.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Angelillo [http://canlii.ca/t/1q3xt 2006 SCC 55], (2006), 274 D.L.R. (4th) 1&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Briand, [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Shoker, [2006] S.C.J. No. 44, [http://canlii.ca/t/1prjc 2006 SCC 44]&lt;br&gt;
R v Hamilton, [2004] O.J. No. 3252, [http://canlii.ca/t/1hmc9 2004 CanLII 5549] (ON CA) at 87 (&quot;Sentencing is a very human process.  Most attempts to describe the proper judicial approach to sentencing are as close to the actual process as a paint-by- numbers landscape is to the real thing.  The fixing of a fit sentence is the product of the combined effects of the circumstances of the specific offence and the unique attributes of the specific offender.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v Grady(1971), 5 N.S.R. (2d) 264 at p. 266:(&quot;It would be a grave mistake, it appears to me, to follow rigid rules for determining the type and length of sentence in order to secure a measure of uniformity, for almost invariably different circumstances are present in the case of each offender. ...&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; penalties.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lee, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpp44 2012 ABCA 17] at para. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is “an inherently individualized process.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.(C.A.), [1996] S.C.J. No. 28,
para. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a &quot;profoundly subjective process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R.  227, at para.  46&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity of an offence can be measured in part by the lasting emotional effects of the offence upon the victim.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Butler, [http://canlii.ca/t/21bfq 2008 NSCA 102] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

When crafting a sentence for multiple offences, proportionality can be achieved either &quot;by imposing concurrent sentences&quot; or &quot;by applying the totality principle to consecutive sentences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Guha, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftgfz 2012 BCCA 423] (CanLII) at para. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggravating and Mitigating Factors===
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Factors of Sentencing]]''

Section 718.2 is a non-exhaustive list of secondary principles in sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nasogaluak at 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Other objectives and principles are listed at s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code: 
{{quotation|
'''Other sentencing principles'''&lt;br&gt;
718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:
:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
::(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,
::(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner,
::(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,
::(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,
::(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization, or
::(v) evidence that the offence was a terrorism offence
&lt;p&gt;
shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;&lt;P&gt;...&lt;p&gt;|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718.2 CCC]
}}

Take note that certain offences have their own additional factors to consider that are found throughout the code. For example, fraud offences under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec380.1 s. 380.1].

===Other Principles===
{{quotation|
718.2&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
:(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;
:(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;
:(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hamilton, 2004 ONCA __; R. v. D.L. (1990), 53 CCC 365 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt; and
:(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718.2 CCC]
}}

Judges are not permitted to apply their own personal belief or views that are contrary to the principles of sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;R .v. Song  2009 ONCA __&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Totality - s.718.2(c) ===
See [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Purpose and Principles of Sentencing/Totality Principle]]

=== Parity (s.718.2(b)) ===
The parity principle means that a sentence should be &quot;similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;see s. 718.2(b) Criminal Code&lt;br&gt;
Sentencing, 7th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2008), at ss.2.21
&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge has a responsibility to &quot;impose sentences in line with precedent, noting always that for each offence and each offender some elements are unique.&quot; &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Oake, [2010] N.J. No. 94 (NLCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

To fulfil this requirement sentencing judges must consider the range of sentences of &quot;similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Tuglavina, [2011] N.J. No. 25 (NLCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle ensures fairness between similarly situated cases.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Rawn, [http://canlii.ca/t/frzp0 2012 ONCA 487] at para. 18&lt;/ref&gt; It does not however override the individualized approach to sentencing. 
&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Knife (1982), 16 Sask. R. 40 (C.A.) at p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of the provincial courts of appeal is to maintain parity in sentence and minimize the differences in sentencing approaches.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Arcand [http://canlii.ca/t/2dnsp 2010 ABCA 363]&lt;br&gt;
Nasogaluak [http://canlii.ca/t/2848x 2010 SCC 6]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the judges must also be sensitive to the needs of local community.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Nasogaluak&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parity to Co-Accused====
In a situation of co-accused, the roles of the parties will be considered as well as their personal circumstances. 
&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Knife (1982), 16 Sask. R. 40 (C.A.) at p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of parity does not require equal sentences for participants in the same offence. Rather, they must &quot;only [be] understandable sentences when examined together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Issa (T.), (1992), 57 O.A.C. 253 at para. 9&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Rawn, [http://canlii.ca/t/frzp0 2012 ONCA 487] at para 30&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where accomplices who commit the crime at the orders of a principal and agree to testify against he principal can be afforded lesser sentences than the principal.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Ellahib, 2008 ABCA 281 -- 20 years for the principal and the 16 and 15 year sentences accomplices justified because the principal was the instigator and the accomplices entered guilty pleas and testified against him.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Restraint - s. 718.2(d),(e)===

For first time offenders, the principle of restraint &quot;requires that the sentencing judge consider all sanctions apart from incarceration&quot; and where necessary ensure the term be as &quot;short as possible and tailored to the circumstances of the accused&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Battise [http://canlii.ca/t/22cd6 2009 ONCA 114] at 32&lt;br&gt;
R v Priest [http://canlii.ca/t/6hxl 1996 CanLII 1381] (ONCA) 30 OR (3d) 538 at p. 545&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/reF&gt;

The principle also requires the judge to consider rehabilitation in setting the length of the sentence. 

&quot;General deterrence cannot be the sole consideration. Appropriate consideration must be given to the rehabilitation of the offender.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Blanas, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mh80 2006 CanLII 2610] (ON CA), (2006), 207 O.A.C. 226, at para 5
&lt;/ref&gt;

Restraint not only means that prison should be a sanction of last resort, but also means that the court should &quot;seek the least intrusive sentence and the least quantum which will achieve the overall purpose of being an appropriate and just sanction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hamilton [http://canlii.ca/t/1hmc9 2004 CanLII 5549] (ON CA) at para. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Where other dispositions have been tried and failed, and jail has not previously been imposed, the imposition of a &quot;short, sharp&quot; sentence can be appropriate, particularly where the offence is related to property and not violence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Vandale (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 250, per Martin JA citing McKenna J. of the English Court of Appeal in R. v. Curran (1973), 57 Crim. App. R. 945 (&quot;As a general rule it is undesirable that a first sentence of immediate imprisonment should be very long, disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and imposed as this sentence was for reasons of general deterrence, that is, as a warning to others.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Aboriginal Offenders - s. 718.2(e)===
See [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Aboriginal Principles and Factors]]

===Step-up Principle===
The &quot;step-up&quot; principle is where an offender is convicted of a similar or identical offence to one he's been convicted and sentenced in the past for, it can be concluded that the prior sentence was not sufficiently deterrent and so the sentence for the new offence should be increased to focus on specific deterrence.

=== Jump Principle ===
The &quot;jump&quot; principle stated that subsequent sentences passed should not be disproportionate to the prior offence (ie. a &quot;jump&quot; in sentence). A subsequent offence should have an incremental increase proportionate to frequency of the repeated offences.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. White, [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2007/2007nlca44/2007nlca44.html 2007 NLCA 44]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Muyser, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2009/2009abca116/2009abca116.html 2009 ABCA 116]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Murphy, [2011] N.J. No. 43 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words a dramatic increase in sentence due to a recent prior similar record would violate this rule.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. Borde [http://canlii.ca/t/1c062 2003 CanLII 4187] (ON CA), (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 417, at para. 39&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, this rule does not apply where the index offence is greatly more serious than the prior offences.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Borde 2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA), (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 417, at para. 39
R. v. Courtney, [http://canlii.ca/t/frz4k 2012 ONCA 478] at 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The jump principle is of &quot;less utility&quot; when dealing with an accused &quot;with a lengthy criminal record on multiple convictions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Frigault v. R., [http://canlii.ca/t/fpvch 2012 NBCA 8] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

A jump would be inconsistent with rehabilitation where that is a significant factor in sentence.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. White, supra, at paragraphs 5 to 8&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Gap Principle===
The &quot;gap principle&quot; directs courts to take into consideration the gaps of time between offences.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Smith, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p11l 2006 NSCA 95] (CanLII) at para. 36: extensive citation from Ruby on Sentencing&lt;/ref&gt; It gives credit to someone who has made an effort to avoid criminal charges.
&lt;ref&gt;see §8.83 of Clayton Ruby, Sentencing, 7th ed. (Markham:  LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2008) &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===&quot;Starting Points&quot; on Sentence===
A &quot;starting point&quot; for sentences are set as guides and are factors to consider the appropriate sentence. They are meant to achieve greater uniformity and consistency. They are &quot;most useful in circumstances where there is a large disparity between sentences imposed&quot;. &lt;reF&gt;R. v. McDonnell [1997] S.C.J. No. 42, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr3d 1997 CanLII 389]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A starting point of sentence will be raised and lowered after considering the aggravating and mitigating factors on sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ostertag, 2000 ABCA 232 
&lt;/ref&gt;

A starting point cannot be artificially lowered by examination into prior case law that shows lower sentences than the designated &quot;starting point&quot; and deem it to be the &quot;correct&quot; starting point. &lt;ref&gt;R. v Marchesi, [http://canlii.ca/t/25q69 2009 ABCA 304] at para. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge would does not menttion starting points in sentence where one exists is not committing an error in principle.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lee, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpp44 2012 ABCA 17] at 58&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Stone, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqn2 1999 CanLII 688] (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290 &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Wells, [http://canlii.ca/t/527n 2000 SCC 10], [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, &lt;br&gt;
L.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/1x21j 2008 SCC 31], [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Ranges on Sentence===
A range of sentence is not all sentences between the minimum and maximum for the offence charged. Rather, it is narrowed by the specific offence and offender. The variations of punishment when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors creates the continuum of the range. &lt;reF&gt; R v Cromwell [http://canlii.ca/t/1m44w 2005 NSCA 137] at 26&lt;/reF&gt;

Ranges &quot;are guidelines rather than hard and fast rules&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nasogaluak 2010 SCC 6 at para. 44&lt;/ref&gt; A range of sentence can be deviated as long as it is &quot;in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing&quot; and are not necessarily unfit.&lt;ref&gt;Nasogaluak at para. 44 &lt;br&gt;
c.f. R v Doerksen, (1990) 62 Man.R. 2d 259 (CA): A set range of sentence can be deviated from in “exceptional circumstances” &lt;/ref&gt; 
However, factors such as a “good record” and remorse do not amount to exceptional circumstances to deviate from the accepted range.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Henderson, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpxrx 2012 MBCA 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Effect of Election on Sentence===
A sentence is not scaled based on the election made. Thus, an offence prosecuted summarily should not be scaled to less than the maximum only because it would not have been a maximum sentence by indictment.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Solowan, [http://canlii.ca/t/21h61 2008 SCC 62], [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309 at 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences for breach of court orders is a gradual process without a sudden, substantial increase in penalty.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Murphy, [2011] N.J. No. 43 (C.A.) at 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of the [http://lasers.llnl.gov/ National Ignition Facility] at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, spoke about fusion at the Center Stage Meeting Pavilion at about 12:30 p.m. on the first day of the Faire.  He was followed by Mark Frauenfelder, editor-in-chief of ''MAKE''.

=== Impressions ===

The presentation was excellent.  I was able to ask about reducing fast neutrons, and was pleased to receive a reply to my followup correspondence:

 Dear Dr. Moses,
 
 First, I want to thank you again for speaking at the Maker Faire, and
 make sure you got my message I tried to send below from the NIF
 &quot;contact&quot; web form.
 
 I've been thinking, since we spoke, about all the different modes of
 radioactive decay, and how many are weak force interactions with a
 wide variety of components.  So few of them are described well, even
 in the literature produced by particle accelerators (stochastic decay
 seems to be a very different mode of producing particles than
 collisions.)  Would you please point me to the source(s) which you
 think explains electroweak-nuclear interactions best?
 
 I also want to reiterate my suggestion to expand in a way that will
 allow the U.S. to take a serious look at Widom-Larsen and related
 theories.  The academic peer reviewed secondary and tertiary
 literature has recently been very strong in its support of the
 empirical evidence of the anomalies involved.[1-7] Applications are
 intriguing[8] whether or not there is any fusion occurring.[9-10]
 Hagelstein's work at MIT has recently shown that lasers can cause
 interactions with the processes involved.[11]  Department of Energy,
 ENEA, and Navy Research Lab work at Brookhaven has recently shown that
 lasers are useful for studying the anomalies.[12]
 
 I am sure that you want people to think of you as leaving no stone
 unturned in the search for clean energy without nuclear waste.  The
 opportunity to reduce fast neutrons in the production of nuclear
 energy is too great to ignore, and I am certain that Congress will
 agree, if someone of your stature were to propose the investigation.
 Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.
 
 Best regards,
 James Salsman

 -- message sent by NIF contact web form Sunday --
 
 Thank you for taking my question about electroweak-nuclear
 interactions producing fewer fast neutrons at your Maker Faire talk.
 
 It seems that Widom-Larsen theory is the leading explanation of the
 deuterated palladium anomalies.  My assessment of the proportion of
 understood electroweak-nuclear interactions is as confident as your
 assessment if the born secret doctrine hasn't influenced either, but
 how would we know if it had influenced either of our understandings? 
 
 Given that the November, 2009 Scientific American cover story
 contemplates the feasible elimination of fossil fuels in 2030 --
 http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-path-to-sustainable-energy-by-2030
 -- I recommend that you encourage the expansion of your facility 
 with a new division to study ways to reduce fast neutron production
 in nuclear energy.
 
 Thank you again for your patient kindness and long-suffering
 tribulations on the forefront of large industrial technology.

 Dear James,
 
 Thanks for your interest.
 
 While I am not expert in these theories it is my current understanding 
 that hard scientific evidence for the ideas around cold fusion has 
 not been well developed. In fact, the whole field of cold fusion 
 remains in flux.
 
 I think that it is fair to say that attempts to measure the anomalous 
 energy production reported by Fleischman and Pons have remained 
 inconsistent and have failed to suggest any plausible underlying 
 physical mechanism.  This may be because  using very generally 
 applicable and acknowledged laws of physics, seem to preclude that 
 nuclear fusion is occurring at observable rates in the &quot;cold fusion&quot; 
 experiments.  Our current understanding of materials, chemistry, and 
 physics cannot explain the reported observations of energy 
 production, but is entirely consistent with the many experiments that 
 have observed no energy.
 
 Of course our role as scientists is to explore the unknown and learn 
 more and more about its underlying causes. Good luck in your research.
 
 Best regards
 emoses

=== What Prompted Me to Become a Wikibooks Editor ===

I have been reading Wikipedia and Wikibooks for years, of course, and have been inspired to start editing by [[Wikipedia:User:John_Broughton | John Broughton]]'s book [[Wikipedia:Help:Wikipedia:_The_Missing_Manual | Wikipedia: The Missing Manual]] and the book [[How Wikipedia Works]] by [[Wikipedia:User:Phoebe | Phoebe Ayers]], [[Wikipedia:User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]], and [[Wikipedia:User:Tlogmer | Ben Yates]]. After reading the books for a while, I registered a Wikipedia user name (which carried over to other Wikimedia projects) and began editing here and there. When I see a place where I can copy edit, I copy edit. When I know of a good published source from my own professional research, I add it to an article, rewriting if need be for neutral point of view that reflects verifiable sources. 

I've enjoyed seeing how the Wikimedia projects have improved over the years through the efforts of tens of thousands of volunteers, and I want to be part of that. The Wikimedia projects seem to be a natural outgrowth of a culture long established on Usenet and other online discussion forums of sharing information freely in exchange for other free information.

=== Schooling Background ===

My higher education includes undergraduate study of Chinese, Russian, German, Greek, and Hebrew, with courses in linguistics, teaching English as a second language, library science, and research methods in Sinology. I also have a law degree. I was one of the editors of the law review published at my law school. An interesting elective class I took there was on law and social science, my first formal training in human cognitive illusions (in the context of evaluating the reliability of eyewitness testimony). 

Throughout my schooling, from elementary school through law school, I've really thought of myself as responsible for my own learning, which I pursue through independent reading. I maintain an affiliation with my alma mater's library so that I can have access to scholarly monographs, print journals, and online databases. 

=== Occupational Background ===

During my undergraduate education, I was a student assistant for a computerized database project cataloging serials held by all libraries in two states. I have visited a few other countries in North America or east Asia, living in one of them for two three-year stays. While living overseas between my two degrees, I was a teacher of English as a foreign language and translator, editor, and interpreter. I first learned what was, in essence, a markup language by using [[Wikipedia:WordStar]] on an [[Wikipedia:MP/M]] multi-user computer system for word processing while working as a manuscript and copy editor overseas. 

After returning from my first overseas stay, I was an interpreter on contract for the United States federal government and private clients. I have been to all fifty states of the United States, to the District of Columbia many times, and to the federal territory of Guam. After law school I was a judicial clerk for a state supreme court and a lawyer in private practice. 

=== Current Activities ===

For the last two decades, my occupation has included research on education policy, psychology, gifted education, mathematics, and mathematics pedagogy. I teach mathematics lessons and coach a math team. 

I attempt to maintain a Mandarin and English bilingual household as I now live in Minnesota. I am a homeschooling parent and active volunteer in parent organizations.

== What I Expect to Edit on Wikimedia Projects ==

I expect to be most active in editing articles that fit subjects for which I have primary sources at hand as I am near the computer. I have been a moderator of various online discussion forums since 1993, and I hope that experience also guides my participation in Wikimedia project editing. I have enjoyed reading article discussion pages recently as I get up the [[Wikipedia:Be_bold|boldness]] to plunge into editing articles on controversial subjects.

The one Wikimedia project I would most like to expand is the [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Topic:Primary_School_Mathematics Wikiversity Primary School Mathematics] project, and its companion Wikibooks [[Primary_Mathematics]] project. Most of my research and writing these days revolves around that topic or the topic of [[Wikipedia:Intelligence Quotient|IQ testing]].

I saw your note at primary mathematics and thought you'd also like to know our Mathematics Project.  I am freshly trying to restart it now. The aim is simply to provide some community for the editors interested in improving the mathematics coverage here. Give a place to discuss issues with wikibooks (such as &quot;hey this won't TeX correctly&quot; or &quot;how do I make a nice picture&quot;); or actual mathematics content.  Stop by the talk page if we can help you in any way. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:43, 8 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Packages management ==

=== In Terminal ===
: You have to softwares for packages management : &quot;dpkg&quot; and &quot;apt-get&quot;.
:1. If you want to install new software/package from repositories just type in Terminal as root:
 apt-get update
 apt-get install package_name
:2. If you want to install a package &quot;deb&quot; downloaded from other site:
 cd download_folder
 dpkg -i package_name.deb
::a. If a package needs additional dependences and installation has been stoped, then:
 apt-get install -f
::b. If a package has been not configurated correctly, fix it:
 dpkg --reconfigure -a 
:3. Removing packages:
 apt-get remove package_name
:4. Removing package with it's dependences:
 apt-get --purge remove package_name
 apt-get autoremove
:5. Removing old versions of installation packages:
 apt-get autoclean
:6. If you don't know a package name look for it using:
 apt-cache search package_name
  or
 apt-file search package_name
:7. If you want to install &quot;bin&quot; package, make:
 sh package_name.bin
: If the package doesn't have execute rights, change it:
 chmod a+x package_name


=== Packages installation with Synaptic ===
: sidux developers suggest to install packages using &quot;apt-get&quot; command only.
: But you can do it with &quot;apt-get&quot; GUI called Synaptic, if you'd like:
 apt-get install synaptic
: Run Synaptic from: Menu-&gt; System-&gt; Synaptic Package Manager-&gt; type your root password.
:1. First icon &quot;Reload&quot; will refresh packages list.
:2. &quot;Search&quot; icon will help you to find exect software.
:3. When you recive package list mark your one clicking on &quot;Mark for installation&quot; and &quot;Apply&quot;. 
[[File:Package3.png|center|600px]]
:4. Confirm it and wait for finishing, then close Synaptic down.


=== System upgrading ===
:1. sidux developers suggest to make system upgrade using &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; &quot;apt-get&quot; command:
 apt-get update
 apt-get upgrade
  or
 apt-get dist-upgrade
:2. If you want to keep older version of a package (upgrading will not be made), just block it:
  echo package_name hold|dpkg --set-selections
::a. To check blocked packages agains upgrading:
 dpkg --get-selections | grep hold
::b. If you want unblock blocked package for upgrading it: 
 echo package_name install|dpkg --set-selections


=== Other repositories and public key ===
: If you want to install a package from other server, just add an address to repositories list
: using any text editor as a root to file:
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
:2. Then refresh package list with command:
 apt-get update
:2. If you recive a missing public key message so install it:
::a. Sofware makers have public key sometimes to download so take it.
::b. If not add a key using command:
 gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv key_ID
 gpg --export key_ID | apt-key add -


== System management ==

=== Removing old system kernel ===
: sidux makers upgrade system kernel often but they have given a small script to help removing old one easy.
:1. Menu-&gt; System-&gt; kernel-remover
:2. Mark a kernel version with lower number-&gt; then OK. 
[[File:Pakiet1.png|center|300px]]
:3. Should I remove this kernel? -&gt; OK.
[[File:Pakiet2.png|center|300px]]
: The software doesn't show present version of kernel for removing just old ones but I suggest to not
: removing all of theme, keep one old just in a case.


=== System administration ===
: If you want to make any system changes just run: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Xfce4 Settings Manager.
[[File:Package5.png|center|500px]]
: I'll show you the most important only.
:1. Preferred Applications.
::a. If you want to change any application for your one choose it from the list or &quot;Other&quot;.
[[File:Package6.png|center|500px]]
::b. If you've selected &quot;Other&quot; choose an execute script from &quot;/usr/bin&quot; or your own folder.
[[File:Package7.png|center|500px]]
:2. Removable Drives and Media.
::a. Storage tab: I suggest to not mark &quot;Auto-run&quot; and &quot;Auto-open&quot; programs and files on new drives.
[[File:Package8.png|center|500px]]
::b. Multimedia tab: Play audio or video CD's - choose any media player or do not mark it,
::: so you will run CD's files manually.
[[File:Package9.png|center|500px]]
::c. Cameras tab: Import digital photos when connected - use one of theme: gThumb, F-spot or DigiKam.
[[File:Package10.png|center|500px]]
:3. File Manager: Bahavior tab - Single or Double click to activate items to choose.
[[File:Package11.png|center|500px]]
:4. Workspaces: choose one or more.
[[File:Package12.png|center|500px]]
:5. Desktop: choose a wallpaper, icon size or media mounting on Desktop.
[[File:Package13.png|center|500px]]

[[File:Package21.png|center|500px]]


=== Working on files ===

==== Midnight Commander ====
: Sometimes you have to work on files and folders (often as a root).
: One of the best way is using terminal's Midnight Commander:
[[File:Package4.png|center|500px]]
 su
 root password
 mc 
::a. To copy a file/folder mark it in one window and click F5 key, it do that to a folder in second window.
::b. To move a file/folder use F6 key.
::c. If you want to delete a file/folder use F8.
::d. F7 key creates new folder.
::e. If you want to make a view for a file use F3 key, to edit it F4.


==== In Terminal ====
:2. Another way to make all the works is typing a command in Terminal:
::a. To create a file:
 touch /home/user_name/new_file
::b. To create folder:
 mkdir /home/user_name/folder_name
::c. To copy a file:
 cp /path_to_file /path_to_new_folder
::d. To copy a folder:
 cd -r /path_to_folder /path_to_new_folder
::e. To remove a file:
 rm /path_to_file
::f. To remove folder:
 rm -r /path_to_folder
::g. If a folder is not empty:
 rm -rf /path_to_folder
::h. To check files in a folder:
 ls
::i. To go to a folder one level lower:
 cd folder_name
::j. To go to a folder one level upper:
 cd ..
::k. To go to other folder:
 cd /folder_patch


==== Thunar ====
:  Another way to do that with graphic application is using Thunar File Manager with mouse helps menu.


=== GRUB boot loader ===
: GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a boot loader package installed in main drive sector.
: It can run many operating systems.
: There is Grub version 2 provided with sidux.
:1. If you can't find all installed systems on your hard drive on boot loader list, type in Terminal as root:
 su
 update-grub
: Changes will be effective after reboot system.
:2. If you want to change system startup delay (it's normally 5 sec.) just edit the file as root:
 sux 
 mousepad /etc/default/grub
: and change the line: GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 for any you'd like and save the file.
[[File:Package30.png|center|500px]]


: More about GRUB2 read on the project page: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-2.en.html
: And on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB


=== Time zone ===
: If your system's clock doesn't display exect time, just reconfigure it:
: Terminal as root:
 dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
: Choose a continent first and a town after.


=== Default system language ===
: To change it just type in Terminal as root:
 dpkg-reconfigure locales
: Depending of &quot;locales&quot; package version mark your language or choose from a list (I suggest UTF8).  


== Personalization ==

=== Adding new entry to Menu  ===
: Most applications installers have scripts adding entry to Menu but sometimes you have to do it yourself.
: Terminal as a root:
 sux
 mousepad /usr/share/applications/application_name.desktop
: And type it in the new file:
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=Application name
 Comment=What is it for
 Exec=/path_to_execute_file
 Icon=/path_to_graphic_file(icon)
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Categories=Application;Software-categorie
: Save the file and close Mousepad down. There is en example for &quot;Touchepad&quot; application below:
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=Touchpad
 Exec=gsynaptics
 Icon=/home/pavroo/Icons/touchpad.png
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Categories=Application;Settings;
: The icon file patch can be different.


=== Desktop theme changing ===
:1. Wallpaper: download new one from: [http://gnome-look.org/ gnome-look.org] for example or use any picture.
::a. Right click on your picture and choose: &quot;Set as wallpaper&quot;
:2. Icons: download a set of icons from the same webside.
::a. Extract it.
::b. Open Terminal as root and run &quot;mc&quot; then move extracted new icon folder to: &quot;/usr/share/icons&quot;.
::c. Choose new icon theme from: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Appearance-&gt; Icons tab-&gt; choose the new one or any.
::d. Icon size changing: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Desktop-&gt; Icons tab-&gt; Icon size.
:3. Style: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Appearance-&gt; Style tab-&gt; choose any.
:4. Login window: download new one from the same webside from DGM Themes department.
::a. Open: Menu-&gt; Settings-&gt; Login Window-&gt; Local tab.
::b. Click on &quot;Add&quot; and choose downloaded package.
::c. Mark it and close the window down, the new login style will be working after next log in.


=== Panel castomize ===
: Panel applets make faster access to many system and personal functions. I'll show you a few only.
[[File:Package22.png|center|500px]]
:1. Action Buttons lets you block desktop or shut system down in quick way.
[[File:Package29.png|center|300px]]
:2. DateTime adds a clock, date and calendar.
[[File:Package28.png|center|300px]]
:3. Weather Update brings temperature, atmosphere pressure, humidity, wind speed, etc.
[[File:Package23.png|center|300px]]
:4. Mail Watcher checks all your e-mail boxes on &quot;pop3, imap, gmail&quot; servers.

== Users and groups ==

=== User account changes ===
:1. To add new user type in Terminal as root:
 adduser new_user_name
:2. If you want to change your password type in Terminal (not as root):
 passwd
 Changing password for your_name
 Old password: ''type your present password''
 Enter the new password (minimum 5, maximum 8 characters).
 Please use a combination of upper and lower case letters and numbers.
 New password: ''type your new password''
 Re-enter new password: ''re-type your new password''
 Password changed
:3. Removing an user:
 userdel user_name
:4. Removing an user with its home folder and all files:
 userdel -r user_name


=== Root account changes ===
:1. To change root password make (if you know it):
 su
 ''type present root password''
 passwd root
 New password UNIX: ''type new root password''
 Re-enter new password for UNIX: ''re-type new root password''
:2. To change root password (if you forgot or don't know it):
::a. Run computer from sidux LiveCD or any Linux Live distribition.
::b. Open Terminal as root:
:::* check root &quot;/&quot; partition name (it's &quot;/dev/sda6&quot; on my computer):
 su or sudo (depends of Live distribution)
 fdisk -l
:::* create new folder &quot;sid_temp&quot; for example in &quot;media&quot; folder:
 mkdir /media/sid_temp
:::* mount root &quot;/&quot; partition of hard drive file system in Live system:
 mount /dev/sda6 /media/sid_temp
:::* check has been it mounted correctly:
 cd /media/sid_temp
 ls
:::* and change unknown root password for new one:
 chroot /media/sda6 passwd
 Enter new UNIX password:
 Retype new UNIX password:
 passwd: password updated successfully
[[File:Pakiet32.png|center|600px]]


=== Operations on groups ===
:1. To create a new group:
 groupadd group_name
:2. To remove a group:
 groupdel group_name
:3. To add an user to a group:
 adduser user_name group_name


== Security ==

=== Basic informations ===
:1. The main system security thing is the system itself becouse the system is locked with root password;
:: demaging it is very difficult.
:2. Linux file system is virus-proof for most known malwares.
:3. Regular updating remove mistakes and provides new applications functions.


=== Firewall ===
: The firewall keeps out incoming access to your computer from outside.
: So the first thing after system installation is the firewall activation.
: You can do that in a few ways, just have a look: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sidux/Post-installation_work#Firewall Sidux/Post-installation work/Firewall]


=== Antivirus application ===
: Sincerely - you don't need it at all but you can use it for outgoing e-mails scanning
: - most our friends use diffrent operating system; and for external drives scanning befor
: connecting theme to the diffrent OS.


: If you'd like try an antivirus application avilable from Debian's repositories ClamAV with KlamAV GUI:
 apt-get install clamav klamav
: More about ClamAV here: [http://www.clamav.net/ clamav.net] and on Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clam_AntiVirus Clam AntiVirus]

=== Rootkits ===
: Rootkit is a dengerous tool hidding processes with can take control of your computer over.
: A tool for looking for and removing rootkits from linux system is ''chkrootkit''.
: Install it in Terminal:
 apt-get install chkrootkit
: To scan your operating system run the command:
 chkrootkit

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Judenplatz museum stands on the site of a synagogue that was destroyed in 1421, after having only been standing for one year.  The Judenplatz museum in Vienna honors the 65,000 Austrian Jews who were killed by the Nazi’s during the holocaust. The unique façade is intended to honor those dead. The building’s architect designed the memorial as a cube, representing a library with books turned inside out, along the outer wall. 

It is possible for anyone in the world to look up the historical information on anyone of the 65,000 individuals who died during the Holocaust. In that sense the effect of the event has become global. Jewish citizens who cannot visit Prague may now look up the background of an ancestor who they are connected too. Also researchers can use information from that period to better solidify their own studies of the period.

In Prague, the oldest Jewish cemetery dates back to 1439. It is located in the Jewish quarter of Prague in a town named Josefov. The town was named after a late ruler of Czechoslovakia who was a staunch supporter of the Jewish community. The Jewish cemetery is noteworthy because of the density of individuals buried at the site. Before being closed to burials, it eventually accepted 200,000 residents of the Jewish community. When navigating the cemetery grounds a person will not see nameplates on the stones. In place of a name will be a unique marker such as an animal, instrument, or other item that represents the name and the individuals place in society. The cemetery recently made global news when First Lady Michelle Obama took a tour of the site.

Neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism is a problem that affects both Austria and the Czech Republic. In 1947 Austria passed a very strict anti-Neo Nazi law that goes as far as offering police protection to places the Jewish community frequent. Recent population records in Austria report the Jewish population being at 8 million. In the Czech Republic there are laws that prevent public displays of hate against the Jewish community. Despite the law supporters of the neo-Nazi ideology still openly propagate their message in public, through protests. In Austria a recent example from May of 2009 suggests that neo-Nazi supporters are capable of carrying out attacks against the Jewish community. A ground of masked gunmen attacked, with “air gun pellets”, a procession of Jewish concentration camp survivors. 

The United States Department of State reports on issues of anti-Semitism around the world and in the Czech Republic in recent years there have been numerous examples of young people who deface Jewish gravestones with swastikas and for the use of language such as “Heil Hitler.” In Austria the issue is much worse. In 2003 there was 122 reported incidents with the worst being a bomb threat at a Jewish school.

Some exercises are optional and some are more suited to certain types of ocarinas.  '''We need a way to tab the some of the exercises with various different tabs'''.

'''This Chapter should be divided up into Lessons and as a starting point the Mezzetti music should be added here.  Further discussion can be had on the discussion page.'''

{{TODO|Download the Mezzetti book, pick a musical lesson that has not been posted and transcribe it in your favourite composing software editor.  Export the files and upload them here, licensing them so that we can do whatever we want with them.}}

==Introduction==

A keymap is a keyboard layout for foreign languages. Like for example the german keyboard has a different layout (the 'ä', 'ö' and 'ü' keys and other german special keys) and a keymap 'maps' the keys to the right characters for the programs. 

Here is a list of the AROS symbol and the different Kickstart symbol shown for several key combinations. 

&lt;pre&gt;
Alt-1: inverted exclamation mark (¡) / superscript 1 (¹)
Alt-2: @ / superscript 2 (²)
Alt-3: £ / superscript 3 (³)
Alt-4: Euro (€) / cent (¢)
Alt-5: half (½) / quarter (¼)
Alt-6: three-quarters (¾) / half (½)
Alt-7: { / three-quarters (¾)
Alt-8: [ / bullet (•)
Alt-9: ] / left chevron («)
Alt-0: } / right chevron (»)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, in Kickstart pressing Alt and various letters shows a variety of symbols. With the AROS default keymap doing that just shows the letter itself.

==Introduction==

The oop.library allows drivers to use a OO (Object Oriented design). HIDDs are another example of OO usage in AROS.

==Examples==






==Discussion only - OOP Binary Object Model?==

The case for a binary object model. The ability to be able to use C++ and other programming languages from a VM that statically compiles at install time, especially if you want to ditch the JIT in the process.

Also, I'll be needing to wrap any usage of OS-specific structures or variables in a library that links at install time as well.  This could simply be a hosted AROS though. 

But Amiga style libraries are not objects in any meaningful way. The object-orientation in AmigaOS are not centered around libraries, but around other structures. Moving towards more OO might be interesting, but adding interfaces to the libraries isn't achieving that. 

In order to do OOP as a binary object model, I got the source to Marius Schwarz' [http://aminet.net/package/dev/misc/oop4a OOP4a]. There were some serious flaws in it.  It used linear searches to find the names of the commands and didn't support interface inheritance.  I know how to do Java-style interfaces in a .library but the dependence on the linear name lookups made things unusable.

When I started making my Object.library implementation I decided that interface inheritance is preferable to multiple inheritance because it yields no dreaded diamond dependencies.  I used hash tables to do name lookups instead of a linear search and wrote it in C rather than 68k Assembly.  I'm not quite sure how AROS does its library headers without FD files but I realize that they have to be processor independent on AROS.

This brings us back to the subject:  A binary object model.  OOP4a used subdirectories within libs:classes/ on 68k AmigaOS to indicate the inheritance structure hierarchy of the prototype class libraries that it came with.  This would keep the namespaces separate from between the libraries so that no object would interfere with the name of another object (within reason).  I was going to use a separate interface file for each interface in a libs:interfaces/ directory that would be a global repository of all interfaces other than the direct inheritance interface (referred to on OS 4 as &quot;main&quot;).  The direct inheritance interface could be contained in the same directory as the library it defines even though my original plan was to use a hash table for the name lookup.

The way inheritance was implemented in OOP4a was for a parent link to be held in the library's global area in the positive offsets of A6.  This meant that when opening a class library, its parent directory would be accessed and the parent library opened initiating recursion leading up to root class where a null was encountered.  In my Object.library implementation the Object.library class was the root class anyway thus eliminating some specialized cases where a parent class might not have a name lookup, and so on.

oop.library is doing some of these things but I'm convinced it is the right way to do this.
I do like Amiga LVO tables over hash tables to avoid the name binding during load. I could maybe live with one hash table for the directories and then LVO tables in each directory. 

I think the OS4 interfaces of the libraries are actually doing this also. It allows to have different interfaces in one library with each having their own name and LVO table. 

It does require that the developer tells which method or function comes at which place in the LVO table during compilation of the library though.

Recreating OS 4-style interface tables is easy. What bothers me about the interfaces is that you need a pointer to the interface in whatever register (preferably a different register for each interface on PPC and other register-rich processors).  I'd assume that the base pointer for the library would be contained in the interface structure as well.

After having heard the objections to the hash table name lookup, I can tell that it would be slow to open such a library.  Likewise the inheritance chain would be even slower since it would have to execute a name lookup for each stage of direct inheritance until it was resolved.  This brings us to the big question:  How would we store the interfaces if they were more than just a name?  Fat pointers?  Making the hash lookup faster by using the same hash for each stage of inheritance?

A framework should not require a name-mangling scheme but instead, uses subdirectories within libs: to organize the namespace dependencies and support Java-style interface inheritance as well.  The downside is that I'm planning on using hash-tables of names instead of requiring FD or SFD files like AmigaOS does for its libraries to initialize its vtables.

When I looked at the source to OOP.library I didn't like the way that it did everything at runtime.  I was going to make Object.library to supplement OOP.library.  Do you think that would be suitable or should it be added directly to Exec.library like OS 4 does it?  My concern with doing it too much like OS 4 does it is that OS 4 has a utility to generate the C skeleton code from XML descriptors derived from an SFD file.  This means that making a compiler for a language other than C to generate libraries, that makes things very tricky.

In order to allow LLVM to generate code for multiple flavors of AROS, I have to replace or wrap some functions of the C runtime library in other code to make sure that they don't make assumptions about variable sizes and structure sizes. 
In GCC sizeof and offsetof are rendered as macros for minimum overhead but this gets in the way of portability so they will need to be implemented with functions.

If we wanted to take it a step or two farther and make it generate code for all OSs, we'd need to make no assumptions about the structures themselves, thus FILE * would have to be replaced by void * (or i8 * as LLVM represents it; a pointer to a byte) in every instance in the wrapper code only to be reverted to FILE * at second link time on the destination platform.  For an early attempt at wrapping the C stdio.h headers in cross-platform LLVM code, you can look at the project the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/llvmlibc/ Mattathias] team started at in the SVN browser. 

Clearly the LVO method is faster at load time, and load time linking can be *slow* - witness apps like OpenOffice where optimizing load time linking has been a significant part of speeding up the application startup on Linux. But I'm unsure how much it would matter in most cases...

There's also nothing that precludes supporting/using both direct offsets and offering name lookups. E.g. I'm plodding along on a Ruby compiler (in Ruby), and while I use C++ style vtables where possible, it also needs to support name lookups because if certain constructs are used in Ruby you can't determine at compile time the full set of method names that will be used, and you also need to support &quot;send&quot; which means it needs a name =&gt; method mapping. So I have the vtables, but will add a hash table that maps names to vtable slots for cases where it's not feasible to determine the offset at compile time.

E.g. adding a function pointer to the library definitions that can be used to query the library for meta-data such as name =&gt; lvo lookup at runtime would be a fairly non-invasive change that would only slow down apps that for whatever reason actually need name based lookup.





As for the OOP method used in AmigaOS and AROS, that is slow on a whole another level... It made sense on Amiga hardware because it can be made very memory efficient, but there are approaches that can be made far faster and allow the same extensibility... I'm not sure if it matters though - one thing we really ought to have for both cases would be some real measurements and profiling..

The practical use case was never introduced on OS4, unfortunately. What the OS4 interfaces try to mimic a little bit, is the COM known on Windows or XPCOM known from mozilla suite. There, you have objects which can implement several interfaces, all of them inherited from IUnknown. 

The COM method QueryInterface is replaced in exec by exec.library/GetInterface. The COM/XPCOM solution can, in contrast to OS4 version, be called on *any* interface we want. COM-style objects would serve the same type of purpose on OS 4 if there were additional programming languages available.  Unfortunately there are none. C++ classes need interfaces to implement themselves in a binary library format though.

This [https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARruTS7x_Cf8ZGZxanZ2c2RfMWN4aHpqMmQ2&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CLOrsRk link] has some C-like pseudo-code demonstrating the implementations and usages of an interface in an interface-inheritance chain. 

This [https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ARruTS7x_Cf8ZGZxanZ2c2RfMGM4cTQ1dGNw&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CMuW7ooK link] is a higher-level pseudo-code if you want a guide to how the low-level C code works.

None at the moment. And, as far as I know, only few system libraries are using anything else than the &quot;main&quot; interface (most famous example is expansion.library and it's pci interface)

I suggest reading [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:f4f3KSDwFEMJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.42.9750%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dps+protocol+extension+franz&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk this] for inspiration:

Protocol Extension: A technique for Structuring Large Extensible Software Systems (Dr. Michael Franz, 1994)

Protocol Extension uses vtables, but allows them to be dynamically updated at runtime by propagating changes down the inheritance chain.Calls are far faster than Amiga/AROS BOOPSI-style dispatch - the vtable for the most derived classes always holds the right method pointer to call, so the cost compared to C++ virtual calls is just an extra indirection.

The downside is that plain vtables would grow large if the class hierarchy is large since every class vtable needs a slot for every possible method. This can be mitigated by splitting the API's into smaller interfaces that are not inherited from a single root class, in effect creating a shallow, sparse trie of method pointers.

You still have the lookup cost if you want name based lookup of course, but for apps that can be compiled against a symbol table containing the static method id's you very good performance with flexibility as good as dispatcher function based OO systems like BOOPSI (as you can add/remove methods at runtime as long as the vtables are big enough, with a fallback to a dispatcher as the worst case for fully dynamic calls).

(incidentally Franz' wrote his PhD on a method for architecture independent binaries called Semantic Dictionary Encoding; more recently his claim to fame is trace trees, together with Andreas Gal, as used by TraceMonkey and LuaJIT)





I think I may limit the subdirectory thing to namespace resolution.  Other than that, most of what I had already written looks good.  I planned on having LVOs as well as a name lookup originally.  This saves me from having a separate file for the method names in the interface files.  Also, unlike the Protocol Extension technique, I'll maintain a root class since it only defined a &quot;toString&quot; method anyway, though I may rename the method &quot;DebugPrint&quot;.

I thought at least in part it was to cope with the `problem' that amigaos libraries can only version forward and must remain 100% backward compatible.  The only real way to reset the interfaces to remove deprecated snot is to put a version in the library name, and then you're stuck with lots of libraries.  Of course except for amigaos-only libraries there's no practical way to do anything else, so the usefulness of this idea probably isn't huge.  I think it's used for things like MMU support too which are system specific.

But as with system libraries in general it isn't really a solution intended for application programming which is why boopsi was created.

Note that the 'C-object' based mechanism (i.e. structs in structs) has lots of shortcomings too.  This is what glib and gtk+ uses and after a lot of over-engineering they managed to address most problems - such as structure sizes growing breaking binary compatibility (store a separate private data chunk which is allocated and used more like the
way boopsi allocates objects), add interfaces (look it up in a cast at run-time called from a simple function), property handlers, events, and so on.  But it's big, slow, hard to use requires a ton of boilerplate, and in general just not very nice ... it's been a few years since I've used it but I don't think the core has changed much since then.

* every public function (and most internal ones, sigh) has a 'cast'  macro which checks the class type of the object using a tree scan, or a linear scan iirc for interfaces (actually most USERS of an object do another cast which did this
same check too - so error messages point to the source ...) (and usually every member access either uses a macro too or calls another function which does, or uses the get/set interface) 
* private data requires a class lookup (same as boopsi for data pointer), and also means every object instantiation is at least 2 allocated memory blocks 
* IIRC every 'property' is keyed on a string which it has to look up in a global table to convert to a dynamic integer which then needs an if/then if/else tree to process since it isn't static (i.e. much worse than boopsi).
* the event handling was stuff of nightmares, i don't think anybody deserves to know how that works.

Note that a lot of the mess was supposedly to support language bindings to things other than c.

It's possible to fix some of that with a simpler implementation but you're still stuck with some serious limitations since it is essentially a static binding.  So it's still difficult to cope with versioning and binary compatibility and dynamic interfaces. 

x86 is particularly good at executing crappy branchy code, and cpu's are so damn fast anyway i doubt moving to another outdated technique will really be worth it unless you gained a lot.  And by the time you add all the necessary baggage I have a good feeling you probably wont. There are always trade-offs ...

Also depends on the problem being fixed.  e.g. 'i want to write/call system libraries in/from c++' is different to 'i want a c-based application level object system'. 

I am not satisfied with our current oop.library implementation. So I did not put any effort in it as I first want to improve the whole OO system. I find there is still too much happening during a method call. I have some ideas but no time to test if my ideas make any sense. If anyone wants to have a look I can try to put down my rough &amp; vague ideas.

==Introduction==


The AOS3 icon info has a priority adjuster. Wonder how the priority can be stored in an icon. These priority adjusters are features of RAWBInfo. workbench.lib's own info window will display them as tooltypes. The normal &quot;Priority&quot; setting corresponds to the TOOLPRI tooltype which is mapped to the NP_Priority tag for CreateNewProc() in workbench.library. For autostart applications in SYS:WBStartup RAWBInfo will display two additional elements for the launch sequence priority (STARTPRI=&lt;-128..+127&gt;) and the optional delay to wait for the application to terminate (WAIT=&lt;seconds&gt;, seconds==0 means 'don't wait'). All tooltypes default to zero.

Please, don't forget to change the array &quot;layout_expansion_table&quot; in the file &quot;workbench/prefs/input/prefs.c&quot; when you add/change keymap names. 



===SetFunction===


Its been pointed out that workbench.library may be better implemented by merging Workbook and workbench.library.
Wanderer would Exec/SetFunction the routines it needs to override, instead of using the rather limited message passing mechanism we currently have. 

If there are no objections, I would like to implement this, by merging Workbook and workbench.library, and updating Wanderer to SetFunction the necessary parts of workbench.library. Well, its against the philosophy of the AROS implementation of workbench.library (which is meant to be &quot;client&quot; agnostic) - however ive already started using SetFunction localy anyhow in my own code. It does mean I will have to rework my AppIcon/Menu code though. 
In the past people have been talking about some kind of registration API in workbench.library. So that any Workbench implementation like Workbook, Wanderer, ScaleOS could register so that they get the needed information when workbench.library function are called. This way also several workbench implementation could be registered at the same time. 




===AppIcon===

I have a questions about AppIcon interfaces.

Currently the interactions look like this:

Application &lt;--A-&gt; workbench.library &lt;-B-&gt; &quot;workbench replacement&quot;

The interfaces between application and workbench.library (A) are public and defined since release 2.0. On the other hand, I was not able to locate any information about interfaces between workbench.library and &quot;workbench replacement&quot; (B). I checked Amiga Developer CD 2.1 RKMS, AmigaOS 4 SDK and MorphOS SDK.

Does anyone know if there is any standardization on this interface between Amiga-like OSs?

Does anyone know how &quot;Workbench replacement&quot; application on Classic Amigas are doing it? Are they providing their own workbench.library replacements/function patches? That is the normal behaviour.  AROS's workbench.library is more of a special case, and &quot;tries&quot; to be generic.  Normally it is down to the workbench replacements to implement their own workbench.library, or patch the functions in the original. 

Additionally, were there any designs and plans in the past to implement the AROS specific interface for (B)? I checked our workbench.library and it has some AROS-specific functions, but this support looks like work-in-progress rather than finished/frozen API.

Is this (patching) also the way you want to port Scalos to AROS? It seems to me each &quot;Workbench replacement&quot; will have to carry some amount of duplicated code this way - for example registering appicons and communication with them. I'm wondering whether it would not make sense to redo current AROS extension functions to allow sending messages from &quot;Workbench replacement&quot; to Application via workbench.library - there already is one such function in the API - SendAppWindowMessage




===Alternatives===

The task of making a new Wanderer file browser, could involve making it a bit more modular one that includes an abstraction layer to allow different types of items to be displayed in it.  Case in point:  An object-oriented graphical programming language could be implemented in the plugin format to make an AmigaVision-style scripting engine.  Since it would be fully graphical and use the analogy of a directory structure, it would bring many people into the high-level programming arena to contribute code.

This isn't the first time the idea has been brought up. It was discussed once before on [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?viewmode=flat&amp;topic_id=3827&amp;forum=2 AROS-Exec]. 

Want to make the browser aspect kind of like a datatype for directory structures and other hierarchical data formats.  (XML, anyone?)  Maybe we could even make the new Wanderer like a Multiview and Workbench rolled into one program. Of course this should be a longer-term goal than ABI 1.0 so it would be a worthy goal for AROS 2.0. 

For the long term solution, I'd suggest making AROS extensions to workbench.library and icon.library which multiple apps can register with, use and get notifications. If remember correctly this should already be the case or the basics should be available in workbench.library. See RegisterWorkbench()/UnregisterWorkbench(); appicon support seems not available. App developers should be able to give users a workbench like experience on their own screens (for example open a drawer and show the icons of only PNG files and let the user drag it over to a document they're working on) as well as allowing a system wide workbench functions to operate on multiple public screens, or give  the user the freedom to have multiple &quot;workbench&quot; programs running at the same time to decide what they like best, if they so choose. 

The commodore examples for AppMenu, AppIcon, AppWindow are available in the Aminet archive  http://aminet.net/dev/misc/AmigaMail.lha 

uncompress the lzh file in the downloaded lha archive and look in the am_Jul91/AppWorkbench directory. 

While generally in favour of trying to implement things in a generic way - while working on wanderer I came to the conclusion that it would be pointless/overkill. 

* It will likely only be ever fully used by Wanderer (and perhaps workbook).  It makes no sense for existing Workbench replacements to have their internals reworked just to be able to use these specific extensions. 

* It would mean backporting Wanderer to amigaos/other also needs the special workbench.library. 

* It already has had some hard coded wanderer specific and workbook specific changes.  It would be easier to maintain these in patch functions (imho) 

* The existing functions only expose the appicon/menu objects themselves so the &quot;handler&quot; has no way to communicate to the applications themselves with the need to invent more aros specific functions.  Even the implemented code is incomplete (it lacks the ability to inform the handler a new object is added for instance).  It would be easier to maintain handler specific implementations of this stuff imho (since it is very much tied to the workings of the handler in question) 

* How WorkbenchControlA will operate is also undefined. 

... + a few other reasons.

==Introduction==

The arosc library only allows that one task at a time calls a function with the same libbase. AFAIK this does not break any standards. In a later stage a thread implementation will be provided that will to do proper locking around the C functions that need, this should also be usable when you implement your own thread implementation. 

Current arosc is not thread-save and the C libs in ABI V1 neither. The best way to get is have a front-end similar to clib2-ts on AROS. 

YAM is not using any threading library but its own thread implementation. And even if it would use stuff like pthreads it is the C runtime lib's task to protect its internal stuff from race conditions. No thread framework is able to take this load off the C lib, because this is internal stuff. 

For AROS' arosc.library a simple ObtainSemaphore()/ReleaseSemaphore() pair around all implicit and explicit accesses to the __stdio_files list would be a good start. However, there will very probably be many more locations which require enforced single threading to avoid race conditions. 

As an intermediate solution already a static link library can be provided that does the proper locking around the function that need it, e.g. arosc-ts (analog to clib2-ts). 

Perhaps you should contact Olaf Barthel and port over his clib2 to AROS. I already asked him and he has no objections against such a port. The more systems use clib2 the more possible bugs will be found.
I think clib2 C implementation as a static link library would complement the AROS C shared libraries for the programs that depend on certain clib2 peculiarities. 

This may be a bit naive, we may need to consider an OpenLibrary() of the AROS C *shared* library for each thread. That eliminates the locking issue, we just need to make the AROS C data area private to each thread.

This may need some headers and linker support, but it should be much easier to implement than a full locking implementation, and would be a lightweight code change. That is not what users want. They want to be able to have one thread do IO with a file opened by another thread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To upload files with music you can do the following:

Write your music with software and 
#export to .ogg for sound
#make the music into some sort of small picture file
#make the other source files available somewhere
#upload the .ogg and picture files by following the instructions below:

ctrl + click upload in the left menu to open the upload page, then click on &quot;basic uploader&quot;, hidden under that list of options.  This lets you use a template for uploading.  It takes you to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;uploadformstyle=basic].  All you have to do is write
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(({{Information |Description={{en|1=WHICH PIECE OF MUSIC IS IT}} |Source=WHERE IS IT FROM |Author=WHO WROTE THE PIECE AND WHO MADE THE FILE |Date=YYYY-MM-DD |Permission=A SPECIAL LICENSE TAG |other_versions=M)}})&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and fill in the things in caps.

If the music is from the Mezzetti book, that special tag is &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD-Old}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which means it was published in the US before 1923.

Here is an example tag for a mezzetti piece.
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(({{Information |Description={{en|1=Creation date approximate. Musical piece 1 of 3}} |Source=Page 11 Mezzetti method book |Author=Music by Mezzetti, file created by Alejandro Erickson |Date=1870-01-01 |Permission={{PD-Old}} |other_versions=M)}})&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This chapter, as mentioned in the previous, is about using the particle model to explain the three states of matter.

== To explain the three states ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! State
! Model
! Explanation
|-
| Solid
| [[File:Solid particles.svg|200px]]
| In solids, the particles are cramped together tightly in regular positions, and they can only vibrate (wobble) a little, but in fixed positions. Their positions cannot change freely, as a result.
|-
| Liquid
| [[File:Teilchenmodell Fluessigkeit.svg]]
| In liquids, the positions of particles are not fixed like in solids, but the particles cannot move as freely as those in gas, as they can only slide over one another. They are arranged irregularly.
|-
| Gas
| [[File:Gas particle movement.svg|200px]]
| In gases, the positions of particles can alter easily, as the particles move at random directions very quickly. The particles are not packed tightly like those of the two states above, and are arranged irregularly. The particles can be very far apart!
|}

== To exaplain the properties of each of the states ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! State
! Model(s)
! Flexibility of shape
! Compressibility
|-
| Solid
| [[File:Solid particles incompressible.svg|200px]]
| Solids have a fixed shape; their shape cannot be altered.
| Solids have a fixed volume; you cannot compress them.
|-
| Liquid
| [[File:Teilchenmodell Fluessigkeit.svg|200px]]
[[File:Liquid model.svg|143px]]
| Liquids do not have fixed shapes. As you can see, the shape can alter depending on the shape of the container.
| Liquids have a fixed volume. You can see from the model that there are the same number of liquid particles and that the size of the particles are the same.
|-
| Gas
| [[File:Gas particles in a square.svg]]&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Gas particles in a triangle.svg]]
| Gas particles do not have a fixed shape so you can safely bend them and they won't even break. In the model, the shape of the particles changed from the shape of a square and the shape of a triangle.
| Gas particles are perfectly compressible, as opposed to the above two. That means you can press it and it will actually become smaller. Then if you put them in a really big container, it will spread all around the container, through [[../Diffusion|diffusion]]. Note that the triangle here is a lot smaller than the square.
|-
|}

== Quiz ==
#Briefly explain, in your own words, the different properties of the three states of matter and arrangement and movement of their particles.
#Go to the library or search the Internet about 'plasma' the 'fourth' state of matter, and write about 200 words about it.

Answers will vary.

As there are [http://www.google.com.hk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;aq=hts&amp;oq=&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGLL_en-GBHK347&amp;q=In+this+paradoxical+universe+the+pursuit+to+discover+its+mysteries+is+limitless.+The+more+we+know%2c two scribd with exactly the same text], and I discovered that there is a scribd book called 'who am I', which means it is either a copyvio or a coi.

&lt;s&gt;{{trans}}&lt;/s&gt;  I feel it fails to fall under our scope. There are no references give, or that I know of, and this seems indistinguishable from original research to me.  But, since it appears to have been published elsewhere, and appears to have a free license, it would fall under [[s:Wikisource:What_is_Wikisource|Wikisource]].  If we can verify it was published in some form elsewhere we should transwiki it. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:07, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{del}} I did a little further investigating.  A transwiki doesn't make sense, as this book used to be at Wikisource. It then got deleted over copyright concerns, but still occurs as a redlink at [[s:Author:Shriram_Sharma_Acharya]].  Basically this is a previously published work which is not annotated.  Per our policy on annotated texts, &quot;..we do not permit verbatim copies of pre-existing works...&quot; So this book doesn't fall under our scope.  If someone is looking for it, and it really is freely available, they can request an undeletion at wikisource.

{{del}} - I have to say that the phrase &quot;copyright concerns&quot; rather caught my eye. If it's possible copyvio at Wikisource, should we not also be concerned about it being possible copyvio here?

:I have noticed, and updated it. I don't think it should be in Languages as much as Linguistics, as it is not a separate language from English in the way Scots is, per se. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:67.183.16.193|67.183.16.193]] ([[User talk:67.183.16.193|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/67.183.16.193|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''  Before my reasons, let me point out for the benefit of other readers, this was nominated for deletion previously, and its discussion can be read [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/AAVE|here]].  I agree this seems to be a very stalled stub.  I say we provisionally keep it.  The hope being under Linguistics, someone interested will find it and improve it.  But I feel if it has not recieved significant attention within... say a year, it would be appropriate to delete it.

:Hi, I'm new to Wiki, but not so to Linguistics and I saw the original page for this and knew it needed some updates. As i'm figuring out all the interfaces here I will be updating the AAVE page as well as similar ones, so hopefully there'll be no reason to delete a topic as interesting as AAVE [[User:Sociolinguist|Sociolinguist]] ([[User talk:Sociolinguist|talk]]) 08:26, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

==Introduction==

The preparation for trial can be summarized generally into 
# develop the theory and theme(s) for your case
# outline the elements that you need to prove to be successful in your case
# select the witnesses and exhibits you will call 
##match at least one witness to each of the elements needed to be proven
##evaluate the witnesses based on their purpose, and
##identify problems they may present
# outline cross examinations of the otherside's witnesses
# review your theory, themes,and outlines

==Organizing the File==

===Trial Materials===
There are a number of endorsed methods of preparing and organizing materials for trial. There is:
# the Trial Brief and Trial Book&lt;ref&gt;JW McElhaney, ''Trial Notebook''&lt;/ref&gt;
# the Trial Notebook &lt;ref&gt;David Baum, ''Art of Advocacy Preparation''&lt;/ref&gt;
# the Trial Folder &lt;ref&gt;LR booth, &quot;Throw away your trial notebook&quot; (1988) 24 Trial 53&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Trial Brief and Notebook====
A '''trial brief''' and '''trial book''' are documents that contain all the materials that you will need for trial. 

The '''trial brief''' consists of all official documents and materials relevant to the trial matter. That should be on hand during the trial 
proceedings.
 
This should include:
# the indictment or information that outline the charges
# a summary of the case 
# investigation materials 
# police notes 
# witness statements
# medical/expert reports
# court orders
# other official documents (driving abstracts, etc.)
# demonstrative evidence
# correspondence
# legal memos
# case law

The '''trial book''' contains mostly the advocates work-product. This includes:
# a to do list
# witness list
# elements of the offence and an analysis of them
# Exhibit list
# notes for any motions
# outline of opening address
# notes for witness examinations 
# notes of evidence to present
# outline of closing address 
# notes on the charge to the jury
# potential grounds of appeal

===Motions===
The advocate must consider whether to prepare motions for the commencement of trial and equally whether motions from the opposing side are to be anticipated. 

Motions to be considered at the outset:
* exclusion of witnesses
* exclusion of evidence (notice required)
* adjournment
* directed verdict
* severance
* change of venue
* quashing the indictment

==Preparing Witnesses==
Counsel should prepare all essential witnesses who provide non-trivial evidence in trial. 

The most important goal is to refresh the witnesses memory of the incident. Counsel should speak with the witnesses and review the facts of the case and have them review their prior statement.

Counsel should also consider:
* the order in which to call witnesses 
* whether the client wishes to testify

==Effective Presentation and Style==
A trial, in many respects, is a performance with as much drama as is found on TV or on film. Likewise, persuasion exists not just on the level of the substance of a presentation but also in the form of presentation. As such, the advocate's style of presentation can  be just as important as the actual content and structure of an argument. An effective style may come naturally to some, but others will need to practice and refine their presentation to be an effective advocate.

An effective advocate will have control over their voice and body language while presenting. It is a whole package.

Confidence is key. You must appear to be in charge from the very beginning.

===Voice===
There are certain necessary qualities of an effective voice.
* speak slowly
* speak clearly
* speak loudly

===Body language===
Qualities of good body language:
* look the person you are addressing in the eye
* good posture
* take up space with your body

Much of a person's communication comes from non-verbal sources. A nervous tick or a habit that connotes uncertainty or weakness will have an impression on the audience. Negative unconscious body language must be eliminated.

Actions that should be avoided:
* slouching
* fidgeting with papers
* looking down too much
* rocking back and forth
* too much politeness and deference

===Use of Notes===
While having prepared materials for trial are essential, it is generally said that extemporaneous presentation is more effective and persuasive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Energy Change ==
Energetics is all about the energy transfer involved in the  making and breaking of bonds.  The breaking of a bond involves the injection of energy into the system so that the bond can no longer hold the parts together; the creation of bonds involves the removal of energy from the system so that components are captured by the binding forces.  In a typical reaction some bonds are broken and some are created so some energy is injected and some is removed.  Whether the total(net) of these amounts to an injection or removal determines whether the reaction is endothermic (involving an net injection of energy) or exothermic (involving a net removal of energy.)

== Enthalpy change (ΔH) ==

The simple idea described above is complicated by the interaction of the system(reaction) being studied and its environment. This interaction amounts to the changes in volume of the system brought about by the reaction.  To deal with this complexity we introduce the idea of enthalpy(given the symbol H). Enthalpy is not measured directly: we concern ourselves instead with CHANGES in enthalpy (ΔH) resulting from a reaction.

For a given reaction change in Enthalpy is equal to the heat energy change under conditions of constant pressure.

===Exothermic===
*negative ΔH
Such reactions include the combustion of a fuel like methane
CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)                = -890kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
Also including the oxicdation of carbohydrates such sa glucose C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

===Endothermic===
*positive ΔH
Such reactions include the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate
CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) → CaO (s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)                                               = +178kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

;Enthalpy change
:The heat energy transferred under constant pressure.
:ΔH = ΔH products – ΔH reactants

;Standard conditions
We often deal with enthalpy change under standard conditions. i.e.
:100kPa, 298K
;Standard enthalpy of formation
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H^{\ominus}_f&lt;/math&gt;
:The enthalpy change when 1 mole of compound in its standard state is formed from its elements in their standard states (under standard conditions).
;Standard enthalpy of combustion
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H^{\ominus}_c&lt;/math&gt;
:The enthalpy change when 1 mole of substance is completely burned in oxygen under standard conditions.

== Calorimetry ==
===Calculating energy changes===

*&lt;math&gt;q=mc \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;
** heat energy = mass of substance x specific heat capacity x temperature change
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = \frac{q}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
**enthalpy change = heat energy / moles

== Hess's Law ==

;Hess's Law
:The overall enthalpy change is independent of the route the chemical reaction takes place.

== Bond Enthalpies ==
===Bond Enthalpy===
*Energy/enthalpy needed to break/dissociate a bond averaged over different molecules.
*Always positive because breaking bonds requires energy.
*&lt;math&gt;\Delta H^\ominus_r = \Sigma \Delta H^\ominus_r (bonds\ broken) - \Sigma \Delta H^\ominus_r (bonds\ made)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or OPEC was originally formed among a group of Persian Gulf nations in response to the United States refusal to buy oil from the region. Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, Venezuela were the founding nations. Over the years the organization grew with more members. The rest of the member states joined in 1973. Those states include Indonesia, Libya, Algiers, and Gabon. Ecuador joined in 1973 but later withdrew itself from the organization. OPEC controls oil prices by regulating the production of oil among its member nations, therefore creating balance in the market. 

The organization faced a dire situation in 1975 when it came under attack from a terrorist ground led by llich Ramirez Sanchez. The armed group stormed into the room where oil ministers were meeting and after killing several people, took the oil ministers and nearly 70 people hostage. They forced the oil ministers to read propaganda on the airwaves. 

Vienna, Austria is the current location that houses OPEC. Vienna along with the Austrian government makes efforts to provide lodgings when OPEC holds it annual meetings, which bring over a 1000 people into the city. In return OPEC spends nearly its entire 20 million Euro budget in Austria. OPEC provides money for social institutions.

In 1975 after the ministers of OPEC first gathered in Algiers, they laid the groundwork for a financial institution that would be able to promote economic development in the southern hemisphere. This organization is now known as OFID or the OPEC Fund for International Development. This is an institution that is directly connected to OPEC. The ministers make voluntary donations but also utilize public sector money in offering grants to those in need. At the end of April 2010 1,205 grants were dispersed among 125 countries, totaling $483 million USD.

OPEC and OFID are globally important institutions. Due to the economic connections that countries now have through fuel needs, OPEC has become an important mediator of the issue.  OPEC is as only as strong as its member nations and Saudi Arabia is its strongest member. In the early 1980s the country made huge sacrifices on profits to keep OPEC quotas. OPEC has the power to fine nations that veer away from their set production quotas. The fines are needed because too much oil on the market could drive down the price too low and could be costly for everyone involved.

Humans do not need gene therapy to survive, though it may prove helpful to treat certain diseases. Special gene modification research has been carried out on groups such as the 'bubble children' - those whose immune systems do not protect them from the bacteria and irritants all around them. The first clinical trial of human gene therapy began in 1990, but (as of 2008) is still experimental. Other forms of human genetic engineering are still theoretical, or restricted to fiction stories. Recombinant DNA research is usually performed to study gene expression and various human diseases. Some drastic demonstrations of gene modification have been made with mice and other animals, however; testing on humans is generally considered off-limits. In some instances changes are usually brought about by removing genetic material from one organism and transferring them into another species.

There are two main types of genetic engineering. Somatic modifications involve adding genes to cells other than egg or sperm cells. For example, if a person had a disease caused by a defective gene, a healthy gene could be added to the affected cells to treat the disorder. The distinguishing characteristic of somatic engineering is that it is non-inheritable, e.g. the new gene would not be passed to the recipient’s offspring.

Germline engineering would change genes in eggs, sperm, or very early embryos. This type of engineering is inheritable, meaning that the modified genes would appear not only in any children that resulted from the procedure, but in all succeeding generations. This application is by far the more consequential as it could open the door to the perpetual and irreversible alteration of the human species.

There are two techniques researchers are currently experimenting with:
* Viruses are good at injecting their DNA payload into human cells and reproducing it. By adding the desired DNA to the DNA of non-pathogenic virus, a small amount of virus will reproduce the desired DNA and spread it all over the body.
* Manufacture large quantities of DNA, and somehow package it to induce the target cells to accept it, either as an addition to one of the original 23 chromosomes, or as an independent 24th human artificial chromosome.

Human genetic engineering means that some part of the genes or DNA of a person are changed. It is possible that through engineering, people could be given more arms, bigger brains or other structural alterations if desired. A more common type of change would be finding the genes of extraordinary people, such as those for intelligence, stamina, longevity, and incorporating those in embryos.

Human genetic engineering holds the promise of being able to cure diseases and increasing the immunity of people to viruses. An example of such a disease is cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that affects lungs and other organs.

Researchers are currently trying to map out and assign genes to different body functions or disease. When the genes or DNA sequence responsible for a disease is found, theoretically gene therapy should be able to fix the disease and eliminate it permanently. 

However, with the complexity of interaction between genes and gene triggers, gene research is currently in its infancy. Computer modeling and expression technology could be used in the future to create people from scratch. This would work by taking existing DNA knowledge and inserting DNA of &quot;superior&quot; body expressions from people, such as a bigger heart, stronger muscles, etc. and implanting this within an egg to be inserted into a female womb. The visual modeling of this process may be very much like the videogame Spore, where people are able to manipulate the physical attributes of creatures and then &quot;release them&quot; in the digital world.

The possibilities of physical changes are endless. Strength, speed, endurance and so on can be enhanced. The baby can be made taller, more beautiful, the changes possible are really up to the imagination, and the ability of the techniques employed by future gene manipulators. Certain people have been identified with extraordinary physical abilities, (such as athletes, geniuses, physical and mental event record holders) and their genes could be identified and replaced into the target embryo. There is also the possibility that science will advance so much that people will create genes not identified or discovered in nature (or people) and implant these into the human body as artificial genes.

Corresponding gene function to intelligence or mental aptitude in various fields is much harder because while researchers are finding out which sections of the brain light up when used through MRI imaging, corresponding genes to manipulate and/or expand intelligence are harder to map. The brain seems to be the last great medical mystery because unlike a muscle, it transfers information and handles complex processes like a computer, but without any logical process discernible to researchers. However, in certain individuals that have a higher aptitude at certain tasks, the history of their family having done the same work seems to show that either through practice, teaching, or gene expressions these individuals find tasks such as composing music or mathematics much easier than the average member of the population.

==Methods and technology==
==='''Current technology'''===
One of the types is gene manipulation through virus insertion.  The main mechanism by which this operates is a fairly standard one; one is taking DNA throughout the host’s body.  Problems with this approach may be:

:: Randomness of the insertion of the DNA fragment wanted (this might lead, for instance, to a cell turning cancerous, or being more subtly disrupted),
:: Possible lack of control over the immune response to the &quot;retrovirus&quot;, and
:: Possible problems getting complete transformation of the target cell population.

Another approach is to take advantage of the cell's endogenous ability to undergo homologous recombination wherein an exogenous DNA fragment with ends matching an endogenous gene replaces the target gene by action of enzymes called recombinases.  This is the technology used for &quot;knockouts&quot; and &quot;knock-ins&quot; and generally cannot be performed on an intact organism and is therefore only a candidate for germline (i.e. single cell) genetic manipulation.  This technology has very widespread usage in mouse genetics wherein genetically altered embryos are grown in a surrogate mother.  This could easily be extended to humans in the very near future as there are no major additional technological hurdles remaining to engineer humans versus mice (though minor hurdles certainly remain).  The primary hurdle is ethical, as the efficiency of this process can be quite poor and many embryos would be sacrificed in order to produce one genetically modified offspring.

===Future technology===
There are limitations to what current technology can do.  Research scientists want to get finer control on how DNA sequences might be added to a host cell.  Technologies that could offer this sort of control might well result from a merger of highly engineered/modified viruses with micromechanical technologies, modified to migrate to a particular specified N nucleotide sequence in the host DNA for N significantly large to minimize targeting errors, then precisely and efficiently insert the desired snippet in the correct position in the host.  Evidently it would be desirable to allow such a device/organism to feed on available resources in the host in order to migrate from cell to cell and perform this process until a significant proportion of host cells had been transformed; it would then be desirable for the device to disable itself.  Also it would be desirable for the device to understand when it had finished with a cell (e.g. after levels of a desired protein reach a critical threshold, though this would be perhaps too slow, i.e. movement via measurement of some sort of chemical gradient) so that it could move on.  Certainly such devices could not be user controlled for a large population; they would need to be autonomous.

Since DNA sequences vary from individual to individual, and individuals may even be chimeras, also required would be the capability to sequence individual genomes, the ability to target fixes to particular parts of a chimera population, and finally a good understanding of how to avoid disruptive edits- that is, edits that do not disrupt the functioning of some other process in the cell.  This requires some level of mastery of the area of proteomics, that is, the understanding of a lifeform's proteome.

==Computers==
The future most likely lies in a process that is automated by a wide repository of knowledge, a method of combining that knowledge into an embryo, and a design system such as a computer program that is easily represented to human individuals. The researcher is able to pick and choose what characteristics the &quot;soon to be created human&quot; should have, such as high intelligence, high strength, 20/20 or above vision, etc., and then tells the computer to create that person. This designer baby machine would then search through current research on these genes, put them into the proper places of the DNA mode through an accurate DNA modification method, enter it into an egg (created or taken from a female), and then insert the egg into a female or a mechanical womb. 

==Nanotechnology==
Nanotechnology could be used to implement gene changes. Nanotechnology is an expression of ultra small devices or machines that are able to operate at the nanoscale level.

==When to make changes==
===Changes at conception===
Genetic engineering is most easily accomplished by making changes just after the egg and sperm have melded but before first division. In this way, the gene will be expressed throughout and will affect the recipients children, grandchildren, and all subsequent generations. Germline engineering is controversial because there is insufficient knowledge about DNA expression to accurately judge what result these changes will have. 

===Changes after birth===
As of now, this is likely to take the form of gene therapy. This would not be hereditary unless the sex cells are engineered.

==Positive and Negative Distinction==
Two types of genetic engineering exist when applied to humans. Positive and negative. The former enhances humans and the latter removes genetic disorders.

===Negative genetic engineering===
When treating problems that arise from genetic disorder, one solution is gene therapy, also known as negative genetic engineering. A genetic disorder is a condition caused by the genetic code of the individual, such as spina bifida or autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url = http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/genetic+disorder
  | accessdate = 2008-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this happens, genes may be expressed in unfavorable ways or not at all, and this generally leads to further complications. 

The idea of gene therapy is that a non-pathogenic virus or other delivery system can be used to insert a piece of DNA--a good copy of the gene--into cells of the living individual. The modified cells would divide as normal and each division would produce cells that express the desired trait. The result would be that he/she would then have the ability to express the trait that was previously absent at least partially.  This form of genetic engineering could help alleviate many problems, such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or other genetic diseases.

===Positive genetic engineering===
The potential of genetic engineering to cure medical conditions opens the question of exactly what such a condition is. Some view aging and death as medical conditions and therefore potential targets for engineering solutions. They see human genetic engineering potentially as a key tool in this. The difference between cure and enhancement from this perspective is merely one of degree. Theoretically genetic engineering could be used to drastically change people's genomes, which could enable people to regrow limbs and other organs, perhaps even extremely complex ones such as the spine. It could also be used to make people stronger, faster, smarter, or to increase the capacity of the lungs, among other things. If a gene exists in nature, it could be brought over to a human cell. In this view, there is no qualitative difference (only a quantitative one) between, for instance, a genetic intervention to cure muscular dystrophy, and a genetic intervention to improve muscle function even when those muscles are functioning at or around the human average (since there is also an average muscle function for those with a particular type of dystrophy, which the treatment would improve upon).
                                                                     
Others feel that there is an important distinction between using genetic technologies to treat those who are suffering and to make those who are already healthy superior to the average. There is widespread agreement that germline engineering should not currently be allowed for either therapeutic and enhancement applications, as evidenced by a recent report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. &lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Frankel &amp; Audrey R. Chapman, Human Inheritable Genetic Modifications: Assessing Scientific, Ethical, Religious, and Policy Issues, (September 2000), available at http://www.aaas.org/spp/sfrl/projects/germline/report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Though theory and speculation suggest that genetic engineering could be used to make people stronger, faster, smarter, or to increase lung capacity, the AAAS report finds that there is little evidence that this can currently be done without very unsafe and therefore unethical human experiments. Because different cells have different tasks, changing one cell to do a different job will not only affect that one task, it can affect many others too.

==Controversy==
===Ethics===
The genetic engineering of humans has raised many controversial ethical issues. With the release of the 1997 cult film ''Gattaca'', human genetic engineering has been widely debated. While negative genetic engineering (gene therapy) does indeed raise a debate, the use of genetic engineering for human enhancement arouses the strongest feelings on both sides. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book

===Social considerations===
''Individuals'' may benefit from non-therapeutic genetic engineering, but some claim that there may be adverse ''social'' implications. Few resources – particularly those related to medicine and health care – are available to everyone, and allowing the most privileged to engineer themselves or their children to have special capabilities could lead to what some call a genetic aristocracy. Numerous enhancements via genetic engineering have been proposed, including increased memory, intelligence, and less need for sleep, in addition to some peoples’ desires to alter their physical appearance. The advantages created by genetic engineering, either real or perceived, could lead to new forms of inequality between those with genetic enhancements and those without while also exacerbating current inequalities between the rich and poor.

This isn't to say that the poor would never have access to such technologies - there is no theoretical limit on how much retrovirus can be cultured in a bioreactor. But the likely high costs would probably require harsh financing plans. Genetic mortgages of the future could go hand in hand with student loans, spelling disaster for dropouts and increasing the risks of a first-class education for a middle or lower class citizen. Many people view genetic engineering as just a way to cure diseases.

On the other hand society could get to the point where the government pays for everyone to undergo genetic engineering. There would also be a point where patents on specific treatments run out, allowing cheaper access to the majority population after a decade or two of high cost.  This may actually decrease inequalities, because natural differences in ability would be nearly eliminated leaving socioeconomic success or failure entirely to the environment and personal choice.

Did you know that everything you do takes energy? Even while you are sitting still, your body is using energy to breathe, to keep your blood circulating, and to control many different processes. But it's not just you. Everything that moves or changes in any way—from plants to animals to machines—needs energy. Have you ever wondered where all of this energy comes from?

==Lesson Objectives==
* Compare ways in which energy is changed from one form to another.
* Discuss what happens when we burn a fuel.
* Describe the difference between renewable and nonrenewable resources, and classify different energy resources as renewable or nonrenewable.

==The Need for Energy==
''Energy'' can be defined as the ability to move or change matter. Every living thing needs energy to live and grow. Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of the energy you use every day. Cooking your food takes energy, and so does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer. The same is true for heating or cooling your home. Whether you are turning on a light in the kitchen or riding in a car to school, you are using energy all day long. And because billions of people all around the world use energy, there is a huge need for resources to provide all of this energy. Why do we need so much energy?

The main reason is that almost everything that happens on Earth involves energy. Most of the time when something happens, energy is changing forms.

Even though energy does change form, the total amount of energy always stays the same. The '''Law of Conservation of Energy''' says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Scientists discovered this law by noticing that any time they observed energy changing from one form to another, they could measure that the overall amount of energy did not change.

For an example of how energy changes from one form to another, think about what goes on when you kick a soccer ball. Your body gets its energy from food. When your body breaks down the food you eat, it stores the energy from the food in a form called '''chemical energy'''. But some of this stored energy has to be released to make your leg muscles move. When this happens, the energy that is released changes from chemical energy to another form, called '''kinetic energy'''. Kinetic energy is the energy of anything in motion. Your muscles move your leg, your foot kicks the ball, and the ball gains kinetic energy by being kicked. So you can think of the action of kicking the ball as a story of energy moving and changing forms. The same is true for anything that happens involving movement or change. '''Potential energy''' is energy that is stored. Potential energy has the potential to do work or the potential to be converted into other forms of energy. An example of potential energy might be the ball you kicked, if it ended up at the top of a hill.

==Energy, Fuel, and Heat==
As you have learned, energy is the ability to move or change matter. To put it another way, you could say that energy is the ability to do work. But what makes energy available whenever you need it? If you have ever accidentally unplugged a lamp while you were using it, you have seen that the lamp does not have a supply of energy to keep itself lit. When the lamp is plugged into an outlet, it has the source of energy it needs&amp;mdash;electricity. The electricity comes from a power plant, and the power plant has to have energy to produce this electricity (Figure 5.1). The energy to make the electricity comes from a fuel, which stores the energy and releases it when it is needed. A fuel is any material that can release energy in a chemical change. The food you eat acts as a '''fuel''' for your body. You probably hear the word fuel most often when someone refers to its use in transportation. Gasoline and diesel fuel are two fuels that provide the energy for most cars, trucks, and buses. But many different kinds of fuel are used to meet the wide variety of needs for energy storage.

[[File:XN Power pole 01.jpg|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 5.1''': Electrical transmission towers like the one shown in this picture help deliver the electricity that you use for energy every day.]]

For a fuel to be useful, its energy must be released in a way that can be controlled. Controlling the release of the energy makes it possible for the energy to be used to do work. When a fuel is used for its energy, the fuel is usually burned, and most of the energy is released as heat. The heat can be used to do work. For an example of how the energy in a fuel is released mostly as heat, think about what happens when someone starts a fire in a fireplace. First, the person strikes a match and uses it to set some small twigs on fire. After the twigs have burned for a while, they get hot enough to make some larger sticks burn. The fire keeps getting hotter, and soon it is hot enough to burn whole logs.

You might think at first that the heat comes from starting the fire. After all, someone struck a match to start the fire, and then the fire just spread, right? But if you think about this fire in terms of energy, almost all of the heat comes from the energy that has been stored in the wood. In other words, the wood is the fuel for the fire. There is a reason why it is easy to be confused about the source of the fire’s heat. The reason is that some energy has to be put into ''starting'' the fire before any energy can come out of the fire. At first, there is energy stored in the head of the match as chemical energy. When someone strikes a match, this chemical energy is released as heat.

The lit match gives off enough heat to set the twigs on fire. This heat is enough energy to start changing the chemical energy in the wood (and the oxygen in the air, which the wood needs in order to burn) into heat. What happens is that the heat from the match breaks chemical bonds in the twigs. When these bonds break, the atoms in the twigs are free to move around and form new bonds. When the atoms form new bonds, they release more heat. This heat causes more and more of the wood to change its stored chemical energy into heat. So, what started as a fairly small amount of heat from the match turns into a much, much larger amount of heat from the wood. The same thing is true for any fuel. We have to add some energy to the fuel to get it started. But once the fuel starts burning, it keeps changing its chemical energy into heat. As long as the conditions are right, the fuel will keep turning its energy into heat until the fuel is all gone.

==Types of Energy Resources==
Energy resources can be put into two categories—either renewable or nonrenewable. Resources that are ''nonrenewable'' are used faster than they can be replaced (Figure 5.2). Other resources that are called ''renewable'' will never run out. In most cases, these resources are replaced as quickly as they are used.

[[File:Coal_anthracite.jpg|frame|center|'''Figure 5.2''': Like other fossil fuels, this piece of anthracite coal is a nonrenewable energy resource.]]

In a way, the difference between nonrenewable and renewable resources is like the difference between ordinary batteries and rechargeable ones. If you have a flashlight at home that uses ordinary batteries, and you accidentally leave the flashlight on all night long, you will need to buy new batteries once the ones in the flashlight have died. The energy in the ordinary batteries is nonrenewable. But if the flashlight has rechargeable batteries, you can put them in a battery charger and use them in the flashlight again. In this way, the energy in the rechargeable batteries is &quot;renewable&quot;.

Fossil fuels are the most common example of nonrenewable energy resources. Renewable energy resources include solar, water, and wind power. If you traced the energy in all of these resources back to its origin, you would find that almost all energy resources&amp;mdash;not just solar energy&amp;mdash;come from the sun. Fossil fuels are made of the remains of plants and animals that stored the sun's energy millions of years ago. These plants and animals got all of their energy from the sun, either directly or indirectly. The sun heats some areas more than others, which causes wind. The sun's energy drives the water cycle, which moves water over the surface of the Earth. Both wind and water power can be used as renewable resources.

===Types of Nonrenewable Resources===
Fossil fuels, which include coal, oil, and natural gas are nonrenewable resources. Millions of years ago, plants used energy from the sun to form sugars, carbohydrates, and other energy-rich carbon compounds that were later transformed into coal, oil, or natural gas. The solar energy stored in these fuels is a rich source of energy, but while fossil fuels took millions of years to form, we are using them up in a matter of decades and will soon run out. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources. The burning of fossil fuels also releases large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.

===Types of Renewable Resources===
Renewable energy resources include solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. These resources can usually be replaced at the same rate that we use them. Scientists know that the sun will continue to shine for billions of years and we can use the energy from the sun as long as we have a sun. Water flows from high places to lower ones and wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. We can use the flow of wind and water to generate power and we can count on wind and water to continue to flow. Some examples of biomass energy are burning something like wood or changing grains into biofuels. We can plant new trees or crops to replace the ones we use. Geothermal energy uses water in the rocks that has been heated by magma. The magma will heat more water in the rocks as we take hot water out.

Even renewable resources can come with problems, though. We could cut down too many trees or we might need grains to be used for food rather than biofuels. Some renewable resources have been too expensive to be widely used or cause some types of environmental problems. As the technology improves and more people use renewable energy, the prices may come down. And, as we use up fossil fuels, they will become more expensive. At some point, even if renewable energy is expensive, nonrenewable energy will be even more expensive. Ultimately, we will have to use renewable sources (and conserve).

==Important Things to Consider About Energy Resources==
With both renewable and nonrenewable resources, there are at least two important things to consider. One is that we have to have a practical way to turn the resource into a useful form of energy. The other is that we have to consider what happens when we turn the resource into energy.

For example, if we get much less energy from burning a fuel than we put into making it, then that fuel is probably not a practical energy resource. On the other hand, if another fuel gives us large amounts of energy but also creates large amounts of pollution, that fuel also may not be the best choice for an energy resource.

==Lesson Summary==
* According to the law of conservation of energy, energy is neither created or destroyed.
* Renewable resources can be replaced at the rate they are being used.
* Nonrenewable resources are available in limited amounts or are being used faster than they can be replaced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
Have you ever seen dinosaur fossils at a museum? If so, you may have read about how the dinosaur bones turned into fossils. The same processes that formed these fossils also formed some of our most important energy resources. These resources are called fossil fuels. Fossil fuels provide a very high quality energy, but because of our demand for energy, we are using up these resources much faster than they formed.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe the natural processes that formed different fossil fuels.
* Describe different fossil fuels, and understand why they are nonrenewable resources.
* Explain how fossil fuels are turned into useful forms of energy.
* Understand that when we burn a fossil fuel, most of its energy is released as heat.
* Describe how the use of fossil fuels affects the environment.
* Describe how a nuclear power plant produces energy.

==Formation of Fossil Fuels==
As you might guess from their name, fossil fuels are made from fossils. Fossil fuels come from materials that began forming about 500 million years ago. As plants and animals died, their remains settled on the ground and at the bottom of bodies of water. Over time, these remains formed layer after layer. Eventually, all of these layers were buried deep enough that they were under an enormous mass of earth. The weight of the earth pressing down on these layers created intense heat and pressure.

After millions of years of heat and pressure, the material in these layers turned into chemicals called '''hydrocarbons''', which are compounds of carbon and hydrogen. The hydrocarbons in these layers are what we call fossil fuels. The hydrocarbons could be solid, liquid, or gaseous. The solid form is what we know as coal. The liquid form is petroleum, or crude oil. We call the gaseous hydrocarbons natural gas.

You may be surprised to learn that anything that used to be alive could change enough to become something so different, such as coal or oil. There is enough heat and pressure deep below the earth's surface even to create diamonds, which are the hardest natural material in the world.

Like fossil fuels, diamond is made of carbon. In fact, diamond is a type of pure carbon, so it does not contain the hydrogen that fossil fuels do. What determines whether the remains of  living things deep in the earth turn into coal, oil, natural gas, diamond, or something else? All of these materials form under high heat and pressure, but the conditions are different for each material.

==Coal==
Coal is the solid fossil fuel that forms from dead plants that settled at the bottom of swamps millions of years ago. The water and mud in the swamps affected how the remains of plants broke down as they were compressed. The water and mud in the swamp keep oxygen away from the plant material. When plants are buried without oxygen, the organic material can be preserved or fossilized. Then, other material, such as sand and clay, settles on top of the decaying plants and squeezes out the water and some other substances. Over time, the pressure removes most of the material other than carbon, and the carbon-containing material forms a layer of rock that we know as coal.

Coal is black or brownish-black in appearance. Coal is a rock that burns easily. Most forms of coal are '''sedimentary''' rock. But the hardest type of coal, anthracite, is a '''metamorphic''' rock, because it is exposed to higher temperature and pressure as it forms. Coal is mostly carbon, but some other elements can be found in coal, including sulfur.

Around the world, coal is the largest source of energy for electricity. The United States is rich in coal, which is used for electricity. California once had a number of small coal mines but the state no longer produces coal.

A common way of turning coal into a useful form to make electricity starts with crushing the coal into powder. Then, a power plant burns the powder in a furnace that has a boiler. Like other fuels, coal releases most of its energy as heat when it burns. The heat that the burning coal releases in the furnace is enough to boil the water in the boiler, making steam. The power plant uses this steam to spin turbines, and the spinning turbines make generators turn to create electricity.

For people to use coal as an energy source, they need to get it out of the ground. The process of removing coal from the ground is known as coal mining. Coal mining can take place underground or at the surface. The process of coal mining, especially surface mining, affects the environment. Surface mining exposes minerals from underground to air and water from the surface. These minerals contain the chemical element sulfur, and sulfur mixes with air and water to make sulfuric acid, which is a highly '''corrosive''' chemical. The sulfuric acid gets into nearby streams and can kill fish, plants, and animals that live in or near the water. The process of burning coal causes other problems for the environment. A little later, we will look at these other pollution problems, when we explore problems with fossil fuels in general.

==Oil==
Oil is a thick liquid that is usually dark brown or black in appearance. It is found mostly in formations of porous rock in the upper layers of the Earth's crust. Oil is currently the single largest source of energy in the world. How does oil form? The process of making oil is similar in many ways to the process of making coal. The main difference is in the size of the living things—the organisms—whose remains turn into these fossil fuels. The organisms that die and became the material for making oil are much smaller than the plants that turned into coal. These organisms are called plankton and algae. When the plankton and algae die, their remains settle to the bottom of the sea. There, they were buried away from oxygen, just as the plants did in the process of becoming coal. As layers of sediment pile on top of these decaying organisms, heat and pressure increase. Over a period of millions of years, the heat and pressure turn the material into liquid oil.

The United States produces oil, although only about one-quarter as much as it uses. The main oil producing regions are the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Alaska, and California. Most of California's oil fields are in the southern San Joaquin Valley. Compression from when the region was a convergent plate boundary produced a set of anticlines that are parallel to the San Andreas Fault. Oil collects in permeable sediments that are capped by an impermeable cap rock. Oil is also pumped on and off the southern California coast.

Oil as it comes out of the ground is called crude oil. Crude oil is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons. Oil refining is used to separate the compounds in this mixture from one another (Figure 5.3). We can separate crude oil into several useful fuels because each hydrocarbon compound in crude oil boils at a different temperature. An oil refinery heats the crude oil enough to boil the mixture of compounds. Special equipment in the refinery separates these compounds from one another as they boil.

[[File:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|thumb|center|500px|'''Figure 5.3''': Refineries like this one separate crude oil into many useful fuels and other chemicals.]]

Most of the compounds that come out of the refining process are fuels. The rest make up waxes, plastics, fertilizers, and other products. The fuels that come from crude oil, including gasoline, diesel, and heating oil, are rich sources of energy that can be easily transported. Because of this, fuels from oil provide about 90% of the energy used for transportation around the world.

We get gasoline from refining oil. Like oil, gasoline is most commonly used for transportation because it is a concentrated form of energy that is easily carried. Let's consider how gasoline powers a car. Like other fuels you have learned about, gasoline burns and releases most of its energy as heat. When it burns, the gasoline turns into carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. The heat makes these gases expand, like the heated air that fills a hot-air balloon. The expanding gases create enough force to move pistons inside an engine, and the engine makes enough power to move the car.

When a resource like gasoline is concentrated in energy; it contains a large amount of energy for its weight. This is important because the more an object weighs, the more energy it takes to move that object. If we could only get a little energy from a certain amount of gasoline, a car would have to carry more of it to be able to travel very far. But carrying more gasoline would make the car heavier, so moving the car would take even more energy. So a resource with highly concentrated energy is a practical fuel to power cars and other forms of transportation.

Unfortunately, using gasoline to power automobiles also affects the environment. The exhaust fumes from burning gasoline include gases that cause many different types of pollution, including smog and ground-level ozone. These forms of pollution cause air-quality problems for cities where large numbers of people drive every day. Burning gasoline also produces carbon dioxide, which is a cause of global warming.

==Natural Gas==
Natural gas is a fuel that is a mixture of methane and several other chemical compounds. It is often found along with coal or oil in underground deposits. The conditions that create natural gas are similar to those that create oil. In both cases, small  organisms called plankton and algae die and settle to the bottom of the sea. In both cases, the remains of these organisms decay without oxygen being present. The difference is that natural gas forms at higher temperatures than oil does.

The largest natural gas reserves in the United States is found are in the Rocky Mountain states, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico region. California also has natural gas, mostly in the northern Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento Delta. In that region, a sediment filled trough formed aside an ancient convergent margin. Organic material buried in the sediments hardened to become a shale formation that is the source of the gas.

Because it is a mixture of different chemicals, natural gas must be processed before it can be used as a fuel. Some of the chemicals in unprocessed natural gas are poisonous to humans. Other parts, such as water, make the gas a less useful fuel. The processing removes almost everything but methane from natural gas. At this point, the gas is ready to be delivered and used.

Natural gas, often known simply as gas, is delivered to homes for uses such as cooking and heating. Many ranges and ovens use natural gas as a fuel, and gas-powered furnaces, boilers, water heaters, and clothes dryers are also common.

Natural gas is a major source of energy for powering gas turbines and steam turbines to make electricity. When it is used in this way, natural gas works similarly to the way coal does in producing energy for electricity. Like coal and other fuels, natural gas releases most of its energy as heat when it burns. The power plant is able to use this heat, either in the form of hot gases or steam from heated water, to spin turbines. The spinning turbines turn generators, and the generators create electricity.

Processing and using natural gas does have some harmful effects on the environment. Natural gas does burn cleaner than other fossil fuels, meaning that it causes less air pollution. It also produces less carbon dioxide than the other fossil fuels for the same amount of energy.

==Problems with Fossil Fuels==
Although they are rich sources of energy, fossil fuels do present many problems. Because these fuels are nonrenewable resources, their supplies will eventually run out. Safety can be a problem, too, because these fuels burn so easily. For example, a natural gas leak in a building or an underground pipe can lead to a deadly explosion.

Using fossil fuels affects the environment in a variety of ways. There are impacts to the environment when we extract these resources. There are problems that arise because we are running out of supplies of these resources. Burning these fuels can cause air pollution and burning them releases carbon dioxide, which is a major factor in global warming (Figure 5.4).

[[File:Elektrarna Prunerov II 20070926.jpg|thumb|center|500px|'''Figure 5.4''': Coal power plants like this one release large amounts of steam and smoke into the air.]]

Many of the problems with fossil fuels are worse for coal than for oil or natural gas. Coal contains less energy for the amount of carbon it contains than oil or gas. As a result, burning coal releases more carbon dioxide than burning either oil or gas (for the same energy). And yet coal is the most common fossil fuel and so we continue to burn large amounts of it. Coal is the biggest contributor to global warming.

Another problem with coal is that it usually contains sulfur. When coal burns, the sulfur goes into the air as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is the main cause of acid rain, which can be deadly to plants, animals, and whole ecosystems. Burning coal also puts other polluting chemicals and a large number of small solid &quot;particulates&quot; into the air. These particles are dangerous to people, especially those who have an illness, like asthma, that makes breathing hard for them.

==Nuclear Energy==
When scientists learned how to split the nucleus of an atom, they released a huge amount of energy. Scientists and engineers have learned to control this release of energy. The controlled release of this energy is called '''nuclear energy'''. Nuclear power plants use uranium that has been processed and concentrated in fuel rods (Figure 5.5). The uranium atoms are split apart when they are hit by other extremely tiny particles. Nuclear Power (Nuclear fission) is not the same as a nuclear bomb. Explosives cannot directly be made out of uranium, it has to be enriched with Plutonium. Therefore nuclear powerplants cannot explode, meltdown however can occur if the cooling system of the plant is interrupted.

[[File:Nuclear Power Plant Cattenom.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 5.5''': Nuclear power plants like this one provide France with almost 80% of its electricity.]]

Nuclear power plants use the energy they produce to heat water. Once the water is heated, the process is a lot like what happens in a coal power plant. The hot water or steam causes a turbine to spin. When the turbine spins, it makes a generator turn, which in turn produces electricity.

Many countries around the world use nuclear energy as a source of electricity. For example, France gets about 80% of its electricity from nuclear energy. In the United States, a little less than 20% of electricity comes from nuclear energy.

Nuclear energy does not pollute the air. In fact, a nuclear power plant releases nothing but steam into the air. But nuclear energy does create other environmental problems. The process of splitting atoms creates a dangerous by-product called radioactive waste. The radioactive wastes produced by nuclear power plants remain dangerous for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. So far, concerns about this waste have kept nuclear energy from being a larger source of energy in this country. Scientists and engineers are looking for ways to keep this waste safely away from people.

==Lesson Summary==
* Coal, oil and natural gas are all fossil fuels formed from the remains of once living organisms.
* Coal is our largest source of energy for producing electricity.
* Mining and using coal produce many environmental impacts, including carbon dioxide emissions and acid rain.
* Oil and natural gas are important sources of energy for many types of vehicles and uses in our homes and industry.
* Nuclear energy is produced by splitting atoms. It also produces radioactive wastes that are very dangerous for many years.
* Fossil fuels are nonrenewable sources of energy that produce environmental damage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
The International Center for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) is located in Austria's capitol city of Vienna. ICMPD was founded in 1993, upon the initiative of Austria and Switzerland. ICMPD's mission statement is rooted in making our increasingly interdenpendt world more navigable in terms of the flow of individulas across the globe's many borders. Thus, the ICMPD strives to improve and facilitate regional and international co-operation in the field of migration policy and migration management. Acting as somewhat of a facilitator amongst its member states the ICMPD seeks to create contact and dialogue among countries of origin, transit and destination and to support ICMPD Member States in achieving their priorities and migration policy goals. The following states are members of the organisation: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland. In addition to facilitating dialagoue amongst member states ICMPD is dedicated to promoting innovative, comprehensive and sustainable migration policies and to function as a service exchange mechanism for governments and organizations. Migrations challenges in today's world are significant and to better approach this challenge ICMPD adheres to a philosophy based upon the conviction that the complexities of migration challenges can only be met by working in partnership with governments, research institutes, international organizations and civil society and its organizations. The organization was created to serve as a support mechanism for informal consultations, and to provide expertise and efficient services in the newly emerging landscape of multilateral co-operation on migration and asylum issues. ICMPD today is an international organization with sixty staff members at its Vienna Headquarters, a mission in Brussels and regional offices and representatives throughout Europe, CIS, Northern Africa and the Middle East. In addition to its internationl promenince the ICMPD holds UN observer status.

==History/Timeline==
Faced with the growing challenges of migration, an asylum crisis and the need to reform the European refugee reception system a small circle of European government representatives, gathered at the initiative of Switzerland, in the autumn of 1992 to launch the ICMPD. Moreover, migration from and through the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe was on the rise in addition to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to mass displacement, requiring international burden-sharing and thus the birth of ICMPD. At the global level, it was recognized that growing  Global North- Gloabl South migration pressure will be a major issue on the political agenda for the next millennium. 

Prior to the ICMPD the typical form of dealing with migration in a European context was through an ad hoc approach by the Council of Europe, OECD, ICEM/IOM and UNHCR. Informal consultations (now IGC) were created by Sweden and some like-minded countries in 1985. It worked together with the UNHCR to tackle the emerging asylum crisis. An EC/EU co-operation on immigration and asylum was initiated in 1986 in response to the new internal market system and establishment of external EU borders. The EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries also initiated a move to make immigration co-operation level with that of the EC. Radical changes in Central and Eastern Europe gave birth in 1991 to the Vienna process (incorporated by the Council of Europe in 1994) and the Berlin process, which later became the Budapest Process. Existing institutions, such as those mentioned above, worked to upgrade migration-related activities. 

The founding countries of ICMPD felt a support mechanism was needed to provide a platform for informal consultations and efficient services in this newly emerging landscape of multilateral immigration and asylum co-operation. They also wanted to ensure that co-operation with Central and Eastern Europe be given a prominent role, taking into account the need to incorporate the new democracies into the European migration regime and to act against the risk of growing illegal migration. In light of this, it was clear at the Budapest Ministerial Conference in 1993 that ICMPD would become Secretariat to the Budapest process.

==Local Significance==
In May 1993 the basic agreement on the establishment of ICMPD entered into force, the initial signatories was in Vienna between Austria and Switzerland. The following July the first Steering Group meeting took place. Under an arrangement with Sweden the late Jonas Widgren was appointed director in August 1993. A presentation letter to all the responsible ministers of 24 governments, signed by the Swiss Minister of Justice and the Austrian Federal Minister of Interior, was dispatched in September 1993. ICMPD's head office, originally at Möllwaldplatz in Vienna's fourth district, was officially opened in November 1993.

==Global Impact/Significance==
ICMPD’s work centers around three core pillars: Intergovernmental dialogues: with the aim to foster governmental discussion and enhance inter-state dialogue in the current debate on international migration, ICMPD acts as Secretariat to the consultative Budapest Process (50 European and Eurasian states), and to the Dialogue on Mediterranean Transit Migration, which brings together European as well as Mediterranean Arab states. 

Capacity building: with the aim to contribute to good migration governance and to strengthen national and regional capacities in order to deal with the current challenges in various fields of migration, ICMPD develops and organizes training and capacity building programs, facilitates international and interagency co-operation, and supports governmental and administrative bodies in their institution building efforts and legal reform in areas such as asylum, visa, human trafficking and integrated border management.

Research and documentation: with the aim to facilitate co-operation and synergy within and beyond the research community and to respond to an increased demand for a more policy relevant research, ICMPD conducts policy oriented, empirical research with a comparative, interdisciplinary and international approach. The ICMPD library offers one of the largest collections of migration-specific literature in Austria.

Together with profound understanding of our partners' working environment ICMPD provides cutting-edge expertise, sound and policy-oriented research, proficiency in establishing information exchange mechanisms, strong programs development and implementation skills and wide-ranging international networking capacities.

The aldol reaction is powerful because it unites two relatively simple molecules into a more complex one. Increased complexity arises because up to two new [[stereogenic center]]s (on the [[Alpha carbon|α- and β-carbon]] of the aldol adduct, marked with asterisks in the scheme below) are formed. Modern methodology is not only capable of allowing aldol reactions to proceed in high yield, but also controlling both the relative and absolute stereochemical configuration of these stereocenters. This ability to selectively synthesize a particular [[stereoisomer]] is significant because different stereoisomers can have very different chemical or biological properties.

For example, stereogenic aldol units are especially common in [[polyketide]]s, a class of [[natural products|molecules found in biological organisms]]. In nature, polyketides are synthesized by enzymes which effect iterative [[Claisen condensation]]s. The 1,3-dicarbonyl products of these reactions can then be variously derivatized to produce a wide variety of interesting structures. Often, such derivitization involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups, producing the aldol subunit. Some of these structures have potent biological properties: the potent immunosuppressant [[FK506]], the anti-tumor agent [[discodermolide]], or the antifungal agent [[amphotericin B]], for example. Although the synthesis of many such compounds was once considered nearly impossible, aldol methodology has allowed their efficient [[total synthesis|synthesis]] in many cases.&lt;ref name=MahrwaldSchetter2006&gt;

[[Image:typicalaldol2.gif|center]]

A typical modern '''aldol addition reaction''', shown above, might involve the [[nucleophilic addition]] of a [[ketone]] [[enolate]] to an [[aldehyde]]. Once formed, the aldol product can sometimes [[Dehydration reaction|lose a molecule of water]] to form an [[α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound]]. This is called '''[[aldol condensation]]'''. A variety of nucleophiles may be employed in the aldol reaction, including the [[enol]]s, [[enolate]]s, and enol [[ether]]s of ketones, aldehydes, and many other [[carbonyl]] compounds. The [[electrophile|electrophilic]] partner is usually an aldehyde or ketone (many variations, such as the [[Mannich reaction]], exist). When the nucleophile and electrophile are different, the reaction is called a '''crossed aldol reaction'''; conversely, when the nucleophile and electrophile are the same, the reaction is called '''aldol dimerization'''.
[[Image:aldolrxnpic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A typical experimental setup for an aldol reaction.&lt;br /&gt; A solution of [[lithium diisopropylamide]] (LDA) in [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF) (in the flask on the right) will be transferred into a solution of ''tert''-butyl propionate in the flask on the left, forming the lithium enolate of ''tert''-butyl propionate. An aldehyde can then be added to initiate an aldol addition reaction.&lt;br /&gt; Both flasks are submerged in a dry ice/acetone [[cooling bath]] (−78&amp;nbsp;°C) the temperature of which is being monitored by a thermocouple (the wire on the left).]]

==Mechanisms==
The aldol reaction may proceed via two fundamentally different mechanisms. Carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, can be converted to enols or enol ethers. These compounds, being nucleophilic at the [[Alpha-carbon|α-carbon]], can attack especially reactive protonated carbonyls such as protonated aldehydes. This is the &quot;enol mechanism.&quot; Carbonyl compounds, being [[carbon acid]]s, can also be deprotonated to form enolates, which are much more nucleophilic than enols or enol ethers and can attack electrophiles directly. The usual electrophile is an aldehyde, since ketones are much less reactive. This is the &quot;enolate mechanism.&quot;

If the conditions are particularly harsh (e.g., NaOMe, MeOH, [[reflux]]), condensation may occur, but this can usually be avoided with mild reagents and low temperatures (e.g., LDA (a strong base), THF, −78&amp;nbsp;°C). Although the aldol addition usually proceeds to near completion, the reaction is not irreversible, since the treatment of aldol adducts with strong bases usually induces retro-aldol cleavage (gives the starting materials). Aldol condensations are irreversible.

:[[Image:Simple aldol reaction.png|600px|A generalized view of the Aldol reaction]]

===Enol mechanism===
When an acid catalyst is used, the initial step in the [[reaction mechanism]] involves acid-catalyzed [[tautomer]]ization of the carbonyl compound to the enol. The acid also serves to activate the carbonyl group of ''another molecule'' by protonation, rendering it highly [[electrophile|electrophilic]]. The enol is [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] at the α-carbon, allowing it to attack the protonated carbonyl compound, leading to the aldol after [[deprotonation]]. This usually [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrates]] to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound. The scheme shows a typical acid-catalyzed self-condensation of an aldehyde.

'''Acid catalyzed aldol mechanism'''
:[[Image:Enol aldol formation mechanism.png|500px|Mechanism for acid-catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself]]
'''Acid catalyzed dehydration'''
:[[Image:Enol aldol dehydration mechanism.png|500px|Mechanism for acid-catalyzed dehydration of an aldol]]

===Enolate mechanism===
If the [[catalyst]] is a moderate base such as [[hydroxide]] ion or an [[alkoxide]], the aldol reaction occurs via nucleophilic attack by the [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance-stabilized]] enolate on the carbonyl group of another molecule. The product is the [[alkoxide]] salt of the aldol product. The aldol itself is then formed, and it may then undergo dehydration to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound. The scheme shows a simple mechanism for the base catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself.

'''Base catalyzed aldol reaction''' (shown using [[methoxide|&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] as base)
:[[Image:Enolate aldol formation mechanism.png|500px|Simple mechanism for base-catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself]]

'''Base catalyzed dehydration''' (frequently written incorrectly as a single step, see [[E1cB elimination reaction]])
:[[Image:Enolate aldol dehydration mechanism.png|500px|Simple mechanism for the dehydration of an aldol product]]

Although only a catalytic amount of base is required in some cases, the more usual procedure is to use a [[stoichiometric]] amount of a strong base such as [[Lithium diisopropylamide|LDA]] or [[Sodium hexamethyldisilazide|NaHMDS]]. In this case, enolate formation is irreversible, and the aldol product is not formed until the metal alkoxide of the aldol product is protonated in a separate workup step.

===Zimmerman–Traxler model===
More refined forms of the mechanism are known. In 1957, [[Howard Zimmerman|Zimmerman]] and Traxler proposed that some aldol reactions have &quot;six-membered transition states having a [[chair conformation]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman1920&gt;{{cite journal
| title = The Stereochemistry of the Ivanov and Reformatsky Reactions. I

| journal =[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]
| year =1957
| volume =79
| pages =1920–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now known as the '''Zimmerman–Traxler model'''. ''E''-enolates give rise to [[anti isomer|anti products]], whereas ''Z''-enolates give rise to [[syn addition|syn products]]. The factors which control selectivity are the preference for placing substituents equatorially in six-membered transition states and the avoidance of [[pentane interference|syn-pentane interactions]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Heathcock1980&gt;{{cite journal

In reality, only some metals such as lithium and boron reliably follow the Zimmerman–Traxler model. Thus, in some cases, the [[stereochemistry|stereochemical]] outcome of the reaction may be unpredictable.

:[[Image:Zimmerman-Traxler_model_scheme.gif|The Zimmerman–Traxler model]]

==Control in the Aldol reaction==
===The problem===
The problem of &quot;control&quot; in the aldol addition is best demonstrated by an example. Consider the outcome of this hypothetical reaction:

[[Image:Aldolcontrol1.gif|center|Hypothetical aldol reaction]]

In this reaction, two unsymmetrical ketones are being condensed using [[sodium ethoxide]]. The basicity of sodium ethoxide is such that it cannot fully deprotonate either of the ketones, but can produce small amounts of the sodium enolate of both ketones. Effectively, this means that in addition to being potential aldol electrophiles, both ketones may also act as nucleophiles via their sodium enolate. Two electrophiles and two nucleophiles then potentially results in four possible products:

[[Image:Aldolcontrol2.gif|center|Four possible aldol reaction products]]

Thus, if one wishes to obtain only one of the cross-products, one must &quot;control&quot; the aldol addition.

===Acidity===
If one partner is considerably more acidic than the other, then control may be automatic. The most acidic proton is abstracted by the base and an enolate is formed. This type of control only works if the difference in acidity is large enough and no excess of base is used for the reaction. The simplest control is if only one of the reactants has acidic protons and only this molecule forms the enolate. For example, the addition of diethyl malonate into benzaldehyde would only produce one product:

[[Image:Aldolcontrol3.gif|center|Acidic control of the aldol reaction]]

In this case, the doubly activated [[methylene]] protons of the [[malonate]] would be preferentially deprotonated by sodium ethoxide and quantitatively form the sodium enolate. Since [[benzaldehyde]] has no acidic alpha-protons, there is only one possible nucleophile-electrophile combination; hence, control has been achieved. Note that this approach combines two elements of control: increased acidity of the alpha protons on the nucleophile and the lack of alpha protons on the electrophile.

===Order of addition===
One common solution is to form the enolate of one partner first, and then add the other partner under [[kinetic reaction control|kinetic control]].&lt;ref name=OS1985&gt;Bal, B.; Buse, C. T.; Smith, K.; Heathcock, C. H. ''[[Org. Syn.]]'', Coll. Vol. 7, p.185 (1990); Vol. 63, p.89 (1985). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv7p0185 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; Kinetic control means that the forward aldol addition reaction must be significantly faster than the reverse retro-aldol reaction. For this approach to succeed, two other conditions must also be satisfied; namely, it must be possible to quantitatively form the enolate of one partner and the forward aldol reaction must be significantly faster than the transfer of the enolate from one partner to another. Common kinetic control conditions involve the formation of the enolate of a ketone with [[Lithium diisopropylamide|LDA]] at −78&amp;nbsp;°C, followed by the slow addition of an aldehyde.

==Enolates==
===Formation===
The enolate may be formed by using a strong base (&quot;hard conditions&quot;) or using a [[Lewis acid]] and a weak base (&quot;soft conditions&quot;):

[[Image:scheme3a.gif]]

For [[deprotonation]] to occur, the stereoelectronic requirement is that the alpha-C-H [[sigma bond]] must be able to overlap with the pi* orbital of the [[carbonyl]]:

[[Image:scheme3c.gif|center|Stereoelectronic deprotonation requirements]]

===Geometry===
Extensive studies have been performed on the formation of enolates under many different conditions. It is now possible to generate, in most cases, the desired enolate geometry:&lt;ref name=Brown1989&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:scheme3.gif|center|Stereoselective enolate generation]]
For ketones, most enolization conditions give Z enolates. For [[ester]]s, most enolization conditions give E enolates. The addition of [[Hexamethylphosphoramide|HMPA]] is known to reverse the [[stereoselectivity]] of deprotonation.

[[Image:Scheme3d.png|center|The Ireland model]]

In the Ireland model, the deprotonation is assumed to proceed by a six-membered monomeric transition state. The larger of the two substituents on the electrophile (in the case above, methyl is larger than proton) adopts an equatorial disposition in the favored transition state, leading to a preference for E enolates. The model clearly fails in many cases; for example, if the solvent mixture is changed from THF to 23% HMPA-THF (as seen above), the enolate geometry is inexplicably reversed.

===Kinetic versus thermodynamic enolates===
If an unsymmetrical ketone is subjected to base, it has the potential to form two regioisomeric enolates (ignoring enolate geometry). For example:

[[Image:Enolateregio1.gif|center|Kinetic and thermodynamic enolates]]

The trisubstituted enolate is considered the [[thermodynamic reaction control|kinetic]] enolate while the tetrasubstituted enolate is considered the thermodynamic enolate. The alpha hydrogen deprotonated to form the kinetic enolate is less hindered, and therefore deprotonated more quickly. In general, tetrasubstituted olefins are more stable than trisubstituted olefins due to hyperconjugative stabilization. The ratio of enolate regioisomers is heavily influenced by the choice of base. For the above example, kinetic control may be established with LDA at −78&amp;nbsp;°C, giving 99:1 selectivity of kinetic: thermodynamic enolate, while thermodynamic control may be established with [[organolithium reagent|triphenylmethyllithium]] at [[room temperature]], giving 10:90 selectivity.

In general, kinetic enolates are favored by cold temperatures, relatively ionic metal-oxygen bonds, and rapid deprotonation using a slight excess of a strong, hindered base while thermodynamic enolates are favored by higher temperatures, relatively covalent metal-oxygen bonds, and longer equilibration times for deprotonation using a slight sub-stoichiometric amount of strong base. Use of a sub-stoichiometric amount of base allows some small fraction of unenolized carbonyl compound to equilibrate the enolate to the thermodynamic regioisomer by acting as a proton shuttle.

==Stereoselectivity==
The aldol reaction is particularly useful because two new stereogenic centers are generated in one reaction. Extensive research has been performed to understand the reaction mechanism and improve the selectivity observed under many different conditions. The ''syn''/''anti'' convention is commonly used to denote the relative stereochemistry at the α- and β-carbon.

[[Image:Aldol syn-anti.svg|500px|Syn and anti products from an aldol reaction]]

The convention applies when propionate (or higher order) nucleophiles are added to aldehydes. The ''R'' group of the ketone and the ''R''' group of the aldehyde are aligned in a &quot;zig zag&quot; pattern in the plane of the paper (or screen), and the disposition of the formed stereocenters is deemed ''syn'' or ''anti'', depending if they are on the same or opposite sides of the main chain.

Older papers use the ''[[Erythrose|erythro]]''-''[[Threose|threo]]'' nomenclature familiar from carbohydrate chemistry.

===E versus Z enolates===
There is no significant difference between the level of [[stereoinduction]] observed with ''E'' and ''Z'' enolates:&lt;ref name=Brown1989 /&gt;

[[Image:EvsEstereoselectivity.gif|center|Anti-aldol formation via Z-enolate]]

[[Image:EvsZstereoselectivity2.gif|center|Syn-aldol formation via E-enolate]]

===Metal ion===
The enolate metal cation may play a large role in determining the level of stereoselectivity in the aldol reaction. [[Boron]] is often used because its [[bond length]]s are significantly shorter than that of other metals such as [[lithium]], [[aluminium]], or [[magnesium]]. For example, boron-carbon and boron-oxygen bonds are 1.4–1.5 [[Ångstrom|Å]] and 1.5–1.6 Å in length, respectively, whereas typical metal-carbon and metal-oxygen bonds are typically 1.9–2.2 Å and 2.0–2.2 Å in length, respectively. This has the effect of &quot;tightening&quot; the [[transition state]]:&lt;ref name=JACS1981_3099&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Metalion.gif|center]]

===Stereoselectivity: Alpha stereocenter on the enolate===
The aldol reaction may exhibit &quot;substrate-based stereocontrol&quot;, in which existing [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] on either reactant influences the stereochemical outcome of the reaction. This has been extensively studied, and in many cases, one can predict the sense of [[asymmetric induction]], if not the absolute level of [[diastereoselectivity]]. If the enolate contains a [[stereocenter]] in the alpha position, excellent stereocontrol may be realized.

[[Image:enolatealphacenter.gif|center|Aldol reaction with enolate-based stereocontrol]]

In the case of an E enolate, the dominant control element is [[allylic strain|allylic 1,3-strain]] whereas in the case of a Z enolate, the dominant control element is the avoidance of 1,3-diaxial interactions. The general model is presented below:

[[Image:enolatealphacentermodel.gif|center|General model of the aldol reaction with enolate-based stereocontrol]]

For clarity, the stereocenter on the enolate has been [[epimer]]ized; in reality, the opposite diastereoface of the aldehyde would have been attacked. In both cases, the 1,3-syn diastereomer is favored. There are many examples of this type of stereocontrol:&lt;ref name=JACS1991_1047&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:enolatealphacentereg.gif|center|Aldol reaction with enolate-based stereocontrol]]

===Stereoselectivity: Alpha stereocenter on the electrophile===
When enolates attacks aldehydes with an alpha stereocenter, excellent stereocontrol is also possible. The general observation is that ''E'' enolates exhibit [[Felkin model|Felkin]] diastereoface selection, while ''Z'' enolates exhibit anti-Felkin selectivity. The general model&lt;ref name=Evans1982TS&gt;Evans, D. A. ''et al.'' ''Top. Stereochem.'' '''1982''', ''13'', 1–115. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roush1991&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Aldehydealphamodel.gif|center|The general model of the aldol reaction with carbonyl-based stereocontrol]]

Since ''Z'' enolates must react through a [[transition state]] which either contains a destabilizing syn-pentane interaction or anti-Felkin [[rotamer]], ''Z''-enolates exhibit lower levels of diastereoselectivity in this case.

==Evans' oxazolidinone chemistry==
Modern organic syntheses now require the synthesis of compounds in [[enantiopure]] form. Since the aldol addition reaction creates two new stereocenters, up to four stereoisomers may result.

[[Image:Evansaldol1.gif|center|Aldol reaction creates stereoisomers]]

Many methods which control both relative stereochemistry (i.e., syn or anti, as discussed above) and absolute [[stereochemistry]] (i.e., ''R'' or ''S'') have been developed.

[[Image:Evansaldol2.gif|center|Four possible stereoisomers of the aldol reaction]]

A widely used method is the Evans' [[acyl]] [[oxazolidinone]] method.&lt;ref name=Evans1982AldrichActa&gt;Evans, D. A. ''[[Aldrichimica Acta]]'' '''1982''', ''15'', 23. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OS1990&gt;Gage, J. R.; Evans, D. A. [[Organic Syntheses]], Coll. Vol. 8, p.339 (1993); Vol. 68, p.83 (1990). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv8p0339 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in the late 1970s and 1980s by [[David A. Evans]] and coworkers, the method works by temporarily creating a chiral enolate by appending a [[chiral auxiliary]]. The pre-existing chirality from the auxiliary is then transferred to the aldol adduct by performing a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Upon subsequent removal of the auxiliary, the desired aldol stereoisomer is revealed.

[[Image:Evansaldol3.gif|center]]

In the case of the Evans' method, the chiral auxiliary appended is an [[oxazolidinone]], and the resulting carbonyl compound is an [[imide]]. A number of oxazolidinones are now readily available in both enantiomeric forms. These may cost roughly $10–$20 US dollars per gram, rendering them relatively expensive.

[[Image:Evansaldol4.gif|center]]

The [[acylation]] of an oxazolidinone is a convenient procedure, and is informally referred to as &quot;loading done&quot;. ''Z''-enolates, leading to syn-aldol adducts, can be reliably formed using boron-mediated soft enolization:&lt;ref name=Bartroli1981&gt;{{cite journal

| pages =2127–2129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Evansaldol5.gif|center]]

Often, a single [[diastereomer]] may be obtained by one [[crystallization]] of the aldol adduct. Unfortunately, anti-aldol adducts cannot be obtained reliably with the Evans method. Despite the cost and the limitation to give only ''syn'' adducts, the method's superior reliability, ease of use, and versatility render it the method of choice in many situations. Many methods are available for the cleavage of the auxiliary:&lt;ref name=JACS882506&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Evansaldol6.gif|center|Evans' chiral oxazolidinone cleavage]]

[[Image:Evansaldol7.gif|center]]

In the syn-selective reactions, both enolization methods give the ''Z'' enolate, as expected; however, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction is controlled by the methyl stereocenter, rather than the chirality of the oxazolidinone. The methods described allow the stereoselective assembly of [[polyketide]]s, a class of natural products which often feature the aldol retron.

==Modern aldol chemistry==
Recent methodology now allows a much wider variety of aldol reactions to be conducted, often with a catalytic amount of [[Chiral reagent|chiral ligand]]. When reactions employ small amounts of [[enantiopure|enantiomerically]] pure ligands to induce the formation of enantiomerically pure products, the reactions are typically termed &quot;catalytic, asymmetric&quot;; for example, many different catalytic, [[asymmetric synthesis|asymmetric]] aldol reactions are now available.

===Acetate aldol reactions===
A key limitation to the [[chiral auxiliary]] approach described previously is the failure of N-acetyl [[imide]]s to react selectively. An early approach was to use a temporary [[thioether]] group:&lt;ref name=JACS882506 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In this reaction the nucleophile is a boron enolate derived from reaction with [[dibutylboron triflate]] (nBu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BOTf), the base is [[N,N-Diisopropylethylamine]]. The thioether is removed in step 2 by [[Raney Nickel]] / hydrogen [[organic reduction|reduction]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The method works on [[Branching (chemistry)|unbranched]] aliphatic aldehydes, which are often poor [[electrophile]]s for catalytic, asymmetric processes. This may be due to poor electronic and steric differentiation between their [[enantioface]]s.

The [[chemical yield|yields]], [[diastereoselectivity|diastereoselectivities]], and enantioselectivities of the reaction are generally high, although not as high as in comparable Evans cases. Unlike the Evans auxiliary, however, the thiazoldinethione can perform acetate aldol reactions (ref: Crimmins, Org. Lett. 2007, 9(1), 149–152.) and can produce the &quot;Evans syn&quot; or &quot;non-Evans syn&quot; adducts by simply varying the amount of [[sparteine|(−)-sparteine]]. The reaction is believed to proceed via six-membered, titanium-bound [[transition state]]s, analogous to the proposed transition states for the Evans auxiliary. NOTE: the structure of sparteine shown below is missing a N atom.

[[Image:crimminsaldol1.gif|center]]

===Organocatalytic aldol reactions===
An exciting new development is the use of chiral secondary [[amine]] catalysts. These secondary amines form transient [[enamine]]s when exposed to ketones, which may react enantioselectively with suitable aldehyde electrophiles. This is known as '''enamine catalysis''', a type of [[organocatalysis]], since the catalyst is entirely based on a small organic molecule. In a seminal example, [[proline]] efficiently catalyzed the cyclization of a triketone:

[[Image:organocatalytic1.gif|center]]

This reaction is known as the [[Hajos-Parrish reaction]]&lt;ref&gt;Z. G. Hajos, D. R. Parrish, German Patent DE 2102623 '''1971'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

There is no danger of an achiral background reaction because the transient enamine intermediates are much more nucleophilic than their parent ketone enols. This strategy is particularly powerful because it offers a simple way of generating enantioselectivity in reactions without using transition metals, which have the possible disadvantages of being toxic or expensive.

Interestingly, proline-catalyzed aldol reactions do not show any non-linear effects (the enantioselectivity of the products is directly proportional to the enantiopurity of the catalyst). Combined with [[isotopic labelling]] evidence and [[computational chemistry|computational studies]], the proposed [[reaction mechanism]] for proline-catalyzed aldol reactions is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:organocatalytic2.gif|center]]

This strategy allows the otherwise challenging cross-aldol reaction between two aldehydes. In general, cross-aldol reactions between aldehydes are typically challenging because they can [[polymerization|polymerize]] easily or react unselectively to give a statistical mixture of products. The first example is shown below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:organocatalytic3.gif|center]]

In contrast to the preference for syn adducts typically observed in enolate-based aldol additions, these organocatalyzed aldol additions are anti-selective. In many cases, the organocatalytic conditions are mild enough to avoid polymerization. However, selectivity requires the slow syringe-pump controlled addition of the desired electrophilic partner because both reacting partners typically have enolizable protons. If one aldehyde has no enolizable protons or alpha- or beta-branching, additional control can be achieved.

An elegant demonstration of the power of asymmetric organocatalytic aldol reactions was disclosed by MacMillan and coworkers in 2004 in their synthesis of differentially protected [[carbohydrate]]s. While traditional synthetic methods accomplish the synthesis of [[hexose]]s using variations of iterative [[protective group|protection-deprotection]] strategies, requiring 8–14 steps, organocatalysis can access many of the same substrates using an efficient two-step protocol involving the proline-catalyzed dimerization of alpha-oxyaldehydes followed by tandem Mukaiyama aldol cyclization.

[[Image:organocatalytic4.gif|center]]

The aldol dimerization of alpha-oxyaldehydes requires that the aldol adduct, itself an aldehyde, be inert to further aldol reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Earlier studies revealed that aldehydes bearing alpha-alkyloxy or alpha-[[silyloxy]] [[substituent]]s were suitable for this reaction, while aldehydes bearing [[Electron-withdrawing group]]s such as [[acetoxy]] were unreactive. The protected [[erythrose]] product could then be converted to four possible sugars via Mukaiyama aldol addition followed by [[lactol]] formation. This requires appropriate diastereocontrol in the Mukaiyama aldol addition and the product [[carbenium ion|silyloxycarbenium ion]] to preferentially cyclize, rather than undergo further aldol reaction. In the end, [[glucose]], [[mannose]], and [[allose]] were synthesized:

[[Image:organocatalytic5.gif|center]]

===&quot;Direct&quot; aldol additions===
In the usual aldol addition, a carbonyl compound is deprotonated to form the enolate. The enolate is added to an aldehyde or ketone, which forms an alkoxide, which is then protonated on workup. A superior method, in principle, would avoid the deprotonation-aldol-protonation sequence in favor of a &quot;direct aldol addition&quot;. The major issue in such a process is that the aldol addition generates an alkoxide, which is much more basic than the starting materials, precluding catalyst turnover:

==Biological aldol reactions==
Examples of aldol reactions in biochemistry include the splitting of [[fructose-1,6-bisphosphate]] into [[dihydroxyacetone]] and [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] in the second stage of [[glycolysis]] which is an example of a reverse aldol reaction catalysed by the enzyme [[aldolase A]].

Simple sugars are cyclic aldol trimers of acetaldehyde that can be prepared synthetically.

==Mechanism==

The [[reaction mechanism]] of this oxidative cleavage involves first addition of the peroxy acid to the carbonyl forming a [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] intermediate also called the [[Criegee intermediate]] for its similarity with rearrangement of that name. The transition state for this step is envisioned as a hydrogen relay involving three peroxy acid molecules with linear O-H-O interactions.&lt;ref name=Yamabe&gt;''The Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Baeyer-Villiger Reactions'' Shinichi Yamabe and Shoko Yamazaki [[J. Org. Chem.]]; '''2007'''; 72(8) pp 3031 - 3041; (Article) [[doi:10.1021/jo0626562]]&lt;/ref&gt; Next is a [[concerted reaction|concerted]] migration of one of the adjacent carbons to oxygen with loss of a [[carboxylic acid]]. If the migrating carbon is chiral, the stereochemistry is retained.

[[Image:Baeyer-Villiger oxidation (mechanism).png|500px|center|Mechanism of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation]]

:Migratory aptitude: H &gt; tertiary alkyl &gt; cyclohexyl &gt; secondary alkyl, aryl &gt; primary alkyl &gt; methyl

In the [[transition state]] for this migration step the R-C-O-O [[dihedral angle]] should be 180° in order to maximise the interaction between the filled R-C [[sigma bond]] and the [[antibonding]] O-O sigma bond. This step is also (at least [[in silico]]) assisted by two or three peroxyacid units enabling the hydroxyl proton to shuttle to its new position.&lt;ref name=Yamabe/&gt; 

For unsymmetrical ketones, the migrating group is usually the one that can best stabilize positive charge. Thus, cyclic ketones produce [[lactone]]s and aldehydes usually produce [[carboxylic acid]]s, although [[formate]]s can also be formed if the migrating group is tertiary or an electron rich vinyl group or aromatic ring ([[Dakin reaction]]).  Sometimes the [[alcohol]] is formed when the formate is hydrolytically unstable.

== Biocatalytic BV oxidation ==
The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation can also be performed by [[biocatalysis]] with a so-called '''Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase''' or '''BVMO'''. Though largely an experimental technique it shows the promise of [[enantioselectivity]] and [[green chemistry]] for this reaction type. Current stumbling blocks are confinement to water as the reaction medium, substrate specificity,  dependence on the [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] use and costs of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s such as [[NADPH]] and the costs associated with BVMO's themselves because lengthy purification steps are required. [[In vivo]] oxidations with metabolically active microbial cells introduce complications on their own. 

In one study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Towards practical biocatalytic Baeyer-Villiger reactions: applying a thermostable enzyme in the gram-scale synthesis of optically active lactones in a two-liquid-phase system | author = Frank Schulz; François Leca; Frank Hollmann; Manfred T Reetz | journal = [[Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry]] | date = '''2005''' | volume = 1 | issue = 10 | url = http://bjoc.beilstein-journals.org/content/pdf/1860-5397-1-10.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.1186/1860-5397-1-10 | pages = 10 | pmid = 16542025}}&lt;/ref&gt; the enzyme purification issue is addressed and a special thermally stable [[Oxygenase|monooxygenase]] is isolated from a specific [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] strain. This [[enzyme]] converts [[racemic]] 2-phenylcyclohexanone with oxygen to the corresponding (R)-[[lactone]] with 50% [[chemical yield]] and 94% [[enantiomeric excess]] with in a biphasic system of water and [[hexane]]. The NADPH cofactor is regenerated in each [[catalytic cycle]] by action of a second [[dehydrogenase]] enzyme which consumes [[isopropanol]] as a [[sacrificial catalyst]]. 
The solubility of the organic reactant and product is low in the aqueous phase thus averting [[Reaction inhibitor|inhibition]]. On the other hand the [[catalytic turnover number]] for this reaction is much larger than can be obtained with classical organic [[asymmetric catalyst]]s.

The '''Beckmann rearrangement''', named after the German chemist [[Ernst Otto Beckmann]] (1853–1923), is an [[acid catalysis|acid-catalyzed]] [[rearrangement reaction|rearrangement]] of an [[oxime]] to an [[amide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Beckmann solution''' consists of [[acetic acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[acetic anhydride]], and was widely used to catalyze the rearrangement.  Other acids, such as [[sulfuric acid]] or [[polyphosphoric acid]], can also be used. [[sulfuric acid]] is the most commonly used acid for commercial lactam production due to its formation of an ammonium sulfate by-product when neutralized with [[ammonia]]. [[Ammonium sulfate]] is a common agricultural [[fertilizer]] providing nitrogen and sulfur.

== Reaction mechanism ==
The [[reaction mechanism]] of the Beckmann rearrangement is generally believed to consist of an [[alkyl]] migration with expulsion of the hydroxyl group to form a [[nitrilium ion]] followed by [[hydrolysis]]: 

:[[Image:Beckmann rearrangement mechanism.PNG|center|900px|Beckmann rearrangement mechanism]]

In one study, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =S. | last = Yamabe | coauthors =  Tsuchida, N.; Yamazaki, S.| title=Is the Beckmann Rearrangement a Concerted or Stepwise Reaction? A Computational Study | journal=[[Journal of Organic Chemistry]] | year=2005 | volume=70| pages=10638&amp;ndash;10644 |doi=10.1021/jo0508346 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/joceah/2005/70/i26/abs/jo0508346.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mechanism is established [[in silico]] taking into account the presence of [[solvent]] molecules and substituents. The rearrangement of acetone oxime in the Beckmann solution involves three acetic acid molecules and one proton (present as an [[oxonium ion]]). In the [[transition state]] leading to the iminium ion (σ - complex), the methyl group migrates to the nitrogen atom in a [[concerted reaction]] and the hydroxyl group is expulsed. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is stabilized by the three acetic acid molecules. In the next step the electrophilic carbon atom in the nitrilium ion is attacked by water and the proton is donated back to acetic acid. In the transition state leading to the N-methyl acetimidic acid, the water oxygen atom is coordinated to 4 other atoms. In the third step, an isomerization step protonates the nitrogen atom leading to the [[amide]].

[[Image:Beckmann mechanism aliphatic.png|center|600px|The Beckmann rearrangement mechanism]]

The same computation with a [[hydroxonium]] ion and 6 molecules of water has the same result but when the migrating substituent is phenyl in the reaction of acetophenone oxime with protonated acetic acid the mechanism favors the formation of an intermediate three-membered π - complex. This π - complex is again not found in the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. 

[[Image:Acetophenone oxime mechanism.png|center|600px|beckmann rearrangement mechanism acetophenone oxime]]

With the cyclohexanone-oxime, the relief of [[ring strain]] results in a third reaction mechanism leading directly to the protonated caprolactam in a single concerted step without the intermediate formation of a π - complex or σ - complex.

== Cyanuric chloride assisted Beckmann reaction==
The Beckmann reaction is known to be catalyzed by [[cyanuric chloride]] and [[zinc chloride]] [[co-catalyst]].  For example, cyclododecanone can be smoothly convered to the corresponding [[lactam]], a [[monomer]] for the production of [[nylon 12]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Furuya | first = Y. | coauthors = Ishihara, K.; Yamamoto, H.| title=Cyanuric Chloride as a Mild and Active Beckmann Rearrangement Catalyst | journal= [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | year=2005| volume=127| pages=11240&amp;ndash;11241| url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/2005/127/i32/abs/ja053441x.html| doi=10.1021/ja053441x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Beckmann example.png|center|600px|Beckmann reaction]]

The [[reaction mechanism]] for this reaction is based on a [[catalytic cycle]] with cyanuric chloride activating the [[hydroxyl]] group via a [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]. The reaction product is dislodged and replaced by new reactant via an intermediate [[Meisenheimer complex]]. 

[[Image:Beckmann mechanism.gif|center|Beckmann cyanuric acid cataly cycle]]

==Beckmann fragmentation==
When the oxime has a [[quaternary carbon atom]] in an anti position to the hydroxyl group a fragmentation occurs forming a [[nitrile]]:

The '''benzoin condensation''' is a reaction (often called a [[condensation reaction]], for historical reasons) between two [[aromatic]] [[aldehyde]]s, particularly [[benzaldehyde]]. The reaction is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by a [[nucleophile]] such as the [[cyanide]] [[anion]] or an [[persistent carbene|N-heterocyclic carbene]]. The reaction product is an aromatic [[acyloin]] with [[benzoin]] as the parent compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = Benzoin | author = Roger Adams and C. S.

Lapworth]].&lt;ref&gt;''CXXII. — Reactions involving the addition of [[hydrogen cyanide]] to carbon compounds. Part II. Cyanohydrins regarded as complex acids'' [[Arthur Lapworth]], Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions, '''1904''', 85, 1206 - 1214. [[doi:10.1039/CT9048501206]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction mechanism==
[[Image:Benzoin condensation2.png|center|thumb|700px|Scheme 1. Benzoin condensation reaction mechanism. Proton transfers occur at (i) and (ii).]]

In the first step in this reaction, the cyanide anion (as sodium cyanide) reacts with the aldehyde in a [[nucleophilic addition]]. Rearrangement of the intermediate results in [[umpolung|polarity reversal]] of the [[carbonyl]] group, which then adds to the second carbonyl group in a second nucleophilic addition. [[Hydrogen ion|Proton]] transfer and elimination of the cyanide ion affords benzoin as the product. This is a [[reversible reaction]].

The cyanide ion serves three different purposes in the course of this reaction. It acts as a [[nucleophile]], facilitates proton abstraction, and is also the [[leaving group]] in the final step. The benzoin condensation is in effect a [[dimerization]] and not a condensation because a small molecule like water is not released in this reaction. For this reason the reaction is also called a '''benzoin addition'''. In this reaction, the two aldehydes serve different purposes; one aldehyde donates a proton and one aldehyde accepts a proton. 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde is an efficient proton donor while benzaldehyde is both a proton acceptor and donor. In this way it is possible to synthesise mixed benzoins, i.e. products with different groups on each half of the product.

==Scope==
The reaction can be extended to [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] aldehydes with [[base (chemistry)|base]] catalysis in the presence of [[thiazolium salt]]s; the reaction mechanism is essentially the same. These compounds are important in the synthesis of [[heterocyclic compounds]]. The addition is also possible with [[enone]]s; for instance [[methyl vinyl ketone]] is a reagent in the [[Stetter reaction]].

In [[biochemistry]], the [[coenzyme]] [[thiamine]] is responsible for biosynthesis of acyloin-like compounds. This coenzyme also contains a thiazolium moiety, which on [[deprotonation]] becomes a nucleophilic carbene.

In one study, a custom-designed [[persistent carbene|N-heterocyclic carbene]] (NHC, the framework is related to thiazolium salts) was found to facilitate an [[enantioselective]] [[intramolecular]] benzoin condensation (''Scheme 2'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. Enders, O. Niemeier and T. Balensiefer | title = Asymmetric Intramolecular Crossed-Benzoin Reactions by N-Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis | year = 2006 | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 1463–1467 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200503885 | pmid = 16389609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Intramolecularbenzoin.png|thumb|center|500px|Scheme 2. An intramolecular benzoin condensation]]

This finding was confirmed in another study with a slightly modified NHC using [[DBU (chemistry)|DBU]] as the base instead of [[potassium tert-butoxide]] (''Scheme 3'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = H.

The '''Curtius rearrangement''' (or '''Curtius reaction''' or '''Curtius degradation'''), as first defined by [[Theodor Curtius]], is a [[chemical reaction]] that involves the rearrangement of an [[acyl azide]] to an [[isocyanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Curtius, T. | journal = [[w:Chemische Berichte|Ber.]] | year = 1890 | volume = 23 | pages = 3023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/prac.18940500125]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Several reviews have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith, P. A. S. | journal = [[w:Org. React.|Org. React.]] | year = 1946 | volume = 3 | pages = 337–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/cr00084a001]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:Curtius_Rearrangement_Scheme.png|300px|The Curtius rearrangement]]

The isocyanate can be trapped by a variety of [[nucleophile]]s.  Often water is added to [[hydrolyze]] the isocyanate to an [[amine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Kaiser, C.; Weinstock, J. | title = Amines from mixed carboxylic-carbonic anhydrides: 1-phenylcyclopentylamine |  collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 910 | year = 1988 | prep = cv6p0910}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When done in the presence of [[Tert-Butanol|''tert''-butanol]], the reaction generates [[Tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Boc]]-[[protecting group|protected]] amines, useful intermediates in [[organic synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/op970115w]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ol051428b]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carboxylic acid]]s '''1''' can be easily converted to acyl azides '''3''' using [[diphenylphosphoryl azide]] '''2'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Shioiri, T.; Yamada, S. | title = Diphenyl phosphorazidate | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 206 | year = 1990 | prep = cv7p0206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ja00772a052]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1016/S0040-4020(01)97352-1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:DPPA Acid To BOC Amine Scheme.png|550px|Using DPPA to convert an acid to a BOC-protected amine]]

Likewise, when the Curtius reaction is performed in the presence of [[benzyl alcohol]], [[Carboxybenzyl|Cbz]]-protected amines are formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = 1-''N''-Acylamino-1,3-dienes from 2,4-pentadienoic acids by the Curtius rearrangement: benzyl ''trans''-1,3-butadiene-1-carbamate |  author = Jessup, P. J.; Petty, C. B.; Roos, J.; Overman, L. E. | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 95 | year = 1988 | prep = cv6p0095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction mechanism==
The first step of the Curtius rearrangement is the loss of [[nitrogen]] gas forming an [[acyl nitrene]] ('''2''').  Once formed, acyl nitrenes very quickly rearrange by migration of R-group forming the desired [[isocyanate]] ('''3''').

:[[Image:Curtius Rearrangement Mechanism.png|600px|The mechanism of the Curtius rearrangement]]

==Scope==
In one variation called the '''Darapsky degradation''' (A. Darapsky, 1936) a Curtius rearrangement takes place as one of the steps from an α-cyanoester to an [[amino acid]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chempensoftware.com/reactions/RXN051.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)==

===Overview (location)===
In the former living quarters and office of Sigmund Freud in the house at Berggasse 19 in Vienna's ninth district, the Sigmund Freud Museum presents an exhibition documenting the life and work of the founder of psychoanalysis. Freud lived and worked in this house from 1891 until 1938, when on 4 June he was forced by the National Socialists to flee with his family into exile in England.
History/Timeline: Over the years the museum was expanded in several phases. Initially limited to the few rooms of Sigmund Freud's former practice, the facility underwent major expansion during the '80s and '90s. The addition of a new library was followed by a museum shop, a book storage unit and a modern lecture and exhibition hall in the newly integrated private apartment of the Freud family. The various phases of remodeling were overseen by architect Wolfgang Tschapeller, whose additions maintain a clear distance from the historical structure. Today Anna Freud's rooms house a collection of contemporary art, the Sigmund Freud Museum Contemporary Art Collection. Historical film clips assembled and commentated by Anna Freud that depict moments in the private life of Freud and his family are shown in a video room.

In 2002, the museum gained a new &quot;exterior surface&quot; through the acquisition of the Berggasse 19 storefront in which Siegmund Kornmehl operated his kosher butcher shop until 1938. Starting with the installation &quot;A View to Memory&quot; by Joseph Kosuth, the Sigmund Freud Foundation has since May 2002 regularly invited artists to redefine the storefront as a space for artistic intervention.

===Local Significance===
For many Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), the father of psychoanalysis is Vienna’s most famous sons. His writings not only influenced the intellectual thinkers of his day, but have formed the basis of psychological thought throughout the world (Vienna: City Guide). Thus, the museum is his home country of Vienna is testament to the significance the country has educating generations since the time of Sigmund Freud.  The interior decoration of the museum was carried out in 1971 with the help of Anna Freud, Sigmund Freud's youngest daughter. Original furnishings, including the waiting room, a selection from Freud’s collection of antiquities, and signed copies and first editions of his works provide a glimpse into Freud's biography, his cultural environment and the development of psychoanalysis. The museum owns the original furniture from his waiting room, nearly eighty pieces of Freud’s collection of antiques, and some of his personal belongings. In addition, the few existing original films and sound recordings of Sigmund Freud and his family can be viewed in the museum’s media room.

===Global significance/Impact===
Today Berggasse 19 stands programmatically for the institutions and activities that deepen knowledge about psychoanalysis, its historical dimensions and its links to art. While many of Freud’s ideas are as controversial today as they were in his time, there is no doubting his contribution to psychology; “free association” – the practice of having patients lie on a couch and talk about whatever came to mind- is still the common method of psychotherapy in the United States and around the world. The concept of the unconscious is present in many schools of psychoanalytical thought.  
Additional information: The Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C. holds the most extensive collection of Freud documentation. Thus, Freud admirers and enthusiasts here in the United States do not have to travel to Europe to acquire a first-hand learning experience of the acclaimed psychoanalysis.

==Franz Kafka Museum (Prague)==

===Overview (location)===
The Franz Kafka Museum of Prague is dedicated to the Prague-born author, Franz Kafka. The first part of the museum is dedicated to setting the scene. It shows photographs of Prague during Kafka's lifetime and conjures up a vivid picture of the city’s thriving Jewish community. One glass box contains photos of artists, writers and musicians who were Kafka’s peers, including his friend Max Brod. It is easy to imagine these young men walking around Prague’s Old Town, or hanging out in the city’s café’s, just as the young do now. Some of these same names appear in the memorial in the Pinkas Synagogue, dedicated to victims of the Holocaust.

===History/Timeline===
The long-term exhibition, The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague, has made its home here after a stay in Barcelona and then New York. The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague takes place in summer, a time of special significance for Kafka. He was born here on 3rd July 1883, died in a sanatorium at Kierling on 3rd June 1924, and was buried in Prague on 11th  June.

'''FRANZ KAFKA BIOGRAPHY ( 1883 - 1924 ) 	'''													

1883 - Franz Kafka is born in Prague on 3 July. His father, Hermann Kafka, is a merchant from a modest background. His mother, Julie Löwy, is from a Jewish family whose religion is more deeply rooted than her husband’s.
1889 - 1893 - Primary school on the Fleischmarktgasse (Meat Market Street). Sisters, Gabrielle, called Elli, Valerie, called Valli, and Ottilie, called Ottla, are born during this period.
1893 - 1900 - Studies at the Altstädter German Institute. First friends are: Oskar Pollak and Rudolf Illový. The Kafka family lives on the Zeltnergasse.
1901 - 1902 - Higher education at the German University of Prague; first chemistry; in the summer, German studies, then law. Spends the summer holiday at Liboch, near Prague, and travels to Munich. First meetings with Max Brod. 
1903 - Up until this year, has destroyed his first exercises in style. Reads Nietzsche. July: state exams in history of law.
1904 - Autumn / winter: probably, the first draft of &quot;Description of a Strunggle&quot; (&quot;Beschreibung eine Kampfes&quot;).
1905 - In the month of August, he travels to Zuckmantel, Silesia, to stay at a sanatorium. 
1906 - Obtains his doctorate in law. In October, begins the year of legal work necessary to exercise the profession.
1907 - Writes &quot;Wedding Preparations in the Country&quot; (Hochzeitsvorbereitungen auf dem Lande&quot;). The family moves to Niklastrasse (Nikolas Street). In October, he starts work at the Prague office of the Assicurazioni Generali, a company headquartered in the Italian city of Trieste, then Austrian. 
1908 - The first pieces appear, eight fragments, in the magazine Hyperion. Beginning in July of this year until July 1922, works at the Arbeiterunfall und Versicherungsanstalt (Workers' Accident Insurance Institute).
1909 - &quot;Conversation with the Supplicant&quot; and &quot;Conversation with the Drunk&quot; are published in Hyperion. Spends holiday in Riva (on lake Garda) with Max and Otto Brod. On 29 September, the Prague daily Bohemia publishes the tale &quot;The Airplanes at Brescia&quot; (&quot;Die Aeroplane in Brescia&quot;). He started to write a diary.
1910 - In the Easter supplement of Bohemia, five prose pieces appear under the title &quot;Reflections&quot; (&quot;Betrachtungen&quot;). Starts writing the Diaries. He attends Yiddish theater performances. In the middle of October, travels to Paris with Max and otto Brod. Kafka falls ill and returns alone to Prague. In early December, travels to Berlin.
1911 - Spends his holidays by the lake in northern Italy with Max Brod. Spends a period at the Erlenbach sanatorium. His interest in Yiddish theater grows and he makes friends with Jizchak Löwy. The Diaries are already voluminous. In February, writes The Urban World (Die städtische Welt), an extraordinary dream. From 26 August to 12 Septem´ber, with Max Brod, passes through Munich on his way to Zurich, Lucerne, Lugano, Milan, and Lake Maggiore. From Italy they go on to Paris, where Kafka writes some notes as an exceptional observes, and then return to Milan, where they see plays at the Fossati Theater. In Paris, they have seen Racine's Phaedra and Bizet's Carmen. 
1912 - A decisive year for the writer. During the first month he starts The Man Who Disappeared (&quot;Der Verschollene&quot;), which will later be given the title America by Max Brod. Spends July in Weimar with Max Brod. Is introduced to Felice Bauer, with whom in October will begin a copious correspondence. From November to December, tireless and insomniac, writes &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (literally, &quot;the transformation,&quot; but known generally as &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;). By January 1913, has written seven chapters of The Man Who Disappeared, the original title of the novel, which for a long time was published inder the title of America. In December, gives a public reading of &quot;The Judgment&quot; (&quot;Das Urteil&quot;). The number of pages in the Diaries decreases while the letters to Felice abound.
1913 - In Leipzig, Rowohlt publishes Meditation (Betrachtung), which has been in circulation since November 1912. In January, Kafka travels to Berlin to meet Felice Bauer's family. In May, makes a second trip to Berlin. In September, travels to Vienna, Venice, and Riva.
1914 - In June, becomes engaged to Felice Bauer. In July, breaks off the engagement. Travels to the Baltic. In August, moves to his own rented lodgings on Bilekgasse street. Begins writing The Trial (Der Prozess). Elias Canetti, in his 1969 essay Kafka's Other Trial (Der andere Prozess Kafkas), makes a connection between the &quot;trial&quot; of Kafka's engagement and breakup with Felice and its transformation into the novel The Trial. Meets Felice's friend Grete Bloch. October&quot; writes &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; (&quot;In der Strafkolonie&quot;).
1915 - In January, goes to see Felice Bauer. In March, moves to his own apartment on Lange Gasse (Long Street). (Kafka almost lived with his parents, except for some periods such as those noted and his final days in Berlin). The expressionist playwright Carl Sternheim presents the Fontane prize money to Kafka. November: in Leipzig, Rohwohlt publishes &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; (Die Verwandlung&quot;). &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; is display in bookshops, along with &quot;The Judgment&quot;.
1916 - In July, goes to Marienbad with Felice. Writes short stories for A Country Doctor (Ein Landartz). In Munich, gives a reading of &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;.
1917 - In the evening and at nights, he worked on Alchemists Street, and then takes a room in the Schönborn Palace. In July, becomes engaged to Felice for the second time. On 4 September, is diagnosed with tuberculosis. Takes a leave from work and spends time in Zürau with Ottla. Writes &quot;Aphorisms&quot;. In December, in Prague, breaks off his engagement with Felice for the second time.
1918 - First, to Zürau, where he studies Kierkegaard. In the summer, to Prague. In September, to Turnau. In November, to Schelesen. Relationship with Julie Wohryzek, from a modest family, greatly displeases Kafka's father.
1919 - A Country Doctor and &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; are published. Spends the summer in Prague. Becomes engaged to Julie Wohryzek. Spends the winter with Max Brod in Schelesen. Writes &quot;Letter to his Father&quot; (&quot;Brief an den Vater&quot;), a document as hurtful as a shot to the hierarchical heart of the family, but prevented from reaching its intended recipient by his mother.
1920 - Sick leave in Merano. Correspondence with Milena Jesenská. Summer and autumn, office work in Prague. Breaks up with Julie Wohryzek. Goes to Matliare, in the Tatra Mountains, for the following moths. Strikes up a friendship with a doctor, Robert Klopstock.  
1921 - In the Tatra Mountains (Matliare) until September. In Prague for the rest of the year.
1922 - January and February in Spindelmühle. Returns to Prague.  Reads pages from The Castle (Das Schloss), which he works on from January to September. In the spring, writes &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; (&quot;Ein Hungerkünstler&quot;) and in the summer, &quot;Investigations of a Dog&quot; (&quot;Forschungen eines Hundes&quot;).  Spends June to September in Planá with Ottla, then Prague.
1923 - Spends July in Müritz, on the Baltic Sea. Meets Dora Dymant. Goes to stay with Ottla at Schelesen. From September to March, lives in Berlin with Dymant, a Zionist who revives in Kafka the desire to go and settle in Palestine. Writes some of the narratives that, together with those of the previous year, epitomize the purest traits of his production: &quot;A Little Woman&quot; (&quot;Eine kleine Frau&quot;) and &quot;The Burrow&quot; (&quot;Der Bau&quot;).
1924 - Berlin. In March, leaves for Prague. Writes &quot;Josephine, the Singer, or the Mouse Folk.&quot; Kafka can neither talk nor swallow his food. Leaves Prague at the beginning of April. Goes to the Kierling Sanatorium, with Robert Klopstock and Dora Dymant. Dies there on 3 June. The writer is buried on 11 June in Prague. &quot;A Hunger Artist&quot; is published that summer. 

===Local/Significance===
The symbiosis between Prague and Kafka's life and work is well known - a linking of destinies that, for several decades, Kafka scholars have studied from every possible angle. This is due not only to the nature of the exhibits themselves but also, and primarily, to the way the exhibition is thematically presented. The exhibition has got two sections - Existential Space and Imaginary Topography.
Existential Space - In this first stage of our immersion into the world of Kafka, we look at what the city does with the writer, how it shapes his life, the kind of stamp it leaves on him. Prague acts on Kafka with all of its metamorphosing power, confining him to an existential space which he can only enter by &quot;fixing my gaze on the surface of things&quot;, Prague forces Kafka into a spatial stranglehold, perversely dosing out its secrets. Prague contributes the myth, its obscure magic, a magnificent backdrop, but it abhors clarity. And this is precisely what Kafka detects.
He sees the city as a &quot;dear little mother with claws&quot;, endowed with a past which is greater than its present, shielded by its charm, yet also raising a great, constantly threatening fist. His Diaries and a voluminous correspondence with his family, friends, lovers and editors bear witness to this influence. Our aim is to explore the city, seeing it from Kafka's point of view. An exclusively biographical or merely chronological approach would not be enough; the challenge lies in condensing the principal conflicts in the life of Kafka in Prague, guided by the writer's own gaze. This means joining Kafka on his descent into the depths of his city, adapting ourselves to his sensorial range and cognitive register, becoming involved in a slow distortion of space-time - in short, agreeing to an experience where everything is allowed except indifference.  
Imaginary Topography - The way Kafka creates the layers of his city is one of the most enigmatic operations of modern literature. With the odd exception, Kafka does not name the places he describes in his novels and short stories. The city steps back is no longer recognizable by its buildings, bridges and monuments. And even if they are recognized by an inhabitant of Prague or by a student of Kafka, they have become something else.
People are often keen to pinpoint real Prague places in Kafka's fiction. It is generally recognized that the anonymous cathedral in The Trial is none other than St. Vitus cathedral, and that the path taken by Joseph K. in the last chapter leads from the Old Town to the outer limits of Kleinseite, over Charles Bridge. It is also said that in The Judgment, from Georg Bendemann's window, we recognize the wharf, the river, the opposite bank of the Moldava, just as they could be seen from Niklasstrasse, where the Kafka family lived in 1912. Efforts have been made to prove that the topography of Prague is a constant which simply goes unnamed.

Yet this is not what really matters. In his fiction, Kafka carries out a more difficult operation: he turns Prague into an imaginary topography which transcends the fallacy of realism. Kafka's phantasmal architecture has other ends. Rather than a particular house, school, office, church, prison or castle being important, it is what these constructions reveal when they act as topological metaphors or allegorical places. What surprises does this transfigured Prague hold in store? Just how far can the metamorphosis of a city take us?

===Global Significance/Impact===
Franz Kafka is considered to be one of the most important and influential writers of the 20th century. His work, most of which was published posthumously, continues to be a source of research, scholarship and philosophical discussion in diverse academic, literary and popular arenas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter on the politics of oil takes an in depth focus on the oil industry in Austria and the Czech Republic. Every large organization deals with politics, in essence politics is about governing and managing resources. In dealing with the world’s most demanded resource, oil it can be expected that the politics that surround it will be complex, far reaching, and most of all relate to you the reader.  In studying the politics of oil in these two countries my original assumptions were quickly overturned. The original assumption would be that the politics of oil would be local issues, but I quickly discovered that while local issues do have a place in the research and discussion, regional, and even transnational issues will take precedent in the preceding sections.


&lt;u&gt;Politics of Oil:  The Top Companies That Deal With Oil Everyday&lt;/u&gt;

When the delivery truck fills up the tank in Vienna or the taxi is pumping petrol in Prague, it is more likely than not they are not thinking about the complex politics that go into getting the gas from the ground to the pump. This is where Mr. Helmut Langanger comes into the scene in Austria, and he is the man who helps make that almost mystical transition from the ground to the pump work so well.  Mr. Langanger. is in charge of exploration for the largest oil company in Austria, OMV.  . His leadership in exploring and then drilling for oil in Austria has helped place Austria in a somewhat comfortable energy position. In 2003 the largest discovery was made by his team when a well was found, containing 500,000 tons of crude oil.  (Christian, 2005) While OMV dominates holds the lions share of the market in Austria, the same cannot be said of Austria’s close neighbor, the Czech Republic.

The Ceska Rafinerska is the largest oil refiner in the Czech Republic and in early 2010 has become the center of oil politics in the Czech Republic. The largest oil company in the world, Shell, is looking to sell their share of the company to a buyer for around $200 million. There are numerous buyers vying for the purchase but nobody has reached the set price yet. Many entities have become involved in this engagement, ranging from the Czech government to Russian diplomats. The company, Mero has their sights set on acquiring the refinery in order to expand their control on the energy industry in the Czech Republic. Mero already has the market share on transporting oil throughout the country and acquiring the company would be a strategic benefit, however inside sources close to the negotiations state that their initial offer fell far below what was being asked for. (Frantova, 2010)

&lt;u&gt;The Politics of Paying: How Austria And Czech Republic Pay for Oil&lt;/u&gt;

The Czech Republic, like many countries tax oil as a way to raise funds to run the country. The most recent statistics show that there are various taxes built into the cost of a liter of oil in the country. This includes the value added tax and the consumer tax.(PetroPlaza, 2010) Across the border in Austria there is a growing debate over the oil tax. Should the country use toll roads or move to a  robust fuel tax? Organizations that support toll roads suggest that it would have economic benefits; such as lowering inflation for the Austrian economy and attracting those seeking “cheap gas” from across the border. (Austrian Times , 2010)

&lt;u&gt;The Politics of the Grid: Russia’s Role on it&lt;/u&gt;

Transporting oil from the ground to the tank is no simple task and international politics can sometimes stop the transition. The events that took place between the United States, Czech Republic, and Russia represent how divisive oil can be on the world stage. In the summer of 2008, the United States signed an agreement with the Czech Republic that would place a radar in the country. The radar, which is linked to the larger Anti-Ballistic Missile Program run by the United States Department of Defense  combats Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threats. This event caused diplomatic relations between Russia and the other countries to remain shaky for a few weeks. Days after this agreement was signed Russia cut the flow of oil into the Czech Republic. Russian leaders publicly stated that how furious they were over the proceedings and vowed to take action. The Czech Republic had keenly predicted such tension over oil years before when they built a massive pipeline on the other side of the country extending from Germany. (Kramer 2008)

Austria’s largest oil company, OMV for years have been working to access the precious oil flowing from Russia. Austria and Slovakia at the same time also had their sights set on the Druzhba  Pipeline. The aged pipeline dates from the Communist Era and was constructed to bring the crude supply to countries under Soviet control. The problem that all parties are facing is there is a gap in the pipeline grid and the gap needs to be filled to help prevent stoppages of flow and increase the availability of supply for Austria and Slovakia. The project is in its second phase after the Slovakian company declared bankruptcy. New life was breathed into the project when the Slovakian government bought back a stake in the company. This is a great example of how expensive it is to build pipelines through other countries. It takes cooperation and determination to see a project too success. (Energy Business Review 2009)

&lt;u&gt;The Politics of the Oil Pipeline: How Nations can Rise and Fall from Them&lt;/u&gt;.

It was March 1960, in Bratslavia, Slovakia when an oil pipeline began leaked and severely damaged a critical water reservoir that supplied the city drinking water.  The first step taken on this multi-layered oil pipeline construction plan was to build a pipeline between an Austrian refinery  and the Slovnaft refinery. This brought immediate condemnation from Slovakian citizens who want to protect the environment. The concern is that the  projected development of the pipeline will travel directly over a precious water source. concern.(Spectactor March 2010)

While the prior environmental damage remained on the front of many Slovakian minds, it was in the national interest of their country and Austria to continue with the project especially in light of the memrandum of understanding that the two countries leaders signed committing them to strong energy policies while assisting the other. The “Bratslava-Schwechat-Pipeline” has become the final design for this pipeline. As this project is completed it will be the first time that crude oil will be pumped directly from Russia. While Austria waits for Sloavkia to sort out technical issues, Slovakia must weigh the pros and cons of the project. The positive aspects of developing a more robust network of pipelines throughout central and eastern Europe can help them become more secure. In early 2009, Russia cut off gas to areas of Europe when a disagreement with Ukraine went bad. Therefore to prevent a “Ukraine Incident” it could be advantageous to develop oil that is less connected from Russia. . ( Spectator March 2010)

&lt;u&gt;The Politics of Consolidation: Why Oil Companies are Merging&lt;/u&gt;

In April of this year, 2010 Mobil Oil Austria merged with Agip Austria which is controlled by a company that goes by ENI, which is based in Italy. The European Union Commission dealing with matters like these had to agree to accept the accquistion because of the numerous countries involved in the deal.  ENI deals mainly with natural gas exporation but has its hands in oil exploration as well.  While many of these companies may sound unfamiliar if you are outside of Europe, Mobil Oil Austria which is the key company in the figure is owned by the ExxonMobil Holding Company based in Germany. (EU approves acquisition of Mobil Oil Austria by ENI)

In the Czech Republic there is a transnational oil company. It is the Czech Republic Resource Corporation. The company in Spring of 2010 has signed a deal with a Texas oil company that commits to working with them in the field. This is not strategic business move but a financial one that will allow a new Czech oil company to leverage itself in the competitive market. It has an office in Prague and one located in Texas.  (Stock Market Weekly)

The politics of Oil in Austria and the Czech Republic and the wider Eastern European market are complex, there is no debate about that. But hopefully the point has been brought to the reader that the politics of oil involve leverage and resources. Austria may use leverage to help Slovakia against Russia. OMV may use its vast network through Austria to put up a bid when the next opportunity comes to acquire a smaller company. Oil companies and states seem to have a symbiotic relationship, and that has been a unique facet of this brief look at these two countries “spheres of oil.” Austria and the Czech Republic are great examples of the symbiotic relationship that makes of the politics of oil.

The '''Demjanov rearrangement''' (named after its discoverer [[Nikolai Demyanov]]) is the [[chemical reaction]] of primary [[amine]]s with [[nitrous acid]] to give rearranged [[alcohol]]s.{{Ref|Demjanov1903A}}{{Ref|Demjanov1903B}}{{Ref|Smith1960}} It involves substitution by an OH group with a possible ring expansion.

It is named after the Russian chemist [[Nikolai Jakovlevich Demjanov]] (Dem'anov, Demianov) ([[1861]]–[[1938]]).{{Ref|Jack Li2006}}

[[File:Demjanov_Rearrangement_Scheme.png|500px]]

==Reaction Mechanism==
The reaction process begins with diazotization of the amine by nitrous acid. The diazonium group is a good leaving group.

At this point, two possibilities occur. In possibility A, the four membered ring expands to produce a charged five membered ring, thus expelling the nitrogen gas. An water molecule adds to the carbocation, and with one further deprotonation the substituted five membered ring is produced.{{Ref|Jack Li2006}}

{|
||A. ||[[File:Demjanov mech rearrangement.png|525px]]
|}

In possibility B, the hydrogen molecule adds directly to the carbon attached to the nitrogen molecule, thus expelling the nitrogen gas in one step. After deprotonation, the substituted four membered ring is produced.{{Ref|Jack Li2006}}
{|
||B. ||[[File:Demjanov mech SN2.png|511px]]
|}

==Uses==
The Demjanov rearrangement is extremely useful in producing a 1-carbon ring enlargement in four, five or six membered rings. Ring enlargements are incredibly useful in synthesizing mechanically useful molecules.

It has been shown that the Demjanov reaction is susceptible to [[regioselectivity]]. One example of this is a study conducted by D. Fattori looking at the regioselectivity of the Demjanov rearrangement in one-carbon enlargements of naked sugars.{{Ref|Fattori1993}} It showed that when the an exo methylamine underwent Demjanov nitrous acid deamination, ring enlargement was not produced. 

[[Image: Demjanov Fattori-exo.png|402px]]

However, when the endo methylamine underwent the same conditions, a mixture of rearranged alcohols were produced. 
 
[[Image: Demjanov Fattori-endo.png|396px]] 

Often, the Demjanov rearrangement is followed by deprotonation to produce a cyclic ketone, an incredibly useful molecule for further reactions such as various nucleophilic attacks.

==Problems==
This rearrangement also leads to a substituted, but not expanded, byproduct. Thus it can be difficult to isolate the two products and acquire the desired yield. Also, stereoisomers are produced depending on the direction of addition of the water molecule and other molecules may be produced depending on rearrangements.

==Future uses==
Current research is exploring the possibilities of various directing groups to influence the selectivity of products in the Demjanov rearrangement, such as tin or silicon.{{Ref|Chow2004}}This may lead to increased success with the Demjanov, as it would allow more control in the reaction and increase the desired product yield. The rearrangement is incredibly useful, but using it can sometimes prove ineffective by the difficulty of creating the preferred product. Thus if directing groups are possible, this would greatly improve the applicability of the Demjanov. 

==Variations==
===Tiffeneau-Demjanov Rearrangement===
The [[Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement]] is a variation of the Demjanov rearrangement, and involves both a [[ring expansion]] and the production of a [[ketone]] by using [[sodium nitrite]] and [[hydrogen cation]]. Using the Tiffeneau-Demjanov reaction is often advantageous as, while there are rearrangements possible in the products, the reactant always undergoes ring enlargement. As in the Demjanov rearrangement, products illustrate regioselectivity in the reaction. Migratory aptitudes of functional groups dictate rearrangement products. 

===Use of diazomethane===
[[Diazomethane]] also produces ring enlargement, and its reaction is mechanically similar to the [[Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement]].

Owing to the steric stability of five- and six-membered ring structures, these will preferentially be formed.  1,4- and 1,6 diesters will form five-membered cyclic &amp;beta;-keto esters, while 1,5- and 1,7 diesters will form six-membered &amp;beta;-keto esters. &lt;ref&gt;Organic-Chemistry.org.

Some of the Diels-Alder reactions are reversible; the decomposition reaction of the cyclic system is then called the '''Retro-Diels-Alder'''. For example, Retro-Diels-Alder compounds are commonly observed when a Diels Alder product is analyzed via [[mass spectrometry]].

[[Otto Diels|Otto Paul Hermann Diels]] and [[Kurt Alder]] first documented the novel reaction in 1928 for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in [[1950]] for their work on the eponymous reaction..

The Diels-Alder reaction is generally considered the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; of reactions in organic chemistry since it requires very little energy to create the very useful [[cyclohexene]] ring.&lt;ref&gt;Kloetzel, M. C. ''Org. React.'' '''1948''', ''4'', 1-59. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, H. L. ''Org. React.'' '''1948''', ''4'', 60-173.

== Reaction mechanism ==
The reaction occurs via a single [[transition state]], which has a smaller volume than either the starting materials or the product. It is an associative type of reaction, and it is sped up by very high pressures. Diels-Alder is an example of a [[pericyclic]] reaction.

Some [[free-radical]] versions of this reaction have been observed, though these are not Diels-Alder reactions as the [[stereochemistry]] at the carbons is scrambled. These are step-wise reactions of the free radicals which form the new bonds in at least two steps. An example of this type of reaction is the reaction of ''selenobenzophenone'' with a 1,3-diene (See: [[thioketones]]).

== The diene ==
The [[diene]] component in the Diels-Alder reaction can be open-chain or cyclic and it can have many different kinds of [[substituent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kozmin, S. A.; He, S.; Rawal, V. H. ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 10, p.442 (2004); Vol. 78, p.160 (2002). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=v78p0160 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one limitation: it must be able to exist in the s-''cis'' [[Geometric isomerism|conformation]].  [[Butadiene]]&lt;ref&gt;Hershberg, E. B.; Ruhoff, J. R. ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 2, p.102 (1943); Vol. 17, p.25 (1937). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv2p0102 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; itself normally prefers the s-''trans'' conformation, with the two double bonds as far away from each other as possible. If there are substituents larger than hydrogen then [[steric hindrance]] may influence the relative stabilities of the conformations. For simple cases, the barrier to rotation about the central bond is small and rotation to the less favourable but reactive s-''cis'' conformation is rapid. 
Cyclic dienes that are permanently in the s-''cis'' conformation are exceptionally reactive in Diels-Alder reactions ([[cyclopentadiene]] is a classic example), while cyclic dienes that are permanently in the s-''trans'' conformation and cannot adopt the s-''cis'' conformation will not undergo the Diels-Alder reaction at all. An especially reactive diene is [[Danishefsky’s diene]].

[[Dendralenes]] are a new class of experimental DA dienes.

Unstable dienes, such as o-[[quinodimethane]], can be generated [[in situ]]. [[Aromatic]] stabilization in the product of a DA reaction using such a diene is, in some cases, the reason behind the very high reactivity and lack of stability of such diene. The use of such unstable dienes is advantageous, despite the trouble, in that the products will contain newly formed aromatic six-membered rings.

Benzenoid compounds rarely undergo DA reactions and often require very reactive dienophiles. One example of such rare reaction is the [[Wagner-Jauregg reaction]].

== The dienophile ==
In a typical Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile has an [[electron-withdrawing group]] [[conjugation|conjugated]] to the alkene. Though common, this feature is not exclusive of Diels-Alder dienophiles. There must be some extra conjugation, at least a [[phenyl]] group or [[chlorine]] atom. The dienophile can be activated by a [[Lewis acid]] such as [[niobium pentachloride]].&lt;ref&gt;''Niobium Pentachloride Activation of Enone Derivatives: Diels-Alder and Conjugate Addition Products'' Mauricio Gomes Constantino, Valdemar Lacerda Júnior and Gil Valdo José da Silva ''Molecules'' '''2002''', ''7'', 456–465. ([http://artemis.ffclrp.usp.br/PublicaPDF/Valdemar_Mol02.pdf Article])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:DA NbCl5.gif|center|Dienephile activation by Lewis acid]]

[[Cyclopentadiene]] does not react with [[cyclohexenone]] in [[ethyl acetate]] unless the Lewis acid is present. The yield improves when reaction temperature is lowered to -78°C because [[polymerization]] side reactions are prevented. Niobium pentachloride catalysis gives only the [[endo conformer]]. The same reaction with [[aluminium chloride]] results in an endo and exo mixture. Many of these [[Lewis acid]]s are not good catalysts for the reaction of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, this is because the carbonyl oxygen binds too tightly to the metal centre. A far better catalyst for such a system is a combination of [[silver]] [[perchlorate]] and [[Lawesson's reagent]] in cold [[dichloromethane]].

It is well known that it is possible to use heteroatom containing dienophiles for Diels-Alder reactions, for instance [[Lawesson's reagent]] (and diferrocenyl dithiadiphosphetane disulfide) can react with 1,3-dienes to form six membered ring adducts. Also selenoketones and [[thioketones]] are able to react in the same way with 1,3-dienes. [[Imines]] are reactants in the [[Aza Diels-Alder reaction]].

Dienophiles can be chosen to contain a &quot;masked functionality&quot;. The dienophile undergoes Diels-Alder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule. A series of reactions then follow to transform the functionality into a desirable group. The end product cannot not be made in a single DA step because equivalent dienophile is either unreactive or inaccessible. An example of such approach is the use of α-chloroacrylonitrile (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CClCN). When reacted with a diene, this dienophile will introduce alpha-chloronitrile functionality onto the product molecule. This is a &quot;masked functionality&quot; which can be then hydrolyzed to form a ketone. α-Chloroacrylonitrile dienophile is an equivalent of [[ketene]] dienophile (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=C=O), which would produce same product in one DA step. The problem is that ketene itself cannot be used in Diels-Alder reactions because it reacts with dienes in unwanted manner (by [2+2] [[cycloaddition]]), and therefore &quot;masked functionality&quot; approach has to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Ranganathan ''Synthesis'' '''1977''', 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other such functionalities are [[phosphonium]] substituents (yielding exocyclic double bonds after [[Wittig reaction]]), various [[sulfoxide]] and [[sulfonyl]] functionalities (both are [[acetylene]] equivalents), and nitro groups (ketene equivalents).

== Heterodienophiles ==
No major loss in reactivity of dienophile is seen when one, or both, of the carbons are substituted for another variety of atom.&lt;ref&gt;Weinreb, S. M. ''Comp. Org. Syn.'' '''1991''', ''5'', 513-550. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbonyl]] groups, for example, can successfully react with dienes to yield [[pyran]]oid rings. Generally, the endo [[transition state]] is favored in this case.

Nitroso compounds (N=O) react to form oxazine-like compounds (cyclic molecules with nitrogen and oxygen present in the six-membered ring).&lt;ref&gt;Streith, J.; DeFoin, A. ''Synthesis'' '''1994''', 1107-1117.&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of dienophiles successfully used for DA reactions is [[imine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Greico, P.; Larsen, S. D. ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 8, p.31 (1993); Vol. 68, p.206 (1990). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv8p0031 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; Such reactions are useful for preparation of [[alkaloid]] and other polycyclic compounds.

== Stereoselectivity in DA Reactions ==
Diels-Alder reactions can lead to formation of a variety of structural [[isomer]]s and [[stereoisomer]]s ([[enantiomer]]s and [[diastereomer]]s).&lt;ref&gt;''Diastereofacial Selectivity in the Diels-Alder Reaction'' Coxon, J. M. ''et al.'' ''Advances in Detailed Reaction Mechanisms'' '''1994''', ''3'', 131-166. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; Identity of major products can usually be predicted, however.

In unsymmetrically substituted diene and dienophile, pseudo-[[arene substitution patterns|ortho]] and [[arene substitution patterns|para]] orientations in products are usually favored over [[arene substitution patterns|meta]] orientation. A particular preference in location of substitutents in the product can, in some cases, be explained in terms of [[frontier orbital]] theory. Most commonly, [[diene]] bears an [[electron-releasing group]] (ERG) and dienophile bears an [[electron-withdrawing group]] (EWG). The strongest interaction takes place between [[HOMO]] of diene and [[LUMO]] of dienophile. Carbons that have the highest coefficients in two frontier orbitals will begin to bond; therefore these carbons will direct the orientation of substituents and thus identity of major product of a DA reaction.

Dealing with the actual frontier orbital coefficients can be avoided since the preferred orientation in product can be described in terms of partial positive and negative charges that exist in diene and dienophile. Carbon with a partial negative charge will interact most readily with carbon bearing a partial positive charge. Therefore those two carbons will start coming together, thus dictating the relative orientation of substituents. The existence of partial positive/negative charge can always be determined by drawing resonance contributors for diene and dienophile, taking their ERG and EWG into consideration.

The initial potential of the reaction was utilized in the form of insecticides, which ultimately led to the endo rule. Otto Diels’ and Kurt Alder’s reaction allowed for the production of weapons against agricultural pests to be fully realized in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, A. Diels-Alder Reactions. New York, NY: Elsevier Company, 1965. pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these chemicals contained chlorine, of which two are called [[Dieldrin]] and [[Aldrin]] after the appropriate individuals. These chemicals have been long-since discontinued because of their toxicity to not only invertebrates, but to higher orders of organisms as well.&lt;ref&gt;Damgaard, Ida N., Niels E. Skakkebaek, and Et Al . &quot;Persistent Pesticide in Human Breast Milk and Cryptorchidism.&quot; Environmental Health Perspectives 114 (2006): pp. 1133-1138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cerrillo, I, M F. Olea-Serrano, J Ibarluzea, and Et Al . &quot;Environmental and Lifestyle Factors for Organochloride Exposure Among Women Living in Southern Spain.&quot; Chemosphere 62 (2006): pp. 1917-1924.&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, insecticide use may continue unabated with the recent introduction of various safe treatments. Though insecticides like Dieldrin and Aldrin cause a slew of cardiac and respiratory illnesses (as well as reproductive failure) they served as an important step towards understanding why the endo product was the major yield. The study of the insecticide’s fused [[norcamphane]] rings became a highly popular topic in the 1930s and 1940s. Oxidative degradation revealed high specificity of the stereochemistry; after much research by Kurt Alder and H.F. Rickert, it became clear that steric hindrance is not as important in Diels-Alder reactions as it is in other reactions. This led to the secondary orbital explanation as well as a satisfactory hypothesis that elucidated polymerization of certain Diels-Alder adducts.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, A. Diels-Alder Reactions. New York, NY: Elsevier Company, 1965. pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ERGandEWG.png|right|frame|DA substituent effects]]

===Cis principle===

According to the '''cis principle''' or the '''Alder-Stein rules''' formulated by Alder and Stein in 1937, the [[stereochemistry]] of substituents in the starting material is retained in the product. This means that if a [[cis]]-dienophile is reacted, both of the cis-[[substituent]]s will end up on same side (face) of the product ring. [[Trans]]-dienophile will yield a product where both of trans-substituents (that came originally from the dienophile) will be on different sides of the product ring. The same principle applies to [[diene]]s. ''Trans'', ''trans'' or ''cis'', ''cis'' 1,4-substituents will end up on same side of the ring, whereas ''trans'', cis'' 1,4-substituents will be oriented towards different faces of the ring.

Besides the ortho/meta/para-forming orientations, the [[diene]] and dienophile may arrange themselves in different ways to yield [[Endo-exo isomerism|exo and endo]] [[transition state]]s which result in different products. To determine which is the endo and which is the exo transition state, the two molecules are oriented [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other, such that diene's single bond (one which connects two double bonds) is parallel to dienophile's double or [[triple bond]]. It makes no difference whether the dienophile is positioned above or below the diene. The single substituent (or [[cis]]-substituents on the dienophile) is oriented to point in the direction of diene's pi-system. This is the '''''endo''''' transition state (pictured below). If these substituents are pointed away from the [[diene]], this would be the '''''exo''''' transition state.

===Endo addition rule===
[[Image:endoexo1.png|right|frame|Endo versus exo effect]]
Using the 'cis principle' it is understood that cis-substituents on dienophile, for example, will end up on same side of the molecule. It is not obvious where the [[substituent]]s on both [[diene]] and dienophile will end up relative to each other. To predict the [[cis]] or [[trans]] orientation of substituents that are coming from different molecules we have to examine possible [[transition state]]s. The most stable transition state will lead to the major product. Transition states will also dictate the relative orientation of the diene's and dienophile's substituents on the product ring. In some cases another rule can be applied: the '''endo addition rule'''. According to this rule, the most stable [[transition state]] results when there is a 'maximum accumulation of double bonds'. This rule is not always followed. It most often applies when dealing with cyclic [[diene]]s and dienophiles. For example, the DA reaction of [[cyclopentadiene]] and [[maleic anhydride]] yields over 95% of the [[Endo-exo isomerism|endo]] product.
It is important to note that labels &quot;exo&quot; and &quot;endo&quot; relate to the orientation of [[substituent]]s in the [[transition state]] and not to a specific orientation of substituents in the product molecule. In each individual case, the transition state has to be examined to see the most favored relative orientation of substituents. It is not true for the endo transition state that the substituents on dienophile and 1,4-substituents on diene will always point towards the same side of the newly formed ring. &quot;Endo&quot; and &quot;exo&quot; define specific transition states, not orientation of substituents. In the picture below, it just happens that the endo transition state will yield substituents on same side of the ring. This is not always so. In the case of [[maleic anhydride]] and [[cyclopentadiene]] the endo product will have the R groups of the [[diene]] and dienophile oriented toward the opposite sides of the newly formed ring.

[[Image:bothexoendo.png|center|frame|Reaction with both exo-endo effect]]

The exo product can predominate, however, for some reactions. This can happen when the resulting endo product can easily dissociate back into the starting material. In such reactions, the exo product predominates with extended reaction times because the exo product is [[thermodynamic reaction control|thermodynamically favored]]. In other cases, the endo product can convert to what would be the exo product of the reaction. In the example below, endo product B was the only one isolated after the Diels-Alder reaction. However, letting the reaction go for prolonged periods of time also yielded substantial amounts of exo product A. The authors speculated that endo product B can [[epimer]]ize to exo product A in the following way:

[[Image:conversionendo.png|center|frame|Epimerization in DA reaction]] 

In summary, [[diastereoselectivity]] is based on the postulation of the [[transition state]]. For any given DA reaction, one can imagine one possible transition state being favored over the other due to [[steric]], stereoelectronic, and complexing factors. Thus, predictions can be made on the identity of major product of a particular DA reaction by looking at the starting material available.

==Retro Diels-Alder reactions==
DA reactions are reversible and in a retro Diels-Alder reaction the diene and alkene are reformed. One representative reaction is the '''Rickert-Alder reaction'''&lt;ref&gt;Alder, K.; Stein, G.; Pries, P.; Winckler, H. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges.1929, 62B, 2337-72.&lt;/ref&gt; in which, thanks to favorable rearomatization, the oxidized cycloadduct of [[quinone]] and [[1,3-cyclohexadiene]] at elevated temperatures extrudes [[ethylene]] to form [[anthraquinone]].

:[[Image:Rickert-Alder reaction.png|400px|Rickert-Alder reaction]]

==Asymmetric DA reactions==
In '''asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions ''' only one of two possible enantiomers is formed. [[Asymmetric catalysis]] by [[organocatalysis]] is possible with catalysts based on an [[imidazoline]] skeleton  (the [[MacMillan catalyst]]) for instance in the reaction of [[cyclohexadiene]] with [[acrolein]]:&lt;ref&gt;''New Strategies for Organic Catalysis: The First Highly Enantioselective Organocatalytic Diels-Alder Reaction'' Ahrendt, K. A.; Borths, C. J.; MacMillan, D. W. C. [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; (Communication); '''2000'''; 122(17); 4243-4244.  [[doi:10.1021/ja000092s]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:McMillanCatalyst.png|400px|center|DA reaction with MacMillan catalyst]]

Diels-Alder reactions also lend themselves to [[chiral synthesis]] with [[chiral auxiliary|chiral auxiliaries]]. In one research effort,&lt;ref&gt;''A fully-telescoped, aqueous, auxiliary-mediated asymmetric transformation'' Mathew P. D. Mahindaratne, Brian A. Quiñones, Antonio Recio III, Eric A. Rodriguez, Frederick J. Lakner, and George R. Negrete ''[[Arkivoc]]''(EJ-1566C) pp 321-328 '''2005'''.  ([http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2005/I06_Juaristi/1566/EJ-1566C.asp Article])&lt;/ref&gt; the auxiliary is derived from L-[[asparagine]]. The [[telescopic synthesis]] with [[cyclopentadiene]] and [[acrylic acid]] yields the DA adduct with three [[stereocenter]]s as predominantly the [[endo conformer]] and with 54% [[enantiomeric excess|ee]].

[[Image:AsymmetricDielsAlder.png|center|500px|Asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction with asparagine auxiliary]]

[[Lewis acid]]s ([[aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[zinc chloride|ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and others) act as catalysts by coordinating to the dienophile. The complexed dienophile becomes more [[electrophilic]] and more reactive toward the diene. This increases the rate and often the stereoselectivity of a DA reaction.

The '''Favorskii rearrangement''' (not to be confused with the [[Favorskii reaction]]), named for the Russian chemist [[Alexei Yevgrafovich Favorskii]]&lt;!--- a.k.a. Alexei Evgrafovich Favorskii ---&gt;, is most principally a rearrangement of [[cyclopropanone]]s and [[α-halo ketones]] which leads to [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives.  In the case of cyclic α-halo ketones, the Favorski rearrangement constitutes a ring contraction. This rearrangement takes place in the presence of a base, sometimes [[hydroxide]], to yield a carboxylic acid but most of the time either an [[alkoxide]] base or an [[amine]] to yield an [[ester]] or an [[amide]], respectively.  α,α’-Dihaloketones eliminate HX under the reaction conditions to give α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds  &lt;ref&gt;Favorskii, A.

([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv7p0135 Article])&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the case of cylic α-halo ketones, the rearrangement occurs as depicted below &lt;ref&gt;[[Organic Syntheses]], Coll. Vol. 4, p.594 (1963); Vol. 39, p.37 (1959). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv4p0594 Article])&lt;/ref&gt;:

[[Image:Favorskii Rearrangement Scheme.png|center|350px|The Favorskii rearrangement]]

==Reaction mechanism==

The [[reaction mechanism]] is thought to involve the formation of an [[enolate]] on the side of the [[ketone]] away from the [[chlorine]] atom. This enolate cyclizes to a [[cyclopropanone]] intermediate which is then attacked by the hydroxide [[nucleophile]].

[[Image:Favorskii_Rearrangement_Mechanism.png|center|630px|Favorskii rearrangement mechanism]]

Usage of [[alkoxide]] anions such as sodium methoxide, instead of sodium hydroxide, yields the ring-contracted [[ester]] product.

The reaction type also exists as a [[photochemical reaction]].

The '''Hofmann rearrangement''' is the [[organic chemistry|organic]] reaction of a primary [[amide]] to a primary [[amine]] with one fewer [[carbon]] atom.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, A. W. v. ''[[Chemische Berichte|Ber.]]'' '''1881''', ''14'', 2725.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, E. S.; Lane, J. F. ''Org. React.'' '''1949''', ''3'', 267-306. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shioiri, T. ''Comp. Org. Syn.'' '''1991''', ''6'', 800-806. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:Hofmann Rearrangement Scheme.png|400px|The Hofmann rearrangment]]

The reaction is named after its discoverer: [[August  Wilhelm von Hofmann]].   This reaction is also sometimes called the '''Hofmann degradation''',  and should not be confused with the [[Hofmann  elimination]].

==Mechanism==
The reaction of [[bromine]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] forms [[sodium hypobromite]] ''[[in situ]]'', which transforms the primary amide into an intermediate [[isocyanate]].  The intermediate isocyanate is hydrolyzed to a primary amine giving off [[carbon dioxide]].

:[[Image:Hoffmann_rearrangement_mechanism.svg|400px]]

==Variations==
Several reagents can substitute for bromine. [[N-Bromosuccinimide]] and [[1,8-Diazabicycloundec-7-ene|1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)]] can effect a Hofmann rearrangement.  In the following example, the intermediate isocyanate is trapped by [[methanol]] forming a [[carbamate]].&lt;ref&gt;Keillor, J. W.; Huang, X. - ''Organic Syntheses'' (2004, 549pp)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:[[Image:Hoffmann_Rearrangement_NBS.png|400px|The Hofmann rearrangement using NBS]]

In a similar fashion the intermediate isocyanate can be trapped by [[tert-butanol]] yielding the [[Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate|t-butoxycarbonyl]] (Boc)-protected amine.

A mild alternative to bromine is also [[(bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene]].&lt;ref&gt;Almond, M. R.; Stimmel, J. B.; Thompson, E. A.; Loudon, G.M. - ''Organic Syntheses'' (1993, 132pp)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lossen rearrangement''' is the conversion of a [[hydroxamic acid]] ('''1''') to an [[isocyanate]] ('''3''') via the formation of an O-acyl, sulfonyl, or phosphoryl intermediate hydroxamic acid O-derivative ('''2''') and then conversion to its conjugate base.  Here, [[4-Toluenesulfonyl chloride]] is used to form a sulfonyl O-derivative of hydroxamic acid.  &lt;ref&gt;Lossen, W. ''Ann.'' '''1872''', ''161'', 347.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Lossen, W. ''Ann.'' '''1874''', ''175'', 271 &amp; 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lossen Rearrangement Scheme.png|500px|center|The Lossen rearrangement]]

The isocyanate can be used further to generate ureas in the presence of amines ('''4''') or generate amines in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ('''5''').

[[Image:IsocyanateGOES.png|300px|center|]]

===Reaction Mechanism===
The mechanism below begins with an O-acylated hydroxamic acid derivative that is treated with base to form an isocyanate that generates an [[amine]] and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  The hydroxamic acid acid derivative is first converted to its conjugate base by abstraction of a hydrogen by a base.  Spontaneous rearrangement kicks off a carboxylate anion to produce the isocyanate intermediate.  The isocyanate in the presence H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O hydrolyzes and then [[decarboxylation]] via abastraction of a hydrogen by a base generates an amine and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.

The '''Mannich reaction''' is an [[organic reaction]] which consists of an '''amino alkylation''' of an acidic proton placed next to a [[carbonyl]] [[functional group]] with [[formaldehyde]] and [[ammonia]] or any primary or secondary [[amine]]. The final product is a β-amino-carbonyl compound also known as a [[Mannich base]].&lt;ref&gt;Original translated from German Wiki&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions between [[aldimine]]s and α-methylene carbonyls are also considered Mannich reactions because these imines form between amines and aldehydes. 
The reaction is named after [[Chemist]] [[Carl Mannich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/ardp.19122500151]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Mannich.png|center|500px|Scheme 1. Ammonia or an amine reacts with formaldehyde and an alpha acidic proton to a beta amino carbonyl compound]]

The Mannich reaction is an example of [[nucleophilic addition]] of an amine to a [[carbonyl]] group followed by dehydration to the [[Schiff base]]. The Schiff base is an [[electrophile]] which reacts in in the second step in a [[nucleophilic addition]] with a compound containing an acidic proton. The Mannich reaction is also considered a [[condensation reaction]]. 

In the Mannich reaction, [[ammonia]] or primary or secondary [[amine]]s are employed for the activation of [[formaldehyde]]. Tertiary amines lack an N-H proton to form the intermediate [[imine]]. α-CH-acidic compounds ([[nucleophile]]s) include [[carbonyl]] compounds, [[nitrile]]s, [[acetylene]]s, aliphatic [[nitro]] compounds, α-alkyl-[[pyridine]]s or [[imine]]s. It is also possible to use activated [[phenyl]] groups and electron-rich heterocycles such as [[furan]], [[pyrrole]], and [[thiophene]].

==Reaction mechanism==
The mechanism of the Mannich reaction starts with the formation of an [[iminium]] ion from the amine and the formaldehyde.

[[image:Mannichreactionmech1.svg|center|567px]]


Because the reaction takes place under acidic conditions, the compound with the carbonyl functional group (in this case a [[ketone]]) can [[Keto-enol tautomerism|tautomerize]] to the enol form, after which it can attack the iminium ion.

[[image:Mannichreactionmech2.svg|center|436px]]



[[image:Mannichreactionmech3.svg|center|650px]]

==Asymmetric Mannich reactions==
Progress has been made towards [[chiral synthesis|asymmetric]] Mannich reactions. When properly functionalized the newly formed ethylene bridge in the Mannich adduct has two [[prochiral]] centers giving rise to two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers. The first asymmetric Mannich reaction with an unmodified aldehyde was carried with [[proline|(S)-proline]] as a naturally occurring [[optical isomerism|chiral]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ja017833p]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Asymmetric mannich overview.png|center|500px|Scheme 4. Asymmetric Mannich reactions ref. Cordova (2002)]]

The reaction''' taking''' place is between a simple aldehyde such as [[propionaldehyde]] and an [[imine]] derived from [[glyoxylic acid|ethyl glyoxylate]] and [[aniline|p-methoxyaniline]] (PMP = paramethoxphenyl) catalyzed by (S)-proline in [[dioxane]] at [[room temperature]]. The reaction product is [[Diastereoselectivity|diastereoselective]] with a preference for the syn-Mannich reaction 3:1 when the alkyl substituent on the aldehyde is a [[methyl]] group or 19:1 when the alkyl group the much larger [[pentyl]] group. Of the two possible syn adducts (S,S) or (R,R) the reaction is also [[enantioselective]] with a preference for the (S,S) adduct with [[enantiomeric excess]] larger than 99%. This stereoselectivity is explained in the scheme below.  

[[Image:SynMannichAdduct.png|center|500px|Scheme 5. Asymmetric syn-Mannich reactions ref. Cordova (2002)]]

Proline enters a [[catalytic cycle]] by reacting with the aldehyde to form an [[enamine]]. The two reactants (imine and enamine) line up for the Mannich reaction with [[Si face|Si facial]] attack of the imine by the Si-face of the enamine-aldehyde. Relief of [[steric strain]] dictates that the alkyl residue R of the enamine and the imine group are [[antiperiplanar]] on approach which locks in the syn mode of addition. The enantioselectivity is further controlled by [[hydrogen bonding]] between the proline [[carboxylic acid]] group and the imine. The [[transition state]] for the addition is a nine-membered ring with [[chair conformation]] with partial single bonds and double bonds. The proline group is converted back to the aldehyde and a single S,S isomer is formed.

By modification of the proline catalyst to it is also possible to obtain anti-Mannich adducts.&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ja056984f]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anti Mannich reaction.png|center|500px|Scheme 6. Asymmetric syn-Mannich reactions ref. Mitsumori (2006)]]

An additional methyl group attached to proline forces a specific enamine approach and the transition state now is a 10-membered ring with addition in anti-mode. The diastereoselectivity is at least anti:syn 95:5 regardless of alkyl group size and the S,R [[enantiomer]] is preferred with at least 97% [[enantiomeric excess|ee]].

==Applications==
The Mannich-Reaction is employed in the [[organic synthesis]] of natural compounds such as [[peptide]]s, [[nucleotide]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, and [[alkaloids]] (e.g. [[tropinone]]). Other applications are in agro chemicals such as plant growth regulators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = da Rosa F. A. F., Rebelo R. A., Nascimento II M. G. | title = Synthesis of new indolecarboxylic acids related to the plant hormone indoleacetic acid| journal = Journal of the Brazilian Chemical Society| year = 2003| volume = 14| issue = | pages = 11| url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0103-50532003000100003}}&lt;/ref&gt; paint- and [[polymer chemistry]], [[catalyst]]s and crosslinking.

The Mannich reaction is also used in the synthesis of medicinal compounds e.g. [[rolitetracycline]] (Mannich base of [[tetracycline]]), [[fluoxetine]] (antidepressant), [[tramadol]], and [[tolmetin]] (anti-inflammatory drug).

The '''Michael reaction''' or '''Michael addition''' is the [[nucleophilic addition]] of a [[carbanion]] or another [[nucleophile]] &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2006.03.001]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.files.chem.vt.edu/chem-dept/mapmuri/pdf/Mather%20reprint%206_06.pdf Mather 2006 reprint ]&lt;/ref&gt; to an [[Α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound|alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compound]].  It belongs to the larger class of [[conjugate addition]]s.  This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C-C bonds.  Many asymmetric variants exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chapter 18: Enols and Enolates &amp;mdash; The Michael Addition reaction | author = Ian Hunt | publisher = University of Calgary | url = http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/351/Carey5th/Ch18/ch18-4-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayden et al., Organic Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Image:Michael Reaction general mechanism.png|400px|Michael Reaction general mechanism]]

In this scheme the R and R' [[substituent]]s on the [[nucleophile]] (a '''Michael donor''') are [[electron-withdrawing group]]s such as [[acyl]] and [[cyano]] making the methylene hydrogen [[carbon acid|acidic]] forming the carbanion on reaction with [[base (chemistry)|base]] '''B:'''. The substituent on the activated [[alkene]] also called a '''Michael acceptor''' is usually a [[ketone]] making it an [[enone]] but it can also be a [[nitro]] group.

A newer definition, proposed by Kohler,&lt;ref&gt;Kohler. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1907, 37, 385; ibid., 1935, 57, 1316.&lt;/ref&gt; is the 1,4-addition of a doubly stabilized carbon nucleophile to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.  Some examples of nucleophiles include beta-ketoesters, [[malonate]]s, and beta-cyanoesters.  The resulting product contains a highly useful 1,5-dioxygenated pattern.

Classical examples of the Michael reaction are the reaction between [[diethyl malonate]] (Michael donor) and [[diethyl fumarate]] (Michael acceptor),&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | title = 1,1,2,3-Propanetetracarboxylic acid, tetraethyl ester | author = H.

The Michael addition is an important [[atom economy|atom-economical]] method for [[Diastereomer|diastereoselective]] and [[enantioselective]] C-C bond formation.  A classical [[tandem reaction|tandem]] sequence of Michael and aldol additions is the [[Robinson annulation]].

== Mechanism ==
The [[reaction mechanism]] is  '''1''' (with R an [[alkoxy]] residue) as the nucleophile:

:[[Image:Michael Reaction Mechanism.png|500px|Michael reaction mechanism]]

[[Deprotonation]] of '''1''' by base leads to [[carbanion]] '''2''' stabilized by its electron-withdrawing groups.  Structures 2a to 2c are three [[resonance structure]]s that can be drawn for this species, two of which have [[enolate]] ions. This nucleophile reacts with the electrophilic alkene '''3''' to form '''4''' in a [[conjugate addition reaction]]. Proton abstraction from protonated base (or solvent) by the enolate '''4''' to '''5''' is the final step. 

The course of the reaction is dominated by orbital, rather than electrostatic, considerations.  The [[HOMO]] of stabilized [[enolate]]s has a large coefficient on the central carbon atom while the [[LUMO]] of many alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds has a large coefficient on the beta carbon.  Thus, both reactants can be considered [[HSAB theory|soft]].  These polarized [[frontier orbital]]s are of similar energy, and react efficiently to form a new carbon-carbon bond.

Like the [[aldol addition]], the Michael reaction may proceed via an [[enol]], [[silyl enol ether]] in the Mukaiyama-Michael addition, or more usually, enolate nucleophile.  In the latter case, the stabilized carbonyl compound is [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] with a strong base (hard enolization) or with a [[Lewis acid]] and a weak base (soft enolization).  The resulting enolate attacks the activated [[olefin]] with 1,4-[[regioselectivity]], forming a carbon-carbon bond.  This also transfers the enolate to the [[electrophile]].  Since the electrophile is much less acidic than the nucleophile, rapid proton transfer usually transfers the enolate back to the nucleophile if the product is enolizable; however, one may take advantage of the new locus of nucleophilicity if a suitable electrophile is pendant.  Depending on the relative acidities of the nucleophile and product, the reaction may be [[catalysis|catalytic]] in base.  In most cases, the reaction is [[irreversible reaction|irreversible]] at low temperature, due to [[Principle of least motion|least-motion argument]]s.

==Asymmetric Michael reaction==
Recent research has focused on expanding the scope of [[asymmetric reaction|asymmetric]] Michael additions.  The most common methods involve [[chiral phase transfer catalysis]], involving [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[quaternary ammonium salt]]s derived from the [[Cinchona]] [[alkaloid]]s, and [[organocatalysis]], which uses [[enamine]] or [[iminium]] activation with chiral secondary amines, usually derived from [[proline]].

In the reaction between [[cyclohexanone]] and [[nitrostyrene]] sketched below, the base proline is derivatized and works in conjunction with a protic acid such as [[P-Toluenesulfonic acid|''p''-toluenesulfonic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Simple Diamine- and Triamine-Protonic Acid Catalysts for the Enantioselective Michael Addition of Cyclic Ketones to Nitroalkenes | author =  Sunil V.

:[[Image:Michael reaction asymmetric.png|400px|Michael reaction asymmetric]]

[[Syn addition]] is favored with 99% [[enantiomeric excess|ee]]. In the [[transition state]] believed to be responsible for this selectivity, the [[enamine]] (formed between the proline nitrogen and the cycloketone) and nitrostyrene are co-facial with the [[nitro]] group [[hydrogen bond]]ed to the protonated amine in the proline side group.  

:[[Image:AsymmetricMichaelTransitionState.png|200px|Asymmetric Michael Transition State]]

A well-known Michael reaction is the synthesis of [[warfarin]] from [[4-hydroxycoumarin]] and [[benzylideneacetone]] first reported by Link in 1944 &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ja01234a019]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

:[[File:Warfarin synthesis.svg|Warfarin synthesis]]

Several asymmetric versions of this reaction exist using chiral catalysts &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/anie.200352136]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ol062000v]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ol062718a]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/ejoc.200900664]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/ejoc.200900831]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1021/ed800040m]]&lt;/ref&gt; .

==Mukaiyama-Michael Addition==
In the '''Mukaiyama-Michael Addition''' the nucleophile is an [[silyl ether]] and the catalyst usually [[titanium tetrachloride]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mukaiyama, T. | title = Titanium Tetrachloride in Organic Synthesis [New synthetic methods (21)] | format =  | journal = [[Angew.

==History==
The research done by Arthur Michael in 1887 was prompted by an 1884 publication by Conrad &amp; Kuthzeit on the reaction of diethyl ''2,3-dibromopropionate'' with ''diethyl sodiomalonate'' forming a [[cyclopropane]] derivative &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/cber.188401701314]]&lt;/ref&gt; (now recognized as involving two successive substitution reactions).

Michael was able to obtain the same product by replacing the propionate by ''2-bromacrylic acid ethylester'' and realized that this reaction could only work by assuming an addition reaction to the double bond of the acrylic acid. He then confirmed this assumption by reacting [[diethyl malonate]] and the ethyl ester of [[cinnamic acid]] forming the very first Michael adduct &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/ejoc.200901130]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

:[[File:Original Michael reaction.svg|The Original 1887 Michael reaction]]

In the same year [[Rainer Ludwig Claisen]] claimed priority for the invention &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/prac.18870350144]]&lt;/ref&gt;. He and T. Komnenos had observed addition products to double bonds as side-products earlier in 1883 while investigating condensation reactions of malonic acid with aldehydes &lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/jlac.18832180204]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to biographer Takashi Tokoroyama this claim is without merit.

The '''pinacol rearrangement''' or '''pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement''' is a method for converting a [[diol|1,2-diol]] to a [[carbonyl]] compound in [[organic chemistry]]. This rearrangement takes place under acidic conditions. The name of the reaction comes from the rearrangement of [[pinacol]] to [[pinacolone]].
:[[Image:800px-Pinacol rearragement.png|500px|Pinacol rearrangement]]


This reaction was first described by [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]] in 1860.&lt;ref name=Fittig1860&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  Ueber einige Derivate des Acetons
 | author =  [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]]  
 | journal =  [[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]
 | volume = 114 
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 54–63
 | year = 1860 
 | url =  
 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18601140107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An overview of mechanism==
In the course of this [[organic reaction]], protonation of one of the -OH groups occurs and a [[carbocation]] is formed. If both the -OH groups are not alike, then the one which yields a more stable carbocation participates in the reaction. Subsequently, an [[alkyl]] group from the adjacent carbon migrates to the carbocation center. The driving force for this rearrangement step is believed to be the relative stability of the resultant oxonium ion, which has complete octet configuration at all centers (as opposed to the preceding carbocation). The migration of alkyl groups 
in this reaction occurs in accordance with their usual [[migratory aptitude]], i.e. hydride &gt; Ph- &gt; tertiary &gt; secondary &gt; methyl .

==[[Stereochemistry]] of the rearrangement==
In cyclic systems, the reaction presents more features of interest. In these reactions, the [[stereochemistry]] of the diol plays a crucial role in deciding the major product. An alkyl group which is situated trans- to the leaving -OH group alone may migrate. If otherwise, ring expansion occurs, i.e. the ring carbon itself migrates to the carbocation centre. This reveals another interesting feature of the reaction, viz. that it is largely concerted. There appears to be a connection between the migration origin and migration terminus throughout the reaction.

Moreover, if the migrating alkyl group has a chiral center as its key atom, the configuration at this center is ''retained'' even after migration takes place.

==History==
Although Fittig first published about the pinacol rearrangement, not he but [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] did correctly identify the reaction products involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  What Is a Discovery? Carbon Skeletal Rearrangements as Counter-Examples to the Rule of Minimal Structural Change
 | author =  Jerome A. Berson  
 | journal =  [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]]
 | volume = 41
 | issue = 24
 | pages = 4655–4660
 | year = 2002 
 | url =  
 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200290007   }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a 1859 publication [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]] described the reaction of [[acetone]] with [[potassium]] metal..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  Ueber einige Metamorphosen des Acetons der Essigsäure 
 | author =  W. R. Fittig 
 | journal =  [[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] 
 | volume = 110
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 23–45
 | year = 1859 
 | url =  
 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18591100104}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fittig wrongly assumed a [[molecular formula]] of (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for acetone, the result of a long standing atomic weight debate finally settled at the [[Karlsruhe Congress]] in 1860. He also wrongly believed acetone to be an alcohol which he hoped to prove by forming a metal alkoxide salt. The reaction product he obtained instead he called '''paraceton''' which he believed to be a acetone [[dimer]]. In his second publication in 1860 he reacted paraceton with [[sulfuric acid]] (the actual pinacol rearrangement).  

:[[Image:Acetone2pinacolone.svg|Pinacol rearrangement]]

Again Fittig was unable to assign a molecular structure to the reaction product which he assumed to be another isomer or a polymer. Contemporary chemists who had already adapted to the new atomic weight reality did not fare better. One of them, [[Charles Friedel]], believed the reaction product to be the [[epoxide]] tetramethylethylene oxide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  Recherches sur les acétones et sur les aldéhydes
 | author =  [[Charles Friedel]]
 | journal =  [[Annales de chimie et de physique]] Ser. 4
 | volume = 16
 | issue =  
 | pages = 310
 | year = 1869
 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34826f/f309.table 
 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in analogy with reactions of [[ethylene glycol]]. Finally Butlerov in 1873 came up with the correct structures after he independently synthesised the compound trimethylacetic acid which Friedel had obtained earlier by oxidizing with a [[dichromate]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | title =  Ueber Trimethylessigsäure  
 | author =  [[Aleksandr Butlerov]]
 | journal =  [[Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]
 | volume = 170
 | issue = 1-2 
 | pages = 151–162 
 | year = 1873
 | url = 
 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18731700114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the problems during the determination of the structure are due to the fact that carbon skeletal rearrangements were unknown at that time and therefore the new concept had to be found. Butlerov theory allowed the structure of carbon atoms in the molecule to rearrange and with this concept a structure for pinacolone could be found.

The '''Reformatsky reaction''' (sometimes spelled '''Reformatskii reaction''') is an [[organic reaction]] which [[condensation reaction|condenses]] [[aldehyde]]s (or [[ketone]]s), '''1''', with α-halo [[ester]]s, '''2''', using a metallic [[zinc]] catalyst to form β-hydroxy-esters, '''3'''.{{Ref|Reformatsky}}{{Ref|Reformatsky2}} It was discovered by [[Sergey Reformatsky|Sergey Nikolaevich Reformatsky]].

[[Image:Reformatsky Reaction Scheme.png|center|500px|The Reformatskii reaction]]

The [[organozinc]] reagent, also called a 'Reformatskii enolate', is prepared by treating an alpha-halo ester with zinc dust. Reformatskii enolates are less reactive than lithium enolates or Grignard reagents and hence nucleophilic addition to the ester group does not occur. 

Some reviews have been published.{{Ref|Shriner}}{{Ref|Rathke}}

Both form cyclic eight-membered dimers in the solid state, but differ in stereochemistry: the eight-membered ring in the ethyl derviative adopts a tub-shaped conformation and has ''cis'' bromo groups and ''cis'' THF ligands, whereas in the ''tert''-butyl derviative, the ring is in a chair form and the bromo groups and THF ligands are ''trans''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Reimer-Tiemann reaction''' is a chemical reaction used for the ortho-formylation of phenols. The reaction was discovered by Karl Ludwig Reimer and Ferdinand Tiemann.  In the simplest case, the product is salicylaldehyde:

==Reaction mechanism==

Chloroform ('''1''') reacts with strong base to form the chloroform carbanion ('''2'''), which will quickly alpha-eliminate to give dichlorocarbene ('''3''').  Dichlorocarbene will react in the ortho- and para- position of the phenate ('''5''') to give the dichloromethyl substituted phenol ('''7''').  After basic hydrolysis, the desired product ('''9''') is formed.

The '''Robinson annulation''' is an [[organic reaction]] used to create a six-member ring [[Carbonyl#.CE.B1.2C.CE.B2-Unsaturated_carbonyl_compounds|α,β-unsaturated cyclic ketone]], using a [[ketone]] (or [[aldehyde]]) and [[methyl vinyl ketone]].&lt;ref&gt;Rapson, W. S.; Robinson, R.; ''J. Chem. Soc.'' '''1935''', 1285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann, E. D.; Gingberg, D.; Pappo, R. ''Org. React.'' '''1959''', ''10'', 179. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gawley, R. E. ''Synthesis'' '''1976''', 777-794. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Robert Robinson (scientist)|Sir Robert Robinson]], the British chemist who discovered it while he was at the [[University of Oxford]].

[[Image:Robinson Annulation Scheme.png|center|350px|The Robinson annulation]]

In addition to methyl vinyl ketone, 1-chloro-3-butanone&lt;ref&gt;[[Clayton Heathcock|Heathcock, C. H.]]; Ellis, J. E.; McMurry, J. E.; Coppolino, A. ''[[Tetrahedron Lett.]]'' '''1971''', ''12'', 4995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clayton Heathcock|Heathcock, C. H.]]; Mahaim, C.; Schlecht, M. F.; Utawanit, T. ''[[J. Org. Chem.]]'' '''1984''', ''49'', 3264. ([[doi:10.1021/jo00192a004]])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[isoxazole]]s&lt;ref&gt;McMurry, J. E. ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 6, p.781 (1988); Vol. 53, p.70 (1973). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv6p0781 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; will give the same product.

The [[Wieland-Miescher ketone]] is the Robinson annulation product of 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione and [[methyl vinyl ketone]] while the Hajos-Parrish ketone is the product of 2-methyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione and [[methyl vinyl ketone]]. Asymmetric synthesis of these compounds has greatly increased their synthetic utility &lt;ref&gt; . Hajos, Z, G.; Parrish, D. R. Asymmetric Synthesis of Optically Active Polycyclic Organic Compounds. German Patent DE 2102623, July 29, '''1971'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic intermediates of natural product chemistry'' Zoltan G. Hajos, David R. Parrish [[J. Org. Chem.]]; '''1974'''; 39(12); 1615-1621. [[doi:10.1021/jo00925a003]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reaction mechanism==
Methyl vinyl ketone (or variants thereof) are essential for the [[annulation]] as they are simultaneously a [[Michael acceptor]] and able to take part in an [[aldol condensation]].  The first step in the Robinson annulation (also spelt annelation) is a [[Michael reaction|Michael addition]] followed by an [[aldol reaction]] as the [[annulation]] step in the process. The reaction then proceeds as an aldol condensation to make the desired [[cyclohexenone]] ring.

[[Image:Robinson Annulation Mechanism.png|center|650px|The mechanism of the Robinson annulation]]

==Variations==
===Asymmetric Robinson annulation===
The [[organocatalyst]] [[Proline]] has been used to resolve the [[enantiomer]]ic [[isomer]]s of Robinson [[annulation]]s in [[asymmetric synthesis]]. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 7, p.368 (1990); Vol. 63, p.37 (1985). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv7p0368 Article])&lt;/ref&gt;. A proline derivative was employed in an asymmetric annulation of a [[geranial]] &lt;ref&gt;''Total Synthesis and Revised Structure of Biyouyanagin'' A [[K. C. Nicolaou]], David Sarlah, and David M. Shaw [[Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.]] '''2007''', 46, 4708 –4711 [[doi:10.1002/anie.200701552]]&lt;/ref&gt;: 

[[Image:RobinsonAnnulationAsymmetric.png|center|400px|Asymmetric Robinsion annulation]]

===Wichterle reaction===
The '''Wichterle reaction''' is a variant of the Robinson annulation that replaces methyl vinyl ketone with [[1,3-dichloro-cis-2-butene]]. &lt;ref&gt;Wichterle, O. ''et al.'' ''Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun.'' '''1948''', ''13'', 300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, M.; Matsumoto, T. ''Chem. Lett.'' '''1973''', 957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Coll. Vol. 5, p.869 (1973); Vol. 45, p.80 (1965). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv5p0869 Article])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wichterle Reaction Scheme.png|center|550px|The Wichterle reaction]]

===Hauser annulation===
The reaction sequence in the related Hauser annulation is [[michael addition]] - [[Dieckman condensation]] - [[elimination]] &lt;ref&gt;''Recent Advances in the Hauser Annulation '' Mal, D.; Pahari, P. [[Chem. Rev.]]; (Review); '''2007'''; 107(5); 1892-1918.  [[doi:10.1021/cr068398q]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The Hauser donor is an aromatic methylene [[sulfoxide]] or [[sulfone]] with a [[carboxylic ester]] group in the [[Arene substitution patterns|ortho position]]. The Hauser acceptor is also a Michael acceptor.  In the original Hauser publication  ''ethyl 2-carboxybenzyl phenyl sulfoxide'' reacts with [[3-pentene-2-one]] with [[LDA]] as a base in THF at -78°C &lt;ref&gt;''New synthetic methods for the regioselective annelation of aromatic rings: 1-hydroxy-2,3-disubstituted naphthalenes and 1,4-dihydroxy-2,3-disubstituted naphthalenes''Frank M. Hauser and Richard P.Rhee[[J. Org. Chem.]]; '''197'''8; 43(1) pp 178 - 180; [[doi:10.1021/jo00395a048]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

[[Image:HauserAnnulation.png|400px|center|The Hauser annulation]]

The original reaction product still contains the sulfoxide group but it is lost on heating in an elimination reaction. The ultimate reaction product is a [[naphthalene]] derivative.  The dual purpose of the sulfoxide group is as stabilizing group for the [[carbanion]] in the first reaction step and as [[leaving group]] in the second.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A useful methodology to employ in assessing the conditions of poverty in Austria and the Czech Republic is not simply discussing the conditions of poverty in the country themselves, but to put the conditions in the context of global and European poverty. Although the conditions of poverty in Austria and the Czech Republic will be discussed a context for how these countries are performing in relation to European and global poverty will be provided. In short, this approach will allow for a broader understanding of the issue in regard to the conditions of global, European and finally a specific analysis of poverty in Austria and Czech Republic.  


==A Glimpse at Global Poverty==

'''A Glimpse at Global Poverty'''

Poverty throughout the world is an enormous issue the international community seeks to alleviate. Most recently the international community, in its Millennium Development Goals, adopted by 189 world leaders at a 2000 UN summit, has called attention to this problem by charting a course to reduce by 50% the number of people living on less than $1 a day by the year 2015. This goal will certainly be challenging as the population continues to grow and resources become scarce. In addition to this challenge the recent global economic crisis has also curtailed efforts and gains in reducing poverty. According to Global Issues.org, access to water is becoming a major issue, as “1.1 billion people in developing countries have inadequate access to water and 2.6 billion people lack basic sanitation.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}} Secondly, as wars between nations and internal conflicts within nations continue to rage the plight of refugees, internally displaced people and the process of migration become more problematice. As these people move about in an effort to escape the violence they often leave with nothing and thus struggle to survive while living in poverty. Using Afghanistan  as example – a country who has been inflicted with 30 years of civil upheaval and radical devolution of political, economic, and military authority - Refugees International has the following to say about Afghanistan’s situation:
Millions of Afghans need help rebuilding their lives and country. While all Afghans suffer the government’s poor capacity and lack of services, Afghan returnees and internally displaced have been neglected and are particularly vulnerable.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} Today more that three million registered refugees remain in exile- 2.1 million in Pakistan and 0.9 million in Iran- and hundreds of thousands more are living abroad to escape economic hardship or targeted violence. {{ref|Chapayev1919}} 
In addition to these realities, the World Bank has reported that: 

“the global economic crisis left an additional 50 million people in extreme poverty in 2009 and will leave some 64 million impoverished by the end of 2010, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and eastern and southeastern Asia.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} Hunger may also have spiked in 2009 – with over 1 billion people undernourished – as a consequence of the global food and financial crises.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} Moreover, the effects of the crises are likely to persist with poverty rates slightly higher than they would have been had the world economy grown steadily at its pre-crisis pace, it said.” {{ref|Chapayev1919}}

Interestingly it is China alone that overwhelmingly drives the numbers in regard to how the world is progressing in the field of reducing poverty. For example, the World Bank has noted that “between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate has fallen by about 25%, however while this sounds encouraging, it masks regional variations, and perhaps most glaringly the impact of China.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}} The World Bank continues, “China’s poverty rate fell from 85% to 15.9%, or by over 600 million people, China accounts for nearly all the world’s reduction in poverty and excluding China from the data would yield a reduction in poverty by only 10%.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}} 
==European Poverty==
'''European Poverty'''

In an effort to tackle poverty in Europe the European Union has launched a campaign called ‘2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion’ to help the estimated 84 million Europeans currently considered at risk of poverty. “The key objectives are to raise public awareness about these issues and renew the political commitment of the EU and its Member States to combat poverty and social exclusion.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  A 2008 report on poverty levels in Europe was concluded that the 16% of Europeans considered at risk of poverty fell within a range of 10% to 23% in terms of how much each countries popultaion was at risk throughout the 27 member states of the EU. The EU rate, in comparison to the Czech Republic found that only 10% of the Czech population was considered at risk of poverty- the lowest in the EU. The EU rate, in comparison to Austria found that only 12% of Austrians are considered at risk of poverty. In regard to social exclusion the EU is encourage member states to coordinate their approaches in fighting poverty and social exclusion by placing it at the top of their political agenda.  The EU estimates that social transfers- the public policy measures which makes it possible for people to achieve up-ward mobility and thus decreas overall social exclusion- reduced the risk of poverty by 38% on average in the EU, but this impact varies from less tham 10% to nearly 60% across Europe.  For example, one aspect helping to drive down poverty in CZ is through the public policy agenda centered on social transfers. According to a study conducted by the EU, social transfers in the Czech Republic have helped reduce poverty by 50%. 
In general view of Europe, “low levels of poverty characterize the Scandinavian countries, the so-called Corporatist countries (Austria, Germany) and the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia among the ex-Socialist countries.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  In contrast the risk of poverty tends to be relatively high in the Mediterranean and the Baltic States. Countries with the highest poor population include France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the UK. 
Looking at the conditions of poverty in the countries of Austria and Czech Republic one can clearly see that these nations are doing exceptionally well when compared to others, especially the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. So what has set Austria and the Czech Republic apart from other nations in increasing individual wealthy and thus less of their respective populations resding in poverty? In answering this question I have found that the common link existing between Austria and the Czech Republic are the social programs and support available to their respective citizens, which have made those nations successful in reversign the tide of poverty while increasing the purchasing power of their citizens. 
==Austrian Poverty==
'''Austrian Poverty'''

Taking a closer look at indicators of Austria’s level of poverty a study was conducted by the United Nations. Below are the UN’s findings as compared to the United States:

Source: Human Development Report 2000; Trends in human development and per capita income

Although this data was taken in 2000 it not only gives a solid indication of Austria’s economic success when compared to the United States but more importantly it speaks to the prowess of Austria’s ability to sustain and improve its human development. From 1975-1998 Austria’s human development and per capita income steadily increased this is significant because human development encompasses life expectancy, literacy, average number of years of schooling, and income to assess a country’s performance in providing for its people’s welfare and security {{ref|Chapayev1919}}. In addition to this study the UN also provides reasoning to explain how Austria is able to achieve such favorable human development and per capita income rates thus reducing poverty. Specifically the report states that, “living standards are very high, and due to socialist policies of the federal government, the incidence of poverty is minimal.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}} 
Another interesting aspect highlighting why Austria’s method of dealing with the issue of poverty and homelessness lies in their infrastructure to provide for their citizens who are in need of help. In another study conducted in 2005 by Helix, a clinical research and consulting firm located in Salzburg, Austria concluded the following:
In some counties like Vienna, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vorarlberg there are chain like structures of services in force. Centers for counseling and prevention of eviction –emergency shelters and day care institutions – supported housing and provisions for re-housing. In the counties Styria, Upper Austria and Nether Austria emergency services still have an overweight and provisions headed on resettlement are less elaborated. In the counties Carinthia and Burgenland there are only very few services for homeless persons provided – especially emergency services like shelters and asylums. In some counties (like Vienna, Tyrol, Styria) some old fashioned asylums are still working and can be characterized by low standards and very low provisions of individual support. Beside the professional emergency services in most counties of Austria cheap boarding houses and private hostels are accessible also for homeless persons and used for temporary shelter.

Austria uniquely offers an extensive support system throughout its country to help those in poverty and at risk of going into poverty. One characteristic about the country’s apparuts to deal with poverty is the mix of institutions it offers in order to meet the needs of its citizenary. From the chain-like structures, emergency shelters, day care, aylums, boarding houses and private hostels Austria has a plethora of institutions to support its citizenary. 
==Czech Republic Poverty==
'''Czech Republic Poverty'''

One unique aspect about the Czech Republic society is that the citizenry enjoy vast benefits from their government in the role of state aid for social support. The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MoLSA) is charged with administering the aid. MoLSA was established in 1990 and is responsible for all social and labour aspects in the Czech Republic such as social services, social benefits, and social security, equal opportunity for all citizens as well as migration and integration of foreigners.  Under a national law passed on 1 January 2008, titled State Social Support, the “citizens have a right to benefits if they and the household members assessed with them are permanent residents in the Czech Republic or if they are EU citizens- subject of directly applicable legislation of the European Communities.”{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  The benefits, as administered by the MoLSA, are outlined below:

''Child Allowance-'' 

Child allowance is a basic long-term benefit provided to families with dependent children. A dependent child up to the age of 26 years, living in a family with an income of less than 2.4 times the family’s living minimum is entitled to this allowance. {{ref|Chapayev1919}}

{| border=1
  |+ 
|-
  ! '''Age of the dependent child'''

  | Up to 6 years of age

|-
  | From 6 to 15 years
  | 610
  | 

|-
  | From 15 to 26 years
  | 700
  | 
|}


''Social Allowance-'' 

The aim of this benefit is to be help families with low incomes to cover the costs of their children’s needs. Parents who care for at least one dependent child are entitled to this allowance provided the family income is the previous calendar quarter does not exceed 2.0 times the family’s living minimum. The higher the family income, the lower the monthly allowance. Te social allowance may be raised in cases where the child has a long-term severe disability, a long term disability or a long-term illness. A higher level of social allowance is also paid to families in cases of multiple births- up to the age of three years and to family whose child is studying secondary school on a daily basis or attending university. {{ref|Chapayev1919}} 

''Housing Allowance-'' 

Property owners or tenants registered as permanently resident in that property are entitled to a housing allowance of 30% (in Prague 35%) of family income is sufficient to cover housing costs and at the same time this 30% (in Prague 35%) of family income is lower than the relevant prescriptive costs set by law. The level of housing allowance is set as the difference between prescriptive housing costs and the relevant family income multiplied by a coefficient of 0.03 (in Prague 0.35). {{ref|Chapayev1919}} 

''Parental Allowance-''
 
A parent who personally and duly cares for a child who is the youngest in the family is entitled to parental allowance. Parental allowance is provided at four rates that are set at fixed monthly amounts according to duration of drawing- increased rate (11, 400CZK), basic rate (7,600CZK) and lower rate (3,000 CZK). A parent may elect to draw parental allowance for a period of up to two, three or four years of the child.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} 

''Foster Child Allowance-''

Dependent children placed in foster care are entitled to an allowance. The child continues to be entitled to this allowance even after reaching adulthood, up to a maximum of 26 years of age, provided that they remain a dependent child and live under the same roof as the former foster parent(s).{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  

''Foster Parent Allowance-''

A foster parent who takes a child into foster care is entitled to this allowance. The monthly amount of the foster parent allowance equals the individual living minimum for each child placed in foster care. The foster allowance for one child is 3,126CZK a month.{{ref|Chapayev1919}} 
 
''Birth Grant-''

This a one-time benefit for women who have given birth to a child. If a woman who gives birth to a child and dies and the birth grant has not been disbursed, the child’s father is entitled to this grant. Persons who have taken a child up to the age of one year old into permanent care replacing parental care are also entitled to the birth grant. The birth grant amounts to 13,000 CZK for each child born.{{ref|Chapayev1919}}  

''Funeral Grant-''

The funeral grant is a one-time payment to a person who has arranged for the funeral of a dependent child, or to a person who was the parent of a dependent child, on condition that the deceased was a permanent resident of the Czech Republic on the date of death. The amount of the funeral grant is a fixed sum totaling 5,000 CZK.  
The amount of state support the Czech government provides to its citizens is significant and has a tremendously favorable impact on the conditions of poverty in their country as evidence by their lowest ranking of at-risk-poverty among all the EU member states.{{ref|Chapayev1919}}

The '''Schmidt reaction''' is an [[organic reaction]] involving alkyl migration over the [[carbon]]-[[nitrogen]] [[chemical bond]] in an [[azide]] with expulsion of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plagens, Andreas; Laue, Thomas M. |title=Named organic reactions | edition = 2nd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Chichester |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-470-01041-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key reagent introducing this azide group is [[hydrazoic acid]] and the reaction product depends on the type of reactant: [[carboxylic acid]]s form [[amine]]s through an [[isocyanate]] intermediate (1) and [[ketone]]s form [[amide]]s (2):

[[Image:Schmidt.png|800px]]

A [[catalyst]] is required which can be a [[protic acid]] usually [[sulfuric acid]] or a [[Lewis acid]]. The reaction was discovered in 1924 by [[Karl Friedrich Schmidt]] (1887–1971),&lt;ref&gt;[[doi:10.1002/cber.19240570423]]&lt;/ref&gt; who successfully converted [[benzophenone]] and [[hydrazoic acid]] to [[benzanilide]]. It is a tool regularly used in [[organic chemistry]] for the synthesis of new organic compounds for example in that of the unusual  [[2-quinuclidone]].

==Reaction mechanism==
The carboxylic acid Schmidt reaction starts with [[acylium]] ion '''1''' obtained from [[protonation]] and loss of water. Reaction with [[hydrazoic acid]] forms the protonated azido ketone '''2''' which goes through a [[rearrangement reaction]] with the alkyl group R migrating over the C-N bond with expulsion of nitrogen. The protonated [[isocyanate]] is attacked by water forming [[carbamate]] '''4''' which after deprotonation loses [[carbon dioxide]] to the [[amine]].  

[[Image:Schmidtreactionmechanismamine.png|500px|center|Schmidt reaction mechanism amine formation]]

The reaction is related to the [[Curtius rearrangement]] except that in this reaction the azide is protonated and hence with different intermediates.

In the [[reaction mechanism]] for the [[ketone]] Schmidt reaction the carbonyl group is activated by protonation for [[nucleophilic addition]] by the azide forming intermediate '''3''' which loses water in a [[elimination reaction]] to temporary [[imine]] '''4''' over which one of the alkyl groups migrates from carbon to nitrogen with loss of nitrogen. A similar migration is found in the [[Beckmann rearrangement]]. Attack by water and proton loss converts '''5''' to '''7''' which is a [[tautomer]] of the final [[amide]]. 

[[Image:SchmidtreactionmechanismAmide.png|500px|center|Schmidt reaction mechanism amide formation]]

==Reactions involving alkyl azides==
The scope of this reaction has been extended to reactions of carbonyls with alkyl [[azides]] R-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This extension was first reported by J.H. Boyer in 1955 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Acid-catalyzed Reaction of Alkyl Azides upon Carbonyl Compounds | author = J. H. Boyer and J. Hamer | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 951–954 | doi = 10.1021/ja01609a045 | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; (hence the name '''Boyer reaction''') for example the reaction of [[benzaldehyde|m-nitrobenzaldehyde]] with [[azide|β-azido-ethanol]]: 

[[Image:BoyerReaction.png|400px|center|The Boyer reaction]]

Variations involving [[intramolecular]] Schmidt reactions have been known since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Intramolecular Schmidt reaction of alkyl azides | author = Jeffrey Aube and Gregory L. Milligan | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year = 1991 | volume = 113 | issue = 23 | pages = 8965–8966 | doi = 10.1021/ja00023a065}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intramolecular reaction has been applied to the synthesis of novel [[bicyclic]] [[lactam]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Cation-pi Control of Regiochemistry of Intramolecular Schmidt Reactions en Route to Bridged Bicyclic Lactams | author =  Lei Yao and Jeffrey Aubé | journal = [[J.

The '''Shapiro reaction''' or '''tosylhydrazone decomposition''' is an [[organic reaction]] in which a [[ketone]] or [[aldehyde]] is converted to an [[alkene]] through an intermediate [[hydrazone]] in the presence of 2 equivalents of strong [[base (chemistry)|base]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Shapiro]] ; Lipton, M.F.; Kolonko, K.J.; Buswell, R.L.; Capuano, L.A. ''[[Tetrahedron Lett.]]'', '''1975''', 1811. [[doi:10.1016/S0040-4039(00)75263-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, R. H. ''[[Org. React.]]'', '''1976''', ''23'', 405. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adlington, R.M.; Barret, A.G.M. ''[[Acc. Chem. Res.]]'', '''1983''', ''16'', 55. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction was discovered by [[Robert H. Shapiro]] in 1975. The Shapiro reaction was used in the [[Nicolaou Taxol total synthesis]]. 
[[Image:Shapiro reaction.svg|center|500px|The Shapiro reaction]]

==Reaction mechanism==
In a prelude to the actual Shapiro reaction a [[ketone]] or an [[aldehyde]] is reacted with [[p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Organic Syntheses]]'' Coll. Vol. 5, p.1055 ('''1973'''); Vol. 40, p.93 ('''1960''') ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv5p1055 Article])&lt;/ref&gt; to a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (or tosyl hydrazone) which is an [[imine]] or [[hydrazone]]. Two equivalents of a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] such as [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] then abstract first the hydrazone [[proton (chemistry)|proton]] and then the less [[carbon acid|acidic]] α carbonyl proton leaving a [[carbanion]]. The carbanion proceeds in an [[elimination reaction]] creating the carbon to carbon [[double bond]] and converting the hydrazone group into a lithium [[Diazonium compound|diazonium]] group. This group expels [[nitrogen]] leaving a vinyllithium compound. 
[[Image:ShapiroreactionMechanism.svg|center|Shapiro reaction mechanism]]

Although many secondary reactions exist for this [[functional group]], in the Shapiro reaction in particular [[water]] is added resulting in hydrolysis to the [[alkene]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, R.

The [[Bamford-Stevens reaction]] is also a tosylhydrazone decomposition but in this reaction a much weaker base can only abstract the hydrazone proton and not the α carbonyl proton and the [[reaction mechanism]] now involves a [[carbene]] or in a [[protic solvent]] a [[carbocation]].

The '''Sommelet-Hauser rearrangement''' is a [[rearrangement reaction]] of certain [[benzyl]] [[quaternary ammonium salt]]s &lt;ref&gt;[[Organic Syntheses]], Coll. Vol. 4, p.585 (1963); Vol. 34, p.61 (1954) [http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV4P0585.pdf Link].&lt;/ref&gt;. The reagent is [[sodium amide]] or another alkali metal amide and the reaction product a N-dialkyl benzyl amine with a new [[alkyl]] group in the [[aromatic ortho position]]. 

:[[File:SommeletHauserReaction.svg|Sommelet-Hauser rearrangement]]

This reaction was named after M. Sommelet &lt;ref&gt;M. Sommelet, Compt. Rend. 205, 56 (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles R. Hauser &lt;ref&gt;''Rearrangements of Benzyltrimethylammonium Ion and Related Quaternary Ammonium Ions by Sodium Amide Involving Migration into the Ring'' Simon W. Kantor, Charles R. Hauser [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]], '''1951''', 73 (9), pp 4122–4131 [[doi:10.1021/ja01153a022]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The benzylic methylene proton is acidic and deprotonation takes place to the [[ylide]]. The second step is a [[2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement]].

'''Stork enamine alkylation''', also known as the '''Stork-Enamine reaction''', involves the addition of an [[enamine]] to an [[enone|alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl acceptor]] in a process similar to the [[Michael reaction]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =McMurry | first =John | authorlink = John E. McMurry | title =Organic Chemistry | format =Hardcover | edition =6th | date =2003-03-21 | publisher =Thomson-Brooks/Cole | location =Belmont, CA | isbn =0-534-38999-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The product is then [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] by an [[aqueous]] [[acid]] to produce a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound.

The process: 

# formation of an enamine from a [[ketone]]
# addition of the enamine to and alpha, beta-unsaturated [[aldehyde]] or ketone
# hydrolysis of the enamine back to a ketone

[[Image:Stork enamine reaction.png|center|400px|The Stork enamine reaction]]


When the electrophile is an [[acyl halide]], a 1,3-[[diketone]] is formed ('''Stork acylation'''). The reaction is named after its inventor: [[Gilbert Stork]].

==Variations==
In a special case of this reaction type it is also possible to alkylate [[ketone]]s or [[aldehyde]]s with [[alkyl halide]]s as less reactive [[electrophile]]s &lt;ref&gt;''A New Method for the Alkylation of Ketones and Aldehydes: the C-Alkylation of the Magnesium Salts of N-Substituted Imines'' [[Gilbert Stork]] and Susan R. Dowd [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; '''1963'''; 85(14) pp 2178 - 2180; [[doi:10.1021/ja00897a040]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

[[Image:Stork C alkylation.png|center|400px|Stork enamine reaction with alkyl halides]]

In this method a carbonyl compound is converted to an [[imine]] by [[alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution]] with a primary [[amine]]. The imine is then reacted with an [[Grignard reagent]] to the corresponding magnesium salt to an intermediate capable of [[nucleophilic displacement|displacing]] a halide. [[Hydrolysis]] once again yields the alkylated ketone.

The rearrangement was first discovered in [[bicyclic]] [[terpene]]s for example the conversion of [[isoborneol]] to [[camphene]]:

 

[[Image:Isoborneol2CampheneConversion.svg|Isoborneol Camphene Conversion]]


The story of the rearrangement reveals that many scientists were puzzled with this and related reactions and its close relationship to the discovery of carbocations as intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;Birladeanu, L.  ''[[J. Chem. Ed.]]'' '''2000''', ''77'', 858-863.&lt;/ref&gt;

The related '''Nametkin rearrangement''' named after [[Sergey Namyotkin]] involves the rearrangement of methyl groups in certain terpenes. In some cases the reaction type is also called a '''retropinacol rearrangement''' (see [[Pinacol rearrangement]]).

The '''Wittig Reaction''' is a [[chemical reaction]] of an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with a triphenyl [[#Wittig reagents|phosphonium ylide]] (often called a '''Wittig reagent''') to give an [[alkene]] and [[triphenylphosphine oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Wittig reaction.PNG|center|500px|Wittig Reaction]]

The Wittig reaction was discovered in 1954 by [[Georg Wittig]], for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1979.  It is widely used in [[organic synthesis]] for the preparation of alkenes.&lt;ref&gt;Maercker, A. ''Org. React.'' '''1965''', ''14'', 270-490. (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Carruthers, ''Some Modern Methods of Organic Synthesis'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1971, pp81-90. (ISBN 0-521-31117-9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. W. Hoffmann | title = Wittig and His Accomplishments: Still Relevant Beyond His 100th Birthday | year = 2001 | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 1411–1416 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20010417)40:8&lt;1411::AID-ANIE1411&gt;3.0.CO;2-U}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the [[1,2-Wittig rearrangement|Wittig rearrangement]].

Wittig reactions are most commonly used to couple aldehydes and ketones to singly substituted phosphine [[ylide]]s.  With simple ylides this results in almost exclusively the [[Z-alkene]] product.  In order to obtain the E-alkene, the [[#The Schlosser modification|Schlosser modification]] of the Wittig reaction can be performed.

== Reaction mechanism ==
=== Classical mechanism ===
The steric bulk of the [[ylide]] '''1''' influences the stereochemical outcome of [[nucleophilic addition]] to give a predominance of the [[betaines|betaine]] '''3'''.  Carbon-carbon bond rotation gives the betaine '''4''', which then forms the oxaphosphetane '''5'''.  Elimination gives the desired Z-alkene '''7''' and [[triphenylphosphine oxide]] '''6'''.  With simple Wittig reagents, the first step occurs easily with both [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, and the decomposition of the betaine (to form '''5''') is the [[rate-determining step]].  However with [[#Stabilised Wittig reagents|stabilised ylides]] (where R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; stabilises the negative charge) the first step is the slowest step, so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the [[Geometric isomerism|E-isomer]].  This also explains why stabilised reagents fail to react well with [[Steric hindrance|sterically hindered ketones]]. 

[[File:Wittig Reaction Mechanism.png|center|500px|The mechanism of the Wittig reaction]]

=== Recent developments ===
Recent research has shown that the [[reaction mechanism]] presented above does not account for all experimental results.  Mechanistic studies have been done mostly on unstablilized ylides, because the intermediates can be followed by [[NMR spectroscopy]]. The existence and interconversion of the betaine ('''3a''' and '''3b''') is still under debate and a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = E. Vedejs and C. F. Marth | title = Mechanism of Wittig reaction: evidence against betaine intermediates | year = 1990 | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 112 | issue = 10 | pages = 3905–3909 | doi=10.1021/ja00166a026}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that phosphonium ylides '''1''' can react with carbonyl compounds '''2''' via a π²s/π²a [2+2] [[cycloaddition]] to directly form the oxaphosphatanes '''4a''' and '''4b'''. The [[stereochemistry]] of the product '''5''' is due to the addition of the ylide '''1''' to the carbonyl '''2''' and to the ability of the intermediates to [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce E.

For many years, the stereochemistry of the Wittig reaction, in terms of carbon-carbon bond formation, had been assumed to correspond directly with the Z/E stereochemistry of the alkene products.  However, certain reactants do not follow this simple pattern.  [[Lithium]] salts can also exert a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Reitz, S. O. Nortey, A. D.

[[File:Wittig Reaction Mechanism Update.png|center|600px|The mechanism of the Wittig reaction]]

There are distinct differences in the mechanisms of [[aliphatic]] and [[aromatic]] [[aldehyde]]s and of [[aromatic]] and [[aliphatic]] phosphonium ylides.  Vedejs ''et al.'' have provided evidence that the Wittig reaction of [[Branching (chemistry)|unbranched]] aldehydes under lithium-salt-free conditions do not equilibrate and are therefore under [[kinetic reaction control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = E.

J. ''Top. Stereochem.'' '''1994''', ''21'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittig reagents ==
=== Preparation of simple ylides ===
The Wittig reagent is usually prepared from a [[phosphonium salt]], which is in turn made by the reaction of [[triphenylphosphine]] with an [[alkyl halide]]. To form the Wittig reagent (ylide), the phosphonium salt is suspended in a solvent such as [[diethyl ether]] or [[Tetrahydrofuran|THF]] and a strong base such as [[phenyllithium]] or [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] is added.    

Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−R  X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  [[N-Butyllithium|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li]]  →  Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH−R  +  LiX  +  [[Butane|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The simplest ylide used is methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and this is also the basis of an alternative synthesis of Wittig reagents.  Substituted ylides can be made by alkylation of Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a primary [[alkyl halide]] R−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−X, to produce a substituted phosphonium salt:

Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  [[Alkyl halide|R-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-X]]  →  Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;− CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−R  X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

which can be [[Deprotonation|deprotonated]] with C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li  to make Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH−CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−R.

=== Stabilized Wittig reagents ===
These contain groups that can stabilise the negative charge from the [[carbanion]]-like carbon, for example Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH−COOR, Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH−[[Phenyl|Ph]].  These are less reactive than simple ylides, and so they usually fail to react with ketones, necessitating the use of the [[Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons]] reaction as an alternative.  They can be prepared from the phosphonium salts using weaker bases than butyllithium such as [[alkoxide]]s and (in some cases) [[sodium hydroxide]]. They usually give rise to an E-alkene product when they react, rather than the more usual Z-alkene.

=== Structure of the ylide ===
The Wittig reagent may be written in the '''phosphorane''' form (the more familiar representation) or the '''ylide''' form:

[[File:Wittig reagent structure.gif|300px]]

However the phosphorane resonance requires expansion of the [[Octet rule|octet]] on phosphorus. This [[hypervalency]] cannot (yet) be explained well in terms of standard bonding theory, and this resonance is rather less favoured than the more familiar p–p overlap seen in π-bonded compounds as [[alkene]]s or [[imine]]s.  This means that the ylide form is a significant contributor, and the carbon is quite [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]].

== Scope and limitations ==
The Wittig reaction has become a popular method for [[alkene]] synthesis precisely because of its wide applicability.  Unlike [[elimination reaction]]s (such as [[dehydrohalogenation]] of [[alkyl halide]]s), which produce mixtures of alkene [[regioisomer]]s determined by [[Zaitsev's rule]], the Wittig reaction forms the double bond in one position with no ambiguity.  

A large variety of [[ketone]]s and [[aldehyde]]s are effective in the reaction, though [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives such as [[ester]]s fail to react usefully.  Thus mono-, di- and trisubstituted alkenes can all be prepared in good yield in most cases.  The [[carbonyl]] compound can tolerate several groups such as [[hydroxy|OH]], [[alkoxy|OR]], aromatic [[nitro]] and even ester groups.  There can be a problem with [[Steric hindrance|sterically hindered]] ketones, where the reaction may be slow and give poor yields, particularly with stabilised ylides, and in such cases the [[Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction|Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction]] (using phosphonate esters) is preferred. Another reported limitation is the often labile nature of [[aldehyde]]s which can oxidize, polymerize or decompose. In a so-called Tandem Oxidation-Wittig Process the aldehyde is formed [[in situ]] by oxidation of the corresponding [[alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Richard J. K. Taylor, Leonie Campbell, and Graeme D. McAllister | title = (±) trans-3,3'-(1,2-Cyclopropanediyl)bis-2-(E)-propenoic Acid, Diethyl Ester: Tandem Oxidation Procedure (TOP) using MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Oxidation-Stabilized Phosphorane Trapping | year = 2008 | volume = 85 | pages = 15-26 | url = http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/V85P0015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

As mentioned above, the Wittig reagent itself is usually derived from a primary [[alkyl halide]], because with most secondary halides the phosphonium salt is formed in poor yield.  This means that most tetrasubstituted alkenes are best made by other means.  However the Wittig reagent can tolerate many other variants. It may contain alkenes and [[aromatic ring]]s, and it is compatible with [[ether]]s and even [[ester]] groups.  Even C=O and [[nitrile]] groups can be present if [[conjugated system|conjugated]] with the ylide- these are the [[#Stabilised Wittig reagents|stabilised ylides]] mentioned above. Bis-ylides (containing two P=C bonds) have also been made and used successfully.

One limitation relates to the [[stereochemistry]] of the product.  With simple ylides, the product is usually mainly the [[Geometric isomerism|Z-isomer]], although a lesser amount of the E-isomer is often formed also- this is particularly true when ketones are used.  If the reaction is performed in [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]] in the presence of [[lithium iodide|LiI]] or [[sodium iodide|NaI]], the product is almost exclusively the Z-isomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = L. D. Bergelson and M. M. Shemyakin | title = Synthesis of Naturally Occurring Unsaturated Fatty Acids by Sterically Controlled Carbonyl Olefination | year = 1964 | journal = [[Angew. Chem.]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 250–260 | doi = 10.1002/anie.196402501}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the E-isomer is the desired product, the Schlosser modification may be used.  With stabilised ylides the product is mainly the E-isomer, and this same isomer is also usual with the HWE reaction.

== The Schlosser modification ==
[[File:Schlosser Wittig.gif|right|380px|The Schlosser variant of the Wittig reaction]]

The major limitation of the traditional Wittig reaction is that the reaction goes mainly via the [[erythro]] [[betaine]] intermediate, which leads to the [[Z-alkene]].  However [[Manfred Schlosser|Schlosser]] &amp; Christmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. Schlosser and K. F. Christmann | title = Trans-Selective Olefin Syntheses | year = 1966 | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 126 | doi = 10.1002/anie.196601261}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the erythro betaine can be converted to the [[threo]] betaine using [[phenyllithium]] at low temperature (forming a betaine) followed by [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]].  Upon workup this leads to the [[E-alkene]] product as shown.

[[Elias J. Corey|E. J. Corey]] and [[H. Yamamoto]] found that the utility can be extended to a [[stereoselective]] synthesis of [[allyl alcohol|allylic alcohols]], by reaction of the betaine ylid with a second aldehyde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[E. J. Corey]] and H. Yamamoto | title = Modification of the Wittig reaction to permit the stereospecific synthesis of certain trisubstituted olefins. Stereospecific synthesis of α-santalol | year = 1970 | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 226–228 | doi = 10.1021/ja00704a052}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

== Examples of use ==
[[File:Wittig CH2 examples.png|right|450px|Two examples of the Wittig reaction using methylenetriphenylphosphorane]]

Because of its reliability and wide applicability, the Wittig reaction has become a standard tool for synthetic organic chemists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = B. E. Maryanoff and A. B. Reitz | title = The Wittig olefination reaction and modifications involving phosphoryl-stabilized carbanions. Stereochemistry, mechanism, and selected synthetic aspects | year = 1989 | journal = [[Chem. Rev.]] | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 863–927 | doi = 10.1021/cr00094a007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular use of the Wittig reaction is for the introduction of a [[methylene]] group using methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  In the example shown, even a sterically hindered ketone such as [[camphor]] can be successfully converted to its methylene derivative by heating with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and [[potassium tert-butoxide]], which generate the Wittig reagent ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;Fitjer, L.; Quabeck, U. ''Synthetic Communications'' '''1985''', ''15(10)'', 855-864.&lt;/ref&gt;  In another example, the phosphorane is produced using [[sodium amide]] as a base, and this successfully converts the [[aldehyde]] shown into alkene '''I''' in 62% yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = F. A. Bottino, G. Di Pasquale, A. Pollicino, A. Recca and D. T. Clark | title = Synthesis of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole monomers and studies of the surface photostabilization of the related copolymers | year = 1990 | journal = [[Macromolecules (journal)|Macromolecules]] | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 2662–2666 | doi = 10.1021/ma00212a011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction is performed in cold [[THF]], and the sensitive [[nitro]], [[azo]] and [[phenoxide]] groups all survive intact.  The product can be used to incorporate a photostabiliser into a [[polymer]], to protect the polymer from damage by [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]].

Another example of its use is in the synthesis of [[Leukotriene|leukotriene A]] methyl ester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = I. Ernest, A. J. Main and R. Menasse | title = Synthesis of the 7-cis isomer of the natural leukotriene d&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; | year = 1982 | journal = [[Tetrahedron Letters]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–170 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(00)86776-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = E.

Hammarstroem | title = Stereospecific total synthesis of a &quot;slow reacting substance&quot; of anaphylaxis, leukotriene C-1 | year = 1980 | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 102 | issue = 4 | pages = 1436–1439 | doi = 10.1021/ja00524a045}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step uses a stabilised ylide, where the carbonyl group is conjugated with the ylide preventing self condensation, although unexpectedly this gives mainly the ''cis'' product.  The second Wittig reaction uses a non-stabilised Wittig reagent, and as expected this gives mainly the ''cis'' product.  Note that the [[epoxide]] and [[ester]] functional groups survive intact.

[[Methoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine]] is a Wittig reagent for the homologation of aldehydes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant. It was discovered in 1922 by Evans and Bishop. They found that it helped with reproduction in rats. The structure of Vitamin E consists of four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta tocopherol) and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta tocotienol). The most abundant is the alpha tocopherol and it has been found that alpha tocopherol can undo symptoms of Vitamin E deficiency in humans. In the 50s Vitamin E was rediscovered and found to be a cellular antioxidant. 
Because of this discovery, Vitamin E has been studies primarily as an antioxidant and many people have looked at its capability to prevent chronic disease. Epidemiology studies have found a correlation between high Vitamin E intakes and a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. 

Brigelius-Flohe, Regina; Traber, MG (1999). Vitamin E: Functions and Metabolism. The FASEB Journal, 13 (10), pp. 1145-1155. http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/short/13/10/1145.

Vitamin E stops the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) formed when fat undergoes oxidation. Scientists are investigating whether, by limiting free-radical production and possibly through other mechanisms, vitamin E might help prevent or delay the chronic diseases associated with free radicals.
Serum concentrations of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) depend on the liver, which takes up the nutrient after the various forms are absorbed from the small intestine. Vitamin E is also involved in immune function and, as shown primarily by in vitro studies of cells, cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and other metabolic processes

http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamine.asp

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;The Recommended Dietary Allowance&lt;/big&gt; (RDA)&lt;/u&gt; 
The RDA for vitamin E was previously 8 mg/day for women and 10 mg/day for men. The RDA was revised by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine in 2000 (4). This new recommendation was based largely on the results of studies done in the 1950s in men fed vitamin E deficient diets. In a test-tube analysis, hydrogen peroxide was added to blood samples and the breakdown of red blood cells, known as hemolysis, was used to indicate vitamin E deficiency. Because hemolysis has also been reported in children with severe vitamin E deficiency, this analysis was considered to be a clinically relevant test of vitamin E status. Importantly, this means that the latest RDA for vitamin E continues to be based on the prevention of deficiency symptoms rather than on health promotion and prevention of chronic disease.

=French Defence, Winawer Variation=

This is the main line of the Winawer Variation. White pushes his e pawn forward, gaining space and defending it with the d4 pawn. The pawn structure now is the same as the Advance Variation, with white gaining extra space on the kingside. Black's usual response is 4...c5, threatening white's pawn chain at its base. Note that since white's knight is already on c3, the standard Advance Variation reply of c3 is unavailable. Thus, since c5 also cuts off the bishop's escape route, white usually chooses to boot the bishop with 5.a3, leading to an exchange of pieces with 5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3.

=French Defence, Winawer Variation=

This is the main line of the Winawer Variation. Black has just pushed forward his c pawn with 4...c5, threatening white's pawn chain. White's knight on c3 prevents him from extending the chain by moving a pawn to c3, so this puts white's center pawns in danger.

However, c5 also blocks the escape route for black's dark squared bishop. White usually takes advantage of this to regain the initiative with 5.a3. Black usually trades bishop for knight with 5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
The European Fundamental Rights Agency was formed so that fundamemental rights for those residing in the European Union would become a reality. The Agency achieves this by completing three task.  Those task are collecting and analyzing objective reliable comparable data on a variety of fundamental rights issues, by networking with partner organizations to ensure that that the research that is carried out by the FRA is relevant to the needs, and finally by communicating it's evidence based advice to partner organizations to and the general public thereby raising awareness of fundamental rights.

The Agency has a management board that consists of people with appropriate past experience in the management of public or private sector organization in the field of human and fundamental rights. These members consist of one independent person appointed by each of the 27 Member States. Also included is one independent person appointed by the Council of Europe and also two representatives of the Commission.

The FRA receives it's funding by European Union funds which it receives each year from the European Union budgetary authority such as the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (representatives of the 27 Member State governments). The Director of the FRA must present the rationale about how the organization implemented its budget to the European Parliament upon request of the EU. The FRA must also present its annual report to the European Parliament along with an Annual Activity Report. The Agency's budget for 2010 is approximaltey 20 million Euros.

== History/Timeline ==
The European Fundamental Rights Agency was formed so that fundamemental rights for everyone living in European Union would become a reality.  This organization began in March 2007.  This organization had it's roots in another human rights organization called European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). The EUMC was established in Vienna as a separate entity. The EUMC activities started in 1998.  The preceding organization ceased to exist on 28 February 2007. 

On the basis of the data that was collected, the EUMC closely look at the extremity and development of the phenomena and manifestations of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other behavior related to that kind. The EUMC analyzed the causes and also the effects.  The organization was also tasked to develop strategies to combat racism and to showcase examples of good practices specifically related the assistance by organizations in integration of migrants and ethnic and religious minority groups in the EU Member States. 

The EUMC developed the European Information Network on Racism and Xenophobia (RAXEN) to collect data an monitor racial occurrences within the EU. This was accomplished by an organization called National Focal Points. This organiazation was retained by the EUMC to collect, review and disseminate information in each of the EU Member States as it related to racism.

== Local Significance ==
This organization is extremely significant because it affects many different areas with regard to fundametal rights.  The EFRA is active in areas such as:

a) racism and related behavior

b) discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation and against persons belonging to minorities and any combination of these grounds (multiple discrimination);

c) compensation of for people who have been victimized.

d) the rights and protection of children;

e) asylum, immigration and integration of migrants;

f) visa and border control activities; 

g) inclusion of the EU citizens in the Union's democratic processes;

h) information society and, respect for private life and protection of personal information; and

i) access to an impartial justice system.

All of the above mentioned area are of concerns not only in Austria and CZECH Republic, but the entire European Union.

== Global Impact ==
The Agency works to support an environment in which human rights promotion and protection at all levels of society and governance will become a natural reflex activity.  Engaging with the Agency's stakeholders, the wider human rights community, those at the national and local level responsible for providing services and those supporting people who make use of the services is seen as an essential part of supporting this development. This lies at the heart of the Agency's external relations and networking strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I fleshed out the introduction a little and changed some things.  I perhaps rather overcautiously removed the reference to application and abstraction as axioms simply because it is more usual to refer to alpha substitution and beta reduction as the most basic axioms of the calculus - is this agreeable? I will continue slowly - next the syntax. [[User:Jimbotyson|Jimbotyson]] ([[User talk:Jimbotyson|talk]])

Just a quick note - Lambda calculus was developed by Alonzo Church, not Lorenzo Church.</text>

Could a book layout be useful for a course on writing a literature reviewer's guide?
The participants of the course would write their own reviewer's guide and would consequently
be able to make their own informed decisions about children's and youth literature based on
their own deductions in their reviewer's guide. --[[User:Fasten|Bernhard Fastenrath]] 10:48, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Question 1=
==i==

&lt;math&gt;ax = a\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a \cdot (x \cdot a^{-1}) = a \cdot a^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a \cdot (a^{-1} \cdot x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(a \cdot a^{-1}) \cdot x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;1 \cdot x = 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;


==ii==

&lt;math&gt;(x-y)(x+y) = (x\cdot(x-y)+y\cdot(x-y))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= (x^2-xy)+(xy-y^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= x^2-xy+xy-y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= x^2-y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;


==iii==

&lt;math&gt;x^2 = y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Either &lt;math&gt;(x+y)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;, which means &lt;math&gt;x=-y\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(x-y)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;x=y\,&lt;/math&gt;.


==iv==

&lt;math&gt;x^3-y^3 = (x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=(x-y)x^2 + (x-y)xy + (x-y)y^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=(x^3 - x^2y + x^2y - xy^2 + xy^2 - y^3\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=x^3 - y^3\,&lt;/math&gt;

==v==

&lt;math&gt;x^n-y^n = (x-y)(x^{n-1} +x^{n-2}y +...+xy^{n-2}+y^{n-1})\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= x(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y +...+xy^{n-2}+y^{n-1}) - y(x^{n-1} +x^{n-2}y +...+xy^{n-2}+y^{n-1})\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= (x^n + x^{n-1}y + ... + x^2y^{n-2} + xy^{n-1}) - (x^{n-1}y + x^{n-2}y^2 + ... + xy^{n-1}+y^n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= x^n - y^n\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the two middle terms do no appear to match, but if you follow the logical development in each term, you will see that there is a matching additive inverse for each term on both sides.


==vi==

Use the same method as '''iv''', expand the expression and cancel.


=Question 2=

&lt;math&gt;x^2 = xy\,&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x = y\,&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;x-y=0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Step 4 requires division by &lt;math&gt;x-y=0\,&lt;/math&gt; and thus is an invalid step.


= Question 4=
==ii==

All values of x satisfy the inequality, since it can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;-3 &lt; x^2\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x^2 &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt; for all x.


==iii==

If &lt;math&gt;5-x^2 &lt; -2\,&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^2 &gt; 7\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Thus, &lt;math&gt;x &gt; \sqrt{7}\,&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x &lt; -\sqrt{7}\,&lt;/math&gt;.


==v==

&lt;math&gt;x^2-2x+2&lt;/math&gt; cannot be factored in its current form, so we first turn a part of the expression into a perfect square:


:&lt;math&gt;(x^2-2x+1)+1 &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


We then complete the square on &lt;math&gt;x^2-2x+1 = (x-1)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;, so now we have the expression:


:&lt;math&gt;(x-1)^2+1 &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is positive for all values of x.


==vi==

If &lt;math&gt;x^2 + x + 1 &gt; 2\,&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^2+x-1 &gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;math&gt;x^2+x-1 = \left(x+\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) \left(x-\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


Thus &lt;math&gt;x &lt; -\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x &gt; \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


==viii==

Complete the square:


&lt;math&gt;x^2+x+1=x^2+x+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}=\left(x +\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+\frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, &lt;math&gt;\left(x +\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+\frac{3}{4} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==ix==

Solve for &lt;math&gt;(x-\pi)(x+5) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt; first, then consider the third factor &lt;math&gt;(x-3)\,&lt;/math&gt; for both cases, giving us &lt;math&gt;-5 &lt; x &lt; 3\,&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x &gt; \pi\,&lt;/math&gt;


==x==

&lt;math&gt;x &gt; \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x &lt; \sqrt[3]{2}&lt;/math&gt;


==xi==

If &lt;math&gt;2^x &lt; 8\,&lt;/math&gt;, then taking the base 2 logarithm on both sides:


&lt;math&gt;log_2 2^x &lt; log_2 8 = x &lt; 3\,&lt;/math&gt;


==xii==

&lt;math&gt;x &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;


==xiii==

NOTE: The answer in the 3rd Edition provides &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging in values &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. 10, gives us &lt;math&gt;1/10-1/9 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, so I think this is a misprint or an incorrect answer.


If &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x-x^2} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is only positive when &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;x^2 &gt; x&lt;/math&gt;. 


=Question 5=
==i==
&lt;math&gt;a+c&lt;b+d\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;= (b+d)-(a+c)&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= (b-a)+(d-c) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;, which is true since &lt;math&gt;(b-a),(d-c) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


==ii==
&lt;math&gt;b-a&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;=-a+b &gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=-a-(-b)&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=-b &lt; -a\,&lt;/math&gt;


==iv==
&lt;math&gt;(b-a), c &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;c(b-a) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;c(b-a) = bc-ac\,&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;ac &lt; bc\,&lt;/math&gt;. 


==v==
&lt;math&gt;a &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;1-a &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;a(1-a) &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;= a^2 - a &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=a^2 &gt; a\,&lt;/math&gt; 


==viii==

If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are 0, then by definition &lt;math&gt;ac &lt; bd&lt;/math&gt;.

Otherwise, we have already proved that &lt;math&gt;ac &lt; bc&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a, c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, therefore if &lt;math&gt;c &lt; d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ac &lt; bd&lt;/math&gt; is true.


==ix==

If &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^2 &lt; b^2&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;b^2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^2 &lt; ab&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;ab &lt; b^2&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;a^2 &lt; b^2&lt;/math&gt;.

=Question 6=
==ii==
If &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x^n &lt; y^n\,&lt;/math&gt; by '''6.i'''.


If &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 0 \leq y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x^n &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y^n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, hence also true.


If &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; -y &lt; -x\,&lt;/math&gt;, which means &lt;math&gt;(-y)^n &lt; (-x)^n\,&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;-(-y)^n &gt; -(-x)^n = y^n &gt; x^n\,&lt;/math&gt;. 


==iii==

We already know that if &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x^n &lt; y^n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x^n &lt; y^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y^n &lt; x^n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y &lt; x&lt;/math&gt;. But since &lt;math&gt;x^n = y^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;.


==iv==

We already proved in '''6.i''' that if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^n &lt; y^n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}^+&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, if &lt;math&gt;x^n = y^n&lt;/math&gt; it cannot be &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y &lt; x&lt;/math&gt;, and must be &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x = -y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x^n = (-y)^n&lt;/math&gt;, which is positive by virtue of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; being even.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The National Eligibility Test (&quot;NET&quot;) is the national level entrance examination for postgraduate candidates who wish to qualify for university level teaching jobs in India. It is administered by the University Grants Commission.

==About the NET==
The University Grants Commission (&quot;UGC&quot;) administers the NET to determine eligibility for a lectureship and for the award of Junior Research Fellowships (&quot;JRF&quot;) for Indian nationals in order to ensure minimum standards for the entrants in the teaching profession and research. The examination covers humanities (including languages), social sciences, forensic science, environmental sciences, computer science and applications and electronic science.

The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (&quot;CSIR&quot;) administers the UGC-CSIR NET for other science subjects, namely, life sciences, physical sciences, chemical sciences, mathematical sciences and Earth, atmospheric, ocean and planetary sciences jointly with the UGC. The tests are conducted twice in a year generally in the months of '''June''' and '''December'''. For candidates who wish to pursue research, a JRF is available for five years subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. UGC has allocated a number of fellowships to the universities for the candidates who pass the test for JRF. A JRF is awarded to the meritorious candidates from among the candidates qualifying for eligibility for lectureship in the NET Examination. A JRF is available only to candidates who opt for it on their application forms.

The test for a JRF has been conducted since 1984. The government of India, through its notification dated 22 July, 1988 entrusted the task of conducting the eligibility test for lectureship to the UGC. Consequently, the UGC held the first NET, common to both eligibility for lectureship and JRF in two parts, that is, in December 1989 and in March, 1990.

==Concept of SET/SLET==
It was felt that an eligibility test at the national level may not be completely able to represent the subjects which are regional in their character. Moreover, the demand for enabling the candidates to appear for the test in their own mother tongue was also being made. The state governments and union territories were, therefore, given the option of conducting their own test for eligibility for lectureship at the state level. Thus was born the concept of SET, that is, State Eligibility Test for Lectureship Eligibility only. It is conducted both in English and the vernacular.

The Commission at its meeting held on 25 May 1990 decided to constitute a UGC Committee on Accreditation of Test (U-CAT). The terms of reference of U-CAT are as follows:

* Laying down guidelines for holding the tests.
* Laying down guidelines for holding the tests/CSIR.
* Monitoring of tests conducted by other agencies and suggesting follow-up measures.
* Extend guidance and help to State level agencies in the organization of the tests.

Based on the recommendations made by U-CAT, the following guidelines are given to the states regarding test design, course content, organization of the test, etc., for conducting State Eligibility Test (SET) for Lectureship only.

In accordance with the mandate given by the Government of India, the UGC, on request of State Governments, proposed to have the SET duly accredited by UGC for a fixed term. This state level test is based on the pattern of the NET conducted by UGC and UGC/CSIR for humanities, social sciences and science subjects respectively. The State Governments and Union Territories, which wish to conduct their own SET, are required to obtain accreditation from UGC from time to time.

Besides conducting the NET examination, the role of the NET Bureau is to assess and accredit state-identified agencies to conduct SET examination. The SET assessment is done by evaluating the performance of the state agency designated by the state government. The Certification of Accreditation is given to the state for a stipulated period of time.

===Identification of State Agency===
A State Government may identify an agency, which may be a University, or an examination body of repute or a reputed agency associated with recruitment of teachers for higher education.

===States conducting SLET===
Presently, SET/SLET is being conducted in the following states:

* Maharashtra
* Goa
* Tamil Nadu
* Madhya Pradesh
* Andhra Pradesh
* Himachal Pradesh
* Jammu &amp; Kashmir
* Rajasthan
* Uttar Pradesh
* West Bengal
* Gujarat
* NE-SLET (Which includes all North Eastern states and Sikkim)
* Karnataka

The Commission constitutes an Accreditation Committee from time to time to assess the performance of the states conducting the SET Examination. The Commission takes a final decision about any state on the basis of the Report of the Committee.

==Scope of NET &amp; SLET==
===Eligibility for Lectureship===

Clearing of NET Examination confers eligibility for lectureship upon Indian nationals, i.e. the NET qualified candidates are eligible to apply for the post of lecturer in all Indian universities/Institutes/colleges. It was resolved in the UGC's Commission Meeting held on January 1, 2001 that for SET examinations scheduled in or after June 2002, the SET qualified candidates would be eligible for appointment to the post of lecturer only in the universities and colleges belonging to the state from where they have passed the SET examination.  The status of SET was decreed to remain unchanged for SET examinations conducted prior to 1 June 2002, that is, the candidates clearing SET were eligible for appointment to the post of lecturer anywhere in India.

===Junior Research Fellowship===
The candidates who qualify the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) Examination of UGC/CSIR NET are also eligible for the post of lectureship.  In addition they are also eligible to receive Fellowships (UGC/CSIR) under various schemes subject to the candidates finding their placement in the universities/IITs/other national organizations. The validity of the offer is currently within two years with effect from the date of issue of the JRF award letter.  The validity period of the offer has been raised from one year to two years for JRF Award Letters issued on or after 1 May 2005.  However, in case the candidates have already joined M.Phil./Ph.D. programs, the date of commencement of fellowship will be from the date of declaration of NET examination result or date of their joining, whichever is later.

===Shyama Prasad Mukherjee (SPM) Fellowship===
To commemorate the birth centenary year (2000) of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who was the  first Vice-President of CSIR in the Independent India, the CSIR has instituted a special fellowship, namely, &quot;Dr. Shyama  Prasad Mukherjee (SPM)  Fellowship&quot; open to the selective CSIR-UGC JRF (NET) awardees. Around top 50 candidates in Life Sciences and Chemical Sciences and top 25 each in Physical Sciences, Mathematical Sciences &amp; Earth Sciences from each of the two NET examinations conducted in a calendar year and GATE qualified candidates in the subject areas of NET with percentile score of 99% and above are called for interview. The eligible candidates are first screened by a specially constituted panel of subject-experts. The shortlisted candidates after first interview are further interviewed by a panel of SPMF Core Committee members and subject- committee chairmen for making final recommendations. It is the most prestigious fellowship given in India for doing PhD and a preferential qualification in recruitment to CSIR jobs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Factorial notation ==
A factorial of a positive integer ''n'' is the product of all the natural numbers from 1 to ''n''. The factorial of ''n'' is denoted by ''n!'' (n factorial). Factorials are used in probability distributions.

Factorials can be used to find the possible number of permutations or combinations of the elements of a set. For example, let ''S'' represent the set of beads in a bag. The bag has 2 blue and 2 green beads. The beads are taken out of the bag and arranged. The possible arrangements are:

* BBGG
* BGGB
* BGBG
* GBGB
* GBBG
* GGBB

where ''B'' represents a blue bead and ''G'' represents a green bead.

We can see that there are 8 possible arrangements. We can use factorials to work out the number of possible arrangements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
What if we could have all of the energy we needed and never run out of it? What if we could use this energy without polluting the air and water? In the future, renewable sources of energy may be able to provide all of the energy we need. Some of these resources can give us &quot;clean&quot; energy that causes little or no pollution.

Plenty of clean energy is available for us to use. The largest amount of energy to reach Earth's surface is from solar radiation. Each year is 174 petawatts (1.74{{e|17}}&amp;nbsp;W) of energy from the sun enter the Earth's atmosphere. Because the planet's interior is hot, heat flows outward from the interior, providing about 23 terawatts (2.3{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;W) of energy per year. By contrast, the total world power consumption is around 16 terawatts (1.6{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;W) per year. So solar or geothermal energy alone could provide all of the energy needed for people if it could be harnessed.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe different renewable resources, and understand why they are renewable.
* Understand that the sun is the source of most of Earth's energy.
* Describe how energy is carried from one place to another as heat and by moving objects.
* Understand how conduction, convection, and radiation transfer energy as heat when renewable energy sources are used.
* Understand that some renewable energy sources cost less than others and some cause less pollution than others.
* Explain how renewable energy resources are turned into useful forms of energy.
* Describe how the use of different renewable energy resources affects the environment.

==Solar Energy==
When you think of the sun, you probably think of two things&amp;mdash;light and heat. The sun is Earth's main source of energy, and light and heat are two different kinds of energy that the sun makes. The sun makes this energy when one element, called hydrogen, changes into another element, called helium. Changing hydrogen into helium releases huge amounts of energy. The energy travels to the Earth mostly as visible light. The light carries the energy through the empty space between the sun and the Earth in a process called '''radiation'''. We can use this light from the sun as an energy resource called solar energy (Figure 5.6).

[[File:Mafate Marla solar panel dsc00633.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 5.6''': Solar panels like these can turn the sun's energy into electricity to provide power to homes.]]

Solar energy is a resource that has been used on a small scale for hundreds of years. Its use on a larger scale is just starting to ramp up and people increase production of renewable energy sources. One focus of solar power development in the United States is the desert southwest.

Solar power plants are in the works for southeastern California, near the California-Nevada border.

Solar energy is used to heat homes, to heat water, and to make electricity. Solar energy can be used to heat the water in your pool or to heat tile floors in your home. In recent years, scientists and engineers have found new ways to get more and more energy from this resource. Because there are many different uses for solar energy, there are also many different ways of turning the sun's energy into useful forms. One of the most common ways is by using solar cells. Solar cells are devices that can turn sunlight directly into electricity. You may have seen solar panels on roof tops. Lots of solar cells make up an individual solar panel.

Solar power plants turn sunlight into electricity using a large group of mirrors to focus sunlight on one place, called a receiver (Figure 5.7). When a liquid, such as oil or water flows through this receiver, the focused sunlight heats the liquid to a high temperature. Then, this heated liquid transfers its heat by '''conduction'''. In conduction, energy moves between two objects that are in contact with one another. The object that is at a higher temperature transfers energy as heat to the object that is at a lower temperature. For example, when you heat a pot of water on a stove top, conduction causes energy to move from the pot to its metal handle, and the handle gets very hot. In the case of the solar power plant, the energy conducted by the heated liquid is used to make electricity.

[[File:PS10 solar power tower 2.jpg|500px|thumb|center|'''Figure 5.7''': This solar power plant uses mirrors to focus sunlight on the tower in the center. The sunlight heats a liquid inside the tower to a very high temperature, producing energy to make electricity.]]

Solar energy has many benefits. It does not produce any pollution. Also, there is plenty of it available. In fact, the amount of energy that reaches Earth from the sun every day is many times more than all of the energy we use. For this reason, we consider solar energy a renewable form of energy. For as long as sunlight continues to warm the Earth, we will never run out of this resource. One problem with solar energy is that it cannot be used at night, unless a special battery stores extra energy during the day for use at night. The technology for most uses of solar energy is still expensive. Until this technology becomes more affordable, most people will prefer to get their energy from other sources. As you learned earlier, most of the Earth's energy comes from the sun. Other renewable resources also come from the sun originally. You will be learning about these resources later in this lesson.

==Water Power==
Earlier in this lesson, you learned that energy can travel in the form of light and heat, just as it does when it travels from the sun to the Earth. Now, you will learn about one way in which energy can travel in the form of a moving object. In this case, the moving object is water (Figure 5.8). Water power uses the energy of water in motion to make electricity. It is the most widely used form of renewable energy in the world, and it provides almost one fifth of the world's electricity.

[[File:Adam Beck Complex.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 5.8''': Hydroelectric dams like this one use the power of moving water to create electricity.]]

In most power plants that use water power, a dam holds water back from where it would normally flow. Instead, the water is allowed to flow into a large turbine. Because the water is moving, it has energy of motion, called kinetic energy. The energy of this moving water makes the turbine spin. The turbine is connected to a generator, which makes electricity.

Many of the streams in the United States where water flows down a slope have probably been developed for hydroelectric power. This is a major source of California’s electricity, about 14.5 percent of the total. Most of California’s nearly 400 hydropower plants are located in the eastern mountain ranges where large streams descend down a steep grade.

One big benefit of water power is that it does not burn a fuel. This benefit gives water power an advantage over most other energy resources in how it affects the environment. Because water power does not burn a fuel, it causes less pollution than many other kinds of energy. Another benefit of water power is that, like the other resources you are learning about in this lesson, it is a renewable resource. We use energy from the water’s movement, but we are not using up the water itself. Water keeps flowing into our rivers and lakes, so wherever we can build plants to use it, water will be available as a source of energy. The energy of waves and tides can also be used to produce water power.

Water power does have its problems, though. When a large dam is built, this creates a reservoir, changing the ecosystem upstream. Large river ecosystems are inundated, killing all the plants and animals. The dams and turbines also change the downstream environment for fish and other living things. Dams also slow the release of silt, so that downstream deltas retreat and seaside cities become dangerously exposed to storms and rising sea levels. Tidal power stations may need to close off a narrow bay or estuary. Wave power applications have to be able to withstand coastal storms and the corrosion of seawater.

==Wind Power==
As you learned earlier, the sun provides plenty of energy to the Earth. The energy from the sun also creates wind (Figure 5.9). Learning about what causes wind will help you understand that energy can move as heat, not just by radiation and conduction, but also by convection. Wind happens when the sun heats some parts of the Earth differently. For example, sunlight hits the equator much more directly than it hits the North and South Poles. Hot air rises and cooler air moves in, so when the air near the equator is heated much more than the air near the poles, the air begins to move carrying heat through the air in a process called '''convection'''. This movement of air is wind.

[[File:Windpark.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 5.9''': Wind turbines like the ones shown above turn wind into electricity without creating pollution.]]

Wind power uses moving air as a source of energy. Some examples of wind power have been around for a long time. Windmills have been used to grind grain and pump water for hundreds of years. Ships with sails have depended on wind for even longer. Wind can be used to generate electricity, too. Like the moving water that creates water power, the moving air can make a turbine spin to make electricity.

To help you understand how moving air can be used to make electricity, you could think back to what you have learned about energy of motion, called kinetic energy. Any form of matter that is moving has kinetic energy. Even though you cannot see air, it is matter, because it takes up space and has mass. So, when wind makes the air move, this air has kinetic energy. When the moving air hits the blades of a turbine, it makes those blades move, and the turbine spins. The spinning of the turbine creates electricity.

Wind power has many advantages. It is clean energy, meaning that it does not cause pollution or release carbon dioxide. Also, wind is plentiful almost everywhere. One problem with wind energy is that the wind does not blow all of the time. One solution is to find efficient ways to store energy for later use. Until then, another energy source needs to be available when the wind is not blowing. Lastly, windmills are expensive and wear out quickly. For the amount
of energy they generate, windmills are more expensive than some other forms of renewable energy.

California was an early adopter of wind power. Windmills are found in mountain passes, especially where cooler Pacific ocean air is sucked across the passes and into the warmer inland valleys. Large fields of windmills can be seen at Altamont pass in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area, San Gorgonio Pass east of Los Angeles, and Tehachapi Pass at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley.

==Biomass==
Another renewable source of energy is biomass. Biomass is the material that comes from plants and animals that were recently living. Biomass also includes the waste that plants and animals produce. People can use biomass directly for heating. For example, many people burn wood in fireplaces or in wood-burning stoves.

Besides burning biomass directly for heating, people can process biomass to make fuel. This processing makes what is called biofuel. Biofuel is a fairly new type of energy that is becoming more popular. People can use fuels from biomass in many of the same ways that they use fossil fuels. For example, some mechanics have made changes to car, truck, and bus engines to allow them to use a fuel called biodiesel. Other engines can run on pure vegetable oil or even recycled vegetable oil.

If we use fuels made from biomass, we can cut down on the amount of fossil fuel that we use. Because living plants take carbon dioxide out of the air, growing plants for biofuel can mean that we will put less of this gas into the air overall. This could help us do something about the problem of global warming.

==Geothermal Energy==
Geothermal energy is a source of energy that comes from heat deep below the surface of the Earth. This heat produces hot water and steam from rocks that are heated by magma. Power plants that use this type of energy get to the heat by drilling wells into these rocks. The hot water or steam comes up through these wells. Then, the hot water or steam makes a turbine spin to make electricity. Because the hot water or steam can be used directly to make a turbine spin, geothermal energy is a resource that can be used without processing. The fact that it does not need to be processed makes geothermal energy different from most other energy resources. Geothermal energy is clean and safe. It is renewable, too, because the power plant can pump the hot water back into the underground pool. There, the water can pick up heat to make more steam.

This source of energy is an excellent resource in some parts of the world. For example, Iceland is a country that gets about one fourth of its electricity from geothermal sources. In the United States, California leads all states in producing geothermal energy. Geothermal energy in California is concentrated in a few areas in the northern part of the state. The largest geothermal power plant in the state is in the Geysers Geothermal Resource Area in Napa and Sonoma Counties. The source of heat is thought to be a large magma chamber lying beneath the area, a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Many parts of the world do not have underground sources of heat that are close enough to the surface for building geothermal power plants.

==Lesson Summary==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
''Plate tectonics'' is the unifying theory of geology. This important theory explains why Earth's geography has changed through time and continues to change today. It explains why some places are prone to earthquakes and some are not; why some regions have deadly volcanic eruptions, some have mild ones, and some have none at all; and why mountain ranges are located where they are. Plate tectonic motions affect Earth's rock cycle, climate, and the evolution of life. Plate tectonic theory was developed through the efforts of many scientists during the twentieth century.

Before you can learn about plate tectonics, you need to know something about the layers that are found inside Earth. From outside to inside, the planet is divided into crust, mantle, and core. Often geologists talk about the lithosphere, which is the crust and the uppermost mantle. The lithosphere is brittle–it is easily cracked or broken–whereas the mantle beneath it behaves plastically; it can bend. Geologists must use ingenious methods, such as tracking the properties of earthquake waves, to learn about the interior of our planet.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Compare and describe each of Earth's layers.
* Compare some of the ways geologists learn about Earth’s interior.
* Define lithosphere, oceanic and continental crust.
* Describe how heat moves, particularly how convection takes place in the mantle.
* Compare the two parts of the core and describe why they are different from each other.

==Exploring Earth's Interior==
Earth is composed of several layers. On the outside is the relatively cold, brittle '''crust'''. Below the crust is the hot, convecting '''mantle'''. At the center is the dense, metallic inner core. How do scientists know this? Rocks yield clues, but geologists can only see the outermost rocky layer. Rarely, a rock or mineral, like a diamond, may come to the surface from deeper down in the crust or the mantle. Mostly, though, Earth scientists must use other clues to figure out what lies beneath the planet's surface.

One way scientists learn about Earth's interior is by looking at '''seismic waves''' (Figure 6.1). Seismic waves travel outward in all directions from where the ground breaks at an earthquake. There are several types of seismic waves, each with different properties. Each type of wave moves at different speeds through different types of material and the waves bend when they travel from one type of material to another. Some types of waves do not travel through liquids or gases and some do. So scientists can track how seismic waves behave as they travel through Earth and can use the information to understand what makes up the planet's interior. Much more about earthquakes and seismic waves will be presented in the Earthquakes lesson.

[[File:Earthquake wave paths.svg|center|thumb|500px|'''Figure 6.1''': Different types of seismic waves bend or even disappear as they travel encounter the different properties of the layers that make up Earth's interior. Letters describe the path of an individual P wave or S wave.]]

Scientists also learn about Earth's interior from rocks from outer space. '''Meteorites''' are the remains of the material that the early solar system formed from. Some iron and nickel meteorites are thought to be very similar to Earth's core (Figure 6.2). For this reason they give scientists clues as to the core's makeup and density. An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the core that scientists can hold in their hands!

==Crust and Lithosphere==
Of course, scientists know the most about Earth's outermost layer and less and less about layers that are found deeper in the planet's interior (Figure 6.3). Earth's outer surface is its crust; a thin, brittle outer shell made of rock. Geologists call the outermost, brittle, mechanical layer the '''lithosphere'''. The difference between crust and lithosphere is that lithosphere includes the uppermost mantle, which is also brittle.

[[File:Earth cross section-i18.png|center|thumb|500px|'''Figure 6.3''': A cross section of Earth showing the following layers: (1) crust (2) mantle (3a) outer core (3b) inner core (4) lithosphere (5) asthenosphere (6) outer core (7) inner core. The lithosphere is made of the crust plus the uppermost part of the mantle. The asthenosphere is directly under the lithosphere and is part of the upper mantle.]]

The crust is the very thin, outermost solid layer of the Earth. The crust varies tremendously; from thinner areas under the oceans to much thicker areas that make mountains. Just by looking around and thinking of the places you’ve been or seen photos of, you can guess that the crust is not all the same. Geologists make an important distinction between two very different types of crust: oceanic crust and continental crust. Each type has its own distinctive physical and chemical properties. This is one of the reasons that there are ocean basins and continents.

'''Oceanic crust''' is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 to 8 miles). This crust is made of basalt lavas that erupt onto the seafloor. Beneath the basalt is gabbro, an igneous intrusive rock that comes from basalt magma but that cools more slowly and develops larger crystals. The basalt and gabbro of the oceanic crust are dense (3.0 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) when compared to the average of the rocks that make up the continents. Sediments cover much of the oceanic crust, primarily rock dust and the shells of microscopic sea creatures, called plankton. Near shore, the seafloor is thick with sediments that come off the continents in rivers and on wind currents.

'''Continental crust''' is much thicker than oceanic crust, around 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick on average. Continental crust is made up of many different rocks of all three major types: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. The average composition of continental crust is about that of granite. Granite is much less dense (2.7 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) than the basalt and gabbro of the oceanic crust. Because it is thick and has relatively low density, continental crust rises higher above the mantle than oceanic crust, which sinks into the mantle to form basins. When filled with water these basins form the planet's oceans.

Since it is a combination of the crust and uppermost mantle, lithosphere is thicker than crust. Oceanic lithosphere is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) thick. Continental lithosphere is about 250 kilometers (155 miles) thick.

==Mantle==
Beneath the crust, lies the mantle. Like the crust, mantle is made of rock. The mantle is differentiated from the crust by an increase in rock density as indicated by a sudden increase in seismic wave velocities. Evidence from seismic waves and meteorites let scientists know that the mantle is made of iron and magnesium-rich silicate minerals that are part of the rock peridotite. These types of ultramafic rocks are rarely found at Earth’s surface. One very important feature of the mantle is that it is extremely hot.  Although the higher temperatures far exceed the melting points of the mantle rocks at the surface the mantle is almost exclusively solid. The heat in the mantle is mainly due to heat rising from the core. Through the process of '''conduction''', heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects until all are the same temperature. Knowing the ways that heat flows is important for understanding how the mantle behaves.

Heat can flow in two ways within the Earth. If the material is solid, heat flows by conduction, and heat is transferred through the rapid collision among atoms. If a material is fluid and able to move&amp;mdash;that is, it is a gas, liquid, or a solid that can move (like toothpaste)&amp;mdash;heat can also flow by '''convection'''. In convection, currents form so that warm material rises and cool material sinks. This sets up a '''convection cell''' (Figure 6.4).

[[File:Convection cells.svg|center|frame|'''Figure 6.4''': In a convection cell, warm material rises and cool material sinks. In mantle convection, the heat source is Earth's core.]]

Convection occurs when a pot of water is heated on a stove. The stove heats the bottom layer of the water, which makes it less dense than the water above it, so the warmer bottom water rises. Since the layer of water on the top of the pot is not near the heat source, it is relatively cool. As a result, it is denser than the water beneath it and so it sinks. Within the pot, convection cells become well established as long as there is more heat at the bottom of the pot than on the top.

Convection cells are also found in the mantle. Mantle material is heated by the core and so it rises upwards. When it reaches the surface of the Earth, it moves horizontally. As the material moves away from the core's heat, it cools. Eventually the mantle material at the top of the convection cell becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks back down into the deeper mantle. When it reaches the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally just
above the core. Then it reaches the location where warm mantle material is rising, and the mantle convection cell is complete. The relationship between mantle convection and plate tectonics will be discussed in the final section of this chapter.

==Core==
At the planet's center lies a dense metallic '''core'''. Scientists know that the core is metal for two reasons: The first is that some meteorites are metallic and they are thought to be representative of the core. The second is that the density of Earth's surface layers is much less than the overall density of the planet. We can calculate Earth's density using our planet's rotation. If the surface layers are less dense than the average for the planet, then
the interior must be denser than the average. Calculations indicate that the core is about 85% iron metal with nickel metal making up much of the rest. These proportions agree with those seen in metallic meteorites. Seismic waves indicate that the outer core must be liquid and the inner core must be solid.

If Earth's core were not metallic, the planet would not have a magnetic field. Metal conducts electricity, but rock&amp;mdash;which makes up the mantle and crust&amp;mdash;does not. The best conductors are metals that can move, so scientists assume that the magnetic field is due to convection in the liquid outer core. These convection currents form in the outer core because the base of the outer core is heated by the even hotter inner core.

==Lesson Summary==
* The Earth is made of three layers: the crust, mantle and core.
* The brittle crust and uppermost mantle are together called the lithosphere.
* Beneath the lithosphere, the mantle is solid rock that can flow, or behave plastically.
* The hot core warms the base of the mantle, which cause mantle convection.
* Mantle convection is very important to the theory of plate tectonics.

An important piece of plate tectonic theory is the continental drift idea. This was developed in the early part of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, mostly by a single scientist, Alfred Wegener. His hypothesis states that continents move around on Earth's surface and that they were once joined together as a single supercontinent (Figure 6.5). Wegener's idea eventually helped to form the theory of plate tectonics, but while Wegener was alive, scientists did not believe that the continents could move.

[[File:Pangaea continents.svg|400px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.5''': The continents fit together like pieces of a puzzle. This is how they looked 250 million years ago.]]
{{clear}}
==Lesson Objectives==
* Be able to explain the continental drift hypothesis.
* Describe the evidence Wegener used to support his continental drift idea.
* Describe how the north magnetic pole appeared to move, and how that is evidence for continental drift.

==The Continental Drift Idea==
Find a map of the continents and cut each one out. Better yet, use a map where the edges of the continents show the continental shelf. In this case, your continent puzzle piece includes all of the continental crust for that continent and reflects the true size and shape of the continent. Can you fit the pieces together? The easiest link is between the eastern Americas and western Africa and Europe, but the rest can fit together too!

Alfred Wegener, an early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century German meteorologist believed that the continents could fit together. He proposed that the continents were not stationary but that they had moved during the planet's history. He suggested that at one time, all of the continents had been united into a single supercontinent. He named the supercontinent Pangaea, meaning entire earth in ancient Greek. Wegener further suggested that Pangaea broke up long ago and that the continents then moved to their current positions. He called his hypothesis
'''continental drift'''.

==Evidence for Continental Drift==
Besides the fit of the continents, Wegener and his supporters collected a great deal of evidence for the continental drift hypothesis. Wegener found that this evidence was best explained if the continents had at one time been joined together.

Wegener discovered that identical rocks could be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. These rocks were the same type and the same age. Wegener understood that the rocks had formed side-by-side and that the land has since moved apart. Wegener also matched up mountain ranges that had the same rock types, structures, and ages, but that are now on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The Appalachians of the eastern United States and Canada, for example, are just like mountain ranges in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway. Wegener concluded that they formed as a single mountain range that was separated as the continents drifted.

Wegener also found evidence from ancient fossils (Figure 6.6). He found fossils of the same species of extinct plants and animals in rocks of the same age, but on continents that are now widely separated. Wegener suggested that the continents could not have been in their current positions because the organisms would not have been able to travel across the oceans. For example, fossils of the seed fern ''Glossopteris'' are found across all of the southern continents. But the plants' seeds were too heavy to be carried across the ocean by wind. ''Mesosaurus'' fossils are found in South America and South Africa, but the reptile only could only swim in fresh water. ''Cynognathus'' and ''Lystrosaurus'' were reptiles that lived on land. Both of these animals were unable to swim, let alone swim across wide seas! Their fossils have been found across South America, Africa, India and Antarctica. Wegener proposed that the organisms had lived side by side, but that the lands had moved apart after they were dead and fossilized.

[[File:Snider-Pellegrini Wegener fossil map.gif|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.6''': Wegener used fossil evidence to support his continental drift hypothesis. The fossils of these organisms are found on lands that are now far apart. Wegener suggested that when the organisms were alive, the lands were joined and the organisms were living side-by-side.]]

Wegener also looked at evidence from ancient glaciers. Large glaciers are most commonly found in frigid climates, usually in the far northern and southern latitudes. Using the distribution of grooves and rock deposits left by ancient glaciers on many different continents, Wegener traced the glaciers back to where they must have started. He discovered that if the continents were in their current positions, the glaciers would have formed in the middle of the ocean very close to the equator. Wegener knew that this was impossible! However, if the continents had moved, the glaciers would have been centered over the southern land mass much closer to the South Pole.

Wegener also found evidence for his hypothesis from warm climate zones. Coral reefs and the swamps that lead to the formation of coal are now found only in tropical and subtropical environments. But Wegener discovered ancient coal seams and coral reefs in parts of the continents that were much too cold today. The coral reef fossils and coal had drifted to new locations since the coal and coral formed.

Although Wegener's evidence was sound, most geologists at the time rejected his hypothesis of continental drift. These scientists argued that there was no way to explain ''how'' solid continents could plow through solid oceanic crust. At the time, scientists did not understand how solid material could move. Wegener's idea was nearly forgotten until technological advances presented puzzling new information and gave scientists the tools to develop a mechanism for Wegener’s drifting continents.

==Magnetic Polarity Evidence==
The puzzling new evidence came from studying Earth's magnetic field and how it has changed. If you have ever been hiking or camping, you may have used a compass to help you find your way. A compass uses the Earth’s magnetic field to locate the magnetic North Pole. Earth's '''magnetic field''' is like a bar magnet with the ends of the bar sticking out at each pole (Figure 6.7). Currently, the field's north and south magnetic poles are very near to the Earth's north and south geographic poles.

Some iron-bearing minerals, like tiny '''magnetite''' crystals in igneous rocks, point to the north magnetic pole as they crystallize from magma. These little magnets record both the strength and direction of the Earth's magnetic field. The direction is known as the field's '''magnetic polarity'''. In the 1950s, scientists began using '''magnetometers''' to look at the magnetic properties of rocks in many locations.

[[File:Dipole field.jpg|center|frame|'''Figure 6.7''': Earth's magnetic field is like a magnet with its north pole near the geographic north pole and the south pole near the geographic south pole.]]

Geologists noted that magnetite crystals in fresh volcanic rocks pointed to the current magnetic north pole. This happened no matter where the rocks were located, whether they were on different continents or in different locations on the same continent. But for older volcanic rocks, this was not true. Rocks that were the same age and were located on the same continent pointed to the same point, but that point was not the current north magnetic pole. Moving back in time, rocks on the same continent that were the same age pointed at the same point. But these rocks did not point to the same point as the rocks of different ages or the current magnetic pole. In other words, although the magnetite crystals were pointing to the magnetic north pole, the location of the pole seemed to wander. For example, 400 million year old lava flows in North America indicated that the north magnetic pole was located in the western Pacific Ocean, but 250 million year old lava flows indicated a pole in Asia, and 100 million year old lava flows had a pole in northern Asia. Scientists were amazed to find that the north magnetic pole changed location through time!

There were three possible explanations for this puzzling phenomenon: (1) the continent remained fixed and the north magnetic pole moved (2) the north magnetic pole stood still and the continent moved (3) both the continent and the north pole moved.

The situation got stranger when scientists looked at where magnetite crystals pointed for rocks of the same age but on different continents. They found these rocks pointed to different magnetic north poles! For example, 400 million years ago the European north pole was different from the North American north pole at that same time. At 250 million years, the north poles were also different for the two continents. The scientists again looked at the three possible explanations. If the correct explanation was that the continents had remained fixed while the north magnetic pole moved, then there had to be two separate north poles. Since there is only one north pole today, they decided that the best explanation had to involve only one north magnetic pole. This meant that the second explanation must be correct, that the north magnetic pole had remained fixed but that the continents had moved.

To test this, geologists fitted the continents together as Wegener had done. They discovered that there had indeed been only one magnetic north pole but that the continents had drifted. They renamed the phenomenon of the magnetic pole that seemed to move but actually did not '''apparent polar wander'''. This evidence for continental drift gave geologists renewed interest in understanding how continents could move about on the planet's surface. And we know that the magnetic pole wanders, too, so the correct explanation was that both the continents and the magnetic poles move.

==Lesson Summary==
* In the early part of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, scientists began to put together evidence that the continents could move around on Earth's surface.
* The evidence for continental drift included the fit of the continents; the distribution of ancient fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges; and the locations of ancient climatic zones.
* Although the evidence was extremely strong, scientists could not think of a mechanism that could drive solid continents to move around on the solid earth and most rejected the idea.
* Continental drift would resurface after World War II when a mechanism was discovered.

==Review Questions==
# Why can paper cutouts of the continents including the continental margins be pieced together to form a single whole?
# How can the locations where ancient fossils are found be used as evidence for continental drift?
# To show that mountain ranges on opposite sides of the Atlantic formed as two parts of the same range and were once joined, what would you look for?
# What are the three possible explanations for apparent polar wander when the rocks are all on one continent? If the rocks are on more than one continent, which explanation is the only one likely to be true and why?
# In the face of so much evidence in support of continental drift, how could scientists reject the idea?
# Look at a world map. Besides the coast of west Africa and eastern South America, what are some other regions of the world that look as they could be closely fit together?

Perhaps surprisingly, it was World War II that gave scientists the tools to find the mechanism for continental drift that had eluded Wegener and his colleagues. Scientists used maps and other data gathered during the war to develop the seafloor spreading hypothesis. This hypothesis traces oceanic crust from its origin at a mid-ocean ridge to its destruction at a deep sea '''trench'''. Scientists realized that seafloor spreading could be the mechanism for continental drift that they had been looking for.

==Lesson Objectives==
* List the main features of the seafloor: mid-ocean ridges, deep sea trenches, and abyssal plains.
* Describe what seafloor magnetism tells scientists about the seafloor.
* Describe the process of seafloor spreading.

==Seafloor Bathymetry==
During the war, battleships and submarines carried '''echo sounders''' to locate enemy submarines (Figure 6.8). Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions, bounce off the nearest object, and then return to the ship. The round-trip time of the sound wave is then recorded. By knowing the speed of sound in seawater, scientists can calculate the distance to the object that the sound wave hit. During the war, the sound wave rarely encountered an enemy submarine, and so most of the sound waves ricocheted off the ocean bottom.

[[File:Echo Sounding USN.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.8''': A ship sends out sound waves to create a picture of the seafloor below it. The echo sounder pictured has many beams and as a result it creates a three dimensional map of the seafloor beneath the ship. Early echo sounders had only a single beam and created a line of depth measurements.]]

After the war, scientists pieced together the bottom depths to produce a a map of the seafloor. This is known as a '''bathymetric map''' and is similar to a topographic map of the land surface. While a bathymetric map measures the distance of the seafloor below sea level, a topographic map gives the elevation of the land surface above sea level. Bathymetric maps reveal the features of the ocean floor as if the water were taken away.

The bathymetric maps that were produced at this time were astonishing! Most people had thought that the ocean floor was completely flat but the maps showed something completely different. As we know now, majestic mountain ranges extend in a line through the deep oceans. Amazingly, the mountain ranges are connected as if they were the seams on a baseball. These mountain ranges are named mid-ocean ridges. The '''mid-ocean ridges''' and the areas around them rise up high above the deep seafloor (Figure 6.9).

[[File:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|center|thumb|500px|'''Figure 6.9''': A modern map of the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Darker blue indicates deeper seas. A mid-ocean ridge can be seen running through the center of the Atlantic Ocean. Deep sea trenches are found along the west coast of Central and South America and in the mid-Atlantic east of the southern tip of South America. Isolated mountains and flat featureless regions can also be spotted.]]

Another astonishing feature is the deep sea trenches that are found at the edges of continental margins or in the sea near chains of active volcanoes. Trenches are the deepest places on Earth. The deepest trench is the Marianas Trench in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, which plunges about 11 kilometers 35,840 feet (35,840 feet) beneath sea level. Near the trenches, the seafloor is also especially deep.

Besides these dramatic features, there are lots of flat areas, called '''abyssal plains''', just as the scientists had predicted. But many of these plains are dotted with volcanic mountains. These mountains are both large and small, pointy and flat-topped, by themselves as well as in a line. When they first observed the maps, the amazing differences made scientists wonder what had formed these features.

==Seafloor Magnetism==
In the previous lesson, you learned that magnetometers used on land were important in recognizing apparent polar wander. Magnetometers were also important in understanding the magnetic polarity of rocks in the deep sea. During WWII, magnetometers that were attached to ships to search for submarines discovered a lot about the magnetic properties of the seafloor.

In fact, using magnetometers, scientists discovered an astonishing feature of Earth's magnetic field. Sometimes, no one really knows why, the magnetic poles switch positions. North becomes south and south becomes north! When the north and south poles are aligned as they are now, geologists say the polarity is normal. When they are in the opposite position, they say that the polarity is reversed.

[[File:Oceanic.Stripe.Magnetic.Anomalies.Scheme.gif|right|frame|'''Figure 6.10''': Scientists found that magnetic polarity in the seafloor was normal at mid-ocean ridges but reversed in symmetrical patterns away from the ridge center. This normal and reversed pattern continues across the seafloor.]]

Scientists were surprised to discover that the normal and reversed magnetic polarity of seafloor basalts creates a pattern of magnetic stripes! There is one long stripe with normal polarity, next to one long stripe with reversed polarity and so on across the ocean bottom. Another amazing feature is that the stripes are form mirror images on either side of the mid-ocean ridges. The ridge crest is of normal polarity and there are two stripes of reversed polarity of roughly equal width on each side of the ridge. Further distant are roughly equal stripes of normal polarity, beyond that, roughly equal stripes of reversed polarity, and so on. The magnetic polarity maps also show that the magnetic stripes end abruptly at the edges of continents, which are sometimes lined by a deep sea trench (Figure 6.10).

The scientists used geologic dating techniques to find the ages of the rocks that were found with the different magnetic polarities. It turns out that the rocks of normal polarity are located along the axis of the mid-ocean ridges and these are the youngest rocks on the seafloor. The ages of the rocks increases equally and symmetrically on both sides of the ridge.

Scientists also discovered that there are virtually no sediments on the seafloor at the axis, but the sediment layer increases in thickness in both directions away from the ridge axis. This was additional evidence that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis and that the rocks are older with distance away from the ridge (Figure 6.11). The scientists were surprised to find that oldest seafloor is less than 180 million years old while the oldest continental crust is around 4 billion years old. They realized that some process was causing seafloor to be
created and destroyed in a relatively short time.

[[File:Earth seafloor crust age 1996.gif|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 6.11''': Seafloor is youngest near the mid-ocean ridges and gets progressively older with distance from the ridge. Orange areas show the youngest seafloor. The oldest seafloor is near the edges of continents or deep sea trenches.]]
{{clear}}
The scientists also discovered that the seafloor was thinner at the ridge axis and grew thicker as the crust became older. This is because over time, additional magma cools to form rock. The added sediments also increase the thickness of the older crust.

==The Seafloor Spreading Hypothesis==
Scientists brought all of these observations together in the early 1960s to create the '''seafloor spreading''' hypothesis. They suggested that hot mantle material rises up toward the surface at mid-ocean ridges. This hot material is buoyant and causes the ridge to rise, which is one reason that mid-ocean ridges are higher than the rest of the seafloor.

The hot magma at the ridge erupts as lava that forms new seafloor. When the lava cools, its magnetite crystals take on the current magnetic polarity. The polarity is locked in when the lava solidifies and the magnetite crystals are trapped in position. Reversals show up as magnetic stripes on opposite sides of the ridge axis. As more lava erupts, it pushes the seafloor that is at the ridge horizontally away from ridge axis. This continues as the formation of new seafloor forces older seafloor to move horizontally away from the ridge axis.

The magnetic stripes continue across the seafloor. If the oceanic crust butts up against a continent, it pushes that continent away from the ridge axis as well. If the oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, it will sink into it and be lost into the mantle. In either case, the oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest in the ocean.

It is the creation and destruction of oceanic crust, then, that is the mechanism for Wegener's drifting continents. Rather than drifting across the oceans, the continents ride on a conveyor belt of oceanic crust that takes them around the planet’s surface.

One of the fundamental lines of evidence for continental drift is the way the coastlines of continents on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean fit together. So let’s look at how seafloor spreading moves continents in the Atlantic by looking more closely at figure 3 above. New oceanic crust is forming at the mid-ocean ridge that runs through the center of the Atlantic Ocean basins, which is called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Stripes of different magnetic polarity are found on opposite sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These stripes go all the way to the continents, which lie on opposite sides of the Atlantic. So new seafloor forming at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is causing the Americas and Eurasia to move in opposite directions!

==Lesson Summary==
* Using technologies developed to fight World War II, scientists were able to gather data that allowed them to recognize that seafloor spreading is the mechanism for Wegener's drifting continents.
* Bathymetric maps revealed high mountain ranges and deep trenches.
* Magnetic polarity stripes give clues as to seafloor ages and the importance of mid-ocean ridges in the creation of oceanic crust.
* Seafloor spreading processes create new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges and destroy older crust at deep sea trenches.

==Review Questions==
# Describe how sound waves are used to develop a map of the features of the seafloor.
# Why has no ocean crust been located that is older than about 180 million years when the oldest continental crust is about 4 billion years old?
# Describe the major features of mid-ocean ridges, deep sea trenches, and abyssal plains and their relative ages.
# Describe continents move across the ocean basins as if they are on a conveyor belt rather than as if they are drifting, as we Wegner's original idea.
# Explain why the following scenario is impossible: Oceanic crust is not destroyed at oceanic trenches, but new crust is still created at mid-ocean ridges.
# If you were a paleontologist who studies fossils of very ancient life forms, where would be the best place to look for very old fossils: on land or in the oceans?
# Imagine that Earth's magnetic field was fixed in place and the polarity didn’t reverse. What effect would this have on our observations of seafloor basalts?

==Points to Consider==
* How were the technologies that were developed to fight World War II used by scientists for the development of the seafloor spreading hypothesis?
* In what two ways did magnetic data lead scientists to understand more about continental drift and plate tectonics?
* How does seafloor spreading provide a mechanism for continental drift?
* The features of the Atlantic Ocean basin are described in terms of seafloor spreading and continental drift. Now look at the features of the North Pacific Ocean basin and explain them in those terms as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
Wegener's continental drift hypothesis had a great deal of evidence in its favor but it was largely abandoned because his theory on how the continents moved was disproved. In the meantime, scientists developed explanations to explain the locations of fossils on widely different continents (land bridges) and the similarity of rock sequences across oceans (geosynclines), which were becoming more and more cumbersome. When seafloor spreading came along, scientists recognized that the mechanism to explain drifting continents had been found. Like the scientists did before us, we are now ready to merge the ideas of continental drift and seafloor spreading into a new all-encompassing idea: the theory of plate tectonics.

==Lesson Objectives==
* Describe what a plate is and how scientists can recognize its edges.
* Explain how mantle convection moves lithospheric plates.
* Describe the three types of plate boundaries and whether they are prone to earthquakes and volcanoes.
* Describe how plate tectonics processes lead to changes in Earth's surface features.

==Earth's Tectonic Plates==
Now you know that seafloor and continents move around on Earth's surface. But what is it that is actually moving? In other words, what is the &quot;plate&quot; in plate tectonics? This question was also answered due to war, in this case the Cold War.

Although seismographs had been around for decades, during the 1950s and especially in the early 1960s, scientists set up seismograph networks to see if enemy nations were testing atomic bombs. Seismographs record seismic waves. Modern seismographs are sensitive enough to detect nuclear explosions. While watching for enemy atom bomb tests, the seismographs were also recording all of the earthquakes that were taking place around the planet. These seismic records could be used to locate an earthquake's '''epicenter''', the point on Earth's surface directly above the place where the earthquake occurs. Earthquakes are associated with large cracks in the ground, known as '''faults'''. Rocks on opposite sides of a fault move in opposite directions.

Earthquakes are not spread evenly around the planet, but are found mostly in certain regions. In the oceans, earthquakes are found along mid-ocean ridges and in and around deep sea trenches. Earthquakes are extremely common all around the Pacific Ocean basin and often occur near volcanoes. The intensity of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions around the Pacific led scientists to name this region the Pacific Ring of Fire (Figure 6.12). Earthquakes are also common in the world's highest mountains, the Himalaya Mountains of Asia, and across the Mediterranean region.

[[File:Pacific Ring of Fire.png|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 6.12''': The bold pink swatch outlines the volcanoes and active earthquake areas found around the Pacific Ocean basin, which is called the Pacific Ring of Fire.]]

Scientists noticed that the earthquake epicenters were located along the mid-ocean ridges, trenches and large faults that mark the edges of large slabs of Earth's lithosphere (Figure 6.13). They named these large slabs of lithosphere '''plates'''. The movements of the plates were then termed plate tectonics. A single plate can be made of all oceanic lithosphere or all continental lithosphere, but nearly all plates are made of a combination of both.

[[File:Quake epicenters 1963-98.png|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 6.13''': A map of earthquake epicenters shows that earthquakes are found primarily in lines that run up the edges of some continents, through the centers of some oceans, and in patches in some land areas.]]

The lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates. The plates' edges can be drawn by the connecting the dots that are earthquakes epicenters. Scientists have named each of the plates and have determined the direction that each is moving (Figure 6.14). Plates move around the Earth's surface at a rate of a few centimeters a year, about the same rate fingernails grow.

[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|600px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.14''': The lithospheric plates and their names. The arrows show whether the plates are moving apart, moving together, or sliding past each other.]]

==How Plates Move==
We know that seafloor spreading moves the lithospheric plates around on Earth's surface but what drives seafloor spreading? The answer is in lesson one of this chapter: mantle convection. At this point it would help to think of a convection cell as a rectangle or oval. Each side of the rectangle is a limb of the cell. The convection cell is located in the mantle. The base is deep in the mantle and the top is near the crust. There is a limb of mantle material moving on one side of the rectangle, one limb moving horizontally across the top of the rectangle, one limb moving downward on the other side of the rectangle, and the final limb moving horizontally to where the material begins to move upward again.

Now picture two convection cells side-by-side in the mantle. The rising limbs of material from the two adjacent cells reach the base of the crust at the mid-ocean ridge. Some of the hot magma melts and creates new ocean crust. This seafloor moves off the axis of the mid-ocean ridge in both directions when still newer seafloor erupts. The oceanic plate moves outward due to the eruption of new oceanic crust at the mid-ocean ridge.

Beneath the moving crust is the laterally moving top limb of the mantle convection cells. Each convection cell is moving seafloor away from the ridge in opposite directions. This horizontal mantle flow moves with the crust across the ocean basin and away from the ridge. As the material moves horizontally, the seafloor thickens and both the new crust and the mantle beneath it cool. Where the limbs of the convection cells plunge down into the deeper mantle, oceanic crust is dragged into the mantle as well. This takes place at the deep sea trenches. As the crust dives into the mantle its weight drags along the rest of the plate and pulls it downward. The last limbs of the convection cells flow along the core. The material is heated and so is ready to rise again when it reaches the rising limb of the convection cell. As you can see, each convection cell is found beneath a different lithospheric plate and is responsible for the movement of that plate.

==Plate Boundaries==
Back at the planet's surface, the edges where two plates meet are known as '''plate boundaries'''. Most geologic activity, including volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building, takes place at plate boundaries where two enormous pieces of solid lithosphere interact.

Think about two cars moving around a parking lot. In what three ways can those cars move relative to each other? They can move away from each other, they can move toward each other, or they can slide past each other. These three types of relative motion also define the three types of plate boundaries:
* '''Divergent plate boundaries''': the two plates move away from each other.
* '''Convergent plate boundaries''': the two plates move towards each other.
* '''Transform plate boundaries''': the two plates slip past each other.

What happens at plate boundaries depends on which direction the two plates are moving relative to each other. It also depends on whether the lithosphere on the two sides of the plate boundary is oceanic crust, continental crust, or one piece of each type. The type of plate boundary and the type of crust found on each side of the boundary determines what sort of geologic activity will be found there: earthquakes, volcanoes, or mountain building.

===Divergent Plate Boundaries===
Plates move apart, or diverge, at mid-ocean ridges where seafloor spreading forms new oceanic lithosphere. At these mid-ocean ridges, lava rises, erupts, and cools. Magma cools more slowly beneath the lava mostly forming the igneous intrusive rock gabbro. The entire ridge system, then, is igneous. Earthquakes are also common at mid-ocean ridges since the movement of magma and oceanic crust result in crustal shaking. Although the vast majority of mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea, we can see where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge surfaces at the volcanic island of Iceland (Figure 6.15).

[[File:Bridge across continents iceland.jpg|center|500px|thumb|'''Figure 6.15''': The Leif the Lucky Bridge straddles the Mid-Atlantic ridge separating the North American and Eurasian plates on Iceland.]]

[[File:Greatrift.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 6.16''': The Arabian, Indian, and African plates are rifting apart, forming the Great Rift Valley in Africa. The Dead Sea fills the rift with seawater.]]

Although it is uncommon, a divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent. This is called '''continental rifting''' (Figure 6.16). Magma rises beneath the continent, causing it to thin, break, and ultimately split up. As the continental crust breaks apart, oceanic crust erupts in the void. This is how the Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up. The East African Rift is currently splitting eastern Africa away from the African continent.

===Convergent Plate Boundaries===
[[File:Peru-Chile trench.jpg|right|250px|thumb|'''Figure 6.18''': This digital elevation model topographic map shows the trench lining the western margin of South America where the Nazca plate is subducting beneath the South American plate. The resulting Andes Mountains line western South America and are seen as brown and red uplands in this image.]]

What happens when two plates converge depends on the types of crust that are colliding. Convergence can take place between two slabs of continental lithosphere, two slabs of oceanic lithosphere, or between one continental and one oceanic slab. Most often, when two plates collide, one or both are destroyed.

When oceanic crust converges with continental crust, the denser oceanic plate plunges beneath the continental plate. This process occurs at the oceanic trenches and is called '''subduction''' (Figure 6.17). The entire region is known as a '''subduction zone'''. Subduction zones have a lot of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The subducting plate causes melting in the mantle. The magma rises and erupts, creating volcanoes. These volcanoes are found in a line above the subducting plate. The volcanoes are known as a '''continental arc'''. The movement of crust and magma causes earthquakes. The Andes Mountains, which line the western edge of South America, are a continental arc. The volcanoes are the result of the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South American plate (Figure 6.18).

[[File:Active Margin.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.17''': Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate forms a line of volcanoes known as a continental arc and causes earthquakes.]]

The volcanoes of northeastern California&amp;mdash;Lassen Peak, Mount Shasta, and Medicine Lake volcano&amp;mdash;along with the rest of the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate (Figure 6.19). Mount St. Helens, which erupted explosively on May 18, 1980, is the most famous and currently the most active of the Cascades volcanoes.

[[File:Cascade Range related plate tectonics-en.svg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.19''': The Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest are formed by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate. The Juan de Fuca plate forms near the shoreline at the Juan de Fuca ridge.]]

Sometimes the magma does not rise all the way through the continental crust beneath a volcanic arc. This usually happens if the magma is rich in silica. These viscous magmas form large areas of intrusive igneous rock, called '''batholiths''', which may someday be uplifted to form a mountain range. The Sierra Nevada batholith cooled beneath a volcanic arc roughly 200 million years ago (Figure 6.20). Similar batholiths are likely forming beneath the Andes and Cascades today.

[[File:Mount Whitney 2003-03-25.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.20''': The granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range is well exposed here at Mount Whitney, the highest mountain in the range at 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) and the second highest mountain in North America.]]

[[File:Oceanic-oceanic convergence Fig21oceanocean.gif|right|frame|'''Figure 6.21''': A convergent plate boundary subduction zone between two plates of oceanic lithosphere. Melting of the subducting plate causes volcanic activity and earthquakes.]]

When two oceanic plates converge, the older, denser plate will sink beneath the other plate and plunge into the mantle. As the plate is pushed deeper into the mantle, it melts, which forms magma. As the magma rises it forms volcanoes in a line known as an '''island arc''', which is a line of volcanic islands (Figure 6.21).

The Japanese, Indonesian, and Philippine islands are examples of island arc volcanoes. The volcanic islands are set off from the mainland in an arc shape as seen in this satellite image of Japan (Figure 6.22).

[[File:Satellite image of Japan in May 2003.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.22''': Japan is an island arc composed of volcanoes off the Asian mainland, as seen in this satellite image.]]

[[File:Continental-continental convergence Fig21contcont.gif|right|frame|'''Figure 6.23''': When two plates of continental crust collide, the material pushes upward forming a high mountain range. The remnants of subducted oceanic crust remain beneath the continental convergence zone.]]

When two continental plates collide, they are too thick to subduct. Just like if you put your hands on two sides of a sheet of paper and bring your hands together, the material has nowhere to go but up (Figure 6.23)! Some of the world's largest mountains ranges are created at continent-continent convergent plate boundaries. In these locations, the crust is too thick for magma to penetrate so there are no volcanoes, but there may be magma. Metamorphic rocks are common due to the stress the continental crust experiences. As you might think, with enormous slabs of crust smashing together, continent-continent collisions bring on numerous earthquakes.

The world's highest mountains, the Himalayas, are being created by a collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates (Figure 6.24). The Appalachian Mountains are the remnants of a large mountain range that was created when North America rammed into Eurasia about 250 million years ago.

[[File:Himalayas.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.24''': The Himalaya Mountains are the result of the collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate, seen in this photo from the International Space Station. The high peak in the center is world's tallest mountain, Mount Everest (8,848 meters; 29,035 feet).]]

===Transform Plate Boundaries===
[[File:Sanandreas.jpg|right|frame|'''Figure 6.25''': At the San Andreas Fault in California, the Pacific Plate is sliding northeast relative to the North  American plate, which is moving southwest. At the northern end of the picture, the transform boundary turns into a subduction zone.]]

Transform plate boundaries are seen as '''transform faults'''. At these earthquake faults, two plates move past each other in opposite directions. Where transform faults bisect continents, there are massive earthquakes. The world's most notorious transform fault is the 1,300 kilometer (800 mile) long San Andreas Fault in California (Figure 6.25). This is where the Pacific and North American plates grind past each other, sometimes with disastrous consequences.

California is very geologically active. A transform plate boundary creates the San Andreas Fault. A convergent plate boundary between an oceanic plate and a continental plate creates the Cascades volcanoes. Just offshore, the Juan de Fuca ridge is subducting beneath the North American plate at a divergent plate boundary.

==Earth's Changing Surface==
Geologists now know that Wegener was right when he said that the continents had once been joined into the supercontinent Pangaea and are now moving apart. Most of the geologic activity that we see on the planet today is due to the interactions of the moving plates. Where plates come apart at a divergent boundary, there is volcanic activity and small earthquakes. If the plates meet at a convergent boundary, and at least one is oceanic, there is a chain of volcanoes and many earthquakes. If both plates at a convergent boundary are continental, mountain ranges grow. If the plates meet at a transform boundary, there is a transform fault. These faults do not have volcanic activity but they have massive earthquakes.

If you look at a map showing the locations of volcanoes and earthquakes in North America, you will see that the plate boundaries are now along the western edge. This geologically active area makes up part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. California, with its volcanoes and earthquakes, is an important part of this region. The eastern edge of North America is currently mostly quiet, although mountain ranges line the area. If there is no plate boundary there today, where did those mountains come from?

Remember that Wegener used the similarity of the mountains in eastern North America, on the west side of the Atlantic, and the mountains in Great Britain, on the eastern side of the Atlantic, as evidence for his continental drift hypothesis. These mountains were formed at a convergent plate boundary as the continents that made up Pangaea came together. So about 200 million years ago these mountains were similar to the Himalaya today (Figure 6.26)!

[[File:Appalachians NC BLRI9242.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.26''': The Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America were probably once as high as the Himalaya, but they have aged since the breakup of Pangaea.]]

Before the continents collided they were separated by an ocean, just as the continents rimming the Pacific are now. That ocean crust had to subduct beneath the continents just as the oceanic crust around the Pacific is being subducted today. Subduction along the eastern margin of North America produced continental arc volcanoes. Ancient lava from those volcanoes can be found in the region.

Currently, Earth's most geologically active area is around the Pacific. The Pacific is shrinking at the same time the Atlantic is growing. But hundreds of millions of years ago, that was reversed: the Atlantic was shrinking as the Pacific was growing. What we’ve just identified is a cycle, known as the '''supercontinent cycle''', which is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see and many more that are long gone. Scientists think that the creation and breakup of a supercontinent takes place about every 500 million years.

==Intraplate Activity==
While it is true that most geological activity takes place along plate boundaries, some is found away from the edges of plates. This is known as '''intraplate activity'''. The most common intraplate volcanoes are above hotspots that lie beneath oceanic plates. Hotspot volcanoes arise because plumes of hot material that come from deep in the mantle rise through the overlying mantle and crust. When the magma reaches the plate above, it erupts, forming a volcano. Since the hotspot is stable, when the oceanic plate moves over it, and it erupts again, another volcano is created in line with the first. With time, there is a line of volcanoes; the youngest is directly above the hot spot and the oldest is furthest away. Recent research suggests that hotspots are not as stable as scientists once thought, but some larger ones still appear to be.

The Hawaiian Islands are a beautiful example of a chain of hotspot volcanoes. Kilauea volcano on the south side of the Big Island of Hawaii lies above the Hawaiian hot spot. The Big Island is on the southeastern end of the Hawaiian chain. Mauna Loa volcano, to the northwest, is older than Kilauea and is still erupting, but at a lower rate. Hawaii is the youngest island in the chain. As you follow the chain to the west, the islands get progressively older because they are further from the hotspot (Figure 6.27).

[[File:Hawaii hotspot poster.jpg|center|frame|This view of the Hawaiian islands showing the youngest islands in the southeast and the oldest in the northwest. Kilauea volcano, which makes up the southeastern side of the Big Island of Hawaiian, is located above the Hawaiian hotspot.]]

The chain continues into the Emperor Seamounts, which are so old they no longer reach above sea level. The oldest of the Emperor seamounts is about to subduct into the Aleutian trench off of Alaska; no one knows how many older volcanoes have already subducted. It's obvious from looking at the Emperor seamounts that the Pacific plate took a large turn. Radiometric dating has shown that turn to have taken place about 43 million years ago (Figure 6.28). The Hawaii hotspot may also have been moving southward during this time. Still, geologists can use some hotspot chains to tell not only the direction but the speed a plate is moving.

[[File:Pacific elevation.jpg|500px|center|thumb|'''Figure 6.28''': The Hawaii-Emperor chain creates a large angular gash across the Pacific basin in this satellite image. The bend in the chain is due to a change in the direction of motion of the Pacific plate 43 million years ago.]]

Hot spots are also found under the continental crust, although it is more difficult for the magma to make it through the thick crust and there are few eruptions. One exception is Yellowstone, which creates the activity at the Yellowstone hotspot. In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions, but now its activity is best seen in the region's famous geysers.

==Lesson Summary==
* Driven by mantle convection, the plates of lithosphere move around Earth’s surface. New oceanic crust forms at the ridge and pushes the older seafloor away from the ridge horizontally.
* Plates interact at three different types of plate boundaries, divergent, convergent and transform fault boundaries, which are where most of the Earth’s geologic activity takes place.
* These processes acting over long periods of time are responsible for the geographic features we see.

We will compute the derivative and show that it is always &lt;math&gt;g'(x) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. The derivative of &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the quotient rule to be
&lt;math&gt;g'(x)=\frac{xf'(x)-f(x)}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
The denominator is clearly always positive as we know it is the square of some real number &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so in order to show that the entire derivative is always positive we need to show that the numerator is positive.

However, 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{x}\leq f'(x) \Leftrightarrow xf'(x)-f(x) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and we know that, by the mean value theorem there is some &lt;math&gt;c \in (0,x)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{x}=f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;f(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing it must be that &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \geq \frac{f(x)}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;xf'(x)-f(x) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and so the derivative of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is positive, which implies that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing.



==11== 

Since the denominator of 
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2 f(x)}{h^2}&lt;/math&gt;
goes to zero as &lt;math&gt;h \to 0&lt;/math&gt; we can employ L'Hopital's rule. Using this we get  
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2 f(x)}{h^2} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x-h)}{2 h}&lt;/math&gt;
Since the denominator is again zero we apply L'Hopital's rule again
&lt;math&gt; = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f''(x+h)+f''(x-h)}{2 }&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; = f''(x) &lt;/math&gt;


An example of a function that is not differentiable, but where this limit exists is 
&lt;math&gt; f(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} 0 &amp; x \leq 0 \\ x^2  &amp; x &gt; 0 \end{array} \right. &lt;/math&gt;
The second derivative of this function does not exist at zero, as 
&lt;math&gt; f'(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} 0 &amp; x \leq 0 \\ 2x  &amp; x &gt; 0 \end{array} \right. &lt;/math&gt;
however we can compute the above limit at zero by
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)+f(x-h)-2 f(x)}{h^2}=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{h^2}{h^2}=1&lt;/math&gt;

==14==

A function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be convex if
&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda  + (1- \lambda) y ) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y) &lt;/math&gt;

First we shall prove (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) that &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; monotonically increasing implies &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex.


Assume &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing. Let &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y &lt; z&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;. The mean value theorem implies that &lt;math&gt;\exists c \in (x,y)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(c)=\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly &lt;math&gt;\exists d \in (y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f'(d)=\frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, since &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be monotonically increasing we have 
&lt;math&gt;f'(c) \leq f'(d) \Rightarrow \frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}&lt;/math&gt;
Because &lt;math&gt;y\in(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt;y=\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)z&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, we have
&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{f(\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)z)-f(x)}{\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)z-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(\lambda x+ (1-\lambda)z)}{z-\lambda x- (1-\lambda)z}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{f(\lambda x+ z - z \lambda)-f(x)}{\lambda x+ z-\lambda z-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z - \lambda z)}{z-\lambda x - z + \lambda z}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{f(\lambda x+ z - z \lambda)-f(x)}{\lambda x+ z-\lambda z-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z - \lambda z)}{-\lambda x  + \lambda z}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda (z-x)  \left( f(\lambda x+ z - z \lambda)-f(x) \right) \leq \left( f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z - \lambda z)  \right) \left( 1 -\lambda \right) \left(  z - x  \right)&lt;/math&gt;
We note here that the direction of the inequality is preserved since we have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-\lambda &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (*)
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  \left( f(\lambda x+ z - z \lambda)-f(x) \right) \leq \left( f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z - \lambda z)  \right) \left( 1 -\lambda \right) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  \left( f(\lambda x+ z(1 -  \lambda))-f(x) \right) \leq \left( f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda ))  \right) \left( 1 -\lambda \right) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  f(\lambda x+ z(1 -  \lambda))- \lambda  f(x)  \leq f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda ))  -\lambda f(z)+ \lambda f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda ))  &lt;/math&gt;
reducing yields
&lt;math&gt; - \lambda  f(x)  \leq f(z)-f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda ))  -\lambda f(z)   &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow - \lambda  f(x) -f(z) + \lambda f(z)   \leq -f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  f(x) + f(z) - \lambda f(z)  \geq f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow  \lambda  f(x) + f(z)(1 - \lambda )  \geq f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
but since the initial choice of &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt; was arbitrary (up to ordering) this holds for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;z&lt;/math&gt;. We must still address the case corresponding to &lt;math&gt;x&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. This is easy though.

For let &lt;math&gt;x&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. Then by what we have proven already
&lt;math&gt; \lambda  f(z) + f(x)(1 - \lambda )  \geq f(\lambda z+ x(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
now let &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1-\lambda&lt;/math&gt; so it follows from the above that
&lt;math&gt; ( 1-\alpha)  f(z) + f(x)(1 - 1+ \alpha )  \geq f((1-\alpha )z+ x(1  - 1+\alpha )) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow ( 1-\alpha)  f(z) + \alpha f(x)  \geq f((1-\alpha )z+ \alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;

Thus if &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing
&lt;math&gt;\lambda  f(x) + f(z)(1 - \lambda )  \geq f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;

Now we prove (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) that  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; convex implies &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing.


The proof of this direction follows similarly to the previous. Let's assume &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex.

Then
&lt;math&gt; \lambda  f(x) + f(z)(1 - \lambda )  \geq f(\lambda x+ z(1  - \lambda )) &lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt; x&lt;z&lt;/math&gt; (Note: we must have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;z&lt;/math&gt; by (*)) and &lt;math&gt;x,z \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Following the previous reasoning in reverse we see that
&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;\forall y \in (x,z)&lt;/math&gt;. 

So in the limit &lt;math&gt;y \to x&lt;/math&gt; we have 
&lt;math&gt; f'(x) \leq \frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x}&lt;/math&gt; 
and in the limit &lt;math&gt;y \to z&lt;/math&gt; we have 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x} \leq f'(z) &lt;/math&gt;
thus, combining these statements we have
&lt;math&gt; f'(x) \leq \frac{f(z)-f(x)}{z-x}  \leq f'(z) &lt;/math&gt;
so &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing as desired.

Now it only remains to prove that (assuming &lt;math&gt;f''(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists for &lt;math&gt;x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex if and only if &lt;math&gt;f''(x) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing by the previous proof. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f''\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; (proved in class).

So we have shown that (assuming &lt;math&gt;f''(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists for &lt;math&gt;x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex if and only if &lt;math&gt;f''(x) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; as desired.

By page 121 we know that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must be bounded, say by &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. We need to show that given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can find some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int_c^1 f(x) dx \in B_\epsilon \left( \int_0^1 f(x) dx \right).&lt;/math&gt;So, by Theorem 6.12 (c) we have &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \int_0^c f(x) dx + \int_c^1 f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_0^c f(x) dx \leq M \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(x) dx \leq M \cdot c + \int_c^1 f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; but since we can choose any &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is fixed we can choose &lt;math&gt;c = \frac{\epsilon}{2M}&lt;/math&gt; which yields &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(x) dx \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2}+ \int_c^1 f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; So, given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; we can always choose a &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int_c^1 f(x) dx \in B_\epsilon \left( \int_0^1 f(x) dx \right)&lt;/math&gt; as desired.

Considered the function which is defined to be &lt;math&gt;n (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; on the last &lt;math&gt;6/(n^2\pi^2)&lt;/math&gt; of the interval [0,1] and zero at those &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x=6/(n^2\pi^2)&lt;/math&gt;. This function is well defined, since we know that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty 6/(n^2\pi^2) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. 

More specifically the function has value &lt;math&gt;n(-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; on the open interval from &lt;math&gt;(p_n=1-\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} 6/(m^2\pi^2),p_{n+1}=1-\sum_{m=1}^n 6/(m^2\pi^2))&lt;/math&gt;

First we evaluate the integral of the function itself. Consider a partitioning of the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; at each &lt;math&gt;p_n \pm \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the lower and upper sums corresponding to the intervals of the partition from &lt;math&gt;p_n - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p_{n+1} + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; are the same, since the function is constant valued on these intervals. Moreover, as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \to 0&lt;/math&gt; the value of the upper and lower sums both approach &lt;math&gt;n (-1)^n(p_{n+1}-p_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus we can express the value of the integral as the sum of the series
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)n (-1)^n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{(-1)^n 6}{n\pi^2}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; =\frac{6}{\pi^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{(-1)^n }{n}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;
but we recognize this sum as just a constant multiple of the alternating harmonic series. Hence, the integral converges.

Now we examine the integral of the absolute value of the function. We argue similarly to the above, again partitioning the function at &lt;math&gt;p_n\pm \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; as defined above. The difference is that now, as we let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \to 0&lt;/math&gt; the upper and lower sums both go to 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)n  = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{ 6}{n\pi^2}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;  = \frac{6}{\pi^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty  \frac{ 1}{n} &lt;/math&gt;
and so the integral does not exist, as this is the harmonic series, which does not converge.

In the above proof of divergence the important point is that the lower sums diverge. The fact that the upper sums diverge is an immediate consequence of this.

So, we have demonstrated a function whose integral converges, but does not converge absolutely as desired.

==8==

We begin by showing (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;math&gt;) that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; converges if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; converges.

So, we assume to start that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; converges. Now consider the partition &lt;math&gt;P=\{p_n\ |\ p_n=n, n \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; decreases monotonically it must be that &lt;math&gt;inf\{f([p_n,p_{n+1}])\}=f(p_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; and similarly that &lt;math&gt;sup\{f([p_n,p_{n+1}])\}=f(p_{n})&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the integral which we are trying to evaluate is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; and below by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now we observe that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; may be written as a sum over the domain as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \int_{p_n}^{p_{n+1}} f(x) dx \right)&lt;/math&gt; We know moreover that each of these integrals exist, by Theorem 6.9. Also, since &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is always positive each such integral must be positive. Therefore, the integral may be expressed as a sum of a nonnegative series which is bounded above. Hence, by Theorem 3.24 the integral exists.

Now we prove (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) that if &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; converges then  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; converges.

So assume now that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; converges. Then we can prove that the summation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the Cauchy criterion. We established above &lt;math&gt;\int_k^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; is bounded above by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=k}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; and below by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=K+1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that given a sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=K+1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt; it is bounded above by the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_k^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, since the integral  &lt;math&gt;\int_k^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; exists and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is nonegative we know that it has the property given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0\  \exists M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int_M^\infty f(x) dx&lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. For otherwise the integral would not exist and instead tend to infinity.

So now we can apply the Cauchy criterion for series. Since an upper bound of the series has the property that given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0\  \exists M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_M^\infty f(x) &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. So must the series itself have this property.

Thus, the sum converges as desired.

We will prove that If  &lt;math&gt;u\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; then 
&lt;math&gt;uv \leq \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;
and that equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt;u^p=v^q&lt;/math&gt;
\begin{proof}
We begin by proving the special case of equality

Assume that &lt;math&gt;u^p=v^q&lt;/math&gt;. 
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow u=v^{q/p}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow vu=v^{q/p+1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow vu=v^{q/p+1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow vu =v^{q(1/p+1/q)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow vu=v^q&lt;/math&gt;
(Similarly we can show that &lt;math&gt;vu=u^p \Leftrightarrow u^p=v^q &lt;/math&gt;.)
Thus, &lt;math&gt;vu=v^q \Leftrightarrow u^p=v^q &lt;/math&gt; and we see moreover that 
&lt;math&gt;uv = \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q} \Leftarrow vu=v^q&lt;/math&gt;
since in this case we have 
&lt;math&gt;uv = v^q \left( \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q} \right) \checkmark &lt;/math&gt;
Also, if it is not the case that &lt;math&gt;vu=v^q&lt;/math&gt; then it is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;uv \neq \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt; as for a sum of quotients by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; to not contain &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; we must have the numerators equal.


Now we show that as we vary &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; we must always have &lt;math&gt;uv \leq \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;. For, compute the derivative of &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and the derivative of &lt;math&gt;\frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. We get &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u^{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. If we have &lt;math&gt;u^p=v^q&lt;/math&gt; then these are equal as demonstrated above (we showed that &lt;math&gt;u v = u^p&lt;/math&gt; in that case). In the case that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is larger than this value then &lt;math&gt;u^{p-1}&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and in the case that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is less than this value then &lt;math&gt;u^{p-1}&lt;v&lt;/math&gt;. 

This argument can be repeated in an analogous manner for variations in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and given any &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; we can find values for which &lt;math&gt;u^p=v^q&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, we observe that 
&lt;math&gt;uv \leq \frac{u^p}{p}+\frac{v^q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;
as desired\end{proof}

If &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g \in \mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f\geq0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f^p d\alpha = 1 = \int_a^b g^q d\alpha, &lt;/math&gt;
then
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f g d\alpha \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;
\begin{proof}

If &lt;math&gt;0 \leq f \in \mathcal{R} (\alpha) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \leq g \in \mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f^p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g^q&lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; by Theorem 6.11. Also, we have &lt;math&gt;f g \in \mathcal{R}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; so we get
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f g d\alpha \leq \frac{1}{p} \int_a^b f^p d \alpha + \frac{1}{q} \int_a^b g^q d\alpha = 1&lt;/math&gt;
as desired.\end{proof}


===c===

We prove H\&quot;older's inequality
\begin{proof}
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are complex valued then we get 
&lt;math&gt;\left|\int_a^b f g d\alpha \right| \leq \int_a^b |f||g| d\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|f|^p \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|g|^q \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; then applying the previous part to the functions &lt;math&gt;|f|/c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g|/d&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c^p=\int_a^b|g|^q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d^q = \int_a^b|g|^q &lt;/math&gt; gives what we wanted to show.

&lt;math&gt;\left| \int_a^b f g d \alpha  \right| \leq \left( \int_a^b |f|^p d\alpha  \right) ^{1/p}+ \left( \int_a^b |g|^q d\alpha  \right) ^{1/q}&lt;/math&gt;

However, if one of the above is zero (say without loss of generality 
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|f|^p =0&lt;/math&gt; then we just have 
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b|f|(c|g|)d\alpha \leq c^q \frac{1}{q}\int_a^b|g|^q d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit &lt;math&gt;c \to 0 &lt;/math&gt; we observe that the inequality is still true.

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f||g| d\alpha = 0&lt;/math&gt;

\end{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
===a===

We take the expression &lt;math&gt;s \int_1^\infty \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx&lt;/math&gt; and express it as a sum of integrals on the intervals &lt;math&gt;(n,n+1)&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;s \left( \int_1^2 \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx + \int_2^3 \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx + \dots  \right) &lt;/math&gt; but since each such interval &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt; is the same, we just write &lt;math&gt;s \left( \int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^{s+1}} dx + \int_2^3 \frac{2}{x^{s+1}} dx + \dots  \right) &lt;/math&gt;(1)

Now we exploit the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, computing &lt;math&gt;\int_n^{n+1} \frac{n}{x^{s+1}} dx= n \left[ -\frac{x^{-s}}{s} \right]_n^{n+1}=n \left( -\frac{(n+1)^{-s}}{s} +\frac{n^{-s}}{s}\right).&lt;/math&gt; So, the summation in Equation 1 can, more explicitly be written as &lt;math&gt; s \sum_{n=1}^\infty n \left( -\frac{(n+1)^{-s}}{s} +\frac{n^{-s}}{s}\right)= \sum_{n=1}^\infty  \left( \frac{n}{n^{s}} -\frac{n}{(n+1)^{s}} \right)&lt;/math&gt; However, grouping common denominators, we observe that the sum partially telescopes to yield more simply &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}= \zeta(s).&lt;/math&gt;

===b===

Having now proved  Part a it suffices to show that  &lt;math&gt; s \int_1^\infty \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx = \frac{s}{s-1} - s \int_1^\infty \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx.&lt;/math&gt;


By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we have &lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^s} dx=\frac{1}{s-1}&lt;/math&gt; So
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_1^\infty \frac{x}{x^{s+1}} dx&amp;=&amp;\frac{1}{s-1}\\
\Rightarrow s \int_1^\infty \frac{x}{x^{s+1}} dx&amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{s-1}\\
\Rightarrow s \int_1^\infty \left( \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} + \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} \right) dx&amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{s-1}\\
\Rightarrow s \int_1^\infty \left( \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} + \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} \right) dx&amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{s-1}\\
\Rightarrow s \int_1^\infty  \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx &amp;=&amp;\frac{s}{s-1} -  s \int_1^\infty  \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx\\
\end{eqnarray*}
as desired\ 

end part b 

It remains now to show that the integral in Part \ref{2} converges.

Since for &lt;math&gt;x \in (1,\infty)&lt;math&gt; we have
&lt;math&gt;0 \leq  \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} \leq \frac{1}{x^{s+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
we know that
&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{x-[x]}{x^{s+1}} dx&lt;/math&gt;
converges if and only if
&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^{s+1}} dx&lt;/math&gt;
converges.

However, 
&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^{s+1}} dx&lt;/math&gt;
converges by the integral test (Problem 8) since we have already shown that the sequence
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{1}{x^{s+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
is convergent for &lt;math&gt;1&lt;s&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Summons and Appearance Notice */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
A person can be compelled to attend court to face criminal charges in several ways. It starts with the police. They investigate a crime and at some point they suspect an individual is responsible.

The police start by doing one of three things:
# serve an appearance notice on the accused; 
# arrest the accused; or
# lay a charge and issue a warrant or summons

These are not mutually exclusive actions but rather first steps. 

Where the person is given an appearance notice, they are simply served with a document directing them to attend court.

Where the person is arrested first, the police will decide whether to lay a charge. If a charge will be layed the police can do one of the following:
# hold him for court without release 
# release him using a summons, Appearance Notice, Promise to Appear (with or without an undertaking), or Recognizance (with or without an undertaking)

If they are held for court, the issue of release will be left to the judge to determine.

Where the charge is layed first, the warrant or summons gives authority to the police to locate the individual for the purpose of arresting them to serving them with notice to attend court.

==Attendance without Arrest==

===Appearance Notice===
Under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec496 s. 495(2)], a police officer who forms grounds of arrest pursuant to s. 495(1), shall not arrest the individual to ensure that they will attend court where:
# where the offence is one under [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec553# s. 553], a summary, or hybrid offence, and 
# where the officer &quot;believes on reasonable grounds that the public interest...may be satisfied without so arresting the person&quot; while having regard to all the circumstances including the need to:
## establish the identity of the person,
##secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or
## prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, and 
# he has no reasonable grounds to believe that, if he does not so arrest the person, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according to law.

If the officer does not arrest due to s. 495(2), then under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec496 s. 496], the officer &quot;may issue an appearance notice to the person&quot;

==Attendance on Release from a Warrantless Arrest==
Police officers have a number of options to release an accused subsequent to their arrest but without having to have the accused attend court for a bail hearing. The options consist of the following:
# summons or appearance notice
# promise to appear or recognizance (with or without an undertaking)

===Summons and Appearance Notice===
If the officer believes there is grounds to make a warrantless arrest under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec495 s. 495(1)], after concluding that s. 495(2) does not apply, then under s. 497, the officer must release the accused &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; on a summons (s. 497(1)(a)) or a appearance notice (s. 497(1)(b)), if the offence  for summary, hybrid or [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec553# s. 553] offences,  person, unless, under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec497 s. 497(1.1)], the officer &quot;believes, on reasonable grounds&quot; that:
#either:
## &quot;it is necessary in the public interest that the person be detained in custody&quot; or 
## &quot;that the matter of their release from custody be dealt with under another provision of this Part&quot;
#while having regard to all the circumstances including the need to:
##establish the identity of the person,
##secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence,
##prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, or
##ensure the safety and security of any victim of or witness to the offence; or
#&quot;that if the person is released from custody, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according to law.&quot;

Under s. 497(2), these rules do not apply where the accused is arrested without a warrant for an offence in a different province (as referenced in s. 503(3)).

Also, the officer should not release if he believes that the person may fail to attend court or where the offence described in s.503(3)--discusses offences outside of the jurisdiction.

Where the officer does not release the accused then they will be brought before a judge to determine if interim release will be granted.

An appearance notice is defined in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec493 s. 493] as &quot;a notice in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec849 Form 9] issued by a peace officer&quot;.

A summons is defined in s. 493 as &quot;a summons in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec849 Form 6] issued by a justice or judge;&quot;

===Promise to Appear or Recognizance===
If the officer believes there is grounds to make a warrantless arrest under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec495 s. 495(1)], after concluding that s. 495(2) does not apply, and, the officer does not release on an appearance notice or summons under s. 497, then, the officer must release under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec498 s. 498] on a summons, a promise to appear or recognizance (without surety) once there is no further reason to detain the accused, if the offence  for summary, hybrid or 553 offences, or any offence with a maximum penalty of five year jail and is not currently subject to a release process.  That is, unless, under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec498 s. 498(1.1)], the officer &quot;believes, on reasonable grounds&quot; that:
#either:
## &quot;it is necessary in the public interest that the person be detained in custody&quot; or 
## &quot;that the matter of their release from custody be dealt with under another provision of this Part&quot;
#while having regard to all the circumstances including the need to:
##establish the identity of the person,
##secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence,
##prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, or
##ensure the safety and security of any victim of or witness to the offence; or
#&quot;that if the person is released from custody, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according to law.&quot;

A promise to appear is defined in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec493 s. 493] as requiring Form 10. It shall include the accused's name, the substance of the offence, a demand to attend court at a stated time and place.([[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec501 s. 501(1)])

Under s. 503(2.1), any promise to appear or recognizance can be made to include conditions, including:
*to remain within a territorial jurisdiction,
*to notify the officer of any change of address, employment, or occupation,
*to abstain from communicating directly or indirectly with certain individuals,
*to abstain from attending certain locations,
*to deposit their passport,
*to abstain from possessing any firearm and to surrender any firearms licenses,
*to report at certain times to the police,
*to abstain from the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances,
*to abstain from the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription, and
*to comply with any other condition the officer in charge considers necessary to ensure the safety and security of any victim or witness.

===Undertaking to an Officer in Charge===
If an officer has grounds to make a warrantless arrest under s. 495 and the accused is not released under s. 497 or 498, then there is a general discretion under s. 503(2) to release the accused from custody &quot;conditionally&quot; by either a promise to appear or recognizance for any offences except 496 offences. Under s. 503(2.1), the officer may further require the accused to enter into an undertaking, which can have one or more of the following conditions:
*to remain within a territorial jurisdiction,
*to notify the officer of any change of address, employment, or occupation,
*to abstain from communicating directly or indirectly with certain individuals,
*to abstain from attending certain locations,
*to deposit their passport,
*to abstain from possessing any firearm and to surrender any firearms licenses,
*to report at certain times to the police,
*to abstain from the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances,
*to abstain from the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription, and
*to comply with any other condition the officer in charge considers necessary to ensure the safety and security of any victim or witness.

Failure to comply with the undertaking is a criminal offence.

The form of the undertaking should conform to [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec849 Form 11.1] of the Criminal Code.

====Varying Conditions====
Conditions in place from an undertaking to an officer in charge can be modified at any point under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec499 s. 499(3)] and [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec497 497(1.1)], as well as 503(1.1) for the Defence and 503(1.2) for the Crown. The modification does not need the consent of the crown.


===Attendance from release===
If an accused is released by summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, recognizance, or undertaking, as discussed above, and the accused fails to attend on the date specified, the justice may issue a warrant under s. 502 for the arrest of the accused. The warrant may be &quot;endorsed&quot; pursuant to s. 507(6) otherwise the warrant will be considered &quot;unendorsed&quot;.

If the accused attends before the justice, at which point the information will have been laid, the judge will either confirm the &quot;process&quot; (that is, the release mechanism used to compel attendance) or else will cancel it under s. 508.


==Release upon Warrant Arrest==
Where an officer is arresting an accused person on a warrant sections 499 and 503 governs.

===Endorsed Warrant===
Under s. 499(1), where the warrant for arrest was endorsed for release pursuant to s. 507(6) and the offence is not a 469 offence, the officer may do any of the following:
# &quot;release the person on the person's giving a promise to appear&quot;; 
# &quot;release the person on the person’s entering into a recognizance before the officer in charge without sureties in the amount not exceeding five hundred dollars that the officer in charge directs, but without deposit of money or other valuable security&quot;; or
#if the person is not ordinarily resident in the province in which the person is in custody or does not ordinarily reside within two hundred kilometres of the place in which the person is in custody, release the person on the person’s entering into a recognizance before the officer in charge without sureties in the amount not exceeding five hundred dollars that the officer in charge directs and, if the officer in charge so directs, on depositing with the officer in charge such sum of money or other valuable security not exceeding in amount or value five hundred dollars, as the officer in charge directs.

The officer may also impose conditions specified in s. 499(2):
{{quotation|
'''Additional conditions'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) In addition to the conditions for release set out in paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c), the officer in charge may also require the person to enter into an undertaking in Form 11.1 in which the person, in order to be released, undertakes to do one or more of the following things:
:(a) to remain within a territorial jurisdiction specified in the undertaking;
:(b) to notify a peace officer or another person mentioned in the undertaking of any change in his or her address, employment or occupation;
:(c) to abstain from communicating, directly or indirectly, with any victim, witness or other person identified in the undertaking, or from going to a place specified in the undertaking, except in accordance with the conditions specified in the undertaking;
:(d) to deposit the person’s passport with the peace officer or other person mentioned in the undertaking;
:(e) to abstain from possessing a firearm and to surrender any firearm in the possession of the person and any authorization, licence or registration certificate or other document enabling that person to acquire or possess a firearm;
:(f) to report at the times specified in the undertaking to a peace officer or other person designated in the undertaking;
:(g) to abstain from
::(i) the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances, or
::(ii) the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription; and
:(h) to comply with any other condition specified in the undertaking that the officer in charge considers necessary to ensure the safety and security of any victim of or witness to the offence.
...&lt;P&gt;
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec499 CCC]
}}

===Unendorsed Warrant===
Under s. 503, an officer arresting someone on a warrant may either detain them in custody to be brought to a justice within 24 hours or, release the person &quot;conditionally&quot; on a promise to appear or recognizance.

==Laying an Information==
At some point after the initial arrest and before the first appearance for arraignment, the peace officer is expected to prepare an Information and swear the information before a justice of the peace. The officer will give sworn evidence that they had reasonable ground to believe that the offence had been committed by the accused.

This can be done at any time prior to the first appearance for arraignment so long as it is within the time limit for the offence (6 months if summary offence).

See more at [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Informations and Indictments]]

==Confirming Attendance==
Once the accused attends for the first time in court, the authority of the justice of the peace or peace officer is complete and only the judge may compel future attendance. The purpose of a promise to appear, summons, or any other tool to ensure attendance is to secure attendance for the first time. After the initial appearance the promise to appear is irrelevant.&lt;ReF&gt;R v Oliveria  at 30&lt;br&gt;&lt;/reF&gt;

Whenever a judge had an information before him, he must comply with section 508. Section 508(b)(i) would appear to require that judges confirm that the notice, promise to appear or recognizance remains in effect and then endorse the information.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Key, 2011 ONCJ 780 - detailed review of cases&lt;/ref&gt;

However, case law has been divergent on the issue of whether the failure to confirm the order to return to court creates a nullity, invalidating the information. While there are a number of cases supporting the nullity effect on the lack of confirmation,&lt;ref&gt;
eg. R. v. Koshino, [1991] O.J. No. 173 (Gen. Div.), R. v. Sandoval, [2000] O.J. No. 5591 (S.C.J.),  R. v. Smith, [2008] O.J. No. 381 (S.C.J.), R. v. Pilieci (2010), 257 C.C.C. (3d) 541 (Ont. S.C.J.).&lt;/ref&gt; there is a growing line of cases that see it as having no effect on the validity of the charge.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rennie, [2004] O.J. No. 4990 (S.C.J.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Pavlick, [2008] O.J. No. 2114 (S.C.J.) &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sullivan, [2009] O.J. No. 5075 (S.C.J.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Duran, 2011 ONSC 7346&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Morton (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 625 (Ont. Gen. Div.), affirmed, (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 95 (Ont. 
C.A.). &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Matykubov,[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2010/2010oncj233/2010oncj233.html 2010 ONCJ 233]&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. Wetmore (1976), 18 N.S.R. (2d) 292 (N.S.C.A.)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

Where the accused was properly ordered to attend court and failed to, the court may issue a warrant for their arrest under s. 524:
{{quotation|
'''Issue of warrant for arrest of accused'''&lt;br&gt;
524. (1) Where a justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an accused
:(a) has contravened or is about to contravene any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance that was issued or given to him or entered into by him, or
:(b) has committed an indictable offence after any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance was issued or given to him or entered into by him, he may issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Arrest of accused without warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a peace officer who believes on reasonable grounds that an accused
:(a) has contravened or is about to contravene any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance that was issued or given to him or entered into by him, or
:(b) has committed an indictable offence after any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance was issued or given to him or entered into by him, may arrest the accused without warrant.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec524 CCC]
}}


{{reflist|2}}

= Judicial Interim Release (Bail) =
If the peace officer does not release the accused, then under s. 503 they must present the accused before a justice within 24 hours to consider whether to release the accused under s. 515.

=Ruy Lopez:Riga Variation=

White has chosen to move the king to h1, replying to the bishop attack on h2.

Black still has queen under threat and knight pinned, as well as bishop possibly hanging. The only way to address this is [[/10...Qh4|10...Qh4]], threatening checkmate. Alternatives leave things hanging. 

Taking with [[/10...bxc6|10...bxc6]] invites a king and rook fork after 11.Bxc6+. After 11...Bd7, white can also choose to play 12.Bxd5 and pile more pressure on the pinned knight white leaving the option open to take the hanging bishop. 

[[/10...Qd7|10...Qd7]] sets up a queen trade with a win of a pawn for white and the end of black's attack. This continuation may go 10...Qd7 11.Qxd5 Qxd5 12.Nb4+ Kf8 13.Nxd5 Be6 14.Rxe4 Bxd5 15.Rd4 Be6. After the queen trade, black has two pieces hanging, and cannot save both.

=Ruy Lopez:Riga Variation=

Black now threatens the weak f2 square with both knight and queen, threatening checkmate.

If white does not deal with the threat sufficiently, or plays an ineffectual move, black may be able to win with the following lines:

*11...Be5+ 12.Kg1 Qh2+ 13.Kf1 Qh1+ 14.Ke2 Bg4+ 15.Ke3 Qh6+ 16.Kd3 Nxf2#
*11...Be5+ 12.Kg1 Qh2+ 13.Kf1 Qh1+ 14.Ke2 Bg4+ 15.Kd3 Nxf2+ 16.Ke3 Nxd1+
*11...Be5+ 12.Kg1 Qh2+ 13.Kf1 Qh1+ 14.Ke2 Bg4+ 15.Kd3 Nxf2+ 16.Kd2 Qh6+ 17.Re3 Nxd1

Moves that would inhibit this are [[/11. Rxe4|11.Rxe4]], removing black's control over the f2 square, 11.Bg5, threatening black's queen, and any move of the c6 knight, delivering discovered check.

It turns out, however, that only [[/11. Rxe4|11.Rxe4]] can keep white ahead. 11.Bg5 Qxg5 12.Qxd5 Qxd5 13.Nb4+ leaves black up substantially, though it will win back the queen. Knight moves allow 11...Kf8, unpinning black's knight and more or less forcing a following 12.Rxe4.

= Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation =

This move order is a common transpositional tool for Scheveningen players to avoid the [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3/2...d6/3._d4/3...cxd4/4._Nxd4/4...Nf6/5._Nc3/5...e6/6._g4|Keres Attack]], which is reached from 6.g4 from a standard Scheveningen position. While it initially follows the Najdorf move order, the e6 push is more characteristic of the Scheveningen than the Najdorf, where black often plays a direct e7-e5 push.

Note that here, white can choose to follow up with [[/7. g4|7. g4]], but this line is referred to as the Perenyi Attack rather than the Keres Attack. This is because now that a6 controls the b5 square, black can play 7...e5 without fear of 8.Bb5+. Normally, in the Keres Attack, that would result in a trade of light squared bishops. But in this case, black now has two attackers on the exposed g4 pawn, where there is only one defender, the white queen. Further, 7...e5 threatens the d4 knight, so simply moving 8.h3 to protect the g pawn drops the knight. White's move, therefore, in the mainline Perenyi Attack, is 8.Nf5, cutting off the bishop's assault on g4 while moving the knight to temporary safety.

= Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation, Perenyi Attack =

The Perenyi Attack is similar in idea to its cousin the [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e4/1...c5/2._Nf3/2...d6/3._d4/3...cxd4/4._Nxd4/4...Nf6/5._Nc3/5...e6/6._g4|Keres Attack]] of the standard Scheveningen Variation. White mounts an aggressive pawn storm on the kingside, castling long and supporting with Qd2 and Be3. However, it usually arises from a transposition from the Najdorf rather than the normal Scheveningen move order. Compared to the Keres, white has his bishop already developed to the e3 square while black has a pawn on a6 rather than a7.

The differences are subtle but critical. Now, the standard line of the Perenyi attack follows with [[/7...e5|7...e5]]. This puts two attackers on the advanced g4 pawn (which only has the queen defending) and threatens the d4 knight. If this were the Keres, white could play Bb5+ Bd7 Bxd7+ Qxd7, which eliminates one attacker on g4. Then Nb3 moves the knight to safety. However, Bb5+ is not an option here because of the a6 pawn. 

Therefore, play usually continues 8.Nf5 (cutting off the bishop's attack on the g4 pawn and moving the knight away). Black then threatens the knight with 8...g6. At this point, play becomes very complex and sharp. White cannot move the knight away without losing the g4 pawn, and so usually chooses to sacrifice it. White can try to win back a knight with 9.g5 gxf5 10.gxf6, or sacrifice it with 9.g5 gxf5 10.exf5 Ng8 11.f6, boxing in black's kingside pieces. Alternatively, white can develop with 9.Bg2. This leads to a very complex line mostly found in top level chess: 9...gxf5 10.exf5 d5 11.Qe2 d4 12.O-O-O.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tiger hash ==
The Tiger hash processes data in 512-bit blocks and produces a 192-bit message digest. This hash was designed by Ross Anderson and Eli Biham (see http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/), with the goal of producing a secure, fast hash function that performs especially well on next-generation 64-bit architectures, being still efficient on 32 and 16-bit architectures. 

== Tiger tree hash ==
Tiger Tree cryptographic hash is calculated by applying the Tiger hash to 1024-byte blocks of a stream, then combining the interim values through a binary hash tree. 

This implementation method is specially useful as a secure way to validate transfers, especially blocks of a file and prevent corruption in distributed systems.

There is a way you can do this, but it is not a standard option within the program.
 
You need to edit this file (with a program like notepad): 
 
C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4\Publishing\quizresources\styles.xml
 
You'll find a section
 
&lt;style id=&quot;aftereachquestion&quot;&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitemfeedbacknextbutton&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitempresentationnextbutton&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitemfeedbackbackbutton&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitempresentationbackbutton&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
 
change it so that all the values are true, like so
 
&lt;style id=&quot;aftereachquestion&quot;&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitemfeedbacknextbutton&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;pair name=&quot;displayitempresentationnextbutton&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
For roughly 600 years the Vienna Hofburg was the primary residence of those who ruled over Austria. Over time the Hofburg has developed into one of the most important focal points of European history. From the Hofburg located in Vienna the Habsburgs ruled from the 13th century. Initially their rule started as rulers of the Austrian lands then from 1452 as emperors of the Holy Roman Empire.  The last phase of their rule was from 1806 to the end of the Monarchy in 1918 as emperors of Austria.

== History/Timeline ==
Originally a medieval fortified castle dating from the 13th century, the Hofburg palace was modified and extended extended by each emperor.  The palace underwent so much construction that it eventually came to look like a 'city within a city'. The sprawling and vast asymmetric complex which extends to well over 240,000 square feet.  The present day palace now consists of 2,600 rooms, 19 courtyards, 18 wings.  There are also 2600 rooms where approximately 5000 peoples work.  Also, some people live there.

The oldest part of the Hofburg is the Alte Burg Old Fortress. Since the 18th century the Old Forstress has been called the Schweizertrakt (Swiss Wing) after the Swiss Guards who served as the palace watch. The core of the Hofburg complex remains intact. It should be noted that although its four corner towers, most of the moat and the drawbridge were modified over the centuries. Around the middle of the 16th century the façade was changed to reflect the Renaissance style. 

In 1552 the Schweizertor (Swiss Gate) was built.  The gate was designed by Pietro Ferabosco.  This piece is one of a few Renaissance monuments the still remain in Vienna. This particular wing houses the Imperial Treasury.  This place is where the regalia of the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Empire are presently kept. The Vienna Boys' Choir still sings on Sundays at High Mass in the Burgkapelle (Palace Chapel). This part was created and built which was built in 1449. 

Around 1559 construction began on the Stallburg as a new primary residence. Since the 18th century this part of the palace has contained the stables of the famous Lipizzan stallions.  The Lipizzna stallions can be seen daily (except on Mondays) at their morning training or their performances in the Winter Riding School.

The Amalienburg (Amalia Residence) was designed as a stand alone building just opposite the Schweizertrakt. This residence was named after Empress Wilhelmine Amalia.  She used this residenc as her dower residence after the death of husband, Emperor Joseph I. The last occupant of this part of the Hofburg was Empress Elisabeth.  Presently these apartments are still open to the public. 

In the 17th century Emperor Leopold I had the Swiss Wing connected to the Amalia Residence. It was occupied by Empress Maria Theresa during the 18th century. Eventually after her untimely death these apartments were used until the end of the monarchy as state rooms. From 1946 it has been the official location of the offices of the Austrian Federal President.

During the 18th century the Hofburg was enlarged.  All of these enlargmement were designed and initiated by the court architectwho at the time was Joseph Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. Following the architect's death in 1723 the completion of this task was given to his son Johann Emanuel Fischer von Erlach. He was the person who supervised the construction work. 

Between 1723 and 1735 the Court Library which is now the Austrian National Library, was built to showcase the historically significant collection of books owned by the Habsburgs. 

When Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach died, another architect, Lukas von Hildebrandt, seized and opportunity for notariety. While Fischer's son was occupied fulfilling his father's vision for the designs, Hildebrandt planned the builiding the Imperial Chancellery Wing which contained the chancellery of the Holy Roman Empire.  However, at the emperor's express wish Johann Emanuel Fischer von Erlach was chosen to complete this wing in 1730. After the breakdown of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the chancellery was modified to be the residence of imperial family.  

In 1735 Johann Emanuel Fischer von Erlach completed the Winter Riding School.  It is still used today as the setting for the performances of the Spanish Riding School. Elaborate ball rooms were then created in addition to the school. Today they serve as the congress center even though they were initially designed to be used for reception and balls.  

Around the beginning of the 19th century Ludwig Montoyer erected Hall of Ceremonies   This room was used for all the ceremonial events of the imperial dynasty.  Today it continues to be used for famous Viennese balls. 

At the end of the 19th century when the old palace theatre was demolished Ferdinand Kirschner completed the Michaelertr.

At the beginning of the 20th century, shortly before the end of the monarchy, the New Hofburg was erected facing Heldenplatz Hasenauer. Presently is it contains a part of the National Library along with other valuble collections.

== Local Significance ==
Today the Hofburg Palace stands as an important center of cultural significance. This palace is also the official residence for the President of Austria.  The Hofburg area has been the official center of government since 1279 for various empires and republics within Europe.  The palace is a tourist attraction that offers tours and special events.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Gas pressure|Next=Expand or contract?}}

As you know from kindergarten, some things float while other things sink. You may also know that oil, which is insoluble (cannot be dissolved) in water, floats on top of water. What you might not know is how to find out whether something will sink or float. We will discuss that in this long chapter.

== Density ==
First, let's learn a new word: 'mass'. 'Mass' means how much of matter there is. This is not the same as 'volume'. Do you remember that there are always spaces between particles? 'Mass' does not include the spaces between the particles, while 'volume' does. Mass is measured in the units kilogram, gram and milligram.

Imagine you are in an enclosed room, say your bedroom. You are the only one inside the empty, airless room. Therefore, you are the only thing with mass in it. If your room is 1.5m × 2m × 2.5m, and your mass is 30kg, then there are 30kg in every 1.5m × 2m × 2.5m = 7.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Then, in every average cubic metre, there would be 30 kg ÷ 7.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4 kg.

Remember that in your room, there are (on average) 4 kg in every cubic meter. That is also the density in there: density is the amount of matter in a specific space; the volume is usually represented by an invisible '1'. What are the units of density then? The units of density are always constructed by the unit of the mass, a forward-slash, and then the unit of the volume. By now you may have deduced that the method of finding density is mass over volume. This formula is very important, so we will put it here:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note: You can also swap them around like you do in maths to find the mass or volume when you have the density.

== Floating and sinking ==
[[Image:Particles density.svg|right|150px]]
What does all that have to do with floating or sinking? Here's an old riddle: which one is heavier, 1kg of lead or 1kg of feathers? Yes, that's right, they are the same. But what if you put the lead and feathers into a pond? Will they both sink?

Actually, no. While their mass may be the same (1kg), the volume of lead is a lot smaller than that of feathers. As there is the same mass stuffed in a smaller space, it must be denser. The density of water is 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so if the density of the lead is more than 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, it has to sink. On the contrary, the feathers' density is probably less than 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which makes them float.

In other words, whether an object will float or sink in a certain liquid (or gas) depends on their density with relation to the density of the liquid. An example is the diagram on the right.

Unfortunately, we need a bit of math here. The following is a table of the name, mass and volume of some liquids and solids. If all these things are put into a measuring cylinder (or any container for that matter), and nothing dissolves, what will be the order of their altitude, from top to bottom?

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;830&quot;
! Name
! Volume
! Mass
! Density
|-
| Solid W
| 0.000 001m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!--1 cubic cm--&gt;
| 5g
| 
|-
| Solid X
| 5.4cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 1.8g
| 
|-
| Solid Y
| 300mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 1.6g
| 
|-
| Solid Z
| 5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 0.01kg&lt;!--10g--&gt;
| 
|-
| Liquid A
| 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 96g
| 
|-
| Liquid B
| 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 12g
| 
|-
| Water
| &lt;center&gt;/&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;/&lt;/center&gt;
| 
|}

Next, we need to know their densities. Remember to change the units. Note that we use division rather than fractions here. We will round off to three significant figures here.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;830&quot;
! Name
! Volume
! Mass
! Density
|-
| Solid W
| 0.000 001m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 5g
| 5g ÷ 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 5g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Solid X
| 5.4cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 1.8g
| 1.8g ÷ 5.4cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 0.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Solid Y
| 300mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.3cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 1.6g
| 1.6g ÷ 0.3cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 5.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Solid Z
| 5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 0.01kg = 10g
| 10g ÷ 5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Liquid A
| 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 96g
| 96g ÷ 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Liquid B
| 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| 12g
| 12g ÷ 24cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| Water
| &lt;center&gt;/&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;/&lt;/center&gt;
| 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Then, we arrange them in the correct, ascending order.

5g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 5.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 2g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 0.5cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 1cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 2g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 5g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 5.33g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid X &lt; Liquid B &lt; Water &lt; Solid Z &lt; Liquid A &lt; Solid W &lt; Solid Y
[[File:Float sink diagram simple.svg|left|160px]]

Since Solids W and Y are both on the bottom, they are on the same level—they both sink in liquid A. So, the correct order is as follows:
#Solid X
#Liquid B
#Water
#Solid Z
#Liquid A
#Solid W and Solid Y

You can refer to the diagram on the left, which shows a container with all the solids and liquids in it.

== Balloons, ships and submarines ==
Let's get to a topic with no sums: how vehicles work.

=== Balloons ===
[[File:Hot air balloon particles.svg|270px|right]]
[[File:Ballon2.jpg|thumb|160px||left|The engine of a hot-air balloon]]
Once upon a time, when aeroplanes were yet to be invented, the only way to soar through the skies was to ride in a hot-air balloon. A hot air balloon is just like those you ride in amusement parks. They work the same way: using the differences in density to hurl the balloon up.

How exactly? Look at the diagram on the right. Did you know that a hot-air balloon has to be heated before it flies? This is because the particles inside the balloon are just as dense as the particles outside the balloon at the beginning. However, as soon as the particles are heated, they move more vigorously, and as they bump into each other more often, they become less dense. As less dense things float, the balloon will rise.

=== Ships ===
Many ships are made of steel. Steel is very heavy and dense. Its overall density is approximately 7.85g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The density of water, however, is much lower, at 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, it is difficult for steel ships to float if they are made only of steel.

So, how exactly do those ships manage to float? You see, the density of air is very, very low. If there is a large amount of air inside the ship, the total density of the ship will decrease greatly. As long as the density is under 1g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the ship will float.

=== Submarines ===
Submarines work in a way that is similar to the ship, except the overall density of the ship can be altered at will so that the submarine sinks or floats as desired. Look at the diagram below. A tank called a ballast tank takes up a significant part of the submarine's area. Note that it does not have to be position like that in the diagram; it can be anywhere the shipbuilder wants it to be. The ballast tank fills up with sea water when the submarine needs to be submerged. When it needs to surface again, the sea water is pumped out of the ballast tank with the air in another tank.

[[File:Submarine diagram simple.svg|700px]]

== Quiz ==
#Explain why a hot-air balloon cannot rise up if there is no fire.
#Evaluate the following.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Matter !! Mass !! Volume !! Density
|-
| Solid P || 15 || 3 || a
|-
| Solid R || 100 || b || 4
|-
| Liquid H || c || 15 || 6
|}

Answers:
#It is because the fire makes the air particles inside the balloon vibrate more vigorously, thus decreasing the density of air inside the balloon, so that it floats.
#a) 5; b) 25; c) 90

      <comment>/* Vacuum */ hey... i mentioned that above!</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Three states of matter|Next=Float or sink?}}

You may have heard about the experiment in which you suspend a glass of water, and the cardboard under it does not fall down. Why does that happen? And what is the secret of the rubber suckers (the real name is suction cup) that hold up your towels? Read this chapter to find out.

== Gas pressure ==
Picture this. You have 4 table tennis balls, and you put them in a box of 1m x 1m x 1m. That's pretty big. Now you get a weightlifter to shake it. You will here the sound of the table tennis balls hitting against the wall of the box. Let's assume it's, say, once every ten seconds.

Now you put the balls into a box of 50cm x 50cm x 50cm. This time, you realise that the balls hit against the wall six times every ten seconds! That is because as the volume of the box decreases, there is more chance of the table tennis balls hitting against the wall.

When the table tennis balls hit the wall more, they exert more pressure on it. Pressure is when someone drops a heavy weight on you. Remember that gas particles move freely all the time? When gas particles are put into a container, they hit the walls on the container and exert pressure on them. When you hit put them into a smaller container, they would therefore hit the walls more often as well. The pressure exerted is named 'gas pressure'.

Gas pressure is measured in a unit called 'pascal', or simply 'Pa'. A Bourdon gauge can be used to measure gas pressure. We can also connect a pressure sensor to a datalogger to measure gas pressure.

== Air pressure ==
Air is also a kind of gas. Air is made of nitrogen, oxygen and other elements. As air is all around us, it also creates gas pressure. Gas pressure from air is called air pressure or atmospheric pressure. Mind you, you cannot actually feel air particles hitting your skin!

== Vacuum ==
[[File:Magdeburg.svg|200px|left]]
If there is no air, there is no atmospheric pressure. In 1664, the Mayor of Magdeburg combined two hemispheres (halves of spheres), then he pumped the air out of the sphere. He tried to use horses to separate them, but it did not work. Why is that?

This can be explained by the diagram on the left. When the hemispheres are filled with air, the air pressure on the inside equals out the air pressure on the outside. When the inside is hollow, there is no pressure so the air presses the hemispheres together, making it impossible to separate. A place without any air is called a vacuum.

[[File:Suction-lifter-one-cup.jpg|100px|right]]
A daily life application is the suction cup where you pump out the air while pressing it onto the wall. As the air is pumped out, the air particles outside press against the sucker, causing air pressure. That's why it takes some effort to take it off!

== Quiz ==
Fill in the blanks.
#Gas pressure is caused by gas (1) hitting the wall of its (2).
#(3) pressure is also known as air pressure.
#The power of a (4) can be shown by the (5) hemispheres.

Answers:
#particles
#container
#Atmospheric
#vacuum
#Magdeburg

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;pre&gt; This Section is very important for exam poit of view. Therefore, it is required to expend it. 
If you have previous year questions,Please add them [[Exam Questions]]. 
The solution to these questions will be provided. &lt;/pre&gt;

There are several spectroscopic techniques which can be used to identify organic molecules: infrared (IR), mass spectroscopy (MS) UV/visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

IR, NMR and UV/vis spectroscopy are based on observing the frequencies of electromagnetic radiation absorbed and emitted by molecules. MS is based on measuring the mass of the molecule and any fragments of the molecule which may be produced in the MS instrument.

==UV/Visible Spectroscopy==
UV/Vis Spectroscopy uses ultraviolet and/or visible light to examine the electronic properties of molecules.  Irradiating a molecule with UV or Visible light of a specific wavelength can cause the electrons in a molecule to transition to an excited state.  This technique is most useful for analyzing molecules with conjugated systems or carbonyl bonds.

==NMR Spectroscopy==
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is one of the most useful analytical techniques for determining the structure of an organic compound. There are two main types of NMR, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR (Proton NMR) and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR (Carbon NMR). NMR is based on the fact that the nuclei of atoms have a quantized property called spin. When a magnetic field is applied to a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nucleus, the nucleus can align either with (spin +1/2) or against (spin -1/2) the applied magnetic field.

These two states have different potential energies and the energy difference depends on the strength of the magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field about a nucleus, however, depends on the chemical environment around the nucleus. For example, the negatively charged electrons around and near the nucleus can shield the nucleus from the magnetic field, lowering the strength of the effective magnetic field felt by the nucleus. This, in turn, will lower the energy needed to transition between the +1/2 and -1/2 states. Therefore, the transition energy will be lower for nuclei attached to electron donating groups (such as alkyl groups) and higher for nuclei attached to electron withdrawing groups (such as a hydroxyl group).

In an NMR machine, the compound being analyzed is placed in a strong magnetic field and irradiated with radio waves to cause all the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei to occupy the higher energy -1/2 state. As the nuclei relax back to the +1/2 state, they release radio waves corresponding to the energy of the difference between the two spin states. The radio waves are recorded and analyzed by computer to give an intensity versus frequency plot of the sample. This information can then be used to determine the structure of the compound.




'''Aromatics in H-NMR'''
'''Electron Donating Groups vs. Electron Withdrawing Groups'''

On monosubstituted rings, electron donating groups resonate at high chemical shifts.  Electron donating groups increase the electron density by releasing electrons into a reaction center, thus stabilizing the carbocation.  An example of an electron donating group is methyl (-CH3).

Accordingly, electron withdrawing groups are represented at low chemical shifts.  Electron withdrawing groups pull electrons away from a reacting center.  This can stabilize an electron rich carbanion. Some examples of electron withdrawing groups are halogens (-Cl, -F) and carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

Looking at the H NMR spectrum of ethyl benzene, we see that the methyl group is the most electron withdrawing, so it appears at the lowest chemical shift.  The aromatic phenyl group is the most electron donating, so it has the highest chemical shift.

'''Disubstituted Rings'''

The sum of integrated intensity values for the entire aromatic region shows how many substituents are attached to the ring, so a total value of 4 indicates that the ring has 2 substituents.  When a benzene ring has two substituent groups, each exerts an influence on following substitution reactions. The site at which a new substituent is introduced depends on the orientation of the existing groups and their individual directing effects.  For a disubstituted benzene ring, there are three possible NMR patterns.  
[[Image:omp.gif]]

Note that para-substituted rings usually show two symmetric sets of peaks that look like doublets.  

The order of these peaks is dependent on the nature of the two substituents.  For example, the three NMR spectra of chloronitrobenzene isomers are below:

=Mass Spectroscopy=

A mass spectroscope measures the exact mass of ions, relative to the charge.  Many times, some form of separation is done beforehand, enabling a spectrum to be collected on a relatively pure sample.  An organic sample can be introduced into a mass spectroscope and ionised.  This also breaks some molecules into smaller fragments.

The resulting mass spectrum shows:

1) The heaviest ion is simply the ionised molecule itself. We can simply record its mass.

2) Other ions are fragments of the molecule and give information about its structure. Common fragments are:
&lt;center&gt;
{|
|'''species'''
|'''formula'''
|'''mass'''
|-
|methyl
|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|15
|-
|ethyl
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|29
|-
|phenyl
|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|77
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=Infrared spectroscopy.=



Absorbing infrared radiation makes covalent bonds vibrate. Different types of bond absorb different wavelengths of infrared:
 
Instead of wavelength, infrared spectroscopists record the wavenumber; the number of waves that fit into 1 cm. (This is easily converted to the energy of the wave.)

For some reason the spectra are recorded backwards (from 4000 to 500 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is typical), often with a different scale below 1000 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (to see the fingerprint region more clearly) and upside-down (% radiation transmitted is recorded instead of the absorbance of radiation).

The wavenumbers of the absorbed IR radiation are characteristic of many bonds, so IR spectroscopy can determine which functional groups are contained in the sample.  For example, the carbonyl (C=O) bond will absorb at 1650-1760cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Typical method ==

&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Infrared_spectroscopy|Wikipedia article.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IR_spectroscopy_apparatus.svg|thumbnail|centre|400px|Typical apparatus]]

A beam of infra-red light is produced and split into two separate beams. One is passed through the sample, the other passed through a reference which is often the substance the sample is dissolved in. The beams are both reflected back towards a detector, however first they pass through a splitter which quickly alternates which of the two beams enters the detector. The two signals are then compared and a printout is obtained. 

A reference is used for two reasons:
*This prevents fluctuations in the output of the source affecting the data

*This allows the effects of the solvent to be cancelled out (the reference is usually a pure form of the solvent the sample is in).

== Global ban enforcement ==

Hi. Please enforce the global ban on [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] declared by [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales Jimbo Wales] in [http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity:Community_Review/Wikimedia_Ethics:Ethical_Breaching_Experiments&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=548143&amp;oldid=548142 this edit].  Thanks!  &amp;nbsp; — &lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;[[User:Jeff G.|Jeff]] [[User:Jeff G./talk|G. ツ]]&lt;/font&gt; 02:21, 3 May 2010 (UTC)
:http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Administrators'_noticeboard#Global_ban_enforcement is a stronger thread than the original I was working with.  &amp;nbsp; — &lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;&gt;[[User:Jeff G.|Jeff]] [[User:Jeff G./talk|G. ツ]]&lt;/font&gt; 05:16, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

:Looking through his edits I don't see any reason to ban him.  Looking at the other wiki's you've posted this message on it seems many of them feel the same.  I will not personally block any user without reason, regardless of who requests it. I find it notable that many of the admins at the other wiki's where you've requested this have responded similarly. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:47, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

:The moment he edits here I'll block him.

::I will reverse any block made here simply for editing in a positive manner.  There's a request at [[m:Steward_requests/Global#Global_lock.2Funlock_for_Thekohser|Meta]], which is the only forum for a global ban that is appropriate. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:21, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

:::I agree that Thekosher's activities here don't really justify blocking him on Wikibooks, but if Mike decides to block him then I think it would be a mistake to reverse that. From what Thekosher has written elsewhere you can see why Jimbo and other Wikipedians have taken against him. Starting a wheel war would be such a disaster here, that the rest of us should just swallow our principles this time for the good of the project. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 17:18, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

::::Beyond the possibility of a local block being implemented with no corresponding policy violation to justify it, a block here for actions on other wikis would seem to be against Mike's statement on his [[m:User:Mike.lifeguard|Meta page]] stating that steward actions would only be taken here in case of an emergency.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:45, 3 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I am not sure why [[User:Guido den Broeder|Guido den Broeder]] is asking for an unblock of [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]], (assuming they are not the same person), but I think it is best if we let users ask to unblock themselves in general.

== Renaming a Book ==

Hallo
I would like, if possible, to rename a book.  I was the main author and need to change the name to reflect future use, however I have published links to pages in this book that I hope will still work when the book is renamed.  Is this going to be possible and how can I achieve it?  Thanks [[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 10:14, 27 April 2010 (UTC)

:You may use the move tab, by default it will leave behind a redirect that will automatically take users to the new book.  If the book consists of many pages you may want to ask an administrator to do it for you, since our tools allow us to move all subpages of a given module.  Unfortunately there is no way to protect the continued existence of these redirects indefinitely into the future for two reasons.  One someone may come along and start a new book with the same title as your old book and over write the redirect in doing so.  (Also there is a policy of deleting redirects are orphaned.  Though placing a link in the discussion page of your book could prevent this.)  So it is best if possible to update the links where ever you can.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:23, 27 April 2010 (UTC)


Thanks - I would like to go ahead and ask an administrator to make that change for me.  The book is currently called Question Writer 3 Manual and I would like it changed to Question Writer Manual.  Please let me know if there is anything I need to do [[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 08:12, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

:All the pages have been renamed, all the links have been adjusted and made relative, the tags have been corrected to improve the print version, and headings have been added to the collection now linked from the main page to divide the dynamic PDF into chapters. The only thing not done was to correct the fair-use rationales on the images to point to the new page locations, but they do so through the redirects that were left behind. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:13, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

Thank you ever so much (even though I see now that I asked in the wrong place....[[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 08:23, 12 May 2010 (UTC)

:Now worries, you've got exactly the right place.  The page on Renaming is for renaming user accounts and not books. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:12, 12 May 2010 (UTC)  
:(PS. Thanks for getting to this before me A)

== RealityBot ==

The account {{userlinks|RealityBot}} probably isn't a bot, seeing that it has no userpage or user talk. If I'm right, shouldn't it be blocked indef? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 14:01, 2 May 2010 (UTC)
:We have no policy that would call for that. [[Wikibooks:Bots]] doesn't mention anything related to a user having a bot-like name and vice versa and the non-policy [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]] doesn't deal with usernames.  Bots can run on Wikibooks without the bot flag and even without approval (assuming they aren't disruptive). Short of causing disruption, I can not justify a block at this time. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:14, 2 May 2010 (UTC)
::Also there was nothing harmful about the one existing edit under this account. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:26, 2 May 2010 (UTC)
:::Huh, really? In Wikipedia bot accounts don't have to end with -bot but non-bot accounts must not end with -bot. Also in Wikipedia non-approved bots can't be created as they don't have the bot flag. Sorry for my mistake; I'm still quite new here. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:30, 3 May 2010 (UTC)
::::No problem. Wikipedia tends to be rather high-strung about such things. If the account isn't editing, there's no deception. If they start contributing regularly, you might consider asking them to request at [[WB:RENAME|rename]]. &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#4B0082; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|mikelifeguard]]@[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|enwikibooks]]:&amp;#126;$&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 11:33, 3 May 2010 (UTC)
:::::OK, at this stage it seems to be editing like a bot would. However it should be provided with the bot flag. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 11:51, 7 May 2010 (UTC)
::::::We don't, however, hide edits for bots that have not been explicitly approved at [[WB:RFP]].  At minimum, I want to know who's operating it. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:31, 7 May 2010 (UTC)
:::::We seem to be having this conversation in two places. It doesn't look at all like a &quot;bot editing&quot; - the edits are far too infrequent to provide any evidence it is a bot. But regardless of that, bots do not get granted the bot flag without a proper discussion about the purpose and usage of the bot and that requires the operator to come forward and request the flag. There's no precedent, and I oppose creating one, of setting the bot flag just because an account name includes the three letters &quot;bot&quot;. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:37, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

:I see no explicit request from Thenub314 on this other than discussion.  In fact, several titles have been mentioned in the discussion.  And if he's been undoing your revisions to the book, that makes me question if you're in a position to ask for a rename to a book he's been working on extensively.  Thenub's comments indicate he feels the book's introduction adequately defines its scope and audience; this rename seems as though it'd just be to satisfy you.  As for now, I've added {{tlx|book&amp;nbsp;title|Linear&amp;nbsp;Algebra|An&amp;nbsp;Introduction&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;Mathematical&amp;nbsp;Discourse}} to the front page, to provide a subtitle without bloating out every page's link length. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 24 May 2010 (UTC)
::''Coming up with a title that correctly gives the flavor of the book is difficult.  I suppose I think something like [[Linear Algebra: An Introduction to Mathematical Discourse]].'' This is what Thenub suggested. --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 21:49, 24 May 2010 (UTC)
:::Sometimes we just float ideas around to think about them or to get feedback. I don't see why Thenub's comment should be taken as a binding compromise. &lt;s&gt;Furthermore, I question the point of bringing this to the Administrative Assistance room, given that it is an editorial decision and also that Thenub himself is an admin, so theoretically he ''could'' unilaterally move the book if he really felt a pressing need to do so.&lt;/s&gt; --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 21:58, 24 May 2010 (UTC)
:::: For what it is worth, real life is quite busy right now, so bringing a name change request here makes good sense and I had told [[User:33rogers|33rogers]] at some point in the discussion.  But as [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] seems to have guessed, I don't I like my own suggestion all that much, it sounds very 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century but I couldn't think of much better. I was kind of hoping it would spark some new idea, but I don't really mind having it there for the time being. For the moment, my opinion is that the book title template that Adrignola put in is perfect.  It allows us to try out different things without having to move all the pages this way and that.  And suggestions about the title are also still floating around, we should take [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]]'s suggestions just as seriously as my own.  Maybe after we settle we can discuss a permanent move. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:08, 25 May 2010 (UTC)
::::: (Never mind, I have just seen that the idea of bringing it here came from Thenub. Consider the strikeout I left in my post above as a public contrition for overzealousness.) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 16:54, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

:Well, I'd support a vandalism only infinite account block - the contributions are all vandalism, and the attempt to impersonate you (by adding a block notice with an attempt to make the notice appear to come from your account) is clearly deserving of a block.

::It was telling that Adrignolans blanked [[User talk: Mikimeral |Mikimeral's talk page]], whom I had blocked indefinitely for vandalism.

::::&quot;'''But that guy's only a kid in the first grade'''&quot;. How do you know? Unless you have personal knowledge, anything else could be made up. In any case, abuse of multiple accounts to avoid a block isn't allowed, so the second account won't be unblocked.

:::: (Edit conflict with QU, forgive any repetition) Even if it were indefinite, a user can always request an unblock.  But don't be too moved by the persons claims that they are in P2, with near certainty this is a deception.  None of the P2 kids I am in contact with are really capable of sock puppeting, and some of the other edits I have seen form this user.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Redox Reactions (review) ==
Hi. I am curious as to why there is a review section on redox reactions on this page. I think it would just be better to state something along the lines of &quot;Please read [[General Chemistry/Redox Reactions/Oxidation and Reduction equations|redox reactions]] before continuing&quot; or &quot;This page assumes general knowledge of redox reactions. Please read [[General Chemistry/Redox Reactions/Oxidation and Reduction equations|redox reactions]] for more details&quot;. Electrochemistry is not really possible to fully understand without any knowledge of redox reactions anyway, so they should read about redox reactions first. That would make the information about redox reactions on this page unnecessary and redundant. --[[User:Backward|&lt;span style=&quot;background:black;color:white;padding:2px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;back&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Backward|&lt;span style=&quot;background:darkgreen;color:white;padding:2px;&quot;&gt;ward&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]] 21:42, 4 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

A rename is left up to the book contributors; no administrative action needed for that. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:10, 5 June 2010 (UTC)}}
[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Speedy Delete''': Unmaintained; Empty; see [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] &amp; [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Chess/Q&amp;A]] --16:38, 18 May 2010 (UTC)[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]])

:Strong [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''  This is a unnecessary RfD, this page was tagged by [[User:33rogers|33rogers]] for speedy, oposed by myself and restored by Adrignola and finally there is a comment by Swift (that raises the issue of usefulness but never states it should be deleted) on the same page (off topic but now restored) and on the undelete request on Adrignola's talk.
: Given that, the rationals stated above is at least wrong and at worst deceptive (since it doesn't conform to reality). The indicated previous discussion clearly made a distinction on pages on the talk namespace. The page IS maintained and IS considered useful.
:I've been mostly working on that project alone and I think that any page in the talk namespace if maintained, and has a relation to that project's topic, is beneficial and invokes participation. In any case it should be to the existing book communities to manage that space. A RfD would be only in order if the book was abandoned or the page offensive in any way.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' No reason to delete. Even if this page wasn't actively watched, that doesn't devalue it's use. I suggested that it be deleted on the talk page as I personally don't see the value. Book contributors on the other hand do, and that's good enough for me. Not only is there no harm in keeping this, there is no gain in deleting it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:13, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

*There is already consensus from [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Python Programming/Q&amp;A]] that Wikipedia's Reference desk is the correct place for asking questions. The talk page in question has no useful content and I ask that it be deleted (speedy delete). --[[User:33rogers|33rogers]] ([[User talk:33rogers|talk]]) 04:05, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
*: There is no such consensus. It may be a better place for a particular purpose but that doesn't mean wikibooks ''cannot'' have Q&amp;A pages, which is what you seem to be saying. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:07, 19 May 2010 (UTC)
*Furthermore, the only '''content''' on the page was:

&lt;nowiki&gt;== Delete, transwiki or move ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

First off, this page hasn't been used in the several years since it was started. It seems to not provide a very useful service and might just as well be deleted. Still, a place for readers to place questions may still be useful but might fit better at Wikiversity. Wikibooks concerns itself with the authoring of quality educational textbooks, while Wikiversity with the actual education. Should this page belong here, it would rather belong in the main namespace. That leaves the talk page to discussing the page &amp;mdash; as this section does. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:34, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''. Mainly because the link to the Q&amp;A from the front page of the book says &quot;If you have questions related to P2P that are not addressed on the book, ask at the Q&amp;A.&quot;, clearly stating it was not meant as a general reference desk and hinting at its intended usage as a tool for identifying gaps in the book contents (a reasonable motivation for a Q&amp;A page, as I previously stated in the Python Q&amp;A RfD). Furthermore, the page is on Talk: namespace and is linked to an actively maintained book (so that it can potentially be useful to editors and visitors or even, if necessary, adjusted to better fit project scope). The really important point to be raised on this discussion, however, is that the nuanced arguments for and against deletion in the previous Python Q&amp;A RfD clearly show it would ''not'' be adequate to rush all similar cases through speedy deletion. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 05:03, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:&lt;s&gt;'''Neutral'''&lt;/s&gt; While the comments above to sound reasonable, I still have doubts about keeping Q&amp;As. While Duplode's comment sounds rational, it sound a bit like word-play to me. If anyone convinces me I might change my mind though. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 10:16, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{keep}} '''and''' [[File:Symbol move vote.svg|15px]] '''Move'''. No particular reason to delete it, and one of the books main contributors would like to keep it.  Though as the page is linked from the books main page, it seems more appropriate to me to have the page in the main namespace. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:06, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:: The page is a talk page, it is not part of the book content. (All pages that don't constitute the book content shouldn't be on the project's namespace (see also my post below and if you can reply there, same subject). Why do you feel it the main namespace is the best location?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:57, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

* {{keep}} This isn't just about whether to delete, though (nor even whether to rename, although I'm rather in favor of Thenub314's suggestion to move it to mainspace, since there's a demonstrated need for a separate page on which to discuss the content of the page).  Each Q&amp;A page is part of the structure of the book in which it occurs, and rearranging that structure should be done delicately and compassionately with due consideration to the circumstances and community of the individual book; RFD is too blunt an instrument (to say nothing of speedy delete, which doesn't appropriately apply because it is supposed to be limited to utterly uncontroversial cases).  There are two separate functions to be thought through and addressed appropriately:
:* helpdesk, which most of the ''general'' Wikibooks community here seem to agree is not appropriate for Wikibooks  &amp;mdash; but there seems to be some background level of ambivalence, and some disagreement over whether to farm it out to Wikipedia or to Wikiversity, and it might be more appropriately a decision for the local community of each book rather than for the larger community that deals with RFDs &amp;mdash; and
:* suggestions box, a place to suggest additional coverage that might be appropriate for the particular book &amp;mdash; suggestions that some books might choose to invite their readers to make at a special page dedicated to the purpose; and other books might choose to invite their readers to make at the book's main talk page, or at individual content pages' talk pages; and still other books might not specifically invite at all, but just leave readers to decide on their own initiative to make suggestions on the talk pages.
: At any rate, it seems to me that general discussion should be at the general reading room rather than here, and specific discussion of individual books should be at those individual book's main talk pages (with links from the Q&amp;A pages in question, presumably) rather than here.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:57, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I don't agree, the Q&amp;A isn't part of the book, it is a talk page, a discussion area. The need that you feel exists in reality doesn't, for instance Swift post (not Q&amp;A material, and so offtopic on that page) seems to have been forced there, but this is mostly a software limitation, and structurally the main talk page indicates the right place to post such messages. 
:: The way we still use talkpages as if we are in Wikipedia is a software limitation and often a habit. This makes it hard to fallow discussions and to be aware of all activities, on the books I've centered my participation I also took steps to unobtrusively center all talks/discussions in a small set of pages and it seems to work better.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:57, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I agree with the view that this sort of page should be in the main namespace. I see no reason why a module cannot be interactive with content from readers. The talk page is then for the purpose of discussing that page. Either way, it doesn't really matter as it seems to do the job and I don't see anyone complaining.
:: I don't, however, agree with your statement on this so-called &quot;''general'' Wikibooks community&quot;. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:07, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

::: Since this discussion is quickly moving in a more general and constructive direction I followed Pi zero's suggestion and [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Q.26A_pages_and_the_role_of_namespaces|forked it at the reading room]] (excuse me for the slightly ridiculous length of my post there). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 23:15, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

:::: I don't mean to ignore the fork, but allow me to answer Panic's question here, since it was directed to me and is about this page instead of general considerations.  My reasons are two-fold, first it would allow the page to have a discussion page.  This would allow a more appropriate placement of Swift's comments.  Secondly, I do see the page as the part of the content of the book.  Sort of a frequently asked questions, where it is not clear if the questions are frequent.  Granted maybe that wasn't its intention, but that is how I see it. It is my opinion that this is also how readers of the book will view the page in some way.  When developed, many people will read the page not to ask a question, but to read other peoples questions and their answers with the hopes of learning from them.

It is currently tagged as outdated. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:15, 5 June 2010 (UTC)}}
Tagged by Weavejester, the main (perhaps only real) contributor following a declined speedy. Reason given was &quot;Requesting deletion: is unlikely to ever be updated. Confuses search engines.&quot; &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:05, 21 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' At first I felt this was a rather tricky issue, but looking around for information on this software, I think everyone would be best served if we let this go.
: The book seems to be the creation of a fairly small development community which has moved the documentation to the [http://compojure.org Compojure project website]. I don't think it's reasonable to assume that anyone would want to build a separate wikibook based on this outdated one. Policies aside, it seems highly unlikely that anyone will benefit from this book which, with its third place in [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Compojure&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g10&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai= an internet search] for the software and [http://groups.google.com/group/compojure/browse_thread/thread/54de878b01218f2b/00d3df5af9d9c143?lnk=gst&amp;q=wikibooks#00d3df5af9d9c143 year old information], is actually more likely to confuse people looking for information, hurting both the Compojure project as well as Wikibooks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:15, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

:&lt;s&gt;[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''':&lt;/s&gt; I've seen attempts on other books where contributors have moved to other websites and tried to remove content here or tell readers to ignore content here get reversed.  The hard truth is that a great deal of the books on software here are likely to be outdated.  I merged several books into [[Beginner's Guide to Adobe Flash]], which itself was for Flash 8 (2005); some of the other books dealt with Flash MX (2002) and all referred to it as Macromedia Flash, before the rename to Adobe Flash (2007).  Let's ask ourselves how many books &quot;unlikely to ever be updated, confuses search engines&quot; would apply to.  It'd make a better topic for a general forum, but this is what comes to my mind regarding this nomination.  &lt;s&gt;In this particular case, the only significant contributor has requested deletion, so I personally would have honored the speedy deletion request.&lt;/s&gt; -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:15, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

:: Look closer. The only page where Weavejester is the only significant contributor is [[Compojure/Dependencies]]. so Darklama's call was correct.

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' People seem to forget or overlook that not everyone can buy a new computer annually or afford to get the latest release of software programs. How is not keeping updated with the latest version of software programs a problem? I can imagine people will still find a use for books that talk about an older release. Wikibooks isn't paper so books can sit idle until someone comes along to update or improve on them. I've been inclined not to honor deletions like this where people decided to continue the work elsewhere and there can potentially be useful work here still. IMO failure to keep up isn't a reason to delete. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:03, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' The existing deletion policy doesn't provide any context for the creator/contributor asking for a deletion but states that as valid basis for speedy deletion. My opinion is that only the request of the contributor wouldn't justify the deletion of any usable content and so seems QuiteUnusual (and  Swift raises the issue that this isn't even an exact fact). But Swift argumentation for deletion is based on what he sees as future expectation for evolution, on the other hand Adrignola experience (and my own) seems to indicate that even abandoned stubs can be turned into useful projects, to that point even the rational for the requested speedy seems strange and a weak reason to provide the deletion, should we act to promote another projects or is our first duty to benefit Wikibooks? What about the license of the &quot;new&quot; content ?
: I'm willing to change my opinion if stronger argumentation is put forward or a greater assurance is given that the new location will keep the content free, I wouldn't mind at all that a link to the new location would be used with some visibility but carefully constructed not to redirect contributors (something similar to what I've done when fixing the [[Slackersbible]]). At this moment I prefer to keep the free stub...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:37, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''. I'm not supporting deletion, I just saw the RFD tag had been placed on the book following the declined speedy without creating an entry here. I put the RFD discussion here purely as an &quot;administrative tidy up&quot;, not because I support the deletion. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:00, 22 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''. While from a superficial point of view the objections raised by Weavejester make sense this request sounds too much like a mere claim of ownership. There is no reason not to believe in the future someone else could build upon the existing pages and update the book, particularly if the Compojure community grows. In particular, comparing the code examples in the book and on the official site reveals that one year certainly was not enough to make all information useless (for instance, the syntax wasn't re-elaborated from scratch). By the way, &quot;confusing search engines&quot; is not a good argument. If the book is really too outdated to be useful people will stop linking to it and Google ratings will gradually drop. And finally, if there were worries about the situation mentioned in the post linked by Swift it wouldn't cost much to modify the offending page so that it provides links to where to read updated installation instructions - probably it would take about the same time it took to file speedy del and RfD requests... --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 22:51, 22 May 2010 (UTC)
:: P.S.: Some good soul [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Compojure%2FGetting_Started&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1804311&amp;oldid=1799303 just did exactly that] :) --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 00:49, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''. My aim is not to claim ownership over the content, but to remove a resource that is frequently a source of confusion. Wikibooks tend to rate quite highly on search engines; not necessarily because many people link to the specific book, but because Wikibooks is a highly linked-to site in general. So even if there were no direct links to the Compojure wikibook, it would still be ranked highly by search engines. Because of this, I tend to get a fair few questions on why the steps in the Compojure wikibook don't work, and I have to explain that the wikibook is considerably out of date and shouldn't be used as a reference. Now, I could slap out-of-date notices on all the pages, and link back to up-to-date documentation, but given that no-one is interested in keeping it updated, is there any point to keeping it around? It's conceivable that someone might take up the task in future, but as every page of the wikibook is thoroughly obsolete, they'd have to rewrite all the pages anyway: it would be far simpler for our hypothetical maintainer to start from scratch. This is my reasoning behind requesting that the book be deleted. -- [[User:Weavejester|Weavejester]] 01:52, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:: I don't understand why this is a frequent source of confusion. Surely people would be just as confused reading a hard copy or printed book about an older version of the software when a newer version of the software is installed on their computer? How is this failure to not use the right book for the right version of the software our problem or even your problem? How about adding this sort of confused question to some sort of FAQ document on your website? You could for example add &quot;Q: Why Does X, Y, or Z not work for me? A: Make sure you are using the correct software version. The interface changed between 1.0-blah and 1.2-blah.&quot; --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:34, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

::: Printed books are typically written about stable software. In this case, the Compojure wikibook partially documents an early, pre-alpha version that bears little resemblance to the current releases. If the wikibook detailed anything that was still used, I'd recommend keeping the page. -- [[User:WeaveJester|WeaveJester]] 19:36, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

:'''Keep''' per above, perhaps rename to remind readers that it's about the old version. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 12:43, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''': To extend upon my previous comments, which are along this vein...  This is a fundamental misunderstanding with what Wikibooks is, in that it is not a web host; contributing here releases content under a [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|license]] that permits redistribution of the material, with no retraction of that.  If Wikibooks comes up third in the results (pretty good for Wikibooks competing with Wikipedia), update the documentation here or make the site's documentation rank higher than Wikibooks.  In no other situation would one have any hopes of shutting down one's competitors in the search engine results page.  Following the link above, I get [http://weavejester.github.com/compojure/docs/contributing-documentation.html this page] on contributing documentation.  Read through that and see just how inconvenient it is to update it for the average user trying to help out others after discovering a solution to a problem they encountered that wasn't addressed in the documentation.  I personally find this platform inferior to Wikibooks (which does permit review of changes before they are shown to logged-out users).  While this isn't about ownership of content here, is it about control of content elsewhere, given that Weavejester must be asked for permission to update the documentation on compjure.org?  Maybe the users simply prefer our platform instead? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:19, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:: Just to make things clear. Ownership is not the same as control. If a Wikibookian contributes copyrightable content (not all edits are so classified) he owns the content but after licensing it under any of the Wikibooks required licenses he relinquishes any distribution control over those contributions. In addition to this, Wikibooks doesn't permit specific editorial control by any person or subgroups of the project's community.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:40, 23 May 2010 (UTC)
::: Pertinent observation; even if I used &quot;ownership&quot; in a loose, non-legal sense (to mean content and distribution control) it is worthy to keep things clear. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 16:51, 23 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep and Versiontag''' I was pointed here via [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Software_Books_and_software_versions|WB:RR/G]]; you can read my post there for my general position. Basically a way to make it ''extremely clear'' to any viewer that the material applies to a specific version of the software needs to be found and a consensus general guideline would be great to have on top of that. Is there any way to make RevisionReview have ''multiple'' stable versions? Failing that perhaps we can set up some kind of template that works like [[w:Dwarf Fortress|Dwarf Fortress']] wiki handles multiple versions (although without using namespaces) ([http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/DF2010:Alcohol] [http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/40d:Alcohol]). For now at the very least put a notice on all pages summarizing that: 1) These pages represent an old version of the software, 2) Anyone is welcome to contribute material relevant to any version of the software (so long as it's made clear what version the page refers to), and 3) If a page is edited to refer to a new version of the software it should also be edited to reflect that fact.

: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Well... so long as the wikibook is clearly marked as being out of date, I guess that's fine. My goal was never to remove competing sources of information, nor to subvert anyone's creative output. My only issue it that the wikibook currently contains no relevant or useful information, and in my view would only hinder anyone wishing to maintain an up-to-date Compojure wikibook, as it would be easier for any hypothetical maintainer to start from scratch. That said, I understand that removing information, however obsolete and useless, potentially sets a dangerous precedent, and therefore I withdraw my request for deletion.  -- [[User:WeaveJester|WeaveJester]] 19:36, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Elemental analysis''' is the process for determining the partial or complete chemical formula for a substance.  Most commonly, it involves the complete combustion in air or oxygen of the substance and then quantifying the amount of elemental oxides produced.  In the case of organic compounds, the carbon is converted to carbon dioxide and the hydrogen to water.  From these, the percent carbon and percent hydrogen in the substance can be found and compared with a proposed chemical formula for the substance at hand.

Element test: Put a small amount of the solid into a small piece of Na metal then roll it around the solid, followed by introduction into a fusion tube. The tube is heated with a gentle flame at a slow rate (in order not to evaporate N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present in solid) then strong heating till the bottom of the tube become red hot. The tube is then put in a beaker containing a minimal amount of water then heated, cooled, filtered and the filtrate divided into three parts.

1. &lt;u&gt;Test for nitrogen&lt;/u&gt;:
The filtrate and ferrous sulphate are boiled and cooled and dilute sulphuric acid is added. If green or blue color occurs the solid contain nitrogen.

&lt;b&gt;The chemistry behind what happened&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Na+C+N --&gt; NaCN&lt;br&gt;
FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+NaCN gives Fe[CN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fe[CN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+4NaCN give the complex Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;br&gt;
ferrous oxidizes to ferric by the acid so
3Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]+4Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

2. &lt;u&gt;Test for sulphur&lt;/u&gt;:
The filtrate is exposed to dilute acetic acid and lead acetate, yielding a brown or black precipitate. 

&lt;b&gt;The chemistry behind what happened&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Na+S --&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;br&gt;
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S +Pb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields lead sulphide, a black precipitate.

or:
The filtrate and sodium nitro prusside yield a violet color 

Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NO] --&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NOS] = violet color

3. &lt;u&gt;Test for chlorine&lt;/u&gt;:

a) In the absence of N or S:
The filtrate is exposed to dilute nitric acid and silver nitrate. Formation of a white precipitate suggests the presence of chlorine.

b) In the presence of N and/or S :

The filtrate is exposed to dilute sulphoric acid then boiled to 1/3 initial volume and cooled. Formation of a white precipitate after the addition of dilute nitric acid and silver nitrate suggests the presence of chlorine.

&lt;b&gt;Equations&lt;/b&gt;:

NaCN+AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt; AgCN white ppt&lt;br&gt;
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S black ppt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In the presence of N or S these two precipitates may interfere with the white colour of the result of the chlorine test.  Therefore dilute sulphoric acid is added because in the presence of N or S&lt;/b&gt;:
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+ dilute H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;/sub&gt;4 gives H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas
NaCN+ dilulte H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives HCN gas 

There is no interference with the white colour expected from the chlorine test in solid.

[[File:Gas chromatograph.jpg|thumb|Pictured is a sophisticated gas chromatography system. This instrument records concentrations of acrylonitrile in the air at various points throughout the chemical laboratory.]]
'''Chromatography ''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] χρώμα:''chroma'', color and γραφειν:''graphein'' to write) is the collective term for a set of [[laboratory techniques]] for the [[separation of mixtures]]. 
It involves passing a mixture dissolved in a &quot;mobile phase&quot; through a ''stationary phase'', which separates the [[analyte]] to be measured from other molecules in the mixture based on differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases. Subtle differences in a compound's [[partition coefficient]] result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus '''changing''' the separation.

Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for further use (and is thus a form of purification). Analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material and is for measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. The two are not mutually exclusive.

==History==
The '''history of chromatography''' begins during the mid-19th century. Chromatography, literally &quot;color writing&quot;, was used—and named— in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant [[pigments]] such as [[chlorophyll]]. New types of chromatography developed during the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for many types of [[separation process]].

Some related techniques were developed during the 19th century (and even before), but the first true chromatography is usually attributed to Russian botanist [[Mikhail Tsvet|Mikhail Semyonovich Tsvet]], who used columns of calcium carbonate for separating plant pigments during the first decade of the 20th century during his research of [[chlorophyll]].

Chromatography became developed substantially as a result of the work of [[Archer John Porter Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge]] during the 1940s and 1950s. They established the principles and basic techniques of [[partition chromatography]], and their work encouraged the rapid development of several types of chromatography method: [[paper chromatography]], [[gas chromatography]], and what would become known as [[high performance liquid chromatography]]. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Simultaneously, advances continually improved the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.

==Chromatography terms==

*The '''analyte''' is the substance to be separated during chromatography.
*'''Analytical chromatography''' is used to determine the existence and possibly also the concentration of analyte(s) in a sample.
*A '''bonded phase''' is a stationary phase that is covalently bonded to the support particles or to the inside wall of the column tubing. 
*A '''chromatogram''' is the visual output of the chromatograph. In the case of an optimal separation, different peaks or patterns on the chromatogram correspond to different components of the separated mixture. 
:[[File:Rt 5 9.png|300px|Chromatogram with unresolved peaks]] [[File:Rt 5 12.png|300px|Chromatogram with two resolved peaks]]
:Plotted on the x-axis is the retention time and plotted on the y-axis a signal (for example obtained by a [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometer]], [[Mass Spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] or a variety of other detectors) corresponding to the response created by the analytes exiting the system. In the case of an optimal system the signal is proportional to the concentration of the specific analyte separated.
*A '''chromatograph''' is equipment that enables a sophisticated separation e.g. gas chromatographic or liquid chromatographic separation.
*'''Chromatography''' is a physical method of separation in which the components to be separated are distributed between two phases, one of which is stationary (stationary phase) while the other (the mobile phase) moves in a definite direction.
*The '''eluent''' is the mobile phase leaving the column.
*An '''[[eluotropic series]]''' is a list of solvents ranked according to their eluting power.
*An '''immobilized phase''' is a stationary phase which is immobilized on the support particles, or on the inner wall of the column tubing.
*The '''mobile phase''' is the phase which moves in a definite direction. It may be a liquid (LC and CEC), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of [[HPLC]] the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or polar solvents in reverse phase chromotagraphy and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated. 
*'''Preparative chromatography''' is used to purify sufficient quantities of a substance for further use, rather than analysis.
*The '''retention time''' is the characteristic time it takes for a particular analyte to pass through the system (from the column inlet to the detector) under set conditions. See also: [[Kovat's retention index]]
*The '''sample''' is the matter analyzed in chromatography. It may consist of a single component or it may be a mixture of components. When the sample is treated in the course of an analysis, the phase or the phases containing the analytes of interest is/are referred to as the sample whereas everything out of interest separated from the sample before or in the course of the analysis is referred to as waste.
*The '''solute''' refers to the sample components in partition chromatography.
*The '''solvent''' refers to any substance capable of solubilizing other substance, and especially the liquid mobile phase in LC.
*The '''stationary phase''' is the substance which is fixed in place for the chromatography procedure. Examples include the [[silica]] layer in [[Chromatography#Thin layer chromatography|thin layer chromatography]]

==Techniques by chromatographic bed shape==
===Column chromatography===
Column chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1993/pdf/6504x0819.pdf IUPAC Nomenclature for Chromatography] IUPAC Recommendations 1993, Pure &amp; Appl. Chem., Vol. 65, No. 4, pp.819-872, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, W. C. Still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called '''flash column chromatography''' (flash).&lt;ref&gt;Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra, A. ''[[J. Org. Chem.]]'' '''1978''', ''43(14)'', 2923-2925. {{DOI|10.1021/jo00408a041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book

|Number of Pages: 790}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.

In [[expanded bed adsorption]], a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.

===Planar chromatography===
[[File:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpg|right|thumb|75px|Thin layer chromatography is used to separate components of [[chlorophyll]]]]
'''Planar chromatography''' is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed ([[paper chromatography]]) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate ([[thin layer chromatography]]). Different [[chemical compound|compounds]] in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase. The specific [[Retention factor]] (R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.

====Paper chromatography====
Paper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of ''[[chromatography paper]]''. The paper is placed in a jar containing a shallow layer of [[solvent]] and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.

====Thin layer chromatography====
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely employed laboratory technique and is similar to [[paper chromatography]]. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like [[silica gel]], [[aluminium oxide|alumina]], or [[cellulose]] on a flat, inert substrate. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and to allow for quantification, [[HPTLC|high-performance TLC]] can be used.

==Displacement chromatography==
The basic principle of [[displacement chromatography]] is:  
A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) will compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html Displacement Chromatography 101]. Sachem, Inc. Austin, TX 78737&lt;/ref&gt;
There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.

==Techniques by physical state of mobile phase==
===Gas chromatography===
Gas chromatography (GC), also sometimes known as Gas-Liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique in which the mobile  phase is a gas. Gas chromatography is always carried out in a column, which is typically &quot;packed&quot; or &quot;capillary&quot; (see below) .

Gas chromatography (GC) is based on a [[partition equilibrium]] of analyte between a solid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often Helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter glass tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in [[analytical chemistry]]; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat will denature them), frequently encountered in [[biochemistry]], it is well suited for use in the [[petrochemical]], environmental monitoring, and [[Chemical industry|industrial chemical]] fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.

===Liquid chromatography===
Liquid chromatography (LC) is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid. Liquid chromatography can be carried out either in a column or a plane. Present day liquid chromatography that generally utilizes very small packing particles and a relatively high pressure is referred to as [[high performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC).

In the HPLC technique, the sample is forced through a column that is packed with irregularly or spherically shaped particles or a porous monolithic layer (stationary phase) by a liquid (mobile phase) at high pressure. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Technique in which the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g. toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the stationary phase) is called normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g. water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 = octadecylsilyl as the stationary phase) is called reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Ironically the &quot;normal phase&quot; has fewer applications and RPLC is therefore used considerably more. 

Specific techniques which come under this broad heading are listed below. It should also be noted that the following techniques can also be considered [[fast protein liquid chromatography]] if no pressure is used to drive the mobile phase through the stationary phase. See also [[Aqueous Normal Phase Chromatography]].

==Affinity chromatography==
Affinity chromatography&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Bailon, George K. Ehrlich, Wen-Jian Fung and Wolfgang Berthold, An Overview of Affinity Chromatography, Humana Press, 2000. ISBN 978-0-89603-694-9, ISBN 978-1-60327-261-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very [[robust]]. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of [[protein]]s bound to tags. These [[fusion protein]]s are labeled with compounds such as [[His-tag]]s, [[biotin]] or [[antigen]]s, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.

Affinity chromatography often utilizes a biomolecule's affinity for a metal (Zn, Cu, Fe, etc.).  Columns are often manually prepared. Traditional affinity columns are used as a preparative step to flush out unwanted biomolecules.

However, HPLC techniques exist that do utilize affinity chromatogaphy properties.  Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) is useful to separate aforementioned molecules based on the relative affinity for the metal (I.e. Dionex IMAC) .  Often these columns can be loaded with different metals to create a column with a targeted affinty. 

===Supercritical fluid chromatography===
Supercritical fluid chromatography is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a fluid above and relatively close to its critical temperature and pressure.

==Techniques by separation mechanism==
===Ion exchange chromatography===
Ion exchange chromatography uses ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including [[amino acid]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an [[ion exchange resin]] that carries charged [[functional group]]s which interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to be retained. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using [[fast protein liquid chromatography|FPLC]].

===Size exclusion chromatography===
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is also known as '''gel permeation chromatography''' (GPC) or '''gel filtration chromatography''' and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume).
Smaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and, therefore,molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retension; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, &quot;polishing&quot; step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the [[tertiary structure]] and [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins, especially since it can be carried out under native [[solution]] conditions.

==Special techniques==
===Reversed-phase chromatography===
Reversed-phase chromatography is an elution procedure used in liquid chromatography in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase.

===Two-dimensional chromatography===
In some cases, the chemistry within a given column can be insufficient to separate some analytes. It is possible to direct a series of unresolved peaks onto a second column with different physico-chemical ([[Chemical classification]]) properties. Since the mechanism of retention on this new solid support is different from the first dimensional separation, it can be possible to separate compounds that are indistinguishable by one-dimensional chromatography.
The sample is spotted at one corner of a square plate,developed, air-dried, then rotated by 90° and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system.

===Simulated moving-bed chromatography===

===Pyrolysis gas chromatography===

===Fast protein liquid chromatography===
Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) is a term applied to several chromatography techniques which are used to purify proteins. Many of these techniques are identical to those carried out under high performance liquid chromatography, however use of FPLC techniques are typically for preparing large scale batches of a purified product.

===Countercurrent chromatography===
Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a type of liquid-liquid chromatography, where both the stationary and mobile phases are liquids. It involves mixing a solution of liquids, allowing them to settle into layers and then separating the layers.

===Chiral chromatography===
Chiral chromatography involves the separation of stereoisomers. In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. Conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them. To enable chiral separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral, giving differing affinities between the analytes. Chiral chromatography HPLC columns (with a chiral stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.

'''Affinity chromatography''' is a method of separating [[biochemistry|biochemical]] mixtures and based on a highly specific biological interaction such as that between antigen and antibody, enzyme and [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], or [[biochemistry receptor|receptor]] and [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]].  Affinity chromatography combines the size fractionation capability of [[gel permeation chromatography]] with the ability to design a chromatography that reversibly binds to a known subset of molecules. The method was by Cuatrecasas P, Wilchek M,and Meir Wilchek for which the Wolf Prize in Medicine was awarded in 1987. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, affinity chromatography has been the means by which many scientists from different disciplines have been introduced in to the fields of modern biology {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.
==Uses==

Affinity chromatography can be used to:
* Purify and concentrate a substance from a mixture into a buffering solution 

* Reduce the amount of a substance in a mixture

* Discern what biological compounds bind to a particular substance, such as drugs

* Purify and concentrate an enzyme solution.

==Principle==

The immobile phase is typically a gel matrix, often of agarose; a linear sugar molecule derived from algae.&lt;ref&gt;Voet and Voet, Biochemistry John Wiley and Sons; 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually the starting point is an undefined heterogeneous group of molecules in solution, such as a cell lysate, growth medium or blood [[blood plasma|serum]]. The molecule of interest will have a well known and defined property which can be exploited during the affinity purification process. The process itself can be thought of as an entrapment, with the target molecule becoming trapped on a solid or stationary phase or medium. The other molecules in solution will not become trapped as they do not possess this property. The solid medium can then be removed from the mixture, washed and the target molecule released from the entrapment in a process known as elution. Possibly the most common use of affinity chromotography is for the purification  of recombinant proteins.

==Batch and column setup==
[[Image:Affinity-column.png|right|thumb|Column chromatography|170px]]
Binding to the solid phase may be achieved by column chromatography whereby the solid medium is packed onto a column, the initial mixture run through the column to allow setting, a wash buffer run through the column and the elution buffer subsequently applied to the column and collected. These steps are usually done at ambient pressure. 
Alternatively binding may be achieved using a batch treatment, by adding the initial mixture to the solid phase in a vessel, mixing, separating the solid phase (for example), removing the liquid phase, washing, re-centrifuging, adding the elution buffer, re-centrifuging and removing the eluate.

Sometimes a hybrid method is employed, the binding is done by the batch method, then the solid phase with the target molecule bound is packed onto a column and washing and elution are done on the column.

A third method,expanded bed adsorption, which combines the advantages of the two methods mentioned above, has also been developed. The solid phase particles are placed in a column where liquid phase is pumped in from the bottom and exits at the top. The gravity of the particles ensure that the solid phase does not exit the column with the liquid phase.

==Specific uses==

Affinity chromatography can be used in a number of applications, including nucleic acid purification, protein purification from cell free extracts, and purification from blood.

===Immunoaffinity===

Another use for the procedure is the affinity purification of antibodies from blood serum. If serum is known to contain antibodies against a specific antigen (for example if the serum comes from an organism against the antigen concerned) then it can be used for the affinity purification of that antigen. This is also known as Immunoaffinity Chromatography. For example if an organism is immunised against a GST-fusion protein it will produce antibodies against the fusion-protein, and possibly antibodies against the GST tag as well. The protein can then be covalently coupled to a solid support such as agarose 

For thoroughness the GST protein and the GST-fusion protein can each be coupled separately. The serum is initially allowed to bind to the GST affinity matrix. This will remove antibodies against the GST part of the fusion protein. The serum is then separated from the solid support and allowed to bind to the GST-fusion protein matrix. This allows any antibodies that recognize the antigen to be captured on the solid support. Elution of the antibodies of interest is most often achieved using a low [[pH]] buffer such as glycine pH 2.8. The eluate is collected into a neutral [[tris]] or phosphate buffer, to neutralize the low pH elution buffer and halt any degradation of the antibody's activity. This is a nice example as affinity purification is used to purify the initial GST-fusion protein, to remove the undesirable anti-GST antibodies from the serum and to purify the target antibody.

A simplified strategy is often employed to purify antibodies generated against peptide [[antigen]]s. When the peptide antigens are produced synthetically, a terminal [[cysteine]] residue is added at either the N- or C-terminus of the peptide. This cysteine residue contains a [[sulfhydryl]] functional group which allows the peptide to be easily conjugated to a carrier protein (e.g.Keyhole limpet hemocyaninKLH). The same cysteine-containing peptide is also immobilized onto an agarose resin through the cysteine residue and is then used to purify the antibody.

===Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography===

Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) is based on the specific coordinate covalent bond of amino acids, particularly histidine, to metals.  This technique works by allowing proteins with an affinity for metal ions to be retained in a column containing immobilized metal ions, such as cobalt, nickel, copper for the purification of histidine containing proteins or peptides, iron,zinc or gallium for the purification of phosphorylated proteins or peptides. Many naturally occurring proteins do not have an affinity for metal ions, therefore [[recombinant DNA technology]] can be used to introduce such a protein tag into the relevant gene. Methods used to elute the protein of interest include changing the pH, or adding a competitive molecule, such as imidazole.

===Recombinant proteins===

Possibly the most common use of affinity chromatography is for the purification of recombinant proteins. Proteins with a known affinity are [[protein tag|protein tagged]] in order to aid their purification. The protein may have been genetically modified so as to allow it to be selected for affinity binding, this is known as a fusion protein. Tags include glutathione-S-transferase tags. have an affinity for nickel or cobalt ions which are Coordinate covalent bond|coordinated] with a chelator for the purposes of solid medium entrapment. For elution, an excess amount of a compound able to act as a metal ion ligand, such as imidazole, is used. GST has an affinity for glutathione -commercially available immobilized as glutathione agarose. For elution, excess glutathione is used to displace the tagged protein.

===Lectins===

Lectin affinity chromatography is a form of affinity chromatography where lectins are used to separate components within the sample. Lectins, such as [[Concanavalin A]] are proteins which can bind specific carbohydrate (sugar) molecules. The most common application is to separate proteins based on their Glycosylation groups.

[[Image:P1000495.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Typical set up for manual column chromatography.]]
[[Image:Colortest.jpg|frame|right|A chemist in the 1950s using column chromatography.  The Erlenmeyer receptacles are on the floor.]]
'''Column chromatography''' in [[chemistry]] is a method used to purify individual [[chemical compounds]] from mixtures of compounds.  It is often used for preparative applications on scales from micrograms up to kilograms.

The classical preparative chromatography column, is a glass tube with a diameter from 5&amp;nbsp;mm to 50&amp;nbsp;mm and a height of 50&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 m with a tap at the bottom. Two methods are generally used to prepare a column; the dry method, and the wet method. For the dry method, the column is first filled with dry [[Chromatography#Chromatography_terms|stationary phase]] powder, followed by the addition of mobile phase, which is flushed through the column until it is completely wet, and from this point is never allowed to run dry. For the wet method, a [[slurry]] is prepared of the [[eluent]] with the [[Chromatography#Chromatography_terms|stationary phase]] powder and then carefully poured into the column. Care must be taken to avoid air bubbles. A solution of the organic material is pipetted on top of the stationary phase. This layer is usually topped with a small layer of sand or with cotton or glass wool to protect the shape of the organic layer from the velocity of newly added eluent. Eluent is slowly passed through the column to advance the organic material. Often a spherical eluent reservoir or an eluent-filled and stoppered [[separating funnel]] is put on top of the column.

The individual components are retained by the stationary phase differently and separate from each other while they are running at different speeds through the column with the eluent. At the end of the column they elute one at a time. During the entire chromatography process the eluent is collected in a series of [[fractionation|fraction]]s. The composition of the eluent flow can be monitored and each fraction is analyzed for dissolved compounds, e.g. by analytical chromatography, [[Ultraviolet|UV]] absorption, or [[fluorescence]]. Colored compounds (or [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] compounds with the aid of an [[Ultraviolet|UV]] lamp) can be seen through the glass wall as moving bands.

==Overview==
[[Image:Column chromatography sequence.png|600px|thumb|Column chromatography proceeds by a series of steps.]]

== Stationary phase

The ''stationary phase'' or ''adsorbent'' in column chromatography is a solid. The most common stationary phase for column chromatography is [[silica gel]], followed by [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. [[Cellulose]] powder has often been used in the past. Also possible are [[ion exchange chromatography]], [[reversed-phase chromatography]] (RP), [[affinity chromatography]] or [[expanded bed adsorption]] (EBA). The stationary phases are usually finely ground powders or gels and/or are microporous for an increased surface, though in EBA a fluidized bed is used.'''

== Mobile phase (eluent) ==

The ''mobile phase'' or ''[[eluent]]'' is either a pure [[solvent]] or a mixture of different solvents. It is chosen so that the [[retention factor]] value of the compound of interest is roughly around 0.2 - 0.3 in order to minimize the time and the amount of eluent to run the chromatography. The eluent has also been chosen so that the different compounds can be separated effectively. The eluent is optimized in small scale pretests, often using [[chromatography|thin layer chromatography]] (TLC) with the same stationary phase.

A faster [[flow rate]] of the eluent minimizes the time required to run a column and thereby minimizes diffusion, resulting in a better separation, see [[Van Deemter's equation]].  A simple laboratory column runs by [[gravity]] flow.  The flow rate of such a column can be increased by extending the fresh eluent filled column above the top of the stationary phase or decreased by the tap controls.  Better flow rates can be achieved by using a pump or by using compressed gas (e.g. air, [[nitrogen]], or [[argon]]) to push the solvent through the column (flash column chromatography).&lt;ref&gt;Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra, A. ''[[J. Org. Chem.]]'' '''1978''', ''43(14)'', 2923-2925. ({{DOI|10.1021/jo00408a041}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book

The particle size of the stationary phase is generally finer in flash column chromatography than in gravity column chromatography. For example, one of the most widely used silica gel grades in the former technique is mesh 230 – 400 (40 – 63 µm), while the latter technique typically requires mesh 70 – 230 (63 – 200 µm) silica gel.&lt;ref&gt;Normal phase column chromatography, [http://www.materialharvest.com/welcome/silica_products/silica_gels_chromatography.html Material Harvest]&lt;/ref&gt;

A spreadsheet that assists in the successful development of flash columns has been developed. The spreadsheet estimates the retention volume and band volume of analytes, the fraction numbers expected to contain each analyte, and the resolution between adjacent peaks. This information allows users to select optimal parameters for preparative-scale separations before the flash column itself is attempted.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, J. D.; Kormos, C. M. ''[[J. Chromatogr. A]]'' '''2008''', ''1211''(1-2), 49-54. ({{DOI|10.1016/j.chroma.2008.09.085}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automated Systems ==
[[Image:Metrohm 850.jpg|thumb|right|An automated ion chromatography system.]]
Column chromatography is an extremely time consuming stage in any lab and can quickly become the bottleneck for any process lab.  Therefore, several manufacturers have developed automated flash chromatography systems (typically referred to as LPLC, low pressure liquid chromatography, around 50-75 psi) that minimize human involvement in the purification process.  Automated systems will include components normally found on more expensive HPLC systems such as a gradient pump, sample injection ports, a UV detector and a fraction collector to collect the eluent.  Typically these automated systems can separate samples from a few milligrams up to an industrial kg scale and offer a much cheaper and quicker solution to doing multiple injections on prep-HPLC systems.

The resolution (or the ability to separate a mixture) on an LPLC system will always be lower compared to HPLC, as the packing material in an HPLC column can be much smaller, typically only 5 micrometre thus increasing stationary phase surface area, increasing surface interactions and giving better separation.  However, the use of this small packing media causes the high back pressure and is why it is termed high pressure liquid chromatography.  The LPLC columns are typically packed with silica of around 50 micrometres, thus reducing back pressure and resolution, but it also removes the need for expensive high pressure pumps.  Manufacturers are now starting to move into higher pressure flash chromatography systems and have termed these as medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) systems which operate above 150 psi.

The software controlling an automated system will coordinate the components, allow a user to only collect the factions that contain their target compound (assuming they are detectable on the system's detector) and help the user to find the resulting purified material within the fraction collector.  The software will also save the resulting chromatograph from the process for archival and/or later recall purposes.

A representative example of column chromatography as part of an undergraduate laboratory exercise is the separation of three components (out of 28) in the oil of [[spearmint]]: [[carvone]], [[limonene]] and [[dehydrocarveol]] &lt;ref&gt;''Isolation of Three Components from Spearmint Oil: An Exercise in Column and Thin-Layer Chromatography'' Davies, Don R.; Johnson, Todd M. J. Chem. Educ. '''2007''' 84[http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2007/Feb/abs318.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;. A [[microscale chemistry|microscale]] setup consisting of a [[Pasteur pipette]] as column with silica gel stationary phase can suffice. The starting eluent is [[hexane]] and solvent [[Chemical polarity|polarity]] is increased during the process by adding [[ethyl acetate]].

== Column Chromatogram Resolution Calculation ==

Typically, column chromatography is set up with peristaltic pumps flowing buffers and the solution sample through the top of the column.  The solutions and buffers pass through the column where a fraction collector at the end of the column setup collects the eluted samples.  Prior to the fraction collection, the samples that are eluted from the column pass through a detector such as a [[spectrophotometer]] or [[mass spectrometer]] so that the concentration of the separated samples in the sample solution mixture can be determined.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if you were to separate two different proteins with different binding capacities to the column from a solution sample, a good type of detector would be a spectrophotometer using a wavelength of 280&amp;nbsp;nm.  The higher the concentration of protein that passes through the eluted solution through the column, the higher the absorbance of that wavelength.
&lt;br /&gt;
Because the column chromatography has a constant flow of eluted solution passing through the detector at varying concentrations, the detector must plot the concentration of the eluted sample over a course of time.  This plot of sample concentration versus time is called a chromatogram.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ultimate goal of chromatography is to separate different components from a solution mixture.  The resolution expresses the extent of separation between the components from the mixture.  The higher the resolution of the chromatogram, the better the extent of separation of the samples the column gives.  This data is a good way of determining the column’s separation properties of that particular sample.  The resolution can be calculated from the chromatogram.
&lt;br /&gt;
The separate curves in the diagram represent different sample elution concentration profiles over time based on their affinity to the column resin.  To calculate resolution, the retention time and curve width are required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Retention Time:''' The time from the start of signal detection by the detector to the peak height of the elution concentration profile of each different sample.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Curve Width:''' The width of the concentration profile curve of the different samples in the chromatogram in units of time.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A simplified method of calculating chromatogram resolution is to use the plate model&lt;ref name= &quot;Harrison&quot;&gt;Harrison et al.  ''Bioseparations Science and Engineering''.  Oxford University Press.  New York, New York.  2003&lt;/ref&gt;.  The plate model assumes that the column can be divided into a certain number of sections, or plates and the mass balance can be calculated for each individual plate.  This approach approximates a typical chromatogram curve as a [[Gaussian distribution]] curve.  By doing this, the curve width is estimated as 4 times the standard deviation of the curve, 4σ.  The retention time is the time from the start of signal detection to the time of the peak height of the Gaussian curve.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the variables in the figure above, the resolution, plate number, and plate height of the column plate model can be calculated using the equations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Resolution (R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;
	 R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 2(t&lt;sub&gt;RB&lt;/sub&gt; – t&lt;sub&gt;RA&lt;/sub&gt;)/(w&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + w&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
Where:&lt;br /&gt;
	t&lt;sub&gt;RB&lt;/sub&gt; = retention time of solute B&lt;br /&gt;
	t&lt;sub&gt;RA&lt;/sub&gt; = retention time of solute A&lt;br /&gt;
	w&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = Gaussian curve width of solute B&lt;br /&gt;
	w&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = Gaussian curve width of solute A&lt;br /&gt;
Plate Number (N):&lt;br /&gt;
	N = (t&lt;sub&gt;R2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(w/4)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Plate Height (H):&lt;br /&gt;
	H = L/N&lt;br /&gt;
Where L is the length of the column.&lt;ref name= &quot;Harrison&quot;/&gt;

== Column Adsorption Equilibrium ==

For an adsorption column, the column resin (the stationary phase) is composed of microbeads.  Even smaller particles such as proteins, carbohydrates, metal ions, or other chemical compounds are conjugated onto the microbeads.  Each binding particle that is attached to the microbead can be assumed to bind in a 1:1 ratio with the solute sample sent through the column that needs to be purified or separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Binding between the target molecule to be separated and the binding molecule on the column beads can be modeled using a simple equilibrium reaction K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = [CS]/([C][S]) where K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[equilibrium constant]], [C] and [S] are the concentrations of the target molecule and the binding molecule on the column resin, respectively.  [CS] is the concentration of the complex of the target molecule bound to the column resin.&lt;ref name= &quot;Harrison&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Using this as a basis, three different isotherms can be used to describe the binding dynamics of a column chromatography: linear, Langmuir, and Freundlich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The linear isotherm occurs when the solute concentration needed to be purified is very small relative to the binding molecule of the.  Thus, the equilibrium can be defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
[CS] = K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;[C].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For industrial scale uses, the total binding molecules on the column resin beads must be factored in because unoccupied sites must be taken into account.  The [[Langmuir isotherm]] and Freundlich isotherm are useful in describing this equilibrium.
Langmuir Isotherm:&lt;br /&gt;
[CS] = (K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;[C])/(1 + K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;[C]), where S&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; is the total binding molecules on the beads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Freundlich Isotherm:&lt;br /&gt;
[CS] = K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;[C]&lt;sup&gt;1/n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Freundlich isotherm is used when the column can bind to many different samples in the solution that needs to be purified.  Because the many different samples have different binding constants to the beads, there are many different Keq’s.  Therefore, the Langmuir isotherm is not a good model for binding in this case.&lt;ref name= &quot;Harrison&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Discovery==
The advent of displacement chromatography can be attributed to Tiselius &lt;ref&gt;A. Tiselius. Displacement development in adsorption analysis.  Ark. Kemi. Mineral Geol. 16A: 1–18    (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;, who in 1943 first classified the modes of chromatography as frontal, elution, and displacement. Displacement chromatography has since found a variety of applications from isolation of transuranic elements &lt;ref&gt;G. T. Seaborg. The Transuranium Elements. Science 104(2704):379-386 (1946).	&lt;/ref&gt; to biochemical entities &lt;ref&gt;J. Frenz and C.S. Horvath.  High performance displacement chromatography.  pp 212-314 in  C. Horvath (Ed.) High Performance Liquid Chromatography-advances and perspectives. Vol. 5, Academic Press, San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Displacement chromatography is a chromatographic method in which the components are resolved into consecutive  “rectangular” zones of highly concentrated pure substances rather than solvent separated “peaks”. The molecules are forced to migrate down the column by an advancing wave of a displacer molecule that has a higher affinity for the stationary phase than the feed solute. &lt;ref&gt;N. Tugcu .  Purification of proteins using displacement chromatography.  pp 71-89 in M. Zachariou (Ed.)  Methods in Molecular Biology: Vol 421 Affinity Chromatography: Methods and Protocols. 2nd edition. Humana Press, Totowa NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this forced migration, higher product concentrations and purities may be obtained compared to other modes of chromatography.  The technique was rediscovered by Horvath &lt;ref&gt;C.S. Horvath, A. Nahum, and J. Frenz. High performance displacement
chromatography. J. Chromatogr. 218, 365–393(1981).
&lt;/ref&gt; and has since found many applications, particularly in the realm of biological macromolecule purification.

==Principle==
The basic principle of displacement chromatography is:   
A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) will compete effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities.&lt;ref&gt;Displacement Chromatography 101.  [http://www.sacheminc.com/industries/biotechnology/teaching-tools.html] Sachem, Inc. Austin, TX 78737&lt;/ref&gt;
There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks.  Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired in order to achieve maximum purification.  The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors.  But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix.  Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference.  In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings.  Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings.  Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.

==Theory and method==
As shown above, a displacement chromatography process can be broken down into three distinct phases:  loading, displacement, and regeneration.  For the sake of simplicity, examples of biomolecule purification given here will be restricted to proteins.  In principle, all biomolecules of commercial interest today – including oligonucleotides and antibodies – can be purified in displacement mode, with the right choice of column matrix and displacer.

'''Loading phase'''&lt;br /&gt;
The purification starts with a column equilibrated with a loading buffer similar to elution chromatography methods.  The feed mixture containing the impure proteins in buffer is loaded onto the column at a fairly slow rate, under conditions where the materials are well retained.  The purpose of this step is to initiate the binding of the biomolecules in a semiequilibrium state. This is shown in the graphic as the mixture of proteins begins an early separation into yellow and purple components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Displacement phase'''&lt;br /&gt;
After the sample has been loaded, the column is fed a solution of displacer at a fairly low concentration (typically 5 mM) in the same buffer used to load the sample.  The displacer is designed to bind more tightly to the matrix than any of the biomolecules and thus &quot;pushes&quot; all components of the mixture off the matrix ahead of it.  As long as each sample component and the displacer is not irreversibly adsorbed on the column matrix, there is some of each continually adsorbing to, and desorbing from, the matrix.  

In elution mode, optimal results are obtained when concentrations are so low that individual components act independently and do not compete for binding sites on the matrix.  In displacement mode, sample components are introduced in much more concentrated form, and so it is possible for a stronger binding component – either the displacer or one of the proteins in the sample mixture – to compete for binding sites.  The stronger binding components (initially, the displacer itself) then displace by successfully competing for binding sites. 
Based on their individual binding strengths, each component in the original sample then becomes a “displacer” for the next less tightly bound component.  Thus a displacement train is established as adjacent, focused bands with little overlap (yellow and purple in the graphic).  In a successful run, the train is fully established before the components of interest arrive at the bottom of the column.  Fractions can be collected and the desired product cuts made.

'''Regeneration phase'''&lt;br /&gt;
When the displacer breaks through, i.e., begins to emerge from the column, the run is complete and column regeneration can begin.  Regeneration is accomplished by using a buffer that can remove the displacer from the matrix, followed by an equilibration with loading buffer in preparation for the next run.  Since displacers must bind more strongly than any protein being purified, it is to be expected that their removal from the column should require some special conditions.  A non-trivial part of the design of a good displacer, then, is the incorporation of some structural feature that allows for complete removal from the matrix under some conditions.

'''Advantages of displacement chromatography'''&lt;br /&gt;
An important distinction between displacement and step gradient chromatography is that the displacer front always remains behind the adjacent feed zones in the displacement train whereas desorbents (e.g., salts in ion exchange, organic modifiers in reversed-phase chromatography) move through the feed zones. The displacement mode of chromatography takes advantage of the thermodynamic characteristics of the chromatographic system to overcome many of the shortcomings of preparative elution and gradient chromatography. This characteristic of displacement makes it less sensitive to the feed loads than the elution modes of operation, thus enabling it to deliver higher process throughputs. Another advantage is the high resolution that displacement can deliver as compared to elution processes. Displacement  chromatography exploits the nonlinear, multicomponent competition among the components to be separated, resulting in higher resolution, particularly among closely related species. In contrast, in elution processes (e.g., linear gradient, step gradient), the separation takes place under relatively weaker binding conditions (which are essential to get the solutes off the column). The separation factors among solutes are thus lower in elution than in displacement, leading to poorer resolution in the elution modes of operation. Other advantages of displacement include a better control over the product concentrations and the emergence of the product in relatively low concentrations of the mobile phase modifier. The combination of high throughputs and high resolutions in a single process makes displacement an attractive mode of operation for protein purification.

==Applications==
The chromatographic purification of proteins from complex mixtures can be quite challenging, particularly when the mixtures contain similarly retained proteins or when it is desired to enrich trace components in the feed. Further, column loading is often limited when high resolutions are required using traditional modes of chromatography (e.g. linear gradient, isocratic chromatography). In these cases, displacement chromatography is an efficient technique for the purification of proteins from complex mixtures at high column loadings in a variety of applications.
An important advance in the state of the art of displacement chromatography was the development of low molecular mass displacers for protein purification in ion exchange systems.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Cramer and G. Jayaraman, Current Opinions in Biotechnology 4: 217-225, (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;G. Jayaraman, S. Gadam, and S. M. Cramer. J. Chromatogr. A 630:53-68. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;G. Jayaraman, Y. Li, J. A. Moore, and S. M. Cramer. J. Chromatogr. A 702:143-155. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;. This research was significant in that it represented a major departure from the conventional wisdom that large polyelectrolyte polymers are required to displace proteins in ion exchange systems.
Low molecular mass displacers have significant operational advantages as compared to large polyelectrolyte displacers. For example, if there is any overlap between the displacer and the protein of interest, these low molecular mass materials can be readily separated from the purified protein during post-displacement processing using standard size-based purification methods (e.g. size exclusion chromatography, ultrafiltration). In addition, the salt dependent adsorption behavior of these low MW displacers greatly facilitates column regeneration. These displacers have been employed for a wide variety of high resolution separations in ion exchange systems&lt;ref&gt;A. Kundu, S. Vunnum, G.  Jayaraman, and S. M. Cramer. Biotech. and Bioeng. 48: 452-460. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;A. Kundu, S.  Vunnum, and S. M. Cramer.  J. Chromatogr. A, 707:57-67. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;A. Kundu, S. Vunnum, and S. M.

A 923:65-73(2001)&lt;/ref&gt; has also been demonstrated. There are several examples in which displacement chromatography has been applied to the purification of proteins using ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, as well as reversed phase chromatography &lt;ref&gt;R. Freitag and J. Breier. J. Chromatogr. A 691, 101–112 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Displacement chromatography is well suited for obtaining mg quantities of purified proteins from complex mixtures using standard analytical chromatography columns at the bench scale. It is also particularly well suited for enriching trace components in the feed. Displacement chromatography can be readily carried out using a variety of resin systems including, ion exchange, HIC and RPLC &lt;ref&gt;Trace Component Amplification.

[[Two-dimensional chromatography]] represents the most thorough and rigorous approach to evaluation of the proteome. While previously accepted approaches have utilized elution mode chromatographic approaches such as cation exchange to reversed phase HPLC, yields are typically very low requiring analytical sensitivities in the picomolar to femptomolar range &lt;ref&gt;.

As Displacement chromatography offers the advantage of concentration of trace components, two dimensional chromatography utilizing displacement rather than elution mode in the upstream chromatography step represents a potentially powerful tool for analysis of trace components, modifications, and identification of minor expressed components of the proteome.&lt;ref&gt;  2D-HPLC Course SACHEM, Inc.

'''Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)''', or simply '''gas chromatography (GC)''', is a common type of [[chromatography]] used in [[organic chemistry]] for [[Separation process|separating]] and analyzing compounds that can be [[vaporized]] without [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]]. Typical uses of GC include testing the purity of a particular substance, or separating the different components of a mixture (the relative amounts of such components can also be determined). In some situations, GC may help in identifying a compound. In [[microscale chemistry]], GC can be used to prepare pure compounds from a mixture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavia&quot; &gt;{{cite book | author = Pavia, Donald L., Gary M. Lampman, George S. Kritz, Randall G. Engel | title = Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques (4th Ed.) | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole| pages = 797-817 | year = 2006 | id = ISBN 978-0-495-28069-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In gas chromatography, the ''moving phase'' (or &quot;mobile phase&quot;) is a carrier [[gas]], usually an [[inert]] gas such as [[helium]] or an [[Reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] gas such as [[nitrogen]]. The ''stationary phase'' is a microscopic layer of [[liquid]] or [[polymer]] on an inert [[solid]] support, inside a piece of [[glass]] or [[metal]] tubing called a column. The instrument used to perform gas chromatography is called a ''gas chromatograph'' (or &quot;aerograph&quot;, &quot;gas separator&quot;).

The gaseous compounds being analyzed interact with the walls of the column, which is coated with different stationary phases. This causes each compound to [[Elution|elute]] at a different time, known as the ''retention time'' of the compound. The comparison of retention times is what gives GC its analytical usefulness.

Gas chromatography is in principle similar to [[column chromatography]] (as well as other forms of chromatography, such as [[HPLC]], [[Thin layer chromatography|TLC]]), but has several notable differences. Firstly, the process of separating the compounds in a mixture is carried out between a liquid stationary phase and a gas moving phase, whereas in column chromatography the stationary phase is a solid and the moving phase is a liquid. (Hence the full name of the procedure is &quot;Gas-liquid chromatography&quot;, referring to the mobile and stationary phases, respectively.) Secondly, the column through which the gas phase passes is located in an [[oven]] where the [[temperature]] of the gas can be controlled, whereas column chromatography (typically) has no such temperature control. Thirdly, the [[concentration]] of a compound in the gas phase is solely a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[vapor pressure]] of the gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavia&quot; /&gt;

Gas chromatography is also similar to [[fractional distillation]], since both processes separate the components of a mixture primarily based on [[boiling point]] (or vapor pressure) differences. However, fractional distillation is typically used to separate components of a mixture on a large scale, whereas GC can be used on a much smaller scale (i.e. microscale).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavia&quot; /&gt;

Gas chromatography is also sometimes known as '''vapor-phase chromatography''' (VPC), or '''gas-liquid partition chromatography''' (GLPC). These alternative names, as well as their respective abbreviations, are frequently found in [[scientific literature]]. Strictly speaking, GLPC is the most correct terminology, and is thus preferred by many authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pavia&quot; /&gt;

== History ==

[[Chromatography]] dates to 1903 in the work of the [[Russia]]n scientist, [[Mikhail Semenovich Tswett]]. [[Germany|German]] graduate student [[Fritz Prior]] developed solid state gas chromatography in 1947.  [[Archer John Porter Martin]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for his work in developing liquid-liquid (1941) and paper (1944) chromatography, laid the foundation for the development of gas chromatography and later produced liquid-gas chromatography (1950).

== GC analysis ==

A '''gas chromatograph''' is a chemical analysis instrument for separating [[chemical]]s in a complex sample.  A gas chromatograph uses a flow-through narrow tube known as the ''column'', through which different chemical constituents of a sample pass in a gas stream (carrier gas, ''mobile phase'') at different rates depending on their various chemical and physical properties and their interaction with a specific column filling, called the ''stationary phase''. As the chemicals exit the end of the column, they are detected and identified [[electronics|electronically]]. The function of the stationary phase in the column is to separate different components, causing each one to exit the column at a different time (''retention time''). Other parameters that can be used to alter the order or time of retention are the carrier gas flow rate, and the temperature.

In a GC analysis, a known volume of gaseous or liquid [[analyte]] is injected into the &quot;entrance&quot; (head) of the column, usually using a micro[[syringe]] (or, solid phase microextraction fibers, or a gas source switching system).  As the carrier gas sweeps the analyte molecules through the column, this motion is inhibited by the [[adsorption]] of the analyte [[molecule]]s either onto the column walls or onto packing materials in the column. The rate at which the molecules progress along the column depends on the strength of [[adsorption]], which in turn depends on the type of molecule and on the stationary phase materials. Since each type of molecule has a different rate of progression, the various components of the analyte mixture are separated as they progress along the column and reach the end of the column at different times (retention time). A detector is used to monitor the outlet stream from the column; thus, the time at which each component reaches the outlet and the amount of that component can be determined.  Generally, substances are identified (qualitatively) by the order in which they emerge (elute) from the column and by the retention time of the analyte in the column.

== Physical components ==
[[Image:Gas chromatograph.png|thumb|350px|right|Diagram of a gas chromatograph.]]
=== Autosamplers ===

The autosampler provides the means to introduce a sample automatically into the inlets. Manual insertion of the sample is possible but is no longer common. Automatic insertion provides better reproducibility and time-optimization.

Different kinds of autosamplers exist. Autosamplers can be classified in relation to sample capacity (auto-injectors vs. autosamplers, where auto-injectors can work a small number of samples), to robotic technologies (XYZ robot vs. rotating/SCARA-robot – the most common), or to analysis:
* '''Liquid'''
* '''Static head-space by syringe technology'''
* '''Dynamic head-space by transfer-line technology'''
* '''[[Solid phase microextraction|SPME]]'''

Traditionally autosampler manufacturers are different from GC manufacturers and currently no GC manufacturer offers a complete range of autosamplers. Historically, the countries most active in autosampler technology development are the United States, Italy, and Switzerland.

=== Inlets ===

The '''column inlet''' (or ''injector'') provides the means to introduce a sample into a continuous flow of carrier gas. The inlet is a piece of hardware attached to the ''column head''. 

&lt;u&gt;Common inlet types are:&lt;/u&gt;
* '''S/SL (Split/Splitless) injector'''; a sample is introduced into a heated small chamber via a syringe through a ''septum'' - the heat facilitates [[volatilization]] of the sample and sample matrix. The carrier gas then either sweeps the entirety (''splitless'' mode) or a portion (''split'' mode) of the sample into the column. In split mode, a part of the sample/carrier gas mixture in the injection chamber is exhausted through the ''split vent''. Split injection is preferred when working with samples with high analyte concentrations (&gt;0.1%) whereas splitless injection is best suited for trace analysis with low amounts of analytes. (&lt;0.01%)
* '''On-column inlet'''; the sample is here introduced in its entirety without heat. 
* '''PTV injector'''; Temperature-programmed sample introduction was first described by Vogt in 1979. Originally Vogt developed the technique as a method for the introduction of large sample volumes (up to 250 µL) in capillary GC. Vogt introduced the sample into the liner at a controlled injection rate. The temperature of the liner was chosen slightly below the boiling point of the solvent. The low-boiling solvent was continuously evaporated and vented through the split line. Based on this technique, Poy developed the Programmed Temperature Vaporising injector; PTV. By introducing the sample at a low initial liner temperature many of the disadvantages of the classic hot injection techniques could be circumvented.
* '''Gas source inlet''' or '''gas switching valve'''; gaseous samples in collection bottles are connected to what is most commonly a six-port ''switching valve''.  The carrier gas flow is not interrupted while a sample can be expanded into a previously evacuated ''sample loop''. Upon switching, the contents of the sample loop are inserted into the carrier gas stream. 
* '''P/T (Purge-and-Trap) system''';  An inert gas is bubbled through an aqueous sample causing insoluble volatile chemicals to be purged from the matrix.  The volatiles are 'trapped' on an absorbent column (known as a trap or concentrator) at ambient temperature.  The trap is then heated and the volatiles are directed into the carrier gas stream.  Samples requiring preconcentration or purification can be introduced via such a system, usually hooked up to the S/SL port. 
* '''[[Solid phase microextraction|SPME]]''' (solid phase microextraction) offers a convenient, low-cost alternative to P/T systems with the versatility of a syringe and simple use of the S/SL port.

=== Columns ===

Two types of columns are used in GC:
*'''Packed columns''' are 1.5 - 10 m in length and have an internal diameter of 2 - 4 mm.  The tubing is usually made of stainless steel or glass and contains a ''packing'' of finely divided, inert, solid support material (e.g. [[diatomaceous earth]]) that is coated with a liquid or solid stationary phase.  The nature of the coating material determines what type of materials will be most strongly adsorbed.  Thus numerous columns are available that are designed to separate specific types of compounds. 
*'''Capillary columns''' have a very small internal diameter, on the order of a few tenths of millimeters, and lengths between 25-60 meters are common. The inner column walls are coated with the active materials (WCOT columns), some columns are quasi solid filled with many parallel micropores (PLOT columns).  Most capillary columns are made of fused-[[silica]] with a [[polyimide]] outer coating. These columns are flexible, so a very long column can be wound into a small coil. 
*'''New developments''' are sought where stationary phase incompatibilities lead to geometric solutions of parallel columns within one column. Among these new developments are: 
** Internally heated ''microFAST'' columns, where two columns, an internal heating wire and a temperature sensor are combined within a common column sheath ([http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04012004-193144 microFAST]);
** ''[http://www.restek.com/restek/images/external/620-04-001.pdf Micropacked columns]'' (1/16&quot; OD) are column-in-column packed columns where the outer column space has a packing different from the inner column space, thus providing the separation behaviour of two columns in one. They can easily fit to inlets and detectors of a capillary column instrument. 

The '''temperature-dependence''' of molecular adsorption and of the rate of progression along the column necessitates a careful control of the column [[temperature]] to within a few tenths of a degree for precise work.  Reducing the temperature produces the greatest level of separation, but can result in very long elution times.  For some cases temperature is ramped either continuously or in steps to provide the desired separation.  This is referred to as a '''temperature program'''.  Electronic pressure control can also be used to modify flow rate during the analysis, aiding in faster run times while keeping acceptable levels of separation.

The '''choice of carrier gas''' (''mobile phase'') is important, with hydrogen being the most efficient and providing the best separation.  However, helium has a larger range of flowrates that are comparable to hydrogen in efficiency, with the added advantage that helium is non-flammable, and works with a greater number of detectors.  Therefore, helium is the most common carrier gas used.

=== Detectors ===

A number of detectors are used in gas chromatography.  The most common are the [[flame ionization detector]] (FID) and the [[thermal conductivity detector]] (TCD).  Both are sensitive to a wide range of components, and both work over a wide range of concentrations.  While TCDs are essentially universal and can be used to detect any component other than the carrier gas (as long as their thermal conductivities are different from that of the carrier gas, at detector temperature), FIDs are sensitive primarily to hydrocarbons, and are more sensitive to them than TCD.  However, an FID cannot detect water.  Both detectors are also quite robust. Since TCD is non-destructive, it can be operated in-series before an FID (destructive), thus providing complementary detection of the same analytes.

Other detectors are sensitive only to specific types of substances, or work well only in narrower ranges of concentrations.  They include:
*[[discharge ionization detector]] (DID), which uses a high-voltage electric discharge to produce ions.
*[[electron capture detector]] (ECD), which uses a radioactive [[Beta particle]] (electron) source to measure the degree of electron capture.
*[[flame photometric detector]] (FPD)
*[[flame ionization detector]] (FID)
*[[Hall electrolytic conductivity detector]] (ElCD)
*[[helium ionization detector]] (HID)
*[[Nitrogen Phosphorus Detector]] (NPD)
*[[mass selective detector]] (MSD)
*[[photo-ionization detector]] (PID)
*[[pulsed discharge ionization detector]] (PDD)
*[[thermal energy(conductivity) analyzer/detector]] (TEA/TCD)

Some gas chromatographs are connected to a [[mass spectrometer]] which acts as the detector.  The combination is known as [[GC-MS]].  Some [[GC-MS]] are connected to an [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectrometer]] which acts as a back up detector. This combination is known as [[GC-MS-NMR]]. Some [[GC-MS-NMR]] are connected to an [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometer]] which acts as a back up detector. This combination is known as [[GC-MS-NMR-IR]]. It must, however, be stressed this is very rare as most analyses needed can be concluded via purely GC-MS.

== Methods ==

The '''method''' is the collection of conditions in which the GC operates for a given analysis.  '''Method development''' is the process of determining what conditions are adequate and/or ideal for the analysis required.

Conditions which can be varied to accommodate a required analysis include inlet temperature, detector temperature, column temperature and temperature program, carrier gas and carrier gas flow rates, the column's stationary phase, diameter and length, inlet type and flow rates, sample size and injection technique.  Depending on the detector(s) (see below) installed on the GC, there may be a number of detector conditions that can also be varied.  Some GCs also include valves which can change the route of sample and carrier flow. The timing of the opening and closing of these valves can be important to method development.

[[Image:GeoStrataEclipse.jpg]]

This image above shows the interior of a GeoStrata Technologies Eclipse Gas Chromatograph that runs continuously in three minute cycles. Two valves are used to switch the test gas into the sample loop. After filling the sample loop with test gas, the valves are switched again applying carrier gas pressure to the sample loop and forcing the sample through the Column for separation.

=== Carrier gas selection and flow rates ===
Typical carrier gases include [[helium]], [[nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[hydrogen]] and [[air]].  Which gas to use is usually determined by the detector being used, for example, a [[Discharge ionization detector|DID]] requires helium as the carrier gas.  When analyzing gas samples, however, the carrier is sometimes selected based on the sample's matrix, for example, when analyzing a mixture in argon, an argon carrier is preferred, because the argon in the sample does not show up on the chromatogram.  Safety and availability can also influence carrier selection, for example, hydrogen is flammable, and high-purity helium can be difficult to obtain in some areas of the world.  (See: [[Helium#Occurrence and production|Helium--occurrence and production]].)

The purity of the carrier gas is also frequently determined by the detector, though the level of sensitivity needed can also play a significant role.  Typically, purities of 99.995% or higher are used.  Trade names for typical purities include &quot;Zero Grade,&quot; &quot;Ultra-High Purity (UHP) Grade,&quot; &quot;4.5 Grade&quot; and &quot;5.0 Grade.&quot;

The carrier gas flow rate affects the analysis in the same way that temperature does (see above).  The higher the flow rate the faster the analysis, but the lower the separation between analytes.  Selecting the flow rate is therefore the same compromise between the level of separation and length of analysis as selecting the column temperature.

With GCs made before the 1990s, carrier flow rate was controlled indirectly by controlling the carrier inlet pressure, or &quot;column head pressure.&quot;  The actual flow rate was measured at the outlet of the column or the detector with an electronic flow meter, or a bubble flow meter, and could be an involved, time consuming, and frustrating process.  The pressure setting was not able to be varied during the run, and thus the flow was essentially constant during the analysis. The relation between flow rate and inlet pressure is calculated with [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation#Poiseuille's equation for compressible fluids|Poiseuille's equation for compressible fluids]].

Many modern GCs, however, electronically measure the flow rate, and electronically control the carrier gas pressure to set the flow rate.  Consequently, carrier pressures and flow rates can be adjusted during the run, creating pressure/flow programs similar to temperature programs.

=== Inlet types and flow rates ===

The choice of inlet type and injection technique depends on if the sample is in liquid, gas, adsorbed, or solid form, and on whether a solvent matrix is present that has to be vaporized. Dissolved samples can be introduced directly onto the column via a COC injector, if the conditions are well known; if a solvent matrix has to be vaporized and partially removed, a S/SL injector is used (most common injection technique); gaseous samples (e.g., air cylinders) are usually injected using a gas switching valve system; adsorbed samples (e.g., on adsorbent tubes) are introduced using either an external (on-line or off-line) desorption apparatus such as a purge-and-trap system, or are desorbed in the S/SL injector (SPME applications).

=== Sample size and injection technique ===
==== Sample injection ====
[[Image:GCruleof10.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The rule of ten in gas chromatography]]
The real chromatographic analysis starts with the introduction of the sample onto the column. The development of capillary gas chromatography resulted in many practical problems with the injection technique. The technique of on-column injection, often used with packed columns, is usually not possible with capillary columns. The injection system, in the capillary gas chromatograph, should fulfil the following two requirements:
#The amount injected should not overload the column.
#The width of the injected plug should be small compared to the spreading due to the chromatographic process. Failure to comply with this requirement will reduce the separation capability of the column. As a general rule, the volume injected, V&lt;sub&gt;inj&lt;/sub&gt;, and the volume of the detector cell, V&lt;sub&gt;det&lt;/sub&gt;, should be about 1/10 of the volume occupied by the portion of sample containing the molecules of interest (analytes) when they exit the column.

Some general requirements, which a good injection technique should fulfill, are:

*It should be possible to obtain the column’s optimum separation efficiency.
*It should allow accurate and reproducible injections of small amounts of representative samples.
*It should induce no change in sample composition. It should not exhibit discrimination based on differences in boiling point, polarity, concentration or thermal/catalytic stability.
*It should be applicable for trace analysis as well as for undiluted samples.

=== Column selection ===

=== Column temperature and temperature program ===
[[Image:GC Oven inside.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A gas chromatography oven, open to show a capillary column]]
The column(s) in a GC are contained in an oven, the temperature of which is precisely controlled electronically.  (When discussing the &quot;temperature of the column,&quot; an analyst is technically referring to the temperature of the column oven.  The distinction, however, is not important and will not subsequently be made in this article.)

The rate at which a sample passes through the column is directly proportional to the temperature of the column.  The higher the column temperature, the faster the sample moves through the column.  However, the faster a sample moves through the column, the less it interacts with the stationary phase, and the less the analytes are separated.

In general, the column temperature is selected to compromise between the length of the analysis and the level of separation.

A method which holds the column at the same temperature for the entire analysis is called &quot;isothermal.&quot;  Most methods, however, increase the column temperature during the analysis, the initial temperature, rate of temperature increase (the temperature &quot;ramp&quot;) and final temperature is called the &quot;'''temperature program'''.&quot;

A temperature program allows analytes that elute early in the analysis to separate adequately, while shortening the time it takes for late-eluting analytes to pass through the column.

== Data reduction and analysis ==

'''Qualitative analysis:'''

Generally chromatographic data is presented as a graph of detector response (y-axis) against retention time (x-axis), which is called a chromatogram.  This provides a spectrum of peaks for a sample representing the [[analyte]]s present in a sample eluting from the column at different times.  Retention time can be used to identify analytes if the method conditions are constant.  Also, the pattern of peaks will be constant for a sample under constant conditions and can identify complex mixtures of analytes.  In most modern applications however the GC is connected to a [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] or similar detector that is capable of identifying the analytes represented by the peaks.

'''Quantitive analysis:'''

The area under a peak is proportional to the amount of analyte present in the chromatogram.  By calculating the area of the peak using the mathematical function of integration, the concentration of an analyte in the original sample can be determined.  Concentration can be calculated using a [[calibration curve]] created by finding the response for a series of concentrations of analyte, or by determining the [[relative response factor]] of an analyte.  The relative response factor is the expected ratio of an analyte to an [[internal standard]] (or [[external standard]]) and is calculated by finding the response of a known amount of analyte and a constant amount of internal standard (a chemical added to the sample at a constant concentration, with a distinct retention time to the analyte).

In most modern [[GC-MS]] systems, computer software is used to draw and integrate peaks, and match [[mass spectrometry|MS]] spectra to library spectra.

== Application ==
In general, substances that vaporize below ca. 300 °C (and therefore are stable up to that temperature) can be measured quantitatively. The samples are also required to be [[salt]]-free; they should not contain [[ion]]s. Very minute amounts of a substance can be measured, but it is often required that the sample must be measured in comparison to a sample containing the pure, suspected substance.

Various [[GC temperature program|temperature programs]] can be used to make the readings more meaningful; for example to differentiate between substances that behave similarly during the GC process.

Professionals working with GC analyze the content of a chemical product, for example in assuring the quality of products in the chemical industry; or measuring toxic substances in soil, air or water. GC is very accurate if used properly and can measure [[picomole]]s of a substance in a 1 ml liquid sample, or [[Parts per notation|parts-per-billion]] concentrations in gaseous samples.

In practical courses at colleges, students sometimes get acquainted to the GC by studying the contents of [[Lavender]] oil or measuring the [[ethylene]] that is secreted by ''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]'' plants after artificially injuring their leaves. These GC analyses hydrocarbons (C2-C40+). In a typical experiment, a packed column is used to separate the light gases, which are then detected with a [[Thermal conductivity detector|TCD]].  The [[hydrocarbon]]s are separated using a capillary column and detected with an [[Flame ionization detector|FID]].  A complication with light gas analyses that include H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is that He, which is the most common and most sensitive inert carrier (sensitivity is proportional to molecular mass) has an almost identical thermal conductivity to hydrogen (it is the difference in thermal conductivity between two separate filaments in a Wheatstone Bridge type arrangement that shows when a component has been eluted).  For this reason, dual TCD instruments are used with a separate channel for hydrogen that uses nitrogen as a carrier are common.  Argon is often used when analysing gas phase chemistry reactions such as F-T synthesis so that a single carrier gas can be used rather than 2 separate ones.  The sensitivity is less but this is a tradeoff for simplicity in the gas supply.

== GCs in popular culture ==

Movies, books and TV shows tend to misrepresent the capabilities of gas chromatography and the work done with these instruments.

In the U.S. TV show [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]], for example, GCs are used to rapidly identify unknown samples.  &quot;This is [[gasoline]] bought at a [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] station in the past two weeks,&quot; the analyst will say fifteen minutes after receiving the sample.

In fact, a typical GC analysis takes much more time; sometimes a single sample must be run more than an hour according to the chosen program; and even more time is needed to &quot;heat out&quot; the column so it is free from the first sample and can be used for the next. Equally, several runs are needed to confirm the results of a study - a GC analysis of a single sample may simply yield a result per chance (see [[statistical significance]]).

Also, GC does not positively identify most samples; and not all substances in a sample will necessarily be detected.  All a GC truly tells you is at which relative time a component eluted from the column and that the detector was sensitive to it. To make results meaningful, analysts need to know which components at which concentrations are to be expected; and even then a small amount of a substance can hide itself behind a substance having both a higher concentration and the same relative elution time. Last but not least it is often needed to check the results of the sample against a GC analysis of a reference sample containing only the suspected substance.

A [[GC-MS]] can remove much of this ambiguity, since the [[mass spectrometer]] will identify the component's molecular weight.  But this still takes time and skill to do properly.

Similarly, most GC analyses are not [[push-button]] operations.  You cannot simply drop a sample vial into an auto-sampler's tray, push a button and have a computer tell you everything you need to know about the sample. According to the substances one expects to find the operating program must be carefully chosen.

A push-button operation can exist for running similar samples repeatedly, such as in a chemical production environment or for comparing 20 samples from the same experiment to calculate the mean content of the same substance.  However, for the kind of investigative work portrayed in books, movies and TV shows this is clearly not the case.

'''High-performance liquid chromatography''' (HPLC) is a form of [[column chromatography]] used frequently in [[biochemistry]] and [[analytical chemistry]]. It is also sometimes referred to as '''high-pressure liquid chromatography'''. HPLC is used to separate components of a mixture by using a variety of chemical interactions between the substance being analyzed ([[analyte]]) and the chromatography column.  

==Operation==
The basic operating principle of ''HPLC'' is to force the [[analyte]] through a [[column chromatography|column]] of the [[stationary phase]] (usually a tube packed with small round particles with a certain surface chemistry) by pumping a liquid (mobile phase) at high [[pressure]] through the column. The sample to be analyzed is introduced in small volume to the stream of mobile phase and is retarded by specific chemical or physical interactions with the stationary phase as it traverses the length of the column. The amount of retardation depends on the nature of the analyte, stationary phase and mobile phase composition. The time at which a specific analyte elutes (comes out of the end of the column) is called the retention time and is considered a reasonably unique identifying characteristic of a given analyte. The use of pressure increases the linear [[velocity]] (speed) giving the components less time to [[diffusion|diffuse]] within the column, leading to improved resolution in the resulting [[Chromatography|chromatogram]]. Common [[solvent]]s used include any miscible combinations of [[Water (molecule)|water]] or various organic liquids (the most common are [[methanol]] and [[acetonitrile]]). Water may contain buffers or salts to assist in the separation of the analyte components, or compounds such as [[Trifluoroacetic acid]] which acts as an ion pairing agent. 

A further refinement to HPLC has been to vary the mobile phase composition during the analysis, this is known as ''gradient elution''. A normal gradient for reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% methanol and progress linearly to 50% methanol over 25 minutes, depending on how [[hydrophobic]] the analyte is. The gradient separates the analyte mixtures as a function of the affinity of the analyte for the current mobile phase composition relative to the stationary phase. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a [[liquid-liquid extraction]] but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/methanol gradient, the more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) under conditions of relatively high methanol; whereas the more hydrophilic compounds will elute under conditions of relatively low methanol. The choice of solvents, additives and gradient depend on the nature of the stationary phase and the analyte. Often a series of tests are performed on the analyte and a number of generic runs may be processed in order to find the optimum HPLC method for the analyte - the method which gives the best separation of peaks.

==Types of HPLC==
=== Normal phase chromatography ===
Normal phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) was the first kind of HPLC chemistry used, and separates analytes based on polarity.  This method uses a polar stationary phase and a nonpolar mobile phase, and is used when the analyte of interest is fairly polar in nature. The polar analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increase in analyte polarity, and the interaction between the polar analyte and the polar stationary phase (relative to the mobile phase) increases the elution time. The interaction strength not only depends on the functional groups in the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors and structural isomers are often resolved from one another. Use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of the analytes while more hydrophobic solvents tend to increase retention times. Particularly polar solvents in a mixture tend to deactivate the column by occupying the stationary phase surface. This is somewhat particular to normal phase because it is most purely an adsorptive mechanism (the interactions are with a hard surface rather than a soft layer on a surface).. 

NP-HPLC had fallen out of favor in the 1970's with the development of reversed-phase HPLC because of a lack of reproducibility of retention times as water or protic organic solvents changed the hydration state of the silica or alumina chromatographic media. Recently it has become useful again with the development of [[Hilic|HILIC]] bonded phases which utilize a partition mechanism which provides reproducibility.

=== Reversed phase chromatography ===
Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) consists of a non-polar stationary phase and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been treated with RMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;. The retention time is therefore longer for molecules which are more non-polar in nature, allowing polar molecules to elute more readily. Retention time is increased by the addition of polar solvent to the mobile phase and decreased by the addition of more hydrophobic solvent. Reversed phase chromatography (RPC) is so commonly used that it is not uncommon for it to be incorrectly referred to as &quot;HPLC&quot; without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry regularly employs RPC to qualify drugs before their release.

RPC operates on the principle of hydrophobic interactions, which result from repulsive forces between a polar eluent, the relatively non-polar analyte, and the non-polar stationary phase. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand in the aqueous eluent. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for &quot;cavity-reduction&quot; around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the [[surface tension]] of the eluent (water: 73 erg/cm2, methanol: 22 erg/cm2) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding less-polar solvent (MeOH, ACN)into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water. [[Gradient elution]] uses this effect by automatically changing the polarity of the mobile phase during the course of the analysis.

Structural properties of the analyte molecule play an important role in its retention characteristics. In general, an analyte with a larger hydrophobic surface area (C-H, C-C, and generally nonpolar atomic bonds, such as S-S and others) results in a longer retention time because it increases the molecule's nonpolar surface area, which is non-interacting with the water structure. On the other hand, polar groups, such as -OH, -NH2, COO- or -NH3+ reduce retention as they are well integrated into water. Very large molecules, however, can result in an incomplete interaction between the large analyte surface and the ligands alkyl chains and can have problems entering the pores of the stationary phase. 

Retention time increases with hydrophobic - nonpolar - surface area. Branched chain compounds elute more rapidly than their corresponding linear isomers because the overall surface area is decreased. Similarly organic compounds with single C-C-bonds elute later than the ones with a C=C or C-C-triple bond, as the double or triple bond is shorter than a single C-C-bond.

Aside from mobile phase surface tension (organizational strength in eluent structure), other mobile phase modifiers can affect analyte retention.  For example, the addition of inorganic salts causes a moderate linear increase in the surface tension of aqueous solutions (ca. 1.5 erg/cm2 pro Mol for NaCl, 2.5 erg/cm2 pro Mol for (NH4)2SO4), and because the [[entropy]] of the analyte-solvent interface is controlled by surface tension, the addition of salts tend to increase the retention time. This technique is used for mild separation and recovery of proteines and protection of their biological activity in protein analysis (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HIC). 

Another important component is the influence of the [[pH]] since this can change the hydrophobicity of the analyte. For this reason most methods use a [[buffering agent]], such as [[sodium phosphate]], to control the pH. A volatile organic acid such as [[formic acid]] or most commonly [[trifluoroacetic acid]] is often added to the mobile phase, if mass spectrometry is applied to the eluent fractions. The buffers serve multiple purposes: they control pH, neutralize the charge on any residual exposed silica on the stationary phase and act as ion pairing agents to neutralize charge on the analyte. The effect varies depending on use but generally improve the chromatography.

Reversed phase columns are quite difficult to damage compared with normal silica columns, however, many reversed phase columns consist of alkyl derivatized silica particles and should '''never''' be used with aqueous [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] as these will destroy the underlying silica backbone. They can be used with aqueous acid but the column should not be exposed to the acid for too long, as it can corrode the metal parts of the HPLC equipment. The metal content of HPLC columns must be kept low if the best possible ability to separate substances is to be retained. A good test for the metal content of a [[column]] is to inject a sample which is a [[mixture]] of 2,2'- and 4,4'- [[bipyridine]]. Because the 2,2'-bipy can [[chelate]] the metal it is normal that when a [[metal]] [[ion]] is present on the surface of the [[silica]] the shape of the peak for the 2,2'-bipy will be distorted, tailing will be seen on this distorted peak.

=== Size exclusion chromatography ===
{{details|Size exclusion chromatography}}
[[Size exclusion chromatography]] (SEC), also known as ''gel permeation chromatography'' or ''gel filtration chromatography'', separates particles on the basis of size. It is generally a low [[Image resolution|resolution]] chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, &quot;polishing&quot; step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the [[tertiary structure]] and [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins, and is the primary technique for determining the average molecular weight of natural and synthetic [[polymers]].

=== Ion exchange chromatography ===
{{details|Ion exchange chromatography}}
In Ion-exchange chromatography, retention is based on the attraction between solute ions and charged sites bound to the stationary phase. Ions of the same charge are excluded. Some types of Ion Exchangers include: (1) Polystyrene resins- allows cross linkage which increases the stability of the chain. Higher cross linkage reduces swerving, which increases the equilibration time and ultimately improves selectivity. (2) Cellulose and dextran ion exchangers (gels)-These possess larger pore sizes and low charge densities making them suitable for protein separation.(3)Controlled-pore glass or porous silica.  

In general, ion exchangers favor the binding of ions of higher charge and smaller radius. 

An increase in counter ion (with respect to the functional groups in resins) concentration reduces the retention time. An increase in pH reduces the retention time in cation exchange while a decrease in pH reduces the retention time in anion exchange.

This form of chromatography is widely used in the following applications: In purifying water, preconcentration of trace components, Ligand-exchange chromatography, Ion-exchange chromatography of proteins, High-pH anion-exchange chromatography of carbohydrates and oligosaccharides, etc.

=== Bioaffinity chromatography ===

This chromatographic process relies on the property of biologically active substances to form stable, specific, and reversible complexes. The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the Van der Waal's interaction, electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond. An efficient, biospecific bond is formed by a simultaneous and concerted action of several of these forces in the complementary binding sites.

=== Isocratic flow and gradient elution ===

With regard to the mobile phase, a composition that remains constant throughout the procedure is termed ''isocratic''.

In contrast to this is the so called &quot;gradient elution&quot;, which is a separation where the mobile phase changes its composition during a separation process. One example is a gradient in 20 min starting from 10% Methanol and ending up with 30% Methanol. Such a gradient can be increasing or decreasing. The benefit of gradient elution is that it helps speed up elution by allowing components that elute more quickly to come off the column under different conditions than components which are more readily retained by the column. By changing the composition of the solvent, components that are to be resolved can be selectively more or less associated with the mobile phase as a result at equilibrium they spend more time in the solvent and less in the stationary phase therefore they elute faster.

==Parameters==
=== Internal diameter ===
The internal diameter (ID) of an HPLC column is a critical aspect that determines quantity of analyte that can be loaded onto the column and also influences sensitivity. Larger columns are usually seen in industrial applications such as the purification of a drug product for later use. Low ID columns have improved sensitivity and lower solvent consumption at the expense of loading capacity.
*Larger ID columns (over 10 mm) are used to purify usable amounts of material because of their large loading capacity.
*Analytical scale columns (4.6 mm) have been the most common type of columns, though smaller columns are rapidly gaining in popularity. They are used in traditional quantitative analysis of samples and often use a [[spectrophotometer|UV-Vis absorbance detector]].
*Narrow-bore columns (1-2 mm) are used for applications when more sensitivity is desired either with special UV-vis detectors, [[fluorescence]] detection or with other detection methods like [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]]
*Capillary columns (under 0.3 mm) which are used almost exclusively with alternative detection means such as [[mass spectrometry]]. They are usually made from [[fused silica]] capillaries, rather than the stainless steel tubing that larger columns employ.

=== Particle size ===
Most traditional HPLC is performed with the stationary phase attached to the outside of small spherical silica particles (very small beads).  These particles come in a variety of sizes with 5&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;m beads being the most common. Smaller particles generally provide more surface area and better separations, but the pressure required for optimum linear velocity increases by the inverse of the particle diameter squared.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lcgceurope.com/lcgceurope/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=333246&amp;pageID=3#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y. Xiang, Y. Liu and M. L. Lee; J. Chrom. A, Vol. 1104, Issues 1-2, (2006), Pages 198-202 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Cs.Horváth, B.A. Preiss and S.R. Lipsky; Anal. Chem., 39, 1422–1428 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; This means that changing to particles that are half as big in the same size of column will double the performance, but increase the required pressure by a factor of four. Larger particles are more often used in non-HPLC applications such as [[solid-phase extraction]].

=== Pore size ===
Many stationary phases are porous to provide greater surface area. Small pores provide greater surface area while larger pore size has better kinetics especially for larger analyses. For example a protein which is only slightly smaller than a pore might enter the pore but not easily leave once inside.

=== Pump pressure ===
[[Pump]]s vary in pressure capacity, but their performance is measured on their ability to yield a consistent and reproducible [[flow rate]].  [[Pressure]] may reach as high as 6000 [[Pound per square inch|lbf/in²]] (~40 MPa, or about 400 atmospheres).  Modern HPLC systems have been improved to work at much higher pressures, and therefore be able to use much smaller particle sizes in the columns (&lt; 2 micrometres).  These &quot;Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography&quot; systems or UHPLCs can work at up to 15,000 lbf/in² (~100 MPa or about 1000 atmospheres). Note that the term &quot;UPLC&quot;, sometimes found instead is a trademark of [[Waters Corporation]] and not the name for the technique in general.

'''Ion-exchange chromatography''' (or ''ion chromatography'') is a process that allows the separation of [[ion]]s and [[polar molecule]]s based on their charge. It can be used for almost any kind of charged molecule including large [[proteins]], small [[nucleotides]] and [[amino acid]]s. The solution to be injected is usually called a ''sample'', and the individually separated components are called ''analytes''. It is often used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control.

== History ==
Ion methods have been in use since 1850, when H. Thompson and J. T. Way, researchers in England, treated various clays with ammonium sulfate or carbonate in solution to extract the ammonia and release calcium. In 1927, the first [[zeolite]] mineral column was used to remove interfering calcium and magnesium ions from solution to determine the sulfate content of water. The modern version of IEC was developed during the wartime [[Manhattan Project]]. A technique was required to separate and concentrate the radioactive elements needed to make the atom bomb. Researchers chose [[adsorb]]ents that would latch onto charged [[transuranium elements]], which could then be differentially eluted. Ultimately, once declassified, these techniques would use new IE [[resin]]s to develop the systems that are often used today for specific purification of biologicals and inorganics. In the early 1970s, ion chromatography was developed by Hamish Small and co-workers at [[Dow Chemical|Dow Chemical Company]] as a novel method of IEC usable in automated analysis. This later lead to the formation of Dionex Corp (Dow -Ion Exchange) who lead the market in IC equipment and developments. IC uses weaker ionic resins for its stationary phase and an additional neutralizing stripper, or suppressor, column to remove background eluent ions. It is a powerful technique for determining low concentrations of ions and is especially useful in environmental and water quality studies, among other applications.

==Principle==
[[Image:Ion chromatogram.JPG|thumb|450px|right|Ion Chromatogram]]
Ion exchange chromatography retains [[analyte]] molecules on the column based on [[Coulomb's law|coulombic]] (ionic) interactions. The stationary phase surface displays ionic functional groups (R-X) that interact with analyte ions of opposite charge. This type of chromatography is further subdivided into cation exchange chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. The ionic compound consisting of the cationic species M+ and the anionic species B- can be retained by the stationary phase.

Cation exchange chromatography retains positively charged [[cation]]s because the stationary phase displays a negatively charged functional group:

&lt;math&gt;\text{R-X}^-\text{C}^+\,+\, \text{M}^+ \, \text{B}^- \rightleftarrows \,\text{R-X}^-\text{M}^+ \,+\, \text{C}^+ \,+\, \text{B}^-&lt;/math&gt;

Anion exchange chromatography retains anions using positively charged functional group:

&lt;math&gt;\text{R-X}^+\text{A}^-\,+\, \text{M}^+ \, \text{B}^- \rightleftarrows \,\text{R-X}^+\text{B}^- \,+\, \text{M}^+ \,+\, \text{A}^-&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the ion strength of either C+ or A- in the mobile phase can be adjusted to shift the equilibrium position and thus retention time.

The ion chromatogram shows a typical chromatogram obtained with an anion exchange column.

==Typical technique==
[[Image:Metrohm 850.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Metrohm 850 Ion chromatography system]]
A sample is introduced, either manually or with an [[autosampler]], into a sample loop of known volume. A [[buffer solution|buffered]] aqueous solution known as the mobile phase carries the sample from the loop onto a column that contains some form of stationary phase material.  This is typically a resin or gel matrix consisting of [[agarose]] or [[cellulose]] beads with [[Covalent bond|covalently]] bonded charged functional groups. The target analytes (anions or cations) are retained on the stationary phase but can be eluted by increasing the concentration of a similarly charged species that will displace the analyte ions from the stationary phase. For example, in cation exchange chromatography, the positively charged analyte could be displaced by the addition of positively charged sodium ions. The analytes of interest must then be detected by some means, typically by [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] or UV/Visible light absorbance. 

In order to control an IC system, a [[chromatography data system]] (CDS) is usually needed. In addition to IC systems, some of these CDSs can also control [[gas chromatography]] (GC) and HPLC systems.

== Separating proteins ==
[[Image:Ion exchange column.jpg|thumb|left|Preparative-scale ion exchange column used for [[protein purification]].]]

Proteins have numerous functional groups that can have both positive and negative charges.  Ion exchange chromatography separates proteins according to their net charge, which is dependent on the composition of the mobile phase.  By adjusting the pH or the ionic concentration of the mobile phase, various protein molecules can be separated.  For example, if a protein has a net positive charge at pH 7, then it will bind to a column of negatively-charged beads, whereas a negatively charged protein would not. By changing the pH so that the net charge on the protein is negative, it too will be eluted.

Elution by changing the ionic strength of the mobile phase is a more subtle effect - it works as ions from the mobile phase will interact with the immobilized ions in preference over those on the stationary phase.  This &quot;shields&quot; the stationary phase from the protein, (and vice versa) and allows the protein to elute.

'''Micellar electrokinetic chromatography''' (MEKC), is an analytical technique, a modification of [[capillary electrophoresis]], where the samples are separated by differential partitioning between micelles (pseudo-stationary phase) and an surrounding aqueous buffer (mobile phase) &lt;ref&gt;Terabe, S.; Otsuka, K.; Ichikawa, K.; Tsuchiya, A.; Ando, T. ''Anal. Chem''. '''1984''', ''56'', 111.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The basic set-up and detection methods used for MEKC are the same as those used in CE.  The difference is that the solution contains a surfactant at a [[concentration]] that is greater than the critical [[micelle]] concentration (CMC).  Above this concentration, surfactant monomers are in equilibrium with micelles. In most applications, MEKC is performed in open capillaries under [[alkaline]] conditions to generate a strong electroosmotic flow.  [[Sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) is the most commonly used surfactant in MEKC applications.  The anionic character of the sulfate groups of SDS cause the surfactant and micelles to have electrophoretic mobility that is counter to the direction of the strong [[electroosmotic flow]].  As a result, the surfactant monomers and micelles migrate quite slowly, though their net movement is still toward the cathode &lt;ref&gt;Baker, D.R. “Capillary Electrophoresis” John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.: New York, '''1995'''.&lt;/ref&gt;. During a MEKC separation, analytes distribute themselves between the hydrophobic interior of the micelle and hydrophilic buffer solution as shown in ''figure 1''.

[[Image:MEKC.gif|frame|Figure 1: Depiction of the distribution of analytes (A) based on their hydrophobicity.]]

Analytes that are [[soluble|insoluble]] in the interior of micelles should migrate at the electroosmotic flow velocity, &lt;math&gt;u_o&lt;/math&gt;, and be detected at the retention time of the buffer, &lt;math&gt;t_M&lt;/math&gt;.  Analytes that solubilize completely within the micelles (analytes that are highly hydrophobic) should migrate at the micelle velocity, &lt;math&gt;u_c&lt;/math&gt;, and elute at the final elution time, &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Terabe, S.; Otsuka, K.; Ichikawa, K.; Tsuchiya, A.; Ando, T. ''Anal. Chem''. '''1984''', ''56'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Theory ==
The micelle velocity is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;u_c= u_p+u_o&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_p&lt;/math&gt; is the electrophoretic velocity of a micelle.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

The retention time of a given sample should depend on the capacity factor, &lt;math&gt;k^1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;k^1=\frac{n_c}{n_w}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_c&lt;/math&gt;  is the total number of moles of solute in the micelle and &lt;math&gt;n_w&lt;/math&gt; is the total moles in the aqueous phase.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;  The retention time of a solute should then be within the range:

&lt;math&gt; t_M\le t_r\le t_c &lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that charged analytes have a more complex interaction in the capillary because they exhibit electrophoretic mobility, engage in electrostatic interactions with the micelle, and participate in hydrophobic partitioning.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The fraction of the sample in the aqueous phase, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

&lt;math&gt; R= \frac{u_s-u_c}{u_o-u_c}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt; is the migration velocity of the solute.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;  The value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can also be expressed in terms of the capacity factor:

&lt;math&gt; R=\frac{1}{1+k^1}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relationship between velocity, tube length from the injection end to the detector cell (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;), and retention time, &lt;math&gt;u_{o}= L/t_M&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u_{c}= L/t_{c}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_s = L/t_r&lt;/math&gt;, a relationship between the capacity factor and retention times can be formulated:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;math&gt; k^1=\frac{t_r-t_M}{t_M(1-(t_r/t_M))}&lt;/math&gt;

The extra term enclosed in parenthesis accounts for the partial mobility of the hydrophobic phase in MEKC.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  This equation resembles an expression derived for &lt;math&gt;k^1&lt;/math&gt; in conventional packed-bed chromatography:

&lt;math&gt; k=\frac{t_r-t_M}{t_M}&lt;/math&gt;

A rearrangement of the previous equation can be used to write an expression for the retention factor:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_r =\left ( \frac{1+k^1}{1+(t_M/t_c)k^1} \right )t_M&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation it can be seen that all analytes that partition strongly into the micellar phase (where &lt;math&gt;k^1&lt;/math&gt; is essentially ∞) migrate at the same time, &lt;math&gt;t_c&lt;/math&gt;.  In conventional chromatography, separation of similar compounds can be improved by [[gradient]] elution. In MEKC, however, techniques must be used to extend the elution range to separate strongly retained analytes.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Elution ranges can be extended by several techniques including the use of [[organic compound|organic]] modifiers, cyclodextrins, and mixed micelle systems.  Short-chain alcohols or [[acetonitrile]] can be used as organic modifiers that decrease &lt;math&gt;t_M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k^1&lt;/math&gt; to improve the resolution of analytes that co-elute with the micellar phase.  These agents, however, may alter the level of the EOF.  Cyclodextrins are cyclic [[polysaccharide]]s that form inclusion complexes that can cause competitive hydrophobic partitioning of the analyte.  Since analyte-cyclodextrin complexes are neutral, they will migrate toward the cathode at a higher velocity than that of the negatively charged micelles.  Mixed micelle systems, such as the one formed by combining SDS with the neutral surfactant Brij-35, can also be used to alter the selectivity of MEKC.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


== History ==

In 1984, the Terabe group reported a technique that enabled [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) instrumentation to be used in the separation of neutral (as well as ionic) species.

==Applications of MEKC==
The simplicity and efficiency of MEKC have made it an attractive technique for a variety of applications.  Further improvements can be made to the selectivity of MEKC by adding [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] selectors or chiral surfactants to the system.  Unfortunately, this technique is not suitable for protein analysis because proteins are generally too large to partition into a surfactant micelle and tend to bind to surfactant [[monomer]]s to form SDS-protein complexes.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  Recent applications of MEKC include the analysis of uncharged [[pesticide]]s&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, essential and branched-chain [[amino acid]]s in nutraceutical products&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, [[hydrocarbon]] and alcohol contents of marjoram herb&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; .  MEKC has also been targeted for its potential to be used in combinatorial chemical analysis.    The advent of combinatorial [[chemistry]] has enabled [[medicinal chemistry|medicinal chemists]] to synthesize and identify large numbers of potential
[[medication|drugs]] in relatively short periods of time. Small sample and [[solvent]] requirements and the high resolving power of MEKC have enabled this technique to be used to quickly analyze a large number of compounds with good resolution. Traditional methods of analysis, like high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), can be used to identify the purity of a combinatorial library, but assays need to be rapid with good resolution for all components to provide useful information for the chemist.&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;   The introduction of surfactant to traditional capillary electrophoresis instrumentation has dramatically expanded the scope of analytes that can be separated by capillary electrophoresis.

'''Paper chromatography''' is an [[analytical chemistry]] technique for separating and identifying mixtures that are or can be coloured, especially [[pigment]]s. This can also be used in secondary or primary colours in ink experiments. This method has been largely replaced by [[thin layer chromatography]], however it is still a powerful teaching tool. '''Two-way paper chromatography''', also called [[two-dimensional chromatography]] , involves using two solvents and rotating the paper 90° in between. This is useful for separating complex mixtures of similar compounds, for example, [[amino acids]].

==Technique of Paper Chromatography==
A small concentrated spot of [[solution]] that contains the sample of the [[solute]] is applied to a strip of [[chromatography paper]] about two centimetres away from the base of the plate, usually using a [[capillary tube]] for maximum precision. This sample is absorbed onto the paper and may form interactions with it. Any substance that reacts or bonds with the paper cannot be measured using this technique. The paper is then dipped into a suitable [[solvent]], such as [[ethanol]] or [[water]], taking care that the spot is above the surface of the solvent, and placed in a sealed container.

The solvent moves up the paper by [[capillary action]], which occurs as a result of the attraction of the solvent molecules to the paper; this can also be explained as differential [[adsorption]] of the solute components into the solvent. As the solvent rises through the paper it meets and dissolves the sample mixture, which will then travel up the paper with the solvent solute sample. Different compounds in the sample mixture travel at different rates due to differences in solubility in the solvent, and due to differences in their attraction to the fibres in the paper. The more soluble the component the further it goes. Paper chromatography takes anywhere from several minutes to several hours.

In some cases, ''paper chromatography'' does not separate pigments completely; this occurs when two substances appear to have the same values in a particular solvent. In these cases, two-way chromatography is used to separate the multiple-pigment spots.

===Ascending chromatography===
In this method, the solvent is in pool at the bottom of the vessel in which the paper is supported

===Descending chromatography===
In this method, the solvent is kept in a trough at the top of the chamber and is allowed to flow down the paper. The liquid moves down by capillary action as well as by the gravitational force, thus this method is also known as the gravitational method.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In this case, the flow is more rapid as compared to the ascending method, and the chromatography is completed more quickly. The apparatus needed for this case is more sophisticated. The developing solvent is placed in a trough at the top which is usually made up of an inert material. The paper is then suspended in the solvent. Substances that cannot be separated by ascending method can sometimes be separated by the descending method.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Chromatography as art==
Chromatography can be used as an art alternative because of certain colours that it creates, but paper chromatography rarely produces decipherable colours if executed incorrectly. Sometimes, chromatographic results may start with undesirable &quot;leafy&quot; colours, but if done correctly and completely, magnificent hues can be produced.

==R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; value==
R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; value may be defined as the ratio of the distance travelled by the substance to the distance travelled by the solvent. R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; values are usually expressed as a fraction of two decimal places but it was suggested by Smith that a percentage figure should be used instead. If R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; value of a solution is zero, the solute remains in the stationary phase and thus it is immobile. If R&lt;sub&gt;''ƒ''&lt;/sub&gt; value = 1 then the solute has no affinity for the stationary phase and travels with the solvent front.

'''Reversed-phase chromatography''' (RPC) includes any [[chromatographic]] method that uses a [[non-polar]] [[Stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=reversed-phase chromatography|file=R05376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;reversed phase&quot; has a historical background. In the 1970s most liquid chromatography was done on non-modified [[silica]] or [[alumina]] with a hydrophilic surface chemistry and a stronger affinity for polar compounds - hence it was considered &quot;normal&quot;. The introduction of alkyl chains bonded covalently to the support surface reversed the elution order &lt;ref&gt;I. Molnar and C. Horvarth, Clin.Chem., 22 (1976) 1497.&lt;/ref&gt;. Now polar compounds are eluted first while non-polar compounds are retained - hence &quot;reversed phase&quot;. All of the mathematical and experimental considerations used in other chromatographic methods apply (i.e. separation resolution proportional to the column length). Today, reversed-phase column chromatography accounts for the vast majority of analysis performed in liquid chromatography. 

== Stationary Phases==
===Silica Based Stationary Phases===

Any inert [[non-polar]] substance that achieves sufficient packing can be used for reversed-phase chromatography. The most popular column is a octadecyl carbon chain (C18) bonded silica (USP classification L1) with 297 columns commercially available &lt;ref&gt;Chromatographic Reagents Used in USP - NF and Pharamcopeial Forum, (2007 edition).&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by C8 bonded silica (L7 - 166 columns), pure silica (L3 - 88 columns), cyano bonded silica (L10 - 73 columns) and phenyl bonded silica (L11 - 72 columns). Note that C18, C8 and phenyl are dedicated reversed phase packings while cyano columns can be used in a reversed phase mode depending on analyte and mobile phase conditions. It should be noted at this point that not all C18 columns have identical retention properties. Surface functionalization of silica can be performed in a monomeric or a polymeric reaction with different short-chain organosilanes used in a second step to cover remaining silanol groups (end-capping). While the overall retention mechanism remains the same subtle differences in the surface chemistries of different stationary phases will lead to changes in selectivity.

== Mobile Phase Considerations==

Mixtures of water or aqueous buffers and organic solvents are used to elute analytes from a reversed phase column. The solvents have to be miscible with water and the most common organic solvents used are acetonitrile, methanol or tetrahydrofuran (THF). Other solvents can be used such as ethanol, 2-propanol (iso-propyl alcohol). Elution can be performed isocratic (the water-solvent composition does not change during the separation process) or by using a gradient (the water-solvent composition does change during the separation process). The pH of the mobile phase can have an important role on the retention of an analyte and can change the selectivity of certain analytes.
Charged analytes can be separated on a reversed phase column by the use of ion-pairing (also called ion-interaction). This technique is known as reversed phase ion-pairing chromatography.

'''Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)''' is a [[chromatography|chromatographic]] method in which molecules in solution are separated based on their size (more correctly, their [[hydrodynamic volume]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)|file=S05705}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually applied to large [[molecule]]s or macromolecular complexes such as proteins and industrial polymers. Typically, when an aqueous solution is used to transport the sample through the column, the technique is known as '''gel-filtration chromatography''', versus the name '''gel-permeation chromatography''', which is used when an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase. SEC is a widely used [[polymer characterization]] method because of its ability to provide good Mw results for polymers.

==Applications==
The main application of gel-filtration chromatography is the [[fractionation]] of proteins and other water-soluble polymers, while gel permeation chromatography is used to analyze the molecular weight distribution of organic-soluble polymers. Either technique should not be confused with [[gel electrophoresis]], where an electric field is used to &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;push&quot; molecules through the gel depending on their electrical charges.

SEC is a widely used technique for the purification and analysis of synthetic and biological polymers, such as [[proteins]], [[polysaccharides]] and [[nucleic acids]]. Biologists and biochemists typically use a gel medium &amp;mdash; usually [[polyacrylamide]], [[dextran]] or [[agarose]] &amp;mdash; and filter under low pressure. Polymer chemists typically use either a [[silica]] or crosslinked [[polystyrene]] medium under a higher pressure. These media are known as the '''stationary phase'''.

==Advantages==

The advantages of this method include good separation of large molecules from the small molecules with a minimal volume of eluate&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, D. A.; Principles of Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed.; Thompson Brooks/Cole: Belmont, CA, 2006, Chapter 28.&lt;/ref&gt;, and that various solutions can be applied without interfering with the filtration process, all while preserving the biological activity of the particles to be separated. The technique is generally combined with others that further separate molecules by other characteristics, such as acidity, basicity, charge, and affinity for certain compounds. With size exclusion chromatography, there are short and well-defined separation times and narrow bands, which lead to good sensitivity. There is also no sample loss because solutes do not interact with the stationary phase. Disadvantages are, for example, that only a limited number of bands can be accommodated because the time scale of the chromatogram is short, and, in general, there has to be a 10% difference in molecular mass to have a good resolution&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, D. A.; Principles of Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed.; Thompson Brooks/Cole: Belmont, CA, 2006, Chapter 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
The technique was invented by Grant Henry Lathe and Colin R Ruthven, working at Queen Charlotte’s Hospital, London.&lt;ref&gt;Lathe, GH and Ruthven, CR (1955) The separation of substances on the basis of their molecular weights, using columns of starch and water. Biochem J. 60(4):xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lathe, GH and Ruthven, CR (1956) The separation of substances and estimation of their relative molecular sizes by the use of columns of starch in water. Biochem. J. 62(4): 665-674. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=13315231 article]&lt;/ref&gt; They later received the John Scott Award for this invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/johnscottaward.html John Scott Award]&lt;/ref&gt; While Lathe and Ruthven used starch gels as the matrix, [[Jerker Porath]] and [[Per Flodin]] later introduced dextran gels;&lt;ref&gt;Porath, J and Flodin, P (1959) Gel filtration: A method for desalting and group separation. Nature 183(4676): 1657-1659.&lt;/ref&gt; other gels with size fractionation properties include agarose and polyacrylamide. A short review of these developments has appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, M (2006) A look back, adventures in the matrix. Nature Methods 3(5): 410 [http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v3/n5/full/nmeth0506-410.html article]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and method ==
One requirement for SEC is that the analyte does not interact with the surface of the stationary phases. Differences in elution time are based solely on the volume the analyte &quot;sees&quot;. Thus, a small molecule that can penetrate every corner of the pore system of the stationary phase &quot;sees&quot; the entire pore volume and the interparticle volume, and will elute late (when the pore- and interparticle volume has passed through the column ~80% of the column volume). On the other extreme, a very large molecule that cannot penetrate the pore system &quot;sees&quot; only the interpartile volume (~35% of the column volume) and will elute earlier when this volume of mobile phase has passed through the column. The underlying principle of SEC is that particles of different sizes will [[Elution|elute]] (filter) through a stationary phase at different rates. This results in the separation of a solution of particles based on size. Provided that all the particles are loaded simultaneously or near-simultaneously, particles of the same size should elute together. Each size exclusion column has a range of molecular weights that can be separated. The exclusion limit defines the molecular weight at the upper end of this range and is where molecules are too large to be trapped in the stationary phase. The permeation limit defines the molecular weight at the lower end of the range of separation and is where molecules of a small enough size can penetrate into the pores of the stationary phase completely and all molecules below this molecular mass are so small that they elute as a single band&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, D. A.; Principles of Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed.; Thompson Brooks/Cole: Belmont, CA, 2006, Chapter 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Superdex 200HR gel filtration column.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|A size exclusion column.]]

This is usually achieved with an apparatus called a column, which consists of a hollow tube tightly packed with extremely small porous polymer beads designed to have pores of different sizes. These pores may be depressions on the surface or channels through the bead. As the solution travels down the column some particles enter into the pores. Larger particles cannot enter into as many pores. The larger the particles, the faster the elution.

The filtered solution that is collected at the end is known as the '''eluate'''. The '''void volume''' includes any particles too large to enter the medium, and the solvent volume is known as the '''column volume'''.

==Factors affecting filtration==
[[Image:SizeExChrom.png|thumb|right|300px|A cartoon illustrating the theory behind '''size exclusion chromatography''']]
In real-life situations, particles in solution do not have a fixed size, resulting in the probability that a particle that would otherwise be hampered by a pore passing right by it. Also, the stationary-phase particles are not ideally defined; both particles and pores may vary in size. Elution curves, therefore, resemble [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distributions]]. The stationary phase may also interact in undesirable ways with a particle and influence retention times, though great care is taken by column manufacturers to use stationary phases that are inert and minimize this issue.

Like other forms of chromatography, increasing the column length will enhance the resolution, and increasing the column diameter increases the capacity of the column. Proper column packing is important to maximize resolution: An overpacked column can collapse the pores in the beads, resulting in a loss of resolution. An underpacked column can reduce the relative surface area of the stationary phase accessible to smaller species, resulting in those species spending less time trapped in pores.  Unlike affinity chromatography techniques, a solvent head at the top of the column can drastically diminish resolution as the sample diffuses prior to loading, broadening the downstream elution.

== Analysis ==
In simple manual columns, the eluent is collected in constant volumes, known as fractions. The more similar the particles are in size the more likely they will be in the same fraction and not detected separately. More advanced columns overcome this problem by constantly monitoring the eluent.
[[Image:Size exclusion standardisation.png|thumb|left|300 px|Standardization of a size exclusion column.]]
The collected fractions are often examined by [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic techniques]] to determine the concentration of the particles eluted. Common spectroscopy detection techniques are refractive index (RI)and ultraviolet (UV).   When eluting spectroscopically similar species (such as during biological purification), other techniques may be necessary to identify the contents of each fraction. It is also possible to analyse the eluent flow continuously with RI, [[Low-angle laser light scattering|LALLS]], [[Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering]] MALS, UV, and/or viscosity measurements.

The elution volume (Ve) decreases roughly linearly with the [[logarithm]] of the molecular [[hydrodynamic volume]]. Columns are often calibrated using 4-5 standard samples (e.g., folded proteins of known molecular weight), and a sample containing a very large molecule such as thyroglobulin to determine the [[void volume]]. (Blue dextran is not recommended for Vo determination because it is heterogeneous and may give variable results) The elution volumes of the standards are divided by the elution volume of the thyroglobulin (Ve/Vo) and plotted against the log of the standards' molecular weights.

==Applications==
===Biochemical applications===

In general, SEC is considered a low resolution chromatography as it does not discern similar species very well, and is therefore often reserved for the final &quot;polishing&quot; step of a purification. The technique can determine the [[quaternary structure]] of purified proteins that have slow exchange times, since it can be carried out under native [[solution]] conditions, preserving macromolecular interactions. SEC can also assay protein [[tertiary structure]], as it measures the hydrodynamic volume (not molecular weight), allowing folded and unfolded versions of the same protein to be distinguished. For example, the apparent [[hydrodynamic radius]] of a typical protein domain might be 14 Å and 36 Å for the folded and unfolded forms, respectively. SEC allows the separation of these two forms, as the folded form will elute much later due to its smaller size.

===Polymer synthesis===

SEC can be used as a measure of both the size and the [[polydispersity]] of a synthesised [[polymer]], that is, the ability to be able to find the distribution of the sizes of polymer molecules. If standards of a known size are run previously, then a [[calibration curve]] can be created to determine the sizes of polymer molecules of interest in the solvent chosen for analysis (often [[THF]]). In alternative fashion, techniques such as light scattering and/or [[viscometry]] can be used online with SEC to yield absolute molecular weights that do not rely on calibration with standards of known molecular weight. Due to the difference in size of two polymers with identical molecular weights, the absolute determination methods are, in general, more desirable. A typical SEC system can quickly (in about half an hour) give polymer chemists information on the size and polydispersity of the sample. The preparative SEC can be used for [[polymer fractionation]] on an analytical scale.

==Drawback==

In SEC, mass is not measured so much as the hydrodynamic volume of the polymer molecules, that is, how much space a particular polymer molecule takes up when it is in solution. However, the approximate molecular weight can be calculated from SEC data because the exact relationship between molecular weight and hydrodynamic volume for polystyrene can be found. For this, polystyrene is used as a standard. But the relationship between hydrodynamic volume and molecular weight is not the same for all polymers, so only an approximate measurement can be arrived at.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pslc.ws/mactest/sec.htm Polymer Science Learning Center (PSLC) - Size Exclusion Chromatography]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another drawback is the possibility of interaction between the stationary phase and the analyte. Any interaction leads to a later elution time and thus mimics a smaller analyte size.

==Absolute size-exclusion chromatography==
Absolute size-exclusion chromatography (ASEC) is a technique that couples a [[dynamic light scattering]] (DLS) instrument to a size exclusion chromatography system for absolute size measurements of proteins and macromolecules as they elute from the chromatography system.

The definition of absolute used here is that it does not require calibration to obtain hydrodynamic size, often referred to as hydrodynamic diameter (D&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; in units of nm). The sizes of the macromolecules are measured as they elute into the flow cell of the DLS instrument from the size exclusion column set. However, the ability to calculate molar mass from DLS does require a model to be used. Thus, the technique does rely on a prior knowledge of the shape (limited to a few choices) and the assumption that the shape chosen is applicable to the sample. This approach is a crude estimate at best.

A big advantage of DLS coupled with SEC is the ability to obtain enhanced DLS resolution {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.  Batch DLS is simple and provides a direct measure of the protein size but the resolution of DLS is 3 to 1 in diammeter.  Using SEC, the proteins and protein oligomers are separated, allowing oligomeric resolution, but  the high protein loadings required to get a reasonable response from the DLS instrument will overload standard SEC columns and severely reduce normal resolution (see references below).  Aggregation studies can also be done using ASEC.

Limitations of ASEC include flow-rate, concentration, and precision. Because a correlation function requires anywhere from 3–7 seconds to properly build, a limited number of data points can be collected across the peak. This fact can cause erroneous data at flow rates above 0.5 mL/min. Resolution may also be limited if the flow-cell volume is not minimized.

In addition, size vs. mass relationships for [[globular proteins]] and polymeric systems are known for some solvent conditions, and can be used to estimate the molecular mass from the DLS measured [[Stokes radius]].

'''Thin layer chromatography''' (TLC) is a [[chromatography]] technique used to separate mixtures.&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book

This layer of adsorbent is known as the [[stationary phase]].

After the sample has been applied on the plate, a [[solvent]] or solvent mixture (known as the [[mobile phase]]) is drawn up the plate via [[capillary action]]. Because different [[analyte]]s ascend the TLC plate at different rates, separation is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry (5th Edition) (Hardcover) by A.I. Vogel (Author), A.R. Tatchell (Author), B.S. Furnis (Author), A.J. Hannaford (Author), P.W.G. Smith ISBN 0582462363&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Thin layer chromatography can be used to:

*Monitor the progress of a reaction
*Identify compounds present in a given substance
*Determine the purity of a substance

Specific examples of these applications include:
*determination of the components a plant contains
*analyzing [[ceramide]]s and [[fatty acid]]s
*detection of [[pesticide]]s or [[insecticide]]s in food and water
*analyzing the dye composition of fibers in [[forensic]]s, or 
*assaying the [[radiochemical purity]] of [[radiopharmaceutical]]s

A number of enhancements can be made to the original method to automate the different steps, to increase the resolution achieved with TLC and to allow more accurate quantitation.  This method is referred to as [[HPTLC]], or &quot;high performance TLC&quot;.

==Plate preparation==
TLC plates are usually commercially available, with standard particle size ranges to improve reproducibility. They are prepared by mixing the adsorbent, such as [[silica gel]], with a small amount of [[inert]] binder like [[calcium sulfate]] (gypsum) and water. This mixture is spread as a thick slurry on an unreactive carrier sheet, usually [[glass]], thick aluminum foil, or plastic. The resultant plate is dried and ''activated'' by heating in an oven for thirty minutes at 110&amp;nbsp;°C. The thickness of the adsorbent layer is typically around 0.1 – 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm for analytical purposes and around 0.5 – 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm for preparative TLC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.materialharvest.com/welcome/silica_products/tlc_plates.html Tables] showing the thickness value of commercial regular and preparative Thin Layer Chromatography plates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[Image:Tlc sequence.svg|thumb|right|200px|Development of a TLC plate, a purple spot separates into a red and blue spot.]]
[[Image:TLC-Essential-Oils.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chromatogram of 10 [[essential oil]]s coloured with [[vanillin]] reagent. ]]
The process is similar to [[paper chromatography]] with the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different stationary phases. Because of its simplicity and speed TLC is often used for monitoring [[chemical reaction]]s and for the qualitative analysis of reaction products.

A small spot of solution containing the sample is applied to a plate, about one centimeter from the base. The plate is then dipped in to a suitable [[solvent]], such as [[hexane]] or [[ethyl acetate]], and placed in a sealed container. The [[solvent]] moves up the plate by [[capillary action]] and meets the sample mixture, which is dissolved and is carried up the plate by the solvent. Different [[chemical compound|compounds]] in the sample mixture travel at different rates due to the differences in their attraction to the stationary phase, and because of differences in solubility in the solvent.  By changing the solvent, or perhaps using a mixture, the separation of components (measured by the [[Retardation factor|R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;]] value) can be adjusted.  Also, the separation achieved with a TLC plate can be used to estimate the separation of a [[column chromatography|flash chromatography]] column.&lt;ref&gt;Fair, J. D.; Kormos, C. M. ''[[J. Chromatogr. A]]'' '''2008''', ''1211''(1-2), 49-54. ({{DOI|10.1016/j.chroma.2008.09.085}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Separation of compounds is based on the competition of the solute and the mobile phase for binding places on the stationary phase. For instance, if normal phase silica gel is used as the stationary phase it can be considered polar. Given two compounds which differ in polarity, the more polar compound has a stronger interaction with the silica and is therefore more capable to dispel the mobile phase from the binding places. Consequently, the less polar compound moves higher up the plate (resulting in a higher Rf value). If the mobile phase is changed to a more polar solvent or mixture of solvents, it is more capable of dispelling solutes from the silica binding places and all compounds on the TLC plate will move higher up the plate. Practically this means that if you use a mixture of ethyl acetate and heptane as the mobile phase, adding more ethyl acetate results in higher Rf values for all compounds on the TLC plate. Changing the polarity of the mobile phase will normally not result in reversed order of running of the compounds on the TLC plate. An [[eluotropic series]] can be used as a guide in selecting a mobile phase. If a reversed order of running of the compounds is desired, an apolar stationary phase should be used, such as C18-functionalized silica.

==Preparative TLC==

TLC can also be used on a small semi-preparative scale to separate mixtures of up to a few hundred milligrams.  The mixture is not &quot;spotted&quot; on the TLC plate as dots, but rather is applied to the plate as a thin even layer horizontally to and just above the solvent level.  When developed with solvent the compounds separate in horizontal bands rather than horizontally separated spots.  Each band (or a desired band) is scraped off the backing material.  The backing material is then extracted with a suitable solvent (e.g. [[Dichloromethane|DCM]]) and filtered to give the isolated material upon removal of the solvent. For small-scale reactions with easily separated products, preparative TLC can be a far more efficient in terms of time and cost than doing [[column chromatography]]. Obviously, the whole plate can not be chemically developed or the product will be chemically destroyed.  Thus this technique is best used with compounds that are coloured, or visible under [[UV light]]. Alternatively, a small section of the plate can be chemically developed e.g. cutting a section out and chemically developing it, or masking most of the plate and exposing a small section to a chemical developer like [[iodine]].

==Analysis==
As the chemicals being separated may be colorless, several methods exist to visualize the spots:
* Often a small amount of a [[fluorescent]] compound, usually [[manganese]]-activated [[zinc silicate]], is added to the adsorbent that allows the visualization of spots under a [[blacklight]] (UV&lt;sub&gt;254&lt;/sub&gt;). The adsorbent layer will thus fluoresce light green by itself, but spots of analyte quench this fluorescence. 
* [[Iodine]] vapors are a general unspecific color [[reagent]]
* Specific color reagents exist into which the TLC plate is dipped or which are sprayed onto the plate&lt;ref&gt;Stains for Developing TLC Plates http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfthb/research/handbook/TLCstains.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of lipids, the chromatogram may be transferred to a [[PVDF]] membrane and then subjected to further analysis, for example [[mass spectrometry]], a technique known as [[Far-Eastern blot]]ting.

Once visible, the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; value , or [[retention factor]], of each spot can be determined by dividing the distance traveled by the product by the total distance traveled by the solvent (the solvent front). These values depend on the solvent used, and the type of TLC plate, and are not physical constants.

==Applications==
In [[organic chemistry]], reactions are qualitatively monitored with TLC. Spots sampled with a [[capillary]] tube are placed on the plate: a spot of starting material, a spot from the reaction mixture, and a &quot;co-spot&quot; with both. A small (3 by 7&amp;nbsp;cm) TLC plate takes a couple of minutes to run. The analysis is qualitative, and it will show if the starting material has disappeared, i.e. the reaction is complete, if any product has appeared, and how many products are generated (although this might be under-estimated due to co-elution). Unfortunately, TLCs from low-temperature reactions may give misleading results, because the sample is warmed to room temperature in the capillary, which can alter the reaction—the warmed sample analyzed by TLC is not the same as what is in the low-temperature flask. One such reaction is the [[DIBALH]] reduction of ester to aldehyde.

As an example the chromatography of an extract of green leaves (for example [[spinach]]) in 7 stages of development. [[Carotene]] elutes quickly and is only visible until step 2. [[Chlorophyll]] A and B are halfway in the final step and [[lutein]] the first compound staining yellow.

In this method the alcohol and catalyst solution (for instance iron(III) chloride) are place separately on the base line, then reacted and then instantly analyzed.

[[Image:GCMS closed.jpg|right|300 px|Example of a GC-MS|thumb]]
'''Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry''' ('''GC-MS''') is a method that combines the features of [[gas-liquid chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]] to identify different substances within a test sample. Applications of GC-MS include [[drug abuse|drug]] detection, [[fire]] investigation, environmental analysis, [[explosives]] investigation, and identification of unknown samples. GC/MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, it can identify [[trace element]]s in materials that were previously thought to have disintegrated beyond identification.

The GC-MS has been widely heralded as a &quot;[[gold standard (test)|gold standard]]&quot; for [[Forensics|forensic]] substance identification because it is used to perform a ''specific test''. A specific test positively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given sample. A ''non-specific test'' merely indicates that a substance falls into a category of substances. Although a non-specific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance, this could lead to [[false positive]] identification.

==History==
The use of a mass spectrometer as the detector in gas chromatography was developed during the 1950s by Roland Gohlke and Fred McLafferty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ac50164a024 | title = Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry and Gas-Liquid Partition Chromatography | year = 1959 | author = Gohlke, R. S. | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 31 | pages = 535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =10.1016/1044-0305(93)85001-E | title =Early gas chromatography/mass spectrometry | year =1993 | author =Gohlke, R | journal =Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry | volume =4 | pages =367 | last2 =McLafferty | first2 =Fred W.   }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sensitive devices were bulky, fragile, and originally limited to laboratory settings. The development of affordable and [[miniaturized]] [[computer]]s has helped in the simplification of the use of this instrument, as well as allowed great improvements in the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample. In 1996 the top-of-the-line high-speed GC-MS units completed analysis of fire accelerants in less than 90 seconds, whereas first-generation GC/MS would have required at least 16 minutes.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} This has led to their widespread adoption in a number of fields.

==Instrumentation==
{{Main|../gas chromatograph|mass spectrometer}}
[[Image:GCMS open.jpg|thumb|300 px|The insides of the GC-MS, with the column of the gas chromatograph in the oven on the right.]]
The GC-MS is composed of two major building blocks: the [[gas chromatograph]] and the [[mass spectrometer]]. The gas chromatograph utilizes a capillary column which depends on the column's dimensions (length, diameter, film thickness) as well as the phase properties (e.g. 5% phenyl polysiloxane).  The difference in the chemical properties between different [[molecule]]s in a mixture will separate the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column. The molecules take different amounts of time (called the retention time) to come out of (elute from) the gas chromatograph, and this allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture, ionize, accelerate, deflect, and detect the ionized molecules separately. The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into [[ion]]ized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass to charge ratio. 

[[Image:Gcms schematic.gif|thumb|left|300 px|GC-MS schematic]]
These two components, used together, allow a much finer degree of substance identification than either unit used separately. It is not possible to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame Ionization Detector) detects multiple molecules that happen to take the same amount of time to travel through the column (''i.e.'' have the same retention time) which results in two or more molecules to co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes makes it extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically lends to increased certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.

===Purge and Trap GC-MS===
For the analysis of [[volatile]] compounds a [[Purge and Trap]] (P&amp;T) concentrator system may be used to introduce samples.  The target analytes are extracted and mixed with water and introduced into an airtight chamber.  An inert gas such as [[Nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is bubbled through the water; this is known as purging.  The volatile compounds move into the headspace above the water and are drawn along a [[pressure gradient]] (caused by the introduction of the purge gas) out of the chamber.  The volatile compounds are drawn along a heated line onto a 'trap'.  The trap is a column of [[adsorbent]] material at ambient temperature that holds the compounds by returning them to the liquid phase.  The trap is then heated and the sample compounds are introduced to the GC-MS column via a volatiles interface, which is a split inlet system.  P&amp;T GC-MS is particularly suited to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and [[BTEX]] compounds (aromatic compounds associated with petroleum).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Optimizing the Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds - Technical Guide&quot; Restek Corporation, Lit. Cat. 59887A&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of Mass Spectrometer Detectors===
The most common type of mass spectrometer (MS) associated with a gas chromatograph (GC) is the quadrupole mass spectrometer, sometimes referred to by the [[Hewlett-Packard]] (now [[Agilent]]) trade name &quot;Mass Selective Detector&quot; (MSD).  Another relatively common detector is the ion trap mass spectrometer.  Additionally one may find a magnetic sector mass spectrometer, however these particular instruments are expensive and bulky and not typically found in high-throughput service laboratories.  Other detectors may be encountered such as time of flight (TOF), tandem quadrupoles (MS-MS) (see below), or in the case of an ion trap MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; where n indicates the number mass spectrometry stages.

==Analysis==

A mass spectrometer is typically utilized in one of two ways: Full Scan or Selective Ion Monitoring (SIM).  The typical GC/MS instrument is capable of performing both functions either individually or concomitantly, depending on the setup of the particular instrument.

===Full scan MS===
When collecting data in the full scan mode, a target range of mass fragments is determined and put into the instrument's method.  An example of a typical broad range of mass fragments to monitor would be ''m/z'' 50 to ''m/z'' 400.  The determination of what range to use is largely dictated by what one anticipates being in the sample while being cognizant of the solvent and other possible interferences.  A MS should not be set to look for mass fragments too low or else one may detect air (found as ''m/z'' 28 due to nitrogen), carbon dioxide (''m/z'' 44) or other possible interferences.  Additionally if one is to use a large scan range then sensitivity of the instrument is decreased due to performing fewer scans per second since each scan will have to detect a wide range of mass fragments.

Full scan is useful in determining unknown compounds in a sample.  It provides more information than SIM when it comes to confirming or resolving compounds in a sample.  During instrument method development it may be common to first analyze test solutions in full scan mode to determine the retention time and the mass fragment fingerprint before moving to a SIM instrument method.

===Selected ion monitoring===
In selected ion monitoring (SIM) certain ion fragments are entered into the instrument method and only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer.  The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at a small number of fragments (e.g. three fragments) during each scan.  More scans can take place each second.  Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored, [[matrix interference]]s are typically lower.  To additionally confirm the likelihood of a potentially positive result, it is relatively important to be sure that the ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known reference standard.

===Types of Ionization===
After the molecules travel the length of the column, pass through the transfer line and enter into the mass spectrometer they are ionized by various methods with typically only one method being used at any given time.  Once the sample is fragmented it will then be detected, usually by an electron multiplier diode, which essentially turns the ionized mass fragment into an electrical signal that is then detected.

The ionization technique chosen is independent of using Full Scan or SIM.

====Electron Ionization====
By far the most common and perhaps standard form of ionization is [[electron ionization]] (EI).  The molecules enter into the MS (the source is a quadrupole or the ion trap itself in an ion trap MS) where they are bombarded with free electrons emitted from a filament, not much unlike the filament one would find in a standard light bulb.  The electrons bombard the molecules, causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic and reproducible way.  This &quot;hard ionization&quot; technique results in the creation of more fragments of low mass to charge ratio (m/z) and few, if any, molecules approaching the molecular mass unit.  Hard ionization is considered by mass spectroscopists as the employ of molecular electron bombardment, whereas &quot;soft ionization&quot; is charge by molecular collision with an introduced gas.  The molecular fragmentation pattern is dependant upon the electron energy applied to the system, typically 70eV (electron Volts).  The use of 70eV facilitates comparison of generated spectra with National Institute of Standard (NIST-USA) library of spectra applying algorithmic matching programs and the use of methods of analysis written by many method standardization agencies.

====Chemical Ionization====
In [[chemical ionization]] a reagent gas, typically [[methane]] or [[ammonia]] is introduced into the mass spectrometer. Depending on the technique (positive CI or negative CI) chosen, this reagent gas will interact with the electrons and analyte and cause a 'soft' ionization of the molecule of interest.  A softer ionization fragments the molecule to a lower degree than the hard ionization of EI.  One of the main benefits of using chemical ionization is that a mass fragment closely corresponding to the molecular weight of the analyte of interest is produced.

;Positive Chemical Ionization
In Positive Chemical Ionization (PCI) the reagent gas interacts with the target molecule, most often with a proton exchange.  This produces the species in relatively high amounts.

;Negative Chemical Ionization
In Negative Chemical Ionization (NCI) the reagent gas decreases the impact of the free electrons on the target analyte.  This decreased energy typically leaves the fragment in great supply.

The primary goal of instrument analysis is to quantify an amount of substance. This is done by comparing the relative concentrations among the atomic masses in the generated spectrum. Two kinds of analysis are possible, comparative and original. Comparative analysis essentially compares the given spectrum to a spectrum library to see if its characteristics are present for some sample in the library. This is best performed by a [[computer]] because there are a myriad of visual distortions that can take place due to variations in scale. Computers can also simultaneously correlate more data (such as the retention times identified by GC), to more accurately relate certain data.

Another method of analysis measures the peaks in relation to one another.  In this method, the tallest peak is assigned 100% of the value, and the other peaks being assigned proportionate values.  All values above 3% are assigned. The total mass of the unknown compound is normally indicated by the parent peak. The value of this parent peak can be used to fit with a chemical [[formula]] containing the various [[Chemical element|elements]] which are believed to be in the compound. The [[isotope]] pattern in the spectrum, which is unique for elements that have many isotopes, can also be used to identify the various elements present. Once a chemical formula has been matched to the spectrum, the molecular structure and bonding can be identified, and must be consistent with the characteristics recorded by GC/MS. Typically, this identification done automatically by programs which come with the instrument, given a list of the elements which could be present in the sample.

A “full spectrum” analysis considers all the “peaks” within a spectrum. Conversely, selective ion monitoring (SIM) only monitors selected peaks associated with a specific substance. This is done on the assumption that at a given retention time, a set of [[ion]]s is characteristic of a certain compound. This is a fast and efficient analysis, especially if the analyst has previous information about a sample or is only looking for a few specific substances. When the amount of information collected about the ions in a given gas chromatographic peak decreases, the sensitivity of the analysis increases. So, SIM analysis allows for a smaller quantity of a compound to be detected and measured, but the degree of certainty about the identity of that compound is reduced.

===GC-tandem MS===
When a second phase of mass fragmentation is added, for example using a second quadrupole in a quadrupole instrument, it is called tandem MS (MS/MS). MS/MS can sometimes be used quantitate low levels of target compounds in the presence of a high sample matrix background.

The first quadrupole (Q1) is connected with a collision cell (q2) and another quadrupole (Q3). Both quadrupoles can be used in scanning or static mode, depending on the type of MS/MS analysis being performed. Types of analysis include product ion scan, precursor ion scan, Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) (sometimes referred to as Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)) and Neutral Loss Scan. For example: When Q1 is in static mode (looking at one mass only as in SIM), and Q3 is in scanning mode, one obtains a so-called product ion spectrum (also called &quot;daughter spectrum&quot;). From this spectrum, one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen precursor ion. The pair is called a &quot;transition&quot; and forms the basis for SRM.  SRM is highly specific and virtually eliminates matrix background.

==Applications==
===Environmental Monitoring and Cleanup===
GC-MS is becoming the tool of choice for tracking [[Persistent Organic Pollutant|organic pollutants]] in the environment. The cost of GC-MS equipment has decreased significantly, and the reliability has increased at the same time, which has contributed to its increased adoption in [[environmental monitoring|environmental studies]]. There are some compounds for which GC-MS is not sufficiently sensitive, including certain pesticides and herbicides, but for most organic analysis of environmental samples, including many major classes of pesticides, it is very sensitive and effective.

===Criminal Forensics===
GC-MS can analyze the particles from a human body in order to help link a criminal to a [[crime]]. The analysis of [[fire]] debris using GC-MS is well established, and there is even an established American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standard for fire debris analysis. GCMS/MS is especially useful here as samples often contain very complex matrices and results, used in court, need to be highly accurate.

===Law Enforcement===
GC-MS is increasingly used for detection of illegal narcotics, and may eventually supplant drug-sniffing dogs.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; It is also commonly used in forensic toxicology to find drugs and/or poisons in biological specimens of suspects, victims, or the deceased.

===Security===
A post-September 11 development, [[explosive detection]] systems have become a part of all [[United States of America|US]] [[airport]]s. These systems run on a host of technologies, many of them based on GC-MS. There are only three manufacturers certified by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] to provide these systems,{{Fact|date=October 2007}} one of which is Thermo Detection (formerly Thermedics), which produces the [[Egis explosives detector|EGIS]], a GC-MS-based line of explosives detectors. The other two manufacturers are Barringer Technologies, now owned by Smith's Detection Systems and Ion Track Instruments, part of General Electric Infrastructure Security Systems.

===Food, Beverage and Perfume Analysis===
[[Food]]s and [[beverage]]s contain numerous [[aromatic compounds]], some naturally present in the raw materials and some forming during processing. GC-MS is extensively used for the analysis of these compounds which include [[esters]], [[fatty acids]], [[alcohols]], [[aldehydes]], [[terpenes]] etc. It is also used to detect and measure contaminants from spoilage or [[adulteration]] which may be harmful and which is often controlled by governmental agencies, for example [[pesticides]].

===Astrochemistry===
Several GC-MS have left earth. Two were brought to [[Mars]] by the [[Viking program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://appel.nasa.gov/items/Viking_GCMS_case_07%2025%2006.pdf The Development of the Viking GCMS]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venera]] 11 and 12 and [[Pioneer Venus]] analysed the atmosphere of [[Venus]] with GC-MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Nature|volume = 292| pages = 610–613 |year = 1981 |doi = 10.1038/292610a0|title =Chemical composition of the atmosphere of Venus| author = V. A. Krasnopolsky, V. A. Parshev}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Huygens probe]] of the [[Cassini-Huygens]] mission landed one GC-MS on [[Saturn's]] largest moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= The abundances of constituents of Titan’s atmosphere from the GCMS instrument on the Huygens probe |author= H.

===Medicine===
In combination with [[isotopic labeling]] of metabolic compounds, the GC-MS is used for determining [[metabolism|metabolic activity]]. Most applications are based on the use of [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] as the labeling and the measurement of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratios with an '''[[Isotope_ratio_mass_spectrometry|isotope ratio mass spectrometer]]''' ('''IRMS'''); an MS with a detector designed to measure a few select ions and return values as ratios.

'''Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry''' ('''LC-MS''', or alternatively '''HPLC-MS''') is an [[analytical chemistry]] technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of [[High performance liquid chromatography|liquid chromatography]] (or HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of [[mass spectrometry]]. LC-MS is a powerful technique used for many applications which has very high sensitivity and specificity. Generally its application is oriented towards the specific detection and potential identification of chemicals in the presence of other chemicals (in a complex mixture).

==Liquid chromatography==
===Scale===
A major difference between traditional [[High performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and the [[chromatography]] used in LC-MS is that in the latter case the scale is usually much smaller, both with respect to the internal diameter of the column and even more so with respect to flow rate since it scales as the square of the diameter. For a long time, 1 mm columns were typical for LC-MS work (as opposed to 4.6&amp;nbsp;mm for HPLC). More recently 300&amp;nbsp;µm and even 75&amp;nbsp;µm capillary columns have become more prevalent. At the low end of these column diameters the flow rates approach 100&amp;nbsp;nL/min and are generally used with [[nanospray]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mas.1280130504 Capillary liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, Kenneth B. Tomer, M. Arthur Moseley, Leesa J. Deterding, Carol E. Parker, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Vol 13, 1994, pp 431-457]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow splitting===

When standard [[bore]] (4.6 mm) columns are used the flow is often split ~10:1. This can be beneficial by allowing the use of other techniques in tandem such as MS and UV. However splitting the flow to UV will decrease the sensitivity of spectrophotometric detectors. The mass spectrometry on the other hand will give improved sensitivity at flow rates of 200 μL/min or less.

==Mass spectrometry==
===Mass analyzer===

There are a lot of mass analyzers that can be used in LC/MS. [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|Single Quadrupole]], [[Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer|Triple Quadrupole]], [[Ion Trap]], TOF ([[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time of Flight]]) and Quadrupole-time of flight (Q-TOF).

===Interface===

Understandably the interface between a liquid phase technique which continuously flows liquid, and a gas phase technique carried out in a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of [[electrospray ionization]] changed this. The interface is most often an [[electrospray]] ion source or variant such as a nanospray source; however [[fast atom bombardment]], [[thermospray]] and [[atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]] interfaces are also used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mas.1280110103 Combined liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Part III. Applications of thermospray, Patrick Arpino, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Vol 11, 1992 pp 3-40]&lt;/ref&gt; Various deposition and drying techniques have also been used such as using moving belts; however the most common of these is off-line [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|MALDI]] deposition.&lt;ref&gt;Combined liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Part I. Coupling by means of a moving belt interface, Patrick Arpino, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Vol 8, 1989 pp 35-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/10009479/ABSTRACT Coupling matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization to liquid separations, Kermit K. Murray, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Vol 16, pp 283-299]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Pharmacokinetics===
LC-MS is very commonly used in [[pharmacokinetic]] studies of pharmaceuticals and is thus the most frequently used technique in the field of [[bioanalysis]]. These studies give information about how quickly a drug will be cleared from the hepatic blood flow, and organs of the body. MS is used for this due to high sensitivity and exceptional specificity compared to UV (as long as the analyte can be suitably ionised), and short analysis time. 

The major advantage MS has is the use of tandem MS-MS. The detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The process is essentially a selection technique, but is in fact more complex. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick. It is common now to have analysis times of 1 minute or less by MS-MS detection, compared to over 10 mins with UV detection.&lt;ref&gt;Increasing Speed and Throughput When Using HPLC-MS/MS Systems for Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetic Screening, Y. Hsieh and W.A. Korfmacher, Current Drug Metabolism Volume 7, Number 5, 2006, Pp. 479-489&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Covey TR, Lee ED, Henion JD. 1986. High-speed liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of drugs in biological samples.

Anal Chem. 1985 Feb;57(2):474-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proteomics===
LC-MS is also used in the study of [[proteomics]] where again components of a complex mixture must be detected and identified in some manner. The [[bottom-up proteomics]] LC-MS approach to proteomics generally involves protease digestion and denaturation (usually [[trypsin]] as a protease, urea to denature tertiary structure and iodoacetamide to cap cysteine residues) followed by LC-MS with [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] or LC-MS/MS (tandem MS) to derive sequence of individual peptides.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15722218&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wysocki VH, Resing KA, Zhang Q, Cheng G |title=Mass spectrometry of peptides and proteins |journal=Methods |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=211–22 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15722218 |doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2004.08.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LC-MS/MS is most commonly used for proteomic analysis of complex samples where peptide masses may overlap even with a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Samples of complex biological fluids like human serum may be run in a modern LC-MS/MS system and result in over 1000 proteins being identified, provided that the sample was first separated on an SDS-PAGE gel or HPLC-SCX.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

===Drug development===
LC-MS is frequently used in drug development at many different stages including Peptide Mapping, Glycoprotein Mapping, Natural Products Dereplication, Bioaffinity Screening, In Vivo Drug Screening, Metabolic Stability Screening, Metabolite Identification, Impurity Identification, Degradant Identification, Quantitative [[Bioanalysis]], and Quality Control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/66004558/ABSTRACT LC/MS applications in drug development, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, Mike S. Lee, Edward H. Kerns, Vol 18, 1999, pp 187-279]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry''' is a method of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by [[gas chromatography]] and detected using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16531644&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Halket JM, Zaikin VG | title = Derivatization in mass spectrometry --7. On-line derivatisation/degradation | journal = European journal of mass spectrometry (Chichester, England) | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16531644 | doi = 10.1255/ejms.785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
[[Pyrolysis]] is the thermal dissociation of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample is put into direct contact with a [[platinum]] wire, or placed in a [[quartz]] boat inside a platinum coil, and rapidly heated to 600 – 800 C. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. Various methylating reagents, which increase the volatility of polar fragments, can be added to a sample before pyrolysis. These fragments can then be separated on a gas chromatograph (GC). 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not as well-known is the pyrolysis inside a Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injector. The reason this technique is relatively unknown is that PTV injectors in general are of yet not often used. With some of the latest versions it is now possible to heat the sample very quickly until an end temperature of 600°C is reached. Some PTV's have a ramp rate of 30°C/sec. The fast ramp rate and the end temperature of 600°C are enough to make good pyrolysis. There are many advantages to using the injector as a pyrolyser. There is a price advantage, and switching from pyrolysing to normal GC injections can be done without changing the configuration of the hardware. 
Both liquid as well solid samples can be used when a PTV injector with a relative big liner is used. Real quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published.
&lt;br /&gt;

==Applications==
Pyrolysis [[gas chromatography]] is very useful for the identification of synthetic polymeric media, such as acrylics or alkyds, and synthetic varnishes.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/resources/scienceresearch/glossary.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art Conservation: Scientific Research |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used for environmental samples.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12568366&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Janos P | title = Separation methods in the chemistry of humic substances | journal = Journal of chromatography.

The '''distribution constant''' (or '''partition ratio'''), is the [[equilibrium constant]] for the distribution of an [[analyte]] in two [[immiscible]] [[solvent]]s.&lt;ref name=Rice1993&gt;{{citation | last = Rice | first =  N. M. | year = 1993 | title = Nomenclature for liquid-liquid distribution (solvent extraction) (IUPAC Recommendations 1993) | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 65 | pages = 2373 | doi = 10.1351/pac199365112373 | last2 = Irving | first2 = H. M. N. H. | last3 = Leonard | first3 = M. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a particular solvent, it is equal to the ratio of its [[molar concentration]] in the [[Stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]] to its molar concentration in the [[mobile phase]], also approximating the ratio of the [[solubility]] of the solvent in each phase. The [[technical terminology|term]] is often confused with partition [[coefficient]] or distribution coefficient, and is often represented by K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Expression==
The ratio of [[activity (chemistry)|activities]] of a [[solute]], A in an [[aqueous]]/[[organic compound|organic]] system will remain constant and independent of the total [[quantity]] of A (hence &lt;math&gt;[A]_{org} \propto [A]_{aq}&lt;/math&gt;), so at any given temperature:

&lt;math&gt;(K_D)_A = {(a_A)_{org} \over(a_A)_{aq}} \approx {[A]_{org} \over[A]_{aq}}&lt;/math&gt;

Distribution constants are useful as they allow the calculation of the concentration of remaining analyte in the solution, even after a number of [[solvent extraction]]s have occurred. They also provide guidance in choosing the most efficient way to conduct an [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extractive separation]].

Thus, the conentration of A remaining in an aqueous solution after ''i'' extractions with an organic solvent can be found using:

&lt;math&gt;[A]_i = ({V_{aq} \over V_{org} K_D + V_{aq}})^i [A]_0&lt;/math&gt;

(where [A]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the concentration of A remaining after extracting V&lt;sub&gt;aq&lt;/sub&gt; [[millilitre]]s of solution with the original concentration of [A]&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with ''i'' portions of the organic solvent, each with a volume of V&lt;sub&gt;org&lt;/sub&gt;).

The '''Freundlich equation''' or '''Freundlich adsorption isotherm''' is an [[adsorption]] [[isotherm]], which is a curve relating the [[concentration]] of a [[solute]] on the surface of an [[adsorbent]], to the concentration of the solute in the liquid with which it is in contact.  There are basically two well established types of adsorption isotherm: the Freundlich adsorption isotherm and the [[Langmuir equation|Langmuir adsorption isotherm]].

==Freundlich adsorption isotherm==
[[File:Freundlich sorption isotherm.svg|thumb|right|Example of the Freundlich isotherm, showing the amount adsorbed, q (e.g., in mol/kg), as a function of equilibrium concentration in the solution, c (e.g., in mol/L). The graph is for the values of the constants of K=4 and 1/n=0.6.]]
The Freundlich Adsorption Isotherm is mathematically expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\ x/m=Kp^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt; 

or

:&lt;math&gt;\ x/m=Kc^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:x = [[mass]] of [[adsorbate]] 
:m = mass of [[adsorbent]]
:p = [[Solubility equilibrium|Equilibrium]] [[pressure]] of adsorbate
:c = Equilibrium [[concentration]] of adsorbate in solution.
K and 1/n are constants for a given adsorbate and adsorbent at a particular temperature.

'''Kovats retention index''' (shorter '''Kovats index''', '''retention index'''; plural '''retention indices''') is a concept used in [[gas chromatography]] to convert [[retention time]]s into system-independent constants. The index is named after the Hungarian born Swiss chimist, [[Ervin Kováts]] who lied down this retention concept during the 1950s while contributing to the composition analysis of the [[essential oils]].[http://isic.epfl.ch/kovats/]

The retention indices of a certain chemical compound is its retention time normalised to the retention times of adjacently eluting n-alkanes. While retention times vary with the individual [[chromatography|chromatographic]] system (e.g. with regards to column length, film thickness, diameter, carrier gas velocity and pressure, void time), the derived retention indices are quite independent of these parameters and allow comparing values measured by different [[Analytical_chemistry|analytical laboratories]] under varying conditions. Tables of retention indices can help identify components by comparing experimentally found retention indices with known values. &lt;ref name=Kovats1958&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kovats | first =  E. | title = Gas-chromatographische Charakterisierung organischer Verbindungen. Teil 1: Retentionsindices aliphatischer Halogenide, Alkohole, Aldehyde und Ketone | volume = 41 | pages = 1915–32 | year = 1958 | journal = [[Helv. Chim. Acta]] | doi = 10.1002/hlca.19580410703}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title = retention index,  '''I''' in column chromatography |file = R05360}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=MassFinder&gt;[http://massfinder.com/wiki/Retention_index_guide Retention index guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression==
The method takes advantage of the linear relationship between the values of &lt;math&gt;log (t_r')&lt;/math&gt; and the number of [[carbon]] atoms in a [[molecule]]. The value of Kovats index is usually represented by ''I'' in [[mathematical]] expressions. Its applicability is restricted to [[organic compound]]s. For isothermal chromatography, the Kovats index is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;I = 100 \times \left [ n + ( N - n ) \frac{log (t_{r (unknown)} ') - log (t_{r (n)} ')}{log (t_{r (N)} ') - log (t_{r (n)} ')} \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

Where;

&lt;math&gt;I =&lt;/math&gt; Kovats retention index,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n =&lt;/math&gt; the number of carbon atoms in the smaller [[alkane]],&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N =&lt;/math&gt; the number of carbon atoms in the larger alkane,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;t_r' =&lt;/math&gt; the adjusted retention time.

For temperature programmed chromatography, the Kovats index is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;I = \left [ \frac{t_{r (unknown)} - t_{r (n)} )}{t_{r (N)} - t_{r (n)} } \right ] * ( 100 \times z ) + ( 100 \times n )&lt;/math&gt;

Where;

&lt;math&gt;I =&lt;/math&gt; Kovats retention index,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n =&lt;/math&gt; the number of carbon atoms in the smaller [[alkane]],&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N =&lt;/math&gt; the number of carbon atoms in the larger alkane,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;z =&lt;/math&gt; the difference of the number of carbon atoms in the smaller and larger alkane,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;t_r =&lt;/math&gt; the retention time.

In [[chromatography]], the '''retardation factor''' (also known as '''retention factor''') describes the ratio of time spent in the stationary phase relative to time spent in the mobile phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ettre | first =  L. S. | year = 1993 | title = Nomenclature for chromatography (IUPAC Recommendations 1993) | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 65 | pages = 819 | doi = 10.1351/pac199365040819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Planar chromatography==

The retardation factor in [[planar chromatography]], ''R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be mathematically described by the following ratio:&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05353.html IUPAC Gold Book  - retardation factor in planar chromatography]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ R_f = \frac{\mbox{migration distance of substance}}{\mbox{migration distance of solvent front}}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if particular substance in an unknown mixture travels 2.5 cm and the solvent front travels 5.0 cm, the retention factor would be 0.5. An R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value will always be in the range 0 to 1: if the substance moves at all, it moves along the direction the solvent (&quot;mobile phase&quot;) does less, but cannot move further than the solvent does. R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; values are only useful if they are between these two extremes. One can choose a mobile phase with different characteristics (especially polarity) in order to control how far the substance being investigated migrates. An R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; value is characteristic for any given compound (provided that the same stationary and mobile phases are used). 

It can provide corroborative evidence as to the identity of a compound. If the identity of a compound is suspected but not yet proven, an authentic sample of the compound, or standard, is spotted and run on a TLC plate side by side (or on top of each other) with the compound in question. Note that this identity check must be performed on a single plate, because it is difficult to duplicate all the factors which influence R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; exactly from experiment to experiment.

==Column chromatography==
In [[column chromatography]] the retardation factor, ''R'', is the fraction of the sample in the mobile phase at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05352.html IUPAC Gold Book - retardation factor in column chromatography ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\ R_f = \frac{1}{k+1} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the [[retention factor]].

The '''Van Deemter equation''' in [[chromatography]] relates the variance per unit length of a separation column to the linear [[mobile phase]] [[velocity]] by considering physical, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties of a separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0009-2509(56)80003-1 | author = van Deemter JJ, Zuiderweg FJ and Klinkenberg A | year = 1956 | title = Longitudinal diffusion and resistance to mass transfer as causes of non ideality in chromatography | journal = [[Chem. Eng. Sc.]] | volume = 5 | pages = 271–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties include pathways within the column, [[diffusion]] ([[axial]] and longitudinal), and [[mass transfer]] [[kinetics]] between stationary and mobile phases.  In liquid chromatography, the mobile phase velocity is taken as the exit velocity, that is, the ratio of the flow rate in ml/second to the cross-sectional area of the ‘column-exit flow path.’ For a packed column, the cross-sectional area of the column exit flow path is usually taken as 0.6 times the cross-sectional area of the column.  Alternatively, the linear velocity can be taken as the ratio of the column length to the dead time.  If the mobile phase is a gas, then the [[pressure]] correction must be applied. The variance per unit length of the column is taken as the ratio of the column length to the column efficiency in [[theoretical plate]]s.  The Van Deemter equation is a [[hyperbolic function]] that predicts that there is an optimum velocity at which there will be the minimum variance per unit column length and, thence, a maximum efficiency. The Van Deemter equation was the result of the first application of rate theory to the chromatography elution process.

==Van Deemter equation==

:&lt;math&gt; H = A + \frac{B}{u} + C \cdot u &lt;/math&gt;

Where 

* A = [[Eddy-diffusion]] 
* B = [[Longitudinal diffusion]]
* C = [[mass transfer]] kinetics of the analyte between mobile and stationary phase
* ''u'' = [[Linear Velocity]].

A is equal to the multiple paths taken by the [[chemical compound]], in open [[tubular]] [[capillary|capillaries]] this term will be zero as there are no multiple paths. The multiple paths occur in packed columns where several routes through the column packing, which results in band spreading.

B/''u'' is equal to the longitudinal diffusion of the particles of the compound.

C''u'' is equal to the equilibration point. In a column, there is an interaction between the mobile and stationary phases, C''u'' accounts for this.

A minimum value for H can be found by differentiating: 
:&lt;math&gt; U= \sqrt{\frac{B}{C}} &lt;/math&gt;

==Plate count==
[[Image:Rt 5 15.png|400px|thumb|right|Two well resolved peaks in a chromatogram]]The plate height given as:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{L}{N} \,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;L \,&lt;/math&gt; the column length and :&lt;math&gt;N\,&lt;/math&gt; the plate count can be estimated from a [[chromatogram]] by analysis of the [[retention time]] &lt;math&gt;t_R \,&lt;/math&gt; for each component and its [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma \,&lt;/math&gt; as a measure for peak width, provided that the elution curve represents a [[Gaussian curve]].

In this case the plate count is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title = plate number, N | file = P04694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N = \left(\frac{t_R}{\sigma}\right)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

By using the more practical peak width at half height &lt;math&gt;W_{1/2} \,&lt;/math&gt; the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;N = 5.55 \cdot \left(\frac{t_R}{W_{1/2}}\right)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

or with the width at the base of the peak:

:&lt;math&gt;N = 16 \cdot \left(\frac{t_R}{W_{base}}\right)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Expanded van Deemter==
The Van Deemter equation can be further expanded to:

:&lt;math&gt;H = 2\lambda d_p + 2GD_m/\mu + \omega(d_p \mbox{ or } d_c)^2\mu/D_m +Rd_f^2\mu/D_s&lt;/math&gt;

Where: 
* H is plate height
* λ is particle shape (with regard to the packing)
* d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is particle diameter
* G, ω, and R are constants
* D&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the mobile phase
* d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the capillary diameter
* d&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the film thickness
* D&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the diffusion coefficient of the stationary phase.

Van Deemter's equation indicates that band broadening mechanisms are proportionally dependent on flow rate, inversely proportional to flow rate and independent of flow rate.

The '''water bowline''' is a variation on the [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]]. It is less likely to jam or slip and can be used in extreme conditions, such as in wet environments, hence the name. There are more turns near the loop end, which makes more friction, which leads to less tension on the core of the knot.

'''Nuclear quadrupole resonance''' spectroscopy or NQR is a [[chemical analysis]] technique related to nuclear magnetic resonance ([[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceweek.com/2005/sb050128-5.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==

In NMR, nuclei with [[spin (physics)|spin]] ≥ 1/2 have a magnetic dipole moment so that their energies are split by a magnetic field, allowing resonance absorption of energy related to the difference between the ground state energy and the excited state.  In NQR, on the other hand, nuclei with spin ≥ 1 , such as &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;[[nitrogen|N]], &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;[[chlorine|Cl]] and &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;[[copper|Cu]], also have an electric [[quadrupole]] moment so that their energies are split by an electric field gradient, created by the electronic bonds in the local environment. Since unlike NMR, NQR is done in an environment without a static (or DC) magnetic field, it is sometimes called &quot;[[zero field NMR]]&quot;. Many NQR transition frequencies depend strongly upon temperature.

Any nucleus with more than one unpaired nuclear particle (protons or neutrons) will have a charge distribution which results in an electric quadrupole moment.
Allowed nuclear energy levels are shifted unequally due to the interaction of the nuclear charge with an electric field gradient supplied by the non-uniform distribution electron density (e.g. from bonding 
electrons) and/or surrounding ions.  The NQR effect results when transitions are induced 
between these nuclear levels by an externally applied [[radio frequency]] (RF) magnetic field.   
The technique is very sensitive to the nature and symmetry of the bonding around the nucleus.
The energy level shifts are much larger than the chemical shifts measured in NMR.  Due to symmetry, 
the shifts become averaged to zero in the liquid phase, so NQR spectra can only be measured 
for solids.  

==Applications==

There are several research groups around the world currently working on ways to use NQR to detect explosives.  Units designed to detect landmines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1608/MR1608.appk.pdf Appendix K: Nuclear quadrupole resonance], by Allen N. Garroway, [[Naval Research Laboratory]]. In Jacqueline MacDonald, J. R. Lockwood: [http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1608/ Alternatives for Landmine Detection]. Report MR-1608, Rand Corporation, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and explosives concealed in luggage have been tested. A detection system consists of a [[radio frequency]] (RF) power source, a coil to produce the magnetic excitation field and a detector circuit which monitors for a [[radio frequency|RF]] NQR response coming from the explosive component of the object.

Another practical use for NQR is measuring the water/gas/oil coming out of an [[oil well]] in realtime.
This particular technique allows local or remote monitoring of the extraction process, calculation of the well's remaining capacity and the water/detergents ratio the input pump must send to efficiently extract oil.

A '''4Pi Microscope''' is a laser scanning fluorescence microscope with an improved optical axis|axial resolution. The typical value of 500-700&amp;nbsp;nm can be improved to 100-150&amp;nbsp;nm which corresponds to an almost spherical focal spot with 5-7 times less volume than that of standard confocal microscopy.

==Working principle==

[[Image:Scheme-4PiMicroscope.jpg|thumb|Scheme of a 4Pi microscope]].

The improvement in resolution is achieved by using two opposing objective lenses which both are focused to the same geometrical location. Also the difference in optical paths lengths through each of the two objective lenses is carefully aligned to be minimal. By this, molecules residing in the common focal area of both objectives can be illuminated coherently from both sides and also the reflected or emitted light can be collected coherently, i.e. coherent superposition of emitted light on the detector is possible. The solid angle &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; that is used for illumination and detection is increased and approaches the ideal case. In this case the sample is illuminated and detected from all sides simultaneously.

The operation mode of a 4Pi microscope is shown in the figure. The laser light is divided by a beam splitter (BS) and directed by mirrors towards the two opposing objective lenses. At the common focal point superposition of both focused light beams occurs. Excited molecules at this position emit fluorescence light which is collected by both objective lenses, combined by the same beam splitter and deflected by a dichroic mirror (DM) onto a detector. There superposition of both emitted light pathways can take place again.

In the ideal case each objective lens can collect light from a solid angle of &lt;math&gt;\Omega=2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. So, with two objective lenses one can collect from every direction (solid angle &lt;math&gt;\Omega=4\pi&lt;/math&gt;). The name of this type of microscopy is derived from the maximal possible solid angle for excitation and detection. Practically one can achieve only aperture angles of about 140° for an objective lens, which corresponds to &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;1.3\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be operated in three different ways: In a 4Pi microscope of type A, the coherent superposition of excitation light is used to generate the increased resolution. The emission light is either detected from one side only or in an incoherent superposition from both sides. In a 4Pi microscope of type B, only the emission light is interfering. When operated in the type C mode, both excitation and emission light are allowed to interfere leading to the highest possible resolution increase (~7 fold along the optic axis as compared to confocal microscopy).

In a real 4Pi microscope light is not applied from all sides, leading to so-called side lobes in the point spread function. Typically (but not inevitably) two-photon excitation microscopy is used in a 4Pi microscope in combination with an emission pinhole to lower these side lobes to a tolerable level.

==History==

In 1971, Christoph Cremer and Thomas Cremer proposed the creation of a perfect hologram, i.e. that carries the whole field information of the emission of a point source in all directions, a so-called &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt; hologram.&lt;ref&gt;Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field: C. Cremer and T. Cremer in M1CROSCOPICA ACTA VOL. 81 NUMBER 1 September, pp. 31—44 (1978)&lt;br /&gt; [http://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/AG_Cremer/pdf-files/Cremer_Micros_Acta_1978.pdf Basic design of a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope &amp; principle of a confocal laser scanning 4Pi fluorescence microscope, 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first description of a practicable system of 4Pi microscopy, i.e. the setup with two opposing, interfering lenses, was invented by Stefan Hell in 1991&lt;ref&gt;European patent [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=EP&amp;NR=0491289 EP 0491289]&lt;/ref&gt;. He could demonstrate it experimentally also in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.W. Hell, E.H.K. Stelzer, S. Lindek, C. Cremer |title=Confocal microscopy with an increased detection aperture: type-B 4Pi confocal microscopy |journal=Optics Letters |volume=19 |year=1994 |pages=222-224 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ol-19-3-222&amp;seq=0 |doi=10.1364/OL.19.000222}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the following years the number of applications for this microscope have grown. Parallel excitation and detection with 64 spots in the sample simultaneously combined with the improved spatial resolution resulted in the successful recording of the dynamics of mitochondria in yeast cells with a 4Pi microscope in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.

'''Accelerator mass spectrometry''' (AMS) differs from other forms of mass spectrometry in that it accelerates ions to extraordinarily high kinetic energies before mass analysis. The special strength of AMS among the mass spectrometric methods is its power to separate a rare isotope from an abundant neighboring mass (&quot;abundance sensitivity&quot;, e.g. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C from &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapterurl=http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/A00048.pdf

|publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method suppresses molecular isobars completely and in many cases can separate atomic isobars (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N from &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C) also. This makes possible the detection of naturally occurring, long-lived radio-isotopes such as &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl, &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Their typical isotopic abundance ranges from 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt;. AMS can outperform the competing technique of decay counting for all isotopes where the half life is long enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16134128&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Budzikiewicz H, Grigsby RD |title=Mass spectrometry and isotopes: a century of research and discussion |journal=Mass spectrometry reviews |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=146–57 |year=2006 |pmid=16134128 |doi=10.1002/mas.20061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The method==
Generally, negative ions are created (atoms are ionized) in an ion source. In fortunate cases this already allows the suppression of an unwanted isobar, which does not form negative ions (as &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N in the case of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C measurements). The pre-accelerated ions are usually separated by a first mass spectrometer of sector-field type and enter an electrostatic &quot;tandem accelerator&quot;. This is a large nuclear particle accelerator based on the principle of a Tandem van de Graaff Accelerator operating at 0.2 to many million volts with two stages operating in tandem to accelerate the particles. At the connecting point between the two stages, the ions change charge from negative to positive by passing through a thin layer of matter (&quot;stripping&quot;, either gas or a thin carbon foil). Molecules will break apart in this stripping stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Litherland, A. E. | title = Ultrasensitive Mass Spectrometry with Accelerators | journal = Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science | year = 1980 | volume = 30 | pages = 437–473 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ns.30.120180.002253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. d. L. John | title = Mass spectrometry and geochronology | year = 1998 | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–125 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2787(1998)17:2&lt;97::AID-MAS2&gt;3.0.CO;2-J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete suppression of molecular isobars (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; in the case of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C measurements) is one reason for the exceptional abundance sensitivity of AMS.
Additionally, the impact strips off several of the ion's electrons, converting it into a positively charged ion. In the second half of the accelerator the now positively charged ion is accelerated away from the highly positive center of the electrostatic accelerator which previously attracted the negative ion. When the ions leave the accelerator they are positively charged and are moving at several percent of the speed of light. In a second stage of mass spectrometer, the fragments from the molecules are separated from the ions of interest. This spectrometer may exist of magnetic or electric Sector instrument|sectors, and so called velocity selectors, which utilizes both electric fields and magnetic fields.
After this state, no background is left, unless a stable (atomic) isobar forming negative ions exists (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;S if measuring &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl), which is not suppressed at all by the setup described so far. Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these can be separated by methods borrowed from nuclear physics, like degrader foils and gas-filled magnets.
Individual ions are finally detected by single-ion counting (with silicon surface-barrier detectors, ionization chambers, and/or time-of-flight telescopes). Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these detectors can provide additional identification of background isobars by nuclear-charge determination.

===Generalizations===
The above is an example. There are other ways in which AMS is achieved; however, they all work based on improving mass selectivity and specificity by creating high kinetic energies before molecule destruction by stripping, followed by single-ion counting.

==History==
Luis Walter Alvarez|L.W. Alvarez and Robert Cornog of the United States first used an accelerator as a mass spectrometer in 1939 when they employed a cyclotron to demonstrate that &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He was stable; from this observation, they immediately (and correctly) concluded that the other mass-3 isotope tritium was radioactive. In 1977, inspired by this early work, Richard A. Muller at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory recognized that modern accelerators could accelerate radioactive particles to an energy where the background interferences could be separated using particle identification techniques.  He published the seminal paper in Science (vol 196, pages 489-494, 1977) showing how accelerators (cyclotrons and linear) could be used for detection of tritium, radiocarbon (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), and several other isotopes of scientific interest including &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be; he also reported the first successful radioisotope date experimentally obtained using tritium (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H).  His paper was the direct inspiration for other groups using cyclotrons (G. Raisbeck and F. Yiou, in France) and tandem linear accelerators (D. Nelson, R. Korteling, W. Stott at McMaster).  K. Purser and colleagues also published the successful detection of radiocarbon using their tandem at Rochester.  Soon afterwards the Berkeley and French teams reported the successful detection of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be, an isotope widely used in geology. Soon the accelerator technique, because it was about a factor of 1000 more sensitive, virtually supplanted the older “decay counting” methods for these and other radioisotopes.

==Applications==
The  applications are many. AMS is most often employed to determine the concentration of carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, e.g. by. Archaeologists for radiocarbon dating. An accelerator mass spectrometer is required, over other forms of mass spectrometry, because of their insufficient abundance sensitivity, and to resolve stable nitrogen-14 from radiocarbon. Due to the long half-life of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, decay counting requires significantly larger samples.
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be, &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al, and &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl are used for surface exposure dating in geology.
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl, and &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I are used as hydrological tracer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Microscopy Group''' or '''AMG''' is a manufacturer of microscopes based in Mill Creek, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amgmicro.com/ Advanced Microscopy Group]&lt;/ref&gt;
Their products include the  EVOS Microscope, a digital inverted microscope for use in fluorescence and transmitted light applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photonics.com/Content/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=29924 Evos Inverted Microscope] June 12, 2007 Photonics.com&lt;/ref&gt; It utilizes a Light-emitting diode illumination system. The integrated microprocessor and imaging system, and a high resolution digital camera let users process and analyze live and captured images. The 15-inch Liquid crystal display replaces the traditional eye pieces. Software features include time-lapse, cell counting and transfection analysis.

A key feature of the EVOS fluorescence microscope is its LED-based light cube system. Each light cube integrates the illumination source, the light engine and the fluorescence filters into a single unit, removing need for alignment or calibration. The optical path is shortened and the light cube delivers bright illumination intensities. Each LED lasts for more than 50,000 hours. LEDs can be adjusted and controlled, and the chance of photobleaching or phototoxicity is reduced.

The embedded microprocessor gives users control of image acquisition and management. Mouse-controlled user interface allows adjusting illumination levels, balancing fluorescence and transmitted light channels, and capturing image data and saving it to a portable USB flash drive.

This portable unit can be placed in a cell culture hood for sensitive cell isolation procedures and is equipped with a DVI output that can be connected to an external display or monitor.

'''Alpha cleavage''', '''(α-cleavage)''' in [[organic chemistry]], refers to the act of breaking the [[carbon-carbon bond]],&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7641-2794-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Hathaway, Bruce A. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Organic chemistry the easy way |edition= |language= |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |location=Woodbury, N.Y |year=2005 |origyear= |quote= |isbn=0-7641-2794-2 |oclc= |doi= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=fjy2oJuJ_0kC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=%22Alpha+cleavage%22+%22carbon-carbon+bond%22&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;num=20&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=LsVySOaJNZOkiwGD_LgO&amp;sig=ACfU3U3IlpMzSiZN4SPDARQjeuWcUVZLyA|accessdate=|page= 315}}&lt;/ref&gt; adjacent to the carbon bearing a specified [[functional group]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00004.html |title=α-cleavage (alpha-cleavage) |accessdate=2008-07-08 |work=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology (Gold Book) |publisher=IUPAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass spectrometry==
Generally this topic is discussed when covering [[mass spectrometry]] and occurs generally by the same mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Todd1991&gt;{{cite journal | author = Todd, J. F. J. | year = 1991 | title = Recommendations for nomenclature and symbolism for mass spectroscopy (including an appendix of terms used in vacuum technology). (Recommendations 1991) | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 63 | pages = 1541 | doi = 10.1351/pac199163101541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=α-cleavage (alpha-cleavage)|file=A00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example of a mechanism of alpha cleavage, 
an electron is knocked off an atom (usually by electron collision) to form a radical cation. Electron removal generally happens in the following order:  1) [[lone pair]] electrons, 2) [[pi bond]] electrons, 3) [[sigma bond]] electrons

One of the lone pair electrons moves down to form a pi bond with an electron from an adjacent (alpha) bond.The other electron from the bond moves to an adjacent atom (not one adjacent to the lone pair atom) creating a radical. This creates a double bond adjacent to the lone pair atom (oxygen is a good example) and breaks/cleaves the bond from which the two electrons were removed.

Example C-C-(O::)-H &gt; C-C-(O:.+)-H &gt; C' + (C=O:+)-H  where : is a lone pair + is a positive charge and ' is a radical/free electron

In molecules containing carbonyl groups, often competes with [[McLafferty rearrangement]].

==Photochemistry==
In [[photochemistry]], it is the [[Homolysis|homolytic]] cleavage of a bond adjacent to a specified group.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Verhoeven1996&gt;{{cite journal | author = Verhoeven, J.

==Page &quot;renames&quot;==

You can do this yourself by using &quot;move&quot; to move the page you want to change the name of to the new name. By creating a dummy page with the new name, like with Elements from the sea, you'll need an administrator to carry out the move (which they are unlikely to do as they won't spot that you have created a dummy page!). &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:43, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

== Hoping you won't be too busy ==

Hi Italienmoose. You've probably been busy, but I just want to say that I've been hoping you'll have time to continue working on [[French]] (as well as [[A-level French]]). I've had some time to do some formatting work and add content from Wiktionary to tables, but I won't be doing any of the more substantial work, without which the book won't be too useful for beginners. Without you there won't be any active contributors soon. Thanks for your work so far, and let me know if you need anything. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:55, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

I'll see what I can do but at the moment I'm more interested in some of the science books.  Seeing as there's not really anyone to collaborate with at least that will probably speed up my progress once I get around to it.

'''Ambient ionization''' is a form of [[ion]]ization in which ions are formed outside the mass spectrometer without sample preparation or separation.&lt;ref name=Cooks2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooks | first1 = R.

==Direct analysis in real time==
Direct analysis in real time (DART) is an [[atmospheric pressure]] [[ion source]] that operates by exposing the sample to a gas stream (typically helium or nitrogen) that contains long-lived electronically or excited neutral [[atoms]], vibronically excited [[molecules]] (or [[Metastability in molecules|&quot;metastables&quot;]]).  [[Excited state]]s are formed in a [[glow discharge]] in a chamber through which the gas flows..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R.B. Cody, J.A. Laramée, H.D. Durst |journal=Anal.

==Desorption electrospray ionization==
Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) uses an [[electrospray]] source to create charged droplets that are directed at a solid sample. The charged droplets pick up the sample through interaction with the surface and then form highly charged ions that can be sampled into a mass spectrometer.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16237663&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Takáts Z, Wiseman JM, Cooks RG |title=Ambient mass spectrometry using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI): instrumentation, mechanisms and applications in forensics, chemistry, and biology |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1261–75 |year=2005 |pmid=16237663 |doi=10.1002/jms.922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization==
Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI) enables direct analysis of samples deposited on surfaces by means of a jet of hot solvent vapour and [[ultraviolet]] light. The hot jet thermally desorbs the sample from a surface and the vaporized sample is [[ionized]] by a vacuum ultraviolet light and consequently sampled into a mass spectrometer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haapala M, Pól J, Saarela V, Arvola V, Kotiaho T, Ketola RA, Franssila S, Kauppila TJ, Kostiainen R |title=Desorption Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization |journal=Anal.

==Laser assisted==
Electrospray-assisted [[laser]] desorption/ionization (ELDI) relies on a laser to the desorption of material into the electrospray plume.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16299699&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shiea J, Huang MZ, Hsu HJ, Lee CY, Yuan CH, Beech I, Sunner J |title=Electrospray-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for direct ambient analysis of solids |journal=Rapid Commun.

[[Image:WMAP 2008.png|thumb|200px|[[WMAP]] image of the (extremely tiny) anisotropies in the [[cosmic background radiation]]]]
'''Anisotropy''' ({{IPA-en|ˌænaɪˈsɒtrəpi|}}) is the property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to [[isotropy]], which implies homogeneity in all directions. It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical property (absorbance, refractive index, density, etc.) An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a [[polarizer]].

==Fields of interest==
===Computer graphics===

In the field of [[computer graphics]], an anisotropic surface will change in appearance as it is rotated about its geometric [[surface normal|normal]], as is the case with [[velvet]].

[[Anisotropic filtering]] (AF) is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view. Older techniques, such as [[bilinear filtering|bilinear]] and [[trilinear filtering]] don't take account of the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in [[aliasing]] or blurring of textures. By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.

=== Chemistry ===
A chemical anisotropic [[filter (chemistry)|filter]], as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the [[proximal]] [[region]]s filter out larger particles and [[distal]] regions increasingly remove smaller pales, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.

In [[NMR spectroscopy]], the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their [[chemical shift]].  In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of [[benzene]]. This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.

=== Wood ===
Wood is a naturally anisotropic material.  Its properties vary widely when measured with the growth grain or against it.  For example, wood's strength and hardness will be different for the same sample if measured in differing orientation.

=== Real World Imagery===
Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).

===Physics===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Birefringence]] --&gt;
[[Image:Plasma-lamp 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A [[plasma globe|plasma lamp]] displaying the nature of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]], in this case, the phenomenon of &quot;filamentation&quot;]]
[[Cosmologists]] use the term to describe the uneven temperature distribution of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. There is evidence for a so-called &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg19425994.000-axis-of-evil-a-cause-for-cosmic-concern.html 'Axis of evil' a cause for cosmic concern - space - 13 April 2007 - New Scientist Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in the early Universe that is at odds with the currently favored theory of rapid expansion after the [[Big Bang]]. Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies' rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.

[[Physicists]] use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials. [[Magnetic anisotropy]], for example, may occur in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction. Plasmas may also show &quot;filamentation&quot; (such as that seen in [[lightning]] or a [[plasma globe]]) that is directional.

An anisotropic liquid is one which has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or [[chloroform]], which contain no structural ordering of the molecules. [[Liquid crystals]] are examples of anisotropic liquids.

Some materials [[heat conduction|conduct heat]] in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source.  It is more common for heat conduction to be anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required. The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in [[electronics]] are often anisotropic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Many [[crystal]]s are anisotropic to [[light]] (&quot;optical anisotropy&quot;), and exhibit properties such as [[birefringence]]. [[Crystal optics]] describes light propagation in these media. An &quot;axis of anisotropy&quot; is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken (or an axis of symmetry, such as normal to crystalline layers). Some materials can have multiple such [[optical axis|optical axes]].

===Geophysics===
[[Seismic anisotropy]] is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction. Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic [[wavelength]] (e.g., crystals, cracks, pores, layers or inclusions) have a dominant alignment. This alignment leads to a directional variation of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] wavespeed. Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's [[crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[inner core]].

[[Geological]] formations with distinct layers of [[sedimentary]] material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; [[electrical conductivity]] in one direction (e.g. parallel to a layer), is different from that in another (e.g. perpendicular to a layer). This property is used in the gas and [[oil exploration]] industry to identify [[hydrocarbon]]-bearing sands in sequences of [[sand]] and [[shale]]. Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high [[resistivity]] (low conductivity), whereas shales have lower resistivity. [[Formation evaluation]] instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas wells.

The [[hydraulic conductivity]] of [[aquifer]]s is often anisotropic for the same reason. When calculating groundwater flow to [[drainage|drains]]&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan, 1997, The energy balance of groundwater flow applied to subsurface drainage in anisotropic soils by pipes or ditches with entrance resistance. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerart.pdf]. The corresponding free EnDrain program can be downloaded from: [http://www.waterlog.info/endrain.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Water well|wells]],&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan, 2002, Subsurface drainage by (tube)wells, 9 pp. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/wellspac.pdf]. The corresponding free WellDrain program can be downloaded from: [http://www.waterlog.info/weldrain.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability is to be taken into account otherwise the results may be subject to error.

Most common rock-forming [[mineral]]s are anisotropic, including [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]]. Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their [[optical mineralogy|optical properties]]. An example of an isotropic mineral is [[garnet]].

===Medical acoustics===
Anisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting [[echogenicity]] of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed. In [[diffusion tensor imaging]], anisotropy alterations may reflect diffusion changes of water in the brain, particularly in the [[white matter]].

===Material science and engineering===
Anisotropy, in Material Science, is a material’s directional dependence of a physical property. Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior. An example would be the dependence of [[Young's modulus]] on the direction of load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Kocks
  |first = U.F.
  |title = Texture and Anisotropy: Preferred Orientations in Polycrystals and their effect on Materials Properties
  |publisher = [[Cambridge]]
  |year = 2000
  |isbn = 9780521794206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can also be due to certain [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] patterns which are often produced during manufacturing of the material.  In the case of rolling, &quot;stringers&quot; of texture are produced in the direction of rolling, which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions.
Some materials, such as wood and fibre-reinforced [[composite material|composites]] are very anisotropic, being much stronger along the grain/fibre than across it. Metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic, though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour. This is especially important in processes such as [[Stamping (metalworking)|deep-drawing]].

===Microfabrication===

Anisotropic etching techniques (such as [[Deep reactive ion etching]]) are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high [[aspect ratio]].  These features are commonly used in [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] and [[microfluidic]] devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device. Anisotropic etching could also refer to certain chemical etchants which are etching a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes (e.g., KOH etching of [[Silicon]] [100] produces pyramid-like structures)

[[Image:Canal rays.gif|right|thumb|300 px|Canal ray tube schematic showing the rays to the right of the perforated cathode]]
'''Anode rays''' (or '''Canal rays''') are beams of positive [[ion]]s that were observed in experiments by the [[Germany|German]] [[scientist]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-941901-31-9&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Grayson, Michael A. |title=Measuring mass: from positive rays to proteins |publisher=Chemical Heritage Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages=4 |isbn=0-941901-31-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later work on anode rays by [[Wilhelm Wien]] and [[J. J. Thomson]] led to the development of [[mass spectrometry]].

==Experiments==
Goldstein used a [[Gas filled tube|gas discharge tube]] which had a perforated [[cathode]].  A &quot;ray&quot; is produced in the holes (canals) in the cathode and travels in a direction opposite to the &quot;[[cathode ray|cathode rays]],&quot; which are streams of [[electron|electrons]]. Goldstein called these positive rays &quot;Kanalstrahlen&quot; - canal rays because it looks like they are passing through a canal. In 1907 a study of how this &quot;ray&quot; was deflected in a [[magnetic field]], revealed that the [[Particle physics|particles]] making up the ray were not all the same [[mass]].  The lightest ones, formed when there was some [[hydrogen]] gas in the tube, were calculated to be about 1837 times as massive as an [[electron]]. They were [[protons]].

      <comment>/* Perltidy */ update</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
'''Perlwikibot''' is an open-source project which aims to create a complete framework for rapidly creating and deploying computer programs which can perform common repetitive tasks on [[MediaWiki]] wikis. These clients are typically called 'bots' - hence the project name.

You can help fix bugs or add new functionality to the framework. The code is licensed under the GNU General Public License. In short, this means anyone may use the code for any purpose, including commercial use, and including making and distributing modified versions so long as they provide attribution and all derivative versions are also licensed under the GPL.

== Code style ==

Perl code is hard enough to read already, so try to make an effort to write readable code.

=== Comments ===
Comments should be included wherever the code does something that isn't obvious.

;bad:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub foo {
    my $param = shift; # Take the first param
    my @args = @_;     # Take the remaining elements, if any
}
&lt;/source&gt;
;good:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub bar {
    my $param = shift; # The page to edit
    my @args  = @_;    # Contains any other settings (for example, whether to mark the edit as minor)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perltidy ===
Perltidy is a code indenter and formatter. You can use it to help clean up your Perl code. For perlwikibot, use:

 -syn    # Syntax check input and output
 -b      # Backup and modify in-place
 -l=78   # Max line width is 78 cols
 -i=4    # Indent level is 4 cols
 -ci=4   # Continuation indent is 4 cols
 -vt=0   # Minimum vertical tightness
 -vtc=0  # Minimum vertical tightness closing
 -cti=0  # No extra indentation for closing brackets
 -pt=2   # Maximum parenthesis tightness
 -sbt=2  # Maximum square bracket tightness
 -bt=1   # Medium brace tightness
 -nsfs   # No space before semicolons
 -nolq   # Don't outdent long quoted strings
 -boc    # Break at old comma breakpoints
 -bbs    # Blank line before subs
 -sot    # Stack opening tokens
 -sct    # Stack closing tokens
 -bbao   # Break before all operators

You can put this in &lt;code&gt;.perltidyrc&lt;/code&gt;, and they'll be used every time you use perltidy. Put the file in your working directory to apply only to that directory, or in your &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt; to use the settings for everything.

Alternatively, set each option as a command line option to perltidy:
 user@host:~$ perltidy -syn -b -l=78 ...

== Committing ==
=== Getting commit access ===
Ask for commit access on the [http://groups.google.com/group/perlwikibot mailing list].

=== Checkout ===
Find instructions at [https://code.google.com/p/perlwikipedia/source/checkout].
 user@host:~$ svn checkout http://perlwikipedia.googlecode.com/svn/ perlwikibot

=== Commit ===
Find instructions at [https://code.google.com/p/perlwikipedia/source/checkout]. Your password is available on the ''Settings'' tab of your ''Profile'' page (link in top-right corner).
 user@host:~$ svn checkout https://perlwikipedia.googlecode.com/svn/ perlwikibot --username $username
 # Enter your password
 # hack hack hack
 user@host:~$ svn diff
 user@host:~$ svn commit

=== Maintaining &lt;code&gt;./trunk/Changes&lt;/code&gt; ===
The Changes file is for major things that the user will want to know about. If your commit fixes a bug or adds a feature, update Changes, if you commit fixes formatting, adds documentation, or adds or edits tests, don't bother with the Changes file. The Changes is meant to be a way for a user to see what changed when they update without looking into the repository.

When you fix a bug or add a new feature, add a note to the &quot;unreleased&quot; section in &lt;code&gt;./trunk/Changes&lt;/code&gt; ''in the same commit''. If there is no &quot;unreleased&quot; section, create one. When the next release is made, the release manager will move all the notes into a release section and create a new section for changes to be added to for the next release.

=== Using &lt;code&gt;git-svn&lt;/code&gt; ===
Everyone hates SVN, but sometimes you have to use it. [[Git/git-svn|git-svn]] might make using SVN more palatable, though it isn't a cure-all.

The perlwikibot repository is quite small (&lt;300 commits as of May 2010), so you should have no problem making your own clone:
 user@host:~$ git svn clone http://perlwikipedia.googlecode.com/svn/ perlwikibot
 # wait, wait, wait
 # still waiting, SVN is horrid isn't it?
 # hack hack hack
 user@host:~$ git commit ...
 user@host:~$ git svn dcommit

''Don't'' use git branches, SVN doesn't understand them and you'll get useless commit messages like &quot;Merging branch 'feature_branch'&quot; instead of your real commit message. If you figure out how to make git branches and SVN play nicely, update this page!

Mike pushes his git repo to [http://github.com/mikelifeguard/perlwikibot github]; do with it what you will.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''BASICS OF IRON &amp; STEEL'''

Iron and Steel industry has been one of the oldest and has been an instrumental industry collaborating in the growth of mankind, civilizations and modern world.
As it is rightly envisaged in their statement India's major public sector steel giant STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA LIMITED's catch line&quot;There is a little bit of Steel in everybody's life&quot;

If you had to name the technologies that had the greatest effect on modern society, the refining of the heavy metal element iron  would have to be near the top. Iron makes up a huge array of modern products. especially carbon-rich, commercial iron, which we call steel. Cars, tractors, bridges, trains (and their rails), tools, skyscrapers, guns and ships all depend on iron and steel to make them strong. Iron is so important that primitive societies are measured by the point at which they learn how to refine it. This is where the &quot;Iron Age&quot; classification comes from.

­Have you ever wondered how people refine iron and steel? You've probably heard ­of iron ore, but how do we turn a slab of rock into a set of stainless steel surgical instruments or a locomotive? In this article, you'll learn all about iron and steel. 
I thought why not gift the community with an easy to refer book on Steel making with information and insights on the happenings, developments and achievements in this wonderful industry.,

So, let's get going..

But, HOLD ON .. Before we dive into the world of steel making, let us first go through why do we need to know all this, don't you agree?

'''The Advantages of Iron'''
­
­Iron is an incredibly useful substance.It's less brittle than stone yet, compared to wood or copper, extremely strong. If properly heated, iron is also relatively easy to shape into various forms, as well as refine, using simple tools. And speaking of those tools, unlike wood, iron can handle high temperatures, allowing us to build everything from fire tongs to furnaces out of it.In contrast to most substances, you can also magnetize iron, making it useful in the creation of electric motors and generators. Finally, there certainly aren't any iron shortages to worry about. 
The Earth's crust is 5 percent iron, and in some areas, the element concentrates in ores that contain as much as 70 percent iron.

When you compare iron and steel with something like aluminum, you can see why it was so important historically. To refine aluminum, you need access to huge quantities of electricity. Furthermore, to shape aluminum, you have to either cast it or extrude it. Iron, however, is much easier to manipulate. The element has been useful to people for thousands of years, while aluminum really didn't exist in any meaningful way until the 20th century.

­Fortunately, iron can be created relatively easily with tools that were available to primitive societies. There will likely come a day when humans become so technologically advanced that iron is completely replaced by aluminum, plastics and things like carbon and glass fibers. But right now, the economic equation gives inexpensive iron and steel a huge advantage over these much more expensive alternatives.

The only real problem with iron and steel is rust. Fortunately, you can control rust by painting, galvanizing, chrome plating or coating the iron with a sacrificial anode, which corrodes faster than the stronger metal. Think of this last option as hiring a bodyguard to take a bullet for the president. The more active metal has to almost completely corrode before the less active iron or steel begins the process.

­Humans have come up with countless uses for iron, from carpentry tools and culinary equipment to complicated machinery and instruments of torture. Before iron can be put to any of these uses, however, it has to be mined from the ground. 

'''Iron'''

This element is fairly-good reducing agent- so good that it rarely appears uncombined in nature. Iron is by far the most common of these. One of the most common elements in the universe, it is the heaviest metal that forms in normal fusion in stars (but only the largest stars). Once a star begins to produce iron in its core, that star is doomed in short order to a violent explosion that destroys the star and scatters its matter, including all of the elements that it has formed in fusion.

Uncombined iron is found in meteors, solid objects that strike the earth. Iron is by far the most common of the transition elements, and one of the most useful. It's hard to count all the uses of iron, the metal most used (whether pure or in alloys) in almost all machines. Giant &quot;glass box&quot; skyscrapers depend upon iron bars within their concrete &quot;skeletons&quot; to give them strength and stability. The rails of railroads are long iron bars. Concrete highways and airstrips have iron re-enforcing bars to give them the strength to hold heavy vehicles. The vehicles themselves are largely iron and a harder material known as steel, an alloy of iron, carbon, and often metals other than iron.

Iron is the cheapest of all structural metals. With some skill of an artisan known as a blacksmith it can be worked into many useful objects such as horseshoes, nails, plows, chains, pails, ladders, and many tools. In foundries, iron and steel are shaped in far greater quantities into such objects as furniture and parts of aircraft, ships, motor vehicles, and appliances.

Iron has one fault as a structural material: it rusts easily. In the presence of water (especially salt water) it corrodes into oxides:

'''Fe(s) + 1/2 O2(g) → FeO(s) 2 Fe(s) + 3/2 O2(g) → Fe2O3(s)'''

and a mixed oxide known as hematite

'''2 Fe(s) + 3/2 O2(g) → Fe2O3(s)'''

one of the most common ores of iron. Iron oxides are mildly alkaline, so iron resists attacks by alkalis; acids attack it. For example,

'''Fe (s) + H2SO4(l) → Fe2+(aq) + SO42-(aq) + H2(g)'''

Even a comparatively weak acid, like phosphoric acid, can attack iron oxide. This is the &quot;naval jelly&quot; reaction that removes rust from iron:
'''
FeO(s) + H3PO4(l) → Fe2+(aq) + HPO4(aq)-2 + H2O(l)'''

A great advance of humanity, the beginning of the Iron Age, began when people found that they could separate iron from oxygen by burning it with carbon (usually charcoal) which can reduce iron oxides to iron:
'''
Fe3O4(s) + 4 C(s) → 3 Fe(s) + 4 CO(g)'''

Much of existing economic activity depends upon the extraction of iron ore, the reduction of iron ore to iron, the strengthening of iron to steel, the creation of iron and steel objects, and the various practices used in protecting iron from corrosion.

Important as that activity is, our lives would be impossible without an important compound of iron known as hemoglobin which carries oxygen through the bloodstream to cells where the cells can use the oxygen to release energy from food also delivered to cells through the bloodstream.
The earth itself has a hot, dense core of largely iron and nickel. At the temperatures characteristic of the Earth's core the iron and nickel form a giant natural magnet that creates a magnetic field that goes beyond the Earth itself into the atmosphere. That magnetic field drives off much dangerous radiation that would kill life on the Earth's surface if it reached the earth's surface.</text>

=== Description ===

It was aimed to measure Leader-Member Exchange (LMX). Therefore a multidimensional measure was developed and validated. Item analysis involving 302 working students, followed by construct and criterion-related validation using 249 employees representing two organizations resulted in a multidimensional LMX scale. The results provided support for the affect, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Loyalty|loyalty]], and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Contribution|contribution]] dimensions identified by Dienesch and Liden (1986), as well as a fourth dimension, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Professional respect|professional respect]]. The following items are taken from the affect dimension of LMX.

=== Items ===

*I like my supervisor very much as a person.
*My supervisor is the kind of person one would like to have as a friend.
*My supervisor is a lot of fun to work with.

=== Description ===

It was aimed to measure Leader-Member Exchange (LMX). Therefore a multidimensional measure was developed and validated. Item analysis involving 302 working students, followed by construct and criterion-related validation using 249 employees representing two organizations resulted in a multidimensional LMX scale. The results provided support for the [[Handbook of Management Scales/Affect|affect]], [[Handbook of Management Scales/Loyalty|loyalty]], and contribution dimensions identified by Dienesch and Liden (1986), as well as a fourth dimension, [[Handbook of Management Scales/Professional respect|professional respect]]. The following items are taken from the contribution dimension of LMX used in the addendum of the article.

=== Items ===

*I do work for my supervisor that goes beyond what is specified in my job description.
*I am willing to apply extra efforts, beyond those normally required, to meet my supervisor's work goals.
*I do not mind working my hardest for my supervisor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strategic IT planning ==
=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the strategic IT planning dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

Strategic IT planning characterizes an organization’s competence in matching IT capabilities with the changing, cross-functional  business requirements of the enterprise.

=== Items ===

*We constantly review our IT capabilities against strategic goals.
*IT plans are redesigned as required to meet evolving conditions.
*Strategic IT planning is a continuous process.
*Written guidelines exist to structure strategic IT planning in our organization.
*Top management is not involved in strategic IT planning. (reversed coded)
*Strategic IT planning includes inputs from all functional areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the '''Programming with ooc''' book. This is the first comprehensive effort to cover the entirety of the ooc language, among with a collection of idioms, in order to allow the general public to discover the language.

== About ooc ==
[[File:Bk_Llama,_Kristiansand_Zoo,_Norway.jpg|thumb|270px|A llama, the mascot of ooc]]

ooc is a modern, self-hosting, object-oriented, functional-ish, high-level, low-level sexy programming language, starring closures, interfaces, enums, garbage collection.. It strives to be powerful, modular, extensible, portable, yet simple and fast.

The main implementation ooc is rock, a self-hosting compiler which translates ooc sources to C source code, and then use a C compiler to produce an executable.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the project management dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

Project management involves the use of skills and knowledge in coordinating the scheduling and monitoring of defined activities to ensure that the stated objectives of implementation projects are achieved.

=== Items ===

*The tasks to be performed during the ERP project are clearly defined.
*The responsibilities of project team members are clearly defined.
*There is a formal management process to track external contractor activities.
*Problems found during reviews of external project members are not tracked to closure. (reverse coded)
*Measurements are used to determine the status of project tasks.
*Project tasks are reviewed on a periodic basis.
*The ERP project leader is able to track project tasks to completion.
*The ERP project leader is experienced in project management.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the IT skills dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

A competency in IT skills refers to the ability to configure and maintain information systems in support of the business.

=== Items ===

*The internal IT staff have the ability to conduct routine ERP system maintenance.
*There is a high degree of technical expertise in the IT organization.
*The database administrator is an expert in the ERP database management system.
*Internal IT team members understand custom ERP software programs.
*The IT staff are able to efficiently implement ERP system upgrades.
*The IT staff have the technical ability to conduct a formal validation of all system changes.
*IT staff are able to analyze the technical impact of proposed system changes.
*The IT staff actively builds relationships with business managers.
*IT staff offer ideas on how IT can be used to achieve business goals.
*IT staff communicate with functional use groups in the ERP Entity.
*The IT organization provides a service to the business.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the business process skills dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

Business process skills represents an understanding of how the business operates, and the ability to predict the impact of a particular decision or action on the rest of the enterprise (Roth et al. 1995).

=== Items ===

*There is a high level of business process knowledge within the ERP Entity.
*Employees understand how their actions impact the operations of other functional areas.
*Employees understand how their daily business activities support the goals of  the ERP Entity.
*Managers are not clear on how ERP-focused business processes support the goals of the ERP Entity.
*The operational processes of the ERP Entity are formally documented. (*)
*Our ERP Entity's business process documentation reflects actual operational activities. (*)
*Functional managers are able to document cross-functional business process flows. (*)
*Business process design is driven by customer requirements. (*)
*Managers are skilled at analyzing business processes for customer benefits.

(*) = standard path loading below 0.5.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the ERP training dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

ERP training refers to the processes involved in teaching each of the various user groups to use the ERP system efficiently in their day-to-day activities.

=== Items ===

*Specific user training needs were identified early in the implementation.
*A formal training program has been developed to meet the requirements of ERP system users.
*Training materials have been customized for each specific job.
*We seldom update training materials to reflect system changes.
*Training materials target the entire business task, not just the ERP screens and reports.
*Employees are tracked to ensure that they have received the appropriate ERP system training.
*All users have been trained in basic ERP system skills.
*ERP system training review sessions are scheduled.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the learning dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

The learning competency refers to activities designed to identify cutting-edge ERP techniques from both internal and external sources. It also encompasses the formal and/or informal process of pilot-testing these new methods of using the capabilities of ERP system to deliver business value in day-to-day operations.

=== Items ===

*Benchmarking is used to identify cutting-edge ERP techniques.
*We keep track of ERP developments related to our industry.
*Cross-functional groups meet regularly to discuss new uses for the ERP system.
*Internal groups meet regularly to share new methods of using the ERP system.
*ERP improvement suggestions are regularly collected from multiple employee levels.
*Business experiments are conducted to evaluate potential improvements in the way we use ERP.
*ERP experimentation is encouraged even if the proposed improvement is unsuccessful.
*External ERP experts are invited to suggest better ways to use the ERP system.

=== Description ===

The paper defines and operationalizes eight Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) competence constructs. A two-stage normative process of scale development is followed. First, a portfolio of eight generic constructs that are hypothesized to be associated with successful ERP adoption is identified. Each construct is then operationalized as a multi-item measurement scale by applying a manual item sorting technique iteratively to independent panels of expert judges until tentative reliability and validity is established. Second, the multi-item scales is further refined and validated using survey data from 79 North American manufacturing users of ERP systems. The following items are taken from the change readiness dimension of the ERP competence construct.

=== Definition ===

Change readiness refers to the managerial strategies used to overcome workforce resistance to the operational changes resulting from the implementation of the ERP system.

=== Items ===

*Employees understand how they fit into the new ERP Entity.
*Employees have input into how their jobs will change with new ERP business processes.
*Management actively works to alleviate employee concerns about ERP.
*An ERP support group is available to answer concerns about ERP job changes.
*The roles of all employees under the ERP system have been clearly communicated.
*The change readiness of employees impacted by the ERP system is regularly assessed.
*Employees are not prepared for a series of ERP-related changes as the system evolves. (reverse coded)
*ERP-focused changes to the employee reward system have been communicated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Computer Programming/Control/0}}
{{wikipedia|Control flow}} __TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
{{Computer Programming/Control/1}}

 {{ooc/kw|if}} (''condition'') {
     ''statement''
 } {{ooc/kw|else}} {
     ''other statement''
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/1.1}}

 {{ooc/kw|if}} (''condition'') {
     ''statement''
 } {{ooc/kw|else}} {{ooc/kw|if}} (''condition'') {
     ''other statement''
 } {{ooc/kw|else}} {{ooc/kw|if}} (''condition'') {
     ''other statement''
 ...
 } {{ooc/kw|else}} {
     ''another statement''
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/1.3}}


=== ''match'' ===

Often it is necessary to compare one specific variable against several constant expressions. For this kind of conditional expression the ''match'' statement exists. For example:

 {{ooc/kw|match}} (x) {
   {{ooc/kw|case}} 1 =&gt;
      walkTheDog()
 
   {{ooc/kw|case}} 5 =&gt;
      launchNuke()
  
   {{ooc/kw|case}} =&gt;
      selfDestruct()
  }

The last ''case'' here has an empty condition. It's called a ''catch-all case'', which code will be executed in case none of the above cases are matched.

Unlike ''switch'' in C or Java, there is no need to break of a case explicitly with the ''break'' keyword. Only one case per match is only ever executed. This enforces simple designs, at the cost of some flexibility. For example, [[w:Duff's_device|Duff's device]] can't be written in ooc.

However, in some ways, ''match'' is more flexible than a switch. For example, you can have a match without an initial condition:

 {{ooc/kw|match}} {
   {{ooc/kw|case}} (x &lt; 0) =&gt;
      -1
 
   {{ooc/kw|case}} (x &gt; 0) =&gt;
      1
  
   {{ooc/kw|case}} =&gt;
      0
 }

Here we define custom conditions inside the cases, rather than values to compare. The parenthesis are optional, but included here for the sake of readability. It behaves exactly as if we had written ''{{ooc/kw|match}} (true) {'' on the first line.

Another difference with traditional ''switch'' statements is that a ''match'' can be used as an expression. In that case, it's evaluated to the value of the last statement in the case executed. It's a good idea to have a ''catch-all case'' when you use a match as an expression, so that there are no cases where the value is undetermined.

Finally, values are compared using the equality operator ''=='', which can &amp;mdash; like any ooc operator &amp;mdash; be overloaded. This means that ''match'' works with strings as well, which have ''=='' overloaded in the core sdk:

 {{ooc/kw|match}} (humor) {
   {{ooc/kw|case}} &quot;sad&quot; =&gt;
      ohNoes()
 
   {{ooc/kw|case}} &quot;happy&quot; =&gt;
      yay()
  
   {{ooc/kw|case}} =&gt;
      bahHumbug()
 }

By overloading the ''=='' operator, it is possible to use any user-defined type in a ''match'' statement.

== Unconditionals ==

=== ''return'' ===

''return'' exits the current function, optionally passing to the outer scope any value you gave to it

  {{ooc/kw|return}} 42

''return'' doesn't always have a value, it can also only simply be used to exit a function at any point

  {{ooc/kw|return}}

=== ''goto'' ===

ooc doesn't have a ''goto'' keyword. You can control the flow of loops with ''break'' and ''continue'', and exit function via ''return''. The ooc language thrives to be simple, and considers that ''goto'' doesn't belong to a high-level language. See [[w:Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]]'s work for further reading &lt;ref name=&quot;dijkstra1968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[w:Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] | year = 1968 | month = March | url = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF |format=PDF| title = Go To Statement Considered Harmful | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–148 | doi = 10.1145/362929.362947 |quote=The unbridled use of the go to statement has as an immediate consequence that it becomes terribly hard to find a meaningful set of coordinates in which to describe the process progress.  ... The go to statement as it stands is just too primitive, it is too much an invitation to make a mess of one's program.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Computer Programming/Control/7}}

 {{ooc/kw|while}} (true) {
   doSomething()
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/8}}

 {{ooc/kw|while}} (x &lt; 5) {
   x = calculateSomething()
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/10}}

 {{ooc/kw|while}} (true) {
   x = calculateSomething()
 
   {{ooc/kw|if}} (x &gt; 5) {
     {{ooc/kw|break}}
   }
 
   doSomething(x)
 }

=== Skipping iterations ===

The ''continue'' keyword can be used to zap the rest of the loop's body and go directly to the next iteration.

 {{ooc/kw|while}} (true) {
   x = calculateSomething()
 
   {{ooc/kw|if}} (x == 5) {
     {{ooc///|skip the 5th step}}
     {{ooc/kw|continue}}
   }
 
   doSomething(x)
 }

{{Computer Programming/Control/11}}

 {{ooc/kw|for}} (i in 1..11) {
    doSomething(i)
 }

Ranges are delimited by ''..'' &amp;mdash; You can store ranges and re-use them later, e.g.:

 range := 1..11

 {{ooc///|then, later:}}
 {{ooc/kw|for}} (i in range) {
    doSomething(i)
 }

This works because ''1..11'' constructs a new ''Range'', which is a ''cover type''. Covers are explained in later chapters.

''for'' allows to iterate through values of any types, as long as they implement the ''iterator'' method, returning an ''Iterator''. For example, you can iterate over ''ArrayList''s:

 list := [&quot;moody&quot;, &quot;jolly&quot;, &quot;bored&quot;] as ArrayList&lt;Int&gt;
 {{ooc/kw|for}} (state in list) {
   println(state)
 }

      <text xml:space="preserve">There were many causes for hatred of the Armenians. One major factor was the fact that Armenians were primarily Christian, in an otherwise predominantly Muslim area, which was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. Because they were Christian, many Armenians attended missionary schools, and were better educated than the average Turkish citizen, which led to growing resentment of Armenians (Freedmen, 14).  	

==Abdul Hamid II==
Under the rule of Abdul Hamid II, in the late 19th century, Armenians came to be considered second-class citizens (Freedmen, 14). This established a precedent, which took a world war to be fully broken, with devastating effects. Eventually, Ismail Enver Pasha and Talet Bey overthrew Abdul, but continued to persecute Armenians. At the beginning of World War I, most Armenian men aged 45 to 60 were forced into the Ottoman Army, and compelled to do menial tasks, such as carrying heavy supplies for soldiers on foot (Balakian, 178). Nearly all the remaining Armenian men were taken away from their town, and systematically shot (Balakian, 175). Many women were forced to become Kurdish or Turkish wives, against their will, and many children were left orphaned (Freedmen, 32). Those families that were not immediately separated were forced to walk thousands of miles into deserts, where they were abandoned, and left to die.

Abdul Hamid II was extremely paranoid, persecuted the Armenians. Being an insomniac, Abdul tended to pace around his palace at night, with a loaded pistol. He kept the safety off, and killed at least two palace workers who startled him during the night. In addition, he believed that people tried to poison his food, and created elaborate food preparation procedures, including bars on the kitchen windows. He also was gullible: early in his life, a fortune-teller told him to drink a specific mixture every day, or he would die. He followed her advice, and continued drinking the substance every day until he died (Balakian, 48).  

His paranoia spread to his ruling as well. Books were censored for bizarre reasons and phones were tapped (Spencer, 95). One reason many science textbooks were censored is they contained the word &quot;H2O,&quot; which Abdul believed looked like code for &quot;Hamid II is nothing,&quot; (Balakian, 48) 	Abdul had a strong hatred for Armenians, which may have been started by the fact that many historians believe that his mother was Armenian. He was known to be very close to her, but she was a drug addict, and died when Abdul was only 7 years old (Balakian, 35). Throughout his life, Abdul’s father ignored him. 	

Abdul soon began policies against Armenians. He passed laws stating that Christians could not travel throughout the Ottoman Empire without a permit, and banned all public references to Armenia (Spencer, 95). Abdul also began to refer to Armenians only as &quot;the loyal millet&quot; (implying the Armenians were loyal to the Russians). He also is quoted as saying &quot;I will soon settle those Armenians. I will... make them smart, and relinquish their revolutionary ambitions,&quot; (Balakian, 36). He also increased taxes on Armenians (Adalian). His actions culminated in the Hamidian Massacres. From 1894 through 1896, Hamid, under a guise that Armenians were taking Kurdish land, allowed Turkish and Kurdish groups to attack Armenian villages. An attempt was made by a group of Armenians to bring their plight onto the world stage by taking over the Ottoman Bank. This caused a mob of 50,000 Turks to form and kill 600,000 Armenians (Adalian). These terrible actions led many world leaders to nickname Hamid The Great Assassin (Freedmen, 11).  	

By establishing policies that ultimately killed Armenians, Abdul Hamid II established a custom of distrust of them, as well as all citizens. When, in 1913, Hamid's government was taken over, the extensive spy network he created was a valuable asset for the new government in its attempts to persecute Armenians. In fact, in the words of Colgate University professor Peter Balakian &quot;The very sultan [the Young Turks] had just deposed had expanded the Ottoman bureaucracy by creating the most extensive system of intelligence in the empire's history,&quot; (181). 	

==Ismail Enver Pasha==
Ismail Enver Pasha helped overthrow Hamid Abdul II in 1913, but continued the brutality towards Armenians. By 1889, a new Turkish group had formed: the Young Turks. Originally, their ideas centered on liberty; an early advocate of the Young Turks movement, Ali Suavi, described their ideas as &quot;for the first time, the idea of a Turkish, as distinct from an Islamic or Ottoman loyalty,&quot; (Balakian, 135). However, in the 1890's, the movement split. One group became pro-democracy, against Abdul Hamid II, and was sympathetic to the Armenians plight. On the other hand, the remaining side grew into a more nationalistic Turkish group. One historian described their goals: to &quot;solve the problems for all the peoples and ethnic minorities in the empire,&quot; (Balakian, 140). In 1906, a political party was created by some nationalistic Young Turks at the Imperial Military Medical School in Constantinople (Balakian, 139), called the Committee on Union and Progress (CUP) (Freedmen, 13). 	

In 1913, CUP took over the Ottoman Empire, overthrowing Abdul's government. The three leaders, Enver Pasha, the minister of war, Telet Bey, the minister of the interior, and Ahmed Djemal, the minister of the marine, formed what is often referred to as the Young Turk Triumvirate (Adalian). In the process, Enver gained control of the Ottoman Special Organization, the spy network that was set up by Hamid.

In 1914, the Young Turk army, led by Enver, lost the battle of Sankamish, badly (Balakian, 178). To keep his strong outward face of power, Enver blamed the Armenians, just as Abdul did, by claiming they were spying for the Russians. The Ottoman government soon began to manufacture more propaganda that the Armenians were helping the Russians (Freedman, 17). One example of this is a statement released by the government: &quot;The Armenians are in league with the enemy. They will launch an uprising,&quot; (Balakian 182). It also began a policy of disarming all Armenian men. Soon after, a plan was put in place to massacre them, which involved taking them off to far areas and shooting them.

Following the plan to murder the men, the Young Turk Triumvirate, led by Enver, established what British historians James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee dubbed the &quot;Reign of Terror,&quot; (181). In it, all Armenians, men or women, were disarmed, officials followed practices involving randomly breaking into Armenian homes, arresting and executing many Armenians (Balakian, 178). The Ottoman Special Organization's Kurdish armies carried out the policy, and they were given a lot of freedom to commit terrible acts against Armenians (Freedmen, 20). Because of the bureaucracy and extensive intelligence set up by Abdul, Enver was able to more easily institute his plan.  	

==Mehmet Telet Bey==
Another important figure in the Armenian genocide was Mehmet Telet Bey. He was also a member of CUP, but before it, he had worked as a telegrapher. This aided him in helping CUP with intelligence, especially when plotting to overthrow Abdul (Adalian). Before helping found CUP, Telet and Enver worked together as war profiteers in Constantinople (Freedmen, 18).  	After CUP took over, Telet became minister of the interior. In 1915, following a series of propaganda messages by CUP, Telet issued a statement, reiterating CUP's claim that Armenians had been helping the Russians, and claiming that the only way to save the Ottoman Empire was to deport them. Unfortunately, the Ottoman Empire tended to abandon the Armenians after deporting them. On April 24th, 1915, hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and leaders were executed. To this day, April 24th is considered a day of mourning by Armenians (Freedmen, 27). 	

In May 1915, Telet passed the Temporary Law of Deportation. It stated that, in the interest of national security, the Ottoman government could deport any Armenian citizen, if they were &quot;suspected of treason,&quot; (Freedmen, 22). In practice, this meant that the Ottoman government could deport Armenians whenever they wanted.  	Soon after the Temporary Law of Deportation, Telet issued another government proclamation. In the proclamation, Telet demanded that all Armenians, except those who were sick, had to leave their homes within five days. They would be escorted from their homes by armed guards. In the meantime, the report also stated, Armenians could not sell any property they owned, but they could only take with them what they could carry. This effectively robbed all Armenians of everything they owned. According to the report, those who did not cooperate would be killed (Freedmen, 23). By issuing this order, Telet officially ordered the genocide of the Armenians (Freedmen, 19). 	

The effects of Telet's two acts were devastating. Almost all healthy Armenian men who hadn't been killed were, and all the women, along with the elderly and children were forced to walk up to one thousand miles to Syria and Mesopotamia (present day Iraq), causing many to die of exposure-related ailments, and many others shot by the armed guards. In northern Turkey, some Armenians were taken by rail cars. However, upon arrival, the Armenians were abandoned in the remote regions of the desert, with almost no possibility of survival (Freedmen, 24). This terrible situation was only made worse by Telet: on March 29, 1916, he formally rejected aid, disallowing aid agencies from helping those starving and dying without any water or food (Freedmen, 53). Telet also specifically ordered that all Armenian orphans be killed (Adalian).  	

Telet also appointed Dr. Behaeddin Shakir. Starting in 1915, he gradually took over CUP's operation to kill Armenians. By lobbying for the Special Organization, the elaborate spy network set up by Abdul Hamid II, to have more power, he allowed the government to have less interaction and therefore less responsibility in the extermination, one of the most devastating things he did. In the eastern section of Turkey, he persuaded CUP to allow the Special Organization complete autonomy (Balakian, 182).  	

He also instituted a killing program, which encouraged the killing of Armenians by Turks and Kurds. There were many causes for this, including greed for Armenian belongings, the idea of a holy war, or jihad, for Islam, and abstract ideas of Turkish nationalism (Balakian, 183). According to Professor Balakian, &quot;Dr. Shakir played a role not unlike that of Nazi Reich security head Reinhard Heydrich.&quot;  (183). 	

In conclusion, the actions of Hamid Abdul II, Enver Pasha, and Telet Bey caused the deaths of over 1 million Armenians. These actions set an unfortunate precedent of genocide. In a small number of cases, the Turks used a primitive form of gas chambers, where Armenians were forced inside a cave containing a fire, which was then sealed airtight (Balakian, 176). In 1917, Enver Pasha met with German Chancellor Wilhelm II, aboard a German warship (Freedmen, 39). In this meeting, many historians believe the Ottoman Turks gave the Nazis ideas relating to genocide, such as gas chambers. When Telet was being prosecuted for war crimes, he escaped extradition in Germany. During Hitler’s reign, he was given a full military burial. 	

In addition, the precedent set by the genocide has continued. Genocide still occurs around the world today, and the Turkish government has yet to recognize the genocide of the Armenian people. Because of their horrendous actions, three people significantly altered the course of history, and ruined the lives of millions of Armenian people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Libraries|File IO}}

The '''C standard library''' is a standardized collection of header files and library routines used to implement common operations, such as input/output and character string handling. Unlike other languages (such as COBOL, Fortran, and PL/I) C does not include builtin keywords for these tasks, so nearly all C programs rely on the standard library to function.

== History ==
The C programming language previously did not provide any elementary functionalities, such as I/O operations. Over time, user communities of C shared ideas and implementations to provide that functionality. These ideas became common, and were eventually incorporated into the definition of the standardized C programming language. These are now called the '''C standard libraries'''.

Both Unix and C were created at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During the 1970s the C programming language became increasingly popular, with many universities and organizations beginning to create their own variations of the language for their own projects. By the start of the 1980s compatibility problems between the various C implementations became apparent. In 1983 the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to establish a standard specification of C known as &quot;ANSI C&quot;. This work culminated in the creation of the so-called '''C89''' standard in 1989. Part of the resulting standard was a set of software libraries called the '''ANSI C standard library'''.

Later revisions of the C standard have added several new required header files to the library. Support for these new extensions varies between implementations.

The headers '''&lt;iso646.h&gt;''', '''&lt;wchar.h&gt;''', and '''&lt;wctype.h&gt;''' were added with Normative Addendum 1 (hereafter abbreviated as '''NA1'''), an addition to the C Standard ratified in 1995.

The headers '''&lt;complex.h&gt;''', '''&lt;fenv.h&gt;''', '''&lt;inttypes.h&gt;''', '''&lt;stdbool.h&gt;''', '''&lt;stdint.h&gt;''', and '''&lt;tgmath.h&gt;''' were added with '''C99''', a revision to the C Standard published in 1999.

{{NOTE|The [[C++]] programming language includes the functionality of the ANSI C 89 standard library, but has made several modifications, such as placing all identifiers into the &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt; namespace and changing the names of the header files from &lt;tt&gt;&lt;xxx.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;cxxx&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (however, the C-style names are still available, although deprecated).}}

== Design ==
The declaration of each function is kept in a header file, while the actual implementation of functions are separated into a library file. The naming and scope of headers have become common but the organization of libraries still remains diverse. The standard library is usually shipped along with a compiler. Since C compilers often provide extra functionalities that are not specified in ANSI C, a standard library with a particular compiler is mostly incompatible with standard libraries of other compilers.


Much of the C standard library has been shown to have been well-designed.  A few parts, with the benefit of hindsight, are regarded as mistakes.  The string input functions &lt;code&gt;gets()&lt;/code&gt; (and the use of &lt;code&gt;scanf()&lt;/code&gt; to read string input) are the source of many buffer overflows, and most programming guides recommend avoiding this usage.  Another oddity is &lt;code&gt;strtok()&lt;/code&gt;, a function that is designed as a primitive [[w:lexical analysis|lexical analyser]] but is highly &quot;fragile&quot; and difficult to use.

== ANSI Standard ==
The ANSI C standard library consists of 24 C header files which can be included into a programmer's project with a single directive. Each header file contains one or more function declarations, data type definitions and macros. The contents of these header files follows.

In comparison to some other languages (for example Java) the standard library is minuscule.  The library provides a basic set of mathematical functions, string manipulation, type conversions, and file and console-based I/O.  It does not include a standard set of &quot;container types&quot; like the C++ Standard Template Library, let alone the complete graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits, networking tools, and profusion of other functionality that Java provides as standard.  The main advantage of the small standard library is that providing a working ANSI C environment is much easier than it is with other languages, and consequently porting C to a new platform is relatively easy.  

Many other libraries have been developed to supply equivalent functionality to that provided by other languages in their standard library.  For instance, the GNOME desktop environment project has developed the GTK+ graphics toolkit and GLib, a library of container data structures, and there are many other well-known examples.  The variety of libraries available has meant that some superior toolkits have proven themselves through history.  The considerable downside is that they often do not work particularly well together, programmers are often familiar with different sets of libraries, and a different set of them may be available on any particular platform.

== Common support libraries ==

While not standardized, C programs may depend on a runtime library of routines which contain code the compiler uses at runtime. The code that initializes the process for the operating system, for example, before calling &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;, is implemented in the C Run-Time Library for a given vendor's compiler. The Run-Time Library code might help with other language feature implementations, like handling uncaught exceptions or implementing floating point code.

The C standard library only documents that the specific routines mentioned in this article are available, and how they behave. Because the compiler implementation might depend on these additional implementation-level functions to be available, it is likely the vendor-specific routines are packaged with the C Standard Library in the same module, because they're both likely to be needed by any program built with their toolset.

Though often confused with the C Standard Library because of this packaging, the C Runtime Library is not a standardized part of the language and is vendor-specific.

== Compiler built-in functions ==

Some compilers (for example, [[w:GCC|GCC]]) provide built-in versions of many of the functions in the C standard library; that is, the implementations of the functions are written into the compiled object file, and the program calls the built-in versions instead of the functions in the C library shared object file.  This reduces function call overhead, especially if function calls are replaced with inline variants, and allows other forms of optimization (as the compiler knows the control-flow characteristics of the built-in variants), but may cause confusion when debugging (for example, the built-in versions cannot be replaced with instrumented variants).

== POSIX standard library ==
POSIX, (along with the Single Unix Specification), specifies a number of routines that should be available over and above those in the C standard library proper; these are often implemented alongside the C standard library functionality, with varying degrees of closeness. For example, glibc implements functions such as fork within libc.so, but before NPTL was merged into glibc it constituted a separate library with its own linker flag. Often, this POSIX-specified functionality will be regarded as part of the library; the C library proper may be identified as the ANSI or ISO C library.

Analytical chemistry is the study of the separation, identification, and quantification of the chemical components of natural and artificial materials.  Qualitative analysis gives an indication of the identity of the chemical species in the sample and quantitative analysis determines the amount of one or more of these components. The separation of components is often performed prior to analysis.
Analytical methods can be separated into classical and instrumental. Classical methods (also known as wet chemistry methods) use separations such as precipitation, extraction, and distillation and qualitative analysis by color, odor, or melting point. Quantitative analysis is achieved by measurement of weight or volume. Instrumental methods use an apparatus to measure physical quantities of the analyte such as light absorption, fluorescence, or conductivity. The separation of materials is accomplished using chromatography or electrophoresis methods.
Analytical chemistry is also focused on improvements in experimental design, chemometrics, and the creation of new measurement tools to provide better chemical information. Analytical chemistry has applications in forensics, bioanalysis, clinical analysis, environmental analysis, and materials analysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Closing Argument is portion of the trial where counsel can present and explain the reason why the trier-of-fact should decide in their favour. 

==Effective Argumentation==

Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court lists 16 rules of argumentation before a judge in his book &quot;Making your case: The art of persuading judges&quot;: [http://www.utahbar.org/cle/springconvention/materials/making_your_case.pdf]
#Be sure the court has jurisdiction
#know your audience
#Know your case
#Know your adversary's case
#Pay attentions to the standard of decision
#Never overstate your case. Be scrupulously accurate
#Occupy the most defensible terrain
#Yield indefensible terrain
#Take Pains to select the best arguments
#Communicate clearly and concisely
#Appeal not just to rules but also common sense 
#When you must rely on fairness to modify the strict application of the law, identify some jurisprudential maxim that supports you
#Reason is paramount and that overt appeal to emotions is resented
#Assume a posture of respective intellectual equality with the bench
#Maintain your emotions and do not accuse
#Close in a powerful way and say explicitly what you want the court to do

==Purpose and Objectives of Direct Examination==

The objective of direct evidence is to elicit evidence from the witness that is: (1) admissible, (2) persuasive and credible. All of this is to the goal of establishing facts that support your theory of the case and establishing the essential elements of your case. 

Proper direct evidence should possess a number of qualities: (1) a organized, logical and complete narrative; (2) corroboration (3) limited gaps that are vulnerable to cross examination.

==Preparing Direct Examinations==

The purpose of calling any witnesses should be primarily to advance the theory of your case. The theory should revolve around the establishments of facts that make out the elements that need to be proven to have the judge decide the issue of contention.

For a prosecutor who is attempting to establish an offence, the starting point then is to generate the following: 
* a list of elements that need to be proven;  
* a list facts available to match elements; 
* list witnesses that will provide each fact needed; and 
* if necessary, a check list that you follow as you proceed with your evidence

==Preparing a Witness==
The first question when considering a direct examination is to ask oneself &quot;what is the purpose of calling this witness?&quot; If the answer does not advance the case, or may open weaknesses in the case, the advocate must consider not calling the person to testify.

Considerations should include:
* whether the witness have a criminal record
* whether the witness can articulate well enough
* whether the witness may testify to matters harmful to the case

A witness interview should consist of two parts. The first part of the interview should be for the purpose of discovery and the second part should be for practising and rehearsal. Where possible this should be divided into two different interviews.

A witness should be given a copy of any written statement or transcript of an audio statement before reviewing their evidence.

Multiple witnesses should never be interviewed together. The main exception would be to interview a witness in the presence of a police officer who is a witness on the matter.

===Preparing for Cross examination===


==Organization==
In Mauet, Fundamentals of Trial Technique&lt;Ref&gt;2nd ed. Can. at p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; it is recommended that a standard template for questioning for many criminal and civil trials should follow a logical or chronological order. Following the sequence of:
#Background
#Description of incident location
#what occurred just before the incident
#How the incident occurred
#what happened immediately after the incident
#injuries incurred and treatment given
#present physical injuries
#exhibits that highlight the main points

A similar general structure applicable to most witnesses was provided in &quot;The Art of Trial&quot; by Robert White: 
# Identify the witness;
# Detail the witness's interest or lack thereof in the case 
# For each item that needs to be proven:
##the name of the item;
##set the stage;
## elicit crucial testimony;
## establish opportunities for observations and reasons for remembering.

==Questioning==

===Framing the questions===
The questions are intended to signal to the witness what they should talk about. It is important that the language used is tailored to the level of understanding of the witness. It most cases it is important to keep the questions simple, using plain language. More complex questions should be broken down into multiple smaller questions.

===Bad Questioning Styles===
* Beginning a question with &quot;And&quot; or &quot;Okay&quot;
* Repeating the answer given by the witness back at them

===Objectionable questions===
* argumentative questions - that is, questions that seek to make argument to the court, such as questions asking for inferences or interpretations of facts not proven
* vague or over-broad questions
* irrelevant questions
* questions seeking an opinion or conclusion

==Techniques==

==Strategy and Tactics==

==Frequent issues==
===Accused's testimony===

===Refreshing memory===

===Documents===

[[Image:Aromatic-ring-current-2.png|thumb|right|200px|A diagram of an aromatic ring current.  ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the applied magnetic field, the red arrow indicating its direction.  The orange ring shows the direction of the ring current, and the purple rings show the direction of the [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] magnetic field.]]

An '''aromatic ring current''' is an effect observed in [[aromaticity|aromatic]] [[molecules]] such as [[benzene]] and [[naphthalene]]. If a [[magnetic field]] is directed [[perpendicular]] to the plane of the aromatic system, a ring current is induced in the delocalized [[pi-bond|π electrons]] of the aromatic ring.&lt;ref&gt;''The induced magnetic field in cyclic molecules.'' Merino, G.; Heine, T.; Seifert, G. [[Chem. Eur. J.]]; '''2004'''; 10; 4367-4371.  {{DOI|10.1002/chem.200400457}} &lt;/ref&gt; This is a direct consequence of [[Ampère's law]]; since the electrons involved are free to circulate, rather than being localized in bonds as they would be in most non-aromatic molecules, they respond much more strongly to the magnetic field.

Aromatic ring currents are relevant to [[NMR spectroscopy]], as they dramatically influence the [[chemical shift]]s of [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[hydrogen atom|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in aromatic molecules,&lt;ref&gt;''Aromaticity and Ring Currents Gomes'', J. A. N. F.; Mallion, R. B. [[Chem. Rev.]]; (Review); '''2001'''; 101(5); 1349-1384.  {{DOI|10.1021/cr990323h}} &lt;/ref&gt; as well as in any organic or inorganic aromatic molecule.  The effect helps distinguish these nuclear environments and is therefore of great use in molecular structure determination. In benzene, the ring protons experience [[deshielding]] because the induced magnetic field has the same direction as the external field and their [[chemical shift]] is 7.3 ppm compared to 5.6 to the [[vinylic]] proton in [[cyclohexene]]. In contrast any proton inside the aromatic ring experiences [[shielding (NMR)|shielding]] because both fields are in opposite direction. This effect can be observed in [[cyclooctadecanonaene]] ([18]annulene) with 6 inner protons at &amp;minus;3 ppm. 

The situation is reversed in [[antiaromatic]] compounds. In the [[dianion]] of [18]annulene the inner protons are strongly deshielded at 20.8 ppm and 29.5 ppm with the outer electrons significantly shielded (with respect to the reference) at &amp;minus;1.1 ppm. Hence a '''diamagnetic ring current''' or '''diatropic ring current''' is associated with aromaticity whereas a '''paratropic ring current''' signals antiaromaticity.

A similar effect is observed in three-dimensional [[fullerene]]s; in this case it is called a '''sphere current''' &lt;ref&gt;''Sphere Currents of Buckminsterfullerene'', Mikael P. Johansson, Jonas Jusélius, and Dage Sundholm, [[Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.]], Vol. 44, No. 12, pp. 1843-1846, '''2005''' {{DOI|10.1002/anie.200462348}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Numerous attempts have been made to quantify [[aromaticity]] with respect to the observed ring current.&lt;ref&gt;''What is aromaticity?'' Paul von Rage Schleyer and Haijun Jiao Pure &amp; Appl. Chem., Vol. 68, No. 2, pp. 209-218, '''1996''' [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1996/pdf/6802x0209.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt; One method is called '''diamagnetic susceptibility exaltation''' [[Lambda|Λ]] defined as the difference between the measured [[magnetic susceptibility]] of a compound and a calculated value based on group additivity tables. [[Benzene]] is clearly aromatic (Λ = &amp;minus;13.4), [[borazine]] (Λ = &amp;minus;1.7) and [[cyclohexane]] (Λ = 1.1) are not aromatic and [[cyclobutadiene]] (Λ = +18) is antiaromatic.

Another measurable quantity is the [[chemical shift]] of [[lithium]] ions Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in complexes of lithium with aromats because lithium tends to [[coordination chemistry|coordinate]] to the [[hapticity|face]] of the aromatic rings. Thus the lithium atom in [[cyclopentadienyl]] lithium (CpLi) has a chemical shift of &amp;minus;8.6 ppm (aromatic) and its Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; complex  a shift of &amp;minus;13.1.  

Both methods suffer from the disadvantage that values depend on ring size. The '''nucleus-independent chemical shift''' ('''NICS''') is a [[computational chemistry|computational method]] that calculates the [[chemical shift]] of a hypothetical lithium ion positioned directly inside the ring&lt;ref name=Schleyer&gt;''Nucleus-Independent Chemical Shifts: A Simple and Efficient Aromaticity Probe'' Paul von Ragué Schleyer, Christoph Maerker, Alk Dransfeld, Haijun Jiao, and Nicolaas J. R. van Eikema Hommes [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; '''1996'''; 118(26) pp 6317-6318; (Communication) {{DOI|10.1021/ja960582d}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this method negative NICS values indicate aromaticity and positive values antiaromaticity.

Yet another method called the '''harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity''' ('''HOMA''') &lt;ref&gt;''Definition of aromaticity basing on the harmonic oscillator model'' Tetrahedron Letters, Volume 13, Issue 36, '''1972''', Pages 3839-3842 J. Kruszewski and T. M. Krygowski {{DOI|10.1016/S0040-4039(01)94175-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized sum]] of [[squared deviations]] of [[bond length]]s from the optimal value, which is assumed to be realized for a fully aromatic system &lt;ref&gt;''How far is the π-electron delocalization of the phenanthrene moiety modified in the aza-analogues and their N-oxides?'' Beata T. Stępień, Tadeusz M. Krygowski,a Michał K. Cyrański, Jacek Młochowski, Pierluigi Orioli, and Francesco Abbate [[Arkivoc]] 2003 [http://www.arkat-usa.org/?VIEW=MANUSCRIPT&amp;MSID=893 Link]&lt;/ref&gt;. An aromat has HOMA value 1 whereas a non-aromatic compound has value 0. For all-carbon systems, a HOMA value is obtained making use of this equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{HOMA} =  1- 257.7\sum^n_i(d_{\rm opt} - d_i)^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

with the value of 257.7 the normalization value, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; the optimized bond length (1.388&amp;nbsp;[[angstrom]]) and ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' the experimental or computed bond length.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bandwidth log size==
The article says: &quot;The bandwidth monitor history is just /.../ WAN port monthly history, WAN port daily history for the current month and intraday history (for vlan1, eth1, br0, eth0 &amp; vlan0) captured over the last 24 hours. For this reason the backup file does not grow in size once it has reached about 133 Bytes.&quot; Sounds impossible.

I guess tomato only saves WAN monthly and daily in/out byte counts and no intraday history nor device-specific history?

I would also like to hear some numbers about the claim that saving to NVRAM or JFFS is dangerous. Is it so that using JFFS is much safer since the JFFS2 file system takes care of distributing the wear evenly throughout the large JFFS partition? I would calculate that if the memory can withstand 10,000 write cycles (I have heard that nowadays average flash memory can even withstand 100,000 cycles) and the size of the JFFS partition is 1 MB and the file is no more than 1 KB then the log can be saved at least 10,000,000 times, which makes over 1000 years if the log is saved every hour — so JFFS seems a pretty safe option (at least if the JFFS partition is not full of some other files (but maybe JFFS2 can do wear-leveling in those situations as well)). I do not know the details of the design of JFFS2 and its overhead, though.--[[Special:Contributions/84.50.143.71|84.50.143.71]] ([[User talk:84.50.143.71|talk]]) 21:52, 24 June 2010 (UTC)

==Classification (QoS)==
Per the [[Tomato_Firmware/Menu_Reference#Classification|section]] describing the '''QoS -&gt; Classification''' (&lt;tt&gt;qos-classify.asp&lt;/tt&gt;) page: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Similarly, the order of rules can affect performance. For example, if an L7 rule is qualified as UDP this will help performance. But, if it is moved below the DNS rule (with a classification of &quot;Highest&quot;), it will prevent packet inspection of all DNS connections which are also UDP.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
First of all ''&quot;the DNS rule&quot;'' is never defined and so this illustration does not clarify. It raises more questions. 
I suspect that the order of rules at this &lt;tt&gt;qos-classify.asp&lt;/tt&gt; page is significant but I cannot find any better documentation. So here is a very specific clarifying question: 
* If a packet matches two (or more) rules in the list specified at the &lt;tt&gt;qos-classify.asp&lt;/tt&gt; page then does the earliest rule (in the list) take effect or does the latest rule take effect?
I ''suspect'' that the '''earliest''' rule in the list takes effect.

This behaviour would be consistent with my understanding that when ''no rule'' in the list matches for a given packet then the '''Default class''' specified on the '''QoS -&gt; Basic Settings''' (&lt;tt&gt;qos-settings.asp&lt;/tt&gt;) page takes effect.

'''Aspirating IMS''' is an ion mobility spectrometry technology used to detect low or trace quantities of chemicals in the surrounding atmosphere. It is applied in industrial and military purposes to detect harmful substances in air.

== Operation ==

Aspiration IMS operates with open-loop circulation of sampled air. Sample flow is passed via ionization chamber and then enters to measurement area where the ions are deflected into one or more measuring electrodes by perpendicular electric field which can be either static or varying. The output of the sensor is characteristic of the ion mobility distribution and can be used for detection and identification purposes.

The Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, usually referred to as just the &quot;Martinos Center,&quot; is a major hub of [[neuropsychological]] research and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] research and development in Boston.  The center has two sites, one in the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] East Campus in the [[Charlestown Navy Yard]], and another at [[MIT]]. The center is a member or collaborator with NCRR (and [[Biomedical Informatics Research Network|BIRN]]), NIDA, NIBIB, National Cancer Institute, NINDS, NCCAM, ONDCP, and The MIND Institute. The center also has a strategic partnership with Siemens Medical Solutions. It is also a Harvard Catalyst site.

There are 8 [[MRI]] scanning bays used primarily for research, including a 7 [[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]] magnet for human radiography and a combined [[Positron emission tomography|
PET]]-MRI. In addition, the center serves as a development site for new Siemens equipment, such as the 32 channel and 128 channel MRI coils.

[[Image:Spectral lines en.PNG|thumb|Emission lines and absorption lines compared to a continuous spectrum.]]

In [[physics]], '''atomic [[spectral lines]]''' are of two types:
* An '''emission line''' is formed when an electron makes a transition from a particular discrete [[energy level]] of an atom, to a lower energy state, emitting a photon of a particular energy and wavelength. A spectrum of many such photons will show an emission spike at the wavelength associated with these photons.
* An '''absorption line''' is formed when an electron makes a transition from a lower to a higher discrete energy state, with a photon being absorbed in the process. These absorbed photons generally come from background continuum radiation and a spectrum will show a drop in the continuum radiation at the wavelength associated with the absorbed photons.

The two states must be [[bound state]]s in which the electron is bound to the atom, so the transition is sometimes referred to as a &quot;bound–bound&quot; transition, as opposed to a transition in which the electron is ejected out of the atom completely (&quot;bound–free&quot; transition) into a [[continuous spectrum|continuum]] state, leaving an [[ionization|ionized]] atom, and generating continuum radiation.

A [[photon]] with an energy equal to the energy difference between the levels is released or absorbed in the process. The frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; at which the spectral line occurs is related to the photon energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; by [[Planck's law]] &lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].

== Emission and absorption coefficients ==

The emission of atomic line radiation may be described by an [[emission coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; with units of energy/time/volume/solid angle. ''&amp;epsilon; dt dV d&amp;Omega;'' is then the energy emitted by a volume element &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; in time &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; into solid angle &lt;math&gt;d\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For atomic line radiation:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \frac{h\nu}{4\pi}n_2 A_{21}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; is the density of emitting atoms, &lt;math&gt;A_{21}&lt;/math&gt; is the '''Einstein coefficient''' for spontaneous emission, which is fixed for any two energy levels. By [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation|Kirchhoff's law]], the absorption characteristics in a region of space are closely tied to its emission characteristics, so we must mention the absorption coefficient as well. The absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; will have units of 1/length and  ''&amp;kappa;' dx'' gives the fraction of intensity absorbed for a light beam at frequency ''&amp;nu;'' while traveling distance dx. The absorption coefficient is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa' = \frac{h\nu}{4\pi}~(n_1 B_{12}-n_2 B_{21}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral intensity of radiation at (and near) frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; is the density of absorbing atoms, and &lt;math&gt;B_{12}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{21}&lt;/math&gt; are the Einstein coefficients for absorption and induced emission respectively. Like the coefficient &lt;math&gt;A_{21}&lt;/math&gt;, these are also constant for any two energy levels.

In the case of [[local thermodynamic equilibrium]], the densities of the atoms, both excited and unexcited, may be calculated from the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]], but for other cases, (e.g. [[laser]]s) the calculation is more complicated.

The above equations have ignored the influence of the spectral line shape. To be accurate, the above equations need to be multiplied by the (normalized) spectral line shape, in which case the units will change to include a 1/Hz term.

== The Einstein coefficients ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stimulated emission]] --&gt;

In 1916, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that there are essentially three processes occurring in the formation of an atomic spectral line. The three processes are referred to as '''spontaneous emission''', '''induced emission''' and '''absorption''' and with each is associated an '''Einstein coefficient''' which is  a measure of the probability of that particular process occurring.

===Spontaneous emission===
 
{{main|Spontaneous emission}}
[[Image:AtomicLineSpEm.png|thumb|180px|Schematic diagram of atomic spontaneous emission]]

Spontaneous emission is the process by which an electron &quot;spontaneously&quot; (i.e. without any outside influence) decays from a higher energy level to a lower one.  The process is described by the Einstein coefficient &lt;math&gt;A_{21}&lt;/math&gt; which gives the probability per unit time that an electron in state 2 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; will decay spontaneously to state 1 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, emitting a photon with an energy &lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of atoms in state ''i''&amp;nbsp; then the change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to spontaneous emission will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_1}{dt}\right)_{A_{21}}=A_{21}n_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;
=== Stimulated emission ===
{{main|Stimulated emission}}
[[Image:AtomicLineInEm.png|thumb|180px|Schematic diagram of atomic stimulated emission]]

[[Stimulated emission]] (also known as induced emission) is the process by which an electron is induced to jump from a higher energy level to a lower one by the presence of electromagnetic radiation at (or near) the frequency of the transition.  The process is described by the Einstein coefficient &lt;math&gt;B_{21}&lt;/math&gt; which gives the probability per unit time per unit energy density of the radiation field, that an electron in state 2 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; will decay to state 1 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;, emitting a photon with an energy &lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. The change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to induced emission will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_1}{dt}\right)_{B_{21}}=B_{21}n_2 I(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral intensity of the radiation field at the frequency of the transition.

Stimulated emission is one of the fundamental processes that led to the development of the [[laser]].

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;

=== Photoabsorption ===
{{main|Absorption (optics)}}
[[Image:AtomicLineAb.png|thumb|180px|Schematic diagram of atomic absorption]]

Absorption is the process by which a photon is absorbed by the atom, causing an electron to jump from a lower energy level to a higher one. The process is described by the Einstein coefficient &lt;math&gt;B_{12}&lt;/math&gt; which gives the probability per unit time per unit energy density of the radiation field, that an electron in state 1 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; will absorb a photon with an energy &lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt; and jump to state 2 with energy &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt;. The change in the number density of atoms in state 1 per unit time due to absorption will be:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{dn_1}{dt}\right)_{B_{12}}=-B_{12}n_1 I(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;

== Detailed balancing ==

The Einstein coefficients are fixed probabilities associated with each atom, and do not depend on the state of the gas of which the atoms are a part. Therefore, any relationship that we can derive between the coefficients at, say, thermal equilibrium will be valid universally. At equilibrium, we will have a simple balancing, in which the net change in the number of any excited atoms is zero, being balanced by loss and gain due to all processes. With respect to bound-bound transitions, we will have [[detailed balance|detailed balancing]] as well, which states that the net exchange between any two levels will be balanced. This is because the probabilities of transition cannot be affected by the presence or absence of other excited atoms. Detailed balance requires that the change in time of the number of atoms in level 1 due to the above three processes be zero:

:&lt;math&gt;0=A_{21}n_2+B_{21}n_2I(\nu)-B_{12}n_1 I(\nu)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Along with detailed balancing, we may use our knowledge of the equilibrium energy distribution of the atoms, as stated in the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]] , and the equilibrium distribution of the photons, as stated in [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] to derive universal relationships between the Einstein coefficients.

From the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]] we have for the number of excited atomic specie ''i'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_i}{n}= \frac{g_i e^{-E_i/kT}}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the total density of the atomic specie, excited and unexcited, ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; is the degeneracy of state ''i'', and ''Z'' is the [[partition function]]. From [[Planck's law of black body radiation]] we have for the spectral intensity at frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I(\nu)=\frac{F(\nu)}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;F(\nu)=\frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].
Note that in some treatments, the blackbody energy density is used rather than the intensity, in which case:

:&lt;math&gt;F(\nu)=\frac{8\pi h\nu^3 }{c^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these expressions into the equation of detailed balancing and remembering that &lt;math&gt;E_2-E_1=h\nu&lt;/math&gt; yields:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{21}g_2e^{-h\nu/kT}+B_{21}g_2e^{-h\nu/kT}\frac{F(\nu)}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}=
B_{12}g_1\frac{F(\nu)}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation must hold at any temperature, so that the three Einstein coefficients are interrelated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A_{21}}{B_{12}}=\frac{g_1}{g_2}~F(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{B_{21}}{B_{12}}=\frac{g_1}{g_2}&lt;/math&gt;

When this relation is inserted into the original equation, one can also find a relation between &lt;math&gt;A_{12}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, involving [[Planck's law]].

== Oscillator strengths ==

Oscillator strength &lt;math&gt;f_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{12}=\frac{\pi e^2}{m_e c}\,f_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron charge and &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron mass. This allows all three Einstein coefficients to be expressed in terms of the single oscillator strength associated with the particular atomic spectral line:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{21}=\frac{8\nu^2 \pi^2 e^2}{m_e c^3}~\frac{g_1}{g_2}~f_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_{12}=\frac{4\pi^2 e^2}{m_e h\nu c}\,f_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B_{21}=\frac{4\pi^2 e^2}{m_e h\nu c}~\frac{g_1}{g_2}~f_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the main line of the Winawer Variation. Black's bishop is pinning white's c knight, and his c5 advance has just put additional pressure on white's center. At this point, white has chosen to regain the initiative by kicking out the bishop with 5.a3.

Black usually takes the knight with [[/5...Bxc3+|5...Bxc3+]], because moving [[/5...Ba5|5...Ba5]] leaves the c5 pawn undefended and open to white's 6.dxc5.

Black takes the pinned knight to avoid having his bishop boxed in. White's only plausible reply is [[/6. bxc3|6.bxc3]].

I see you're mainly interested in editing calculus and general chemistry.  Me too.  Guess I'll be seeing you around a bit. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 19:47, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

:Glad to know that there are others interested in those books. It seemed like general chemistry was extinct. I just finished those two subjects in my high school. All the information is fresh in my head. The hard part is putting it all into words :) --[[User:Backward|&lt;span style=&quot;background:black;color:white;padding:2px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;back&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Backward|&lt;span style=&quot;background:darkgreen;color:white;padding:2px;&quot;&gt;ward&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]] 21:56, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

== This might help ==

Perhaps you could take a look at [[Using Wikibooks]]. It tells you a lot about editing. BTW, if you use the beta toolbar in your preferences, the toolbar can offer help.

      <comment>/* Drafting a Statement */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
==Disclosure==
A component of the collection of evidence may include requests for further disclosure from the Police or Crown Office. 

==Investigations==
An investigation should be undertaken to discover additional facts and obtain additional evidence that may be used at trial or used in settlement negotiations. 

Amongst the types of evidence that can be obtained by investigation include:
# locate witnesses and obtain statements of eye-witnesses
# obtain information on the background on possible crown witnesses (e.g. work history, character, reputation, criminal history)
# obtain other information that could be used for impeachment
# photographs of scenes

==Taking Statements==

===Potential witnesses===
All potential witnesses should give statements or at the least be interviewed. The net should be cast broadly, so the interviews should go beyond simply the parties to the case and their direct associates. 

People to be contacted include:
* employees/employers of the parties 
* friends of the parties
* relatives of the parties

Counsel should not shy away from talking to parties adverse to the client's case. Any witness may change allegiance over time.

By having a witness give a statement you are able to pin them down on their recollection.

===Drafting a Statement===
Tips for statements:
* should be in the witnesses own words 
* should contain clear and specific details
* should be facts and ''not'' opinions. 
* should not include argument
* should avoid hearsay evidence.

Example Outline of Issues to cover in the statment:&lt;br&gt;
'''witness background'''
* full name, date of birth
* residence
* occupation
'''Facts'''
* Date and time of incident
* Location and actions of witness at time of incident
* Others present at the time of incident (include name, age, relationship, description)
* observations of incident
* reactions (verbal/physical) of each person
* outcome of incident
* harm or damage caused 
* state of person or property prior to harm or damage
* whether anyone else could have seen what happened
* the witnesses' familiarity with the charges and how they would have known?

A warning should be given not to talk to anyone about their evidence.

===Interviewing clients===
{{stub}}

==Organizing Evidence==
The evidence should be organized before you begin outlining the theory of the case and examinations. 

The most straightforward manner of organizing information is chronologically. A chart showing the sequence of events can be quite useful. This is a preferred manner where the case consists of multiple witnesses discussing a single event.

Each event can be broken down into key sub-events. The testimony of each witness should be organized to match each sub-event. Each of these can be used as a topic in cross-examination. At each juncture, look at the non-testimonial evidence and see how it supports the testimony. Also consider the logic of the sequence of events and whether there is something abnormal about it.

'''Atomic spectroscopy''' is the determination of elemental composition by its [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic]] or [[mass spectrum]].  Atomic spectroscopy is closely related to other forms of [[spectroscopy]]. It can be divided by [[atomization]] source or by the type of spectroscopy used.  In the latter case, the main division is between optical and mass spectrometry.  Mass spectrometry generally gives significantly better analytical performance, but is also significantly more complex.  This complexity translates into higher purchase costs, higher operational costs, more operator training, and a greater number of components that can potentially fail.  Because optical spectroscopy is generally less expensive and has performance adequate for many tasks, it is far more common.  Atomic absorption spectrometers are one of the most commonly sold and used analytical devices.

==Optical spectroscopy ==
Electrons exist in energy levels within an atom.  These levels have well defined energies and electrons moving between them must absorb or emit an energy equal to the difference between them.  In optical spectroscopy, the energy absorbed to move an electron to a more energetic level and/or the energy emitted as the electron moves to a lower energy level is in the form of a [[photon]] (a particle of light).  Because this energy is well-defined, an atom's identity can be found by the energy of this transition.  The wavelength of light can be related to its energy.  It is usually easier to measure the wavelength of light than to directly measure its energy.

Optical spectroscopy can be further divided into absorption, emission, and fluorescence.

In '''[[atomic absorption spectroscopy]]''', light is passed through a collection of atoms.  If the wavelength of the light has energy corresponding to the energy difference between two energy levels in the atoms, a portion of the light will be absorbed.  The relationship between the concentration of atoms, the distance the light travels through the collection of atoms, and the portion of the light absorbed is given by the [[Beer-Lambert law]].

The energy stored in the atoms can be released in a variety of ways.  When it is released as light, this is known as fluorescence.  '''[[fluorescence spectroscopy|Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy]]''' measures this emitted light.  Fluorescence is generally measured at a 90° angle from the excitation source to minimize collection of scattered light from the excitation source, often such a rotation is provided by a [[Pellin-Broca prism]] on a turntable which will also separate the light into its [[spectrum]] for closer analysis.  The wavelength once again tells you the identity of the atoms.  For low absorbances (and therefore low concentrations) the intensity of the fluoresced light is directly proportional to the concentration of atoms.  Atomic fluorescence is generally more sensitive (i.e. it can detect lower concentrations) than atomic absorption.

Strictly speaking, any measurement of the emitted light is emission spectroscopy, but [[atomic emission spectroscopy]] usually does not include fluorescence and rather refers to emission after excitation by thermal means.  The intensity of the emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of atoms.

==Mass spectrometry==
{{see details|Mass spectrometry}}
Atomic mass spectrometry is similar to other types of [[mass spectrometry]] in that it consists of an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector.  Atoms' identities are determined by their mass-to-charge ratio (via the mass analyzer)  and their concentrations are determined by the number of ions detected. Although considerable research has gone into customizing mass spectrometers for atomic ion sources, it is the ion source that differs most from other forms of mass spectrometry.  These ion sources must also atomize samples, or an atomization step must take place before ionization.  Atomic ion sources are generally modifications of atomic optical spectroscopy atom sources.

==Ion and atom sources==
Sources can be adapted in many ways, but the lists below give the general uses of a number of sources.  Of these, flames are the most common due to their low cost and their simplicity.  Although significantly less common, inductively-coupled plasmas, especially when used with mass spectrometers, are recognized for their outstanding analytical performance and their versatility.  

For all atomic spectroscopy, a sample must be vaporized and atomized.  For atomic mass spectrometry, a sample must also be ionized.  Vaporization, atomization, and ionization are often, but not always, accomplished with a single source.  Alternatively, one source may be used to vaporize a sample while another is used to atomize (and possibly ionize).  An example of this would be laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, where a laser is used to vaporize a solid sample and an inductively-coupled plasma is used to atomize the vapor.

With the exception of flames and graphite furnaces, which are most commonly used for atomic absorption spectroscopy, most sources are used primarily for atomic emission spectroscopy.

'''Liquid-sampling sources include:'''
*Flames and sparks (atom source)
*Inductively-coupled plasma (atom and ion source)

The '''Balmer series''' or '''Balmer lines''' in [[atomic physics]], is the designation of one of a set of six different named series describing the [[spectral line]] emissions of the [[hydrogen atom]].
The Balmer series is calculated using the '''Balmer formula''', an [[empirical]] equation discovered by [[Johann Balmer]] in 1885. 

The visible [[spectrum]] of [[light]] from [[hydrogen]] displays four [[wavelength]]s, 410 [[metre#SI prefixed forms of metre|nm]], 434&amp;nbsp;nm, 486&amp;nbsp;nm, and 656&amp;nbsp;nm, that reflect emissions of [[photon]]s by [[electron]]s in excited states transitioning to the quantum level described by the [[principal quantum number]] ''n'' equals 2.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Nave (2006). HyperPhysics: [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/hyde.html#c4 ''Hydrogen Spectrum'']. Georgia State University. Accessed March 1st, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of [[ultraviolet]] Balmer lines with wavelengths shorter than 400&amp;nbsp;nm.
[[file:Emission spectrum-H.svg|600px|thumb|The four visible [[Hydrogen spectral series|hydrogen emission spectrum lines]] in the Balmer series. H-alpha is the red line at the right.]]

==Overview==
[[Image:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|left|210px|In the simplified '''Rutherford Bohr model''' of the [[hydrogen atom]], the Balmer lines result from an electron jump between the second energy level closest to the nucleus, and those levels more distant. Shown here is a photon emission. The &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 3 \rightarrow 2&lt;/math&gt; transition depicted here produces [[H-alpha]], the first line of the [[Balmer series]]. For hydrogen (&lt;math&gt;Z = 1&lt;/math&gt;) this transition results in a photon of [[wavelength]] 656 nm (red).]]

The Balmer series is characterized by the [[electron]] transitioning  from ''n'' ≥ 3 to ''n'' = 2, where ''n'' refers to the [[radial quantum number]] or [[principal quantum number]] of the electron.  The transitions are named sequentially by Greek letter: ''n'' = 3 to ''n'' = 2 is called H-α, 4 to 2 is H-β, 5 to 2 is H-γ, and 6 to 2 is H-δ.  As the first spectral lines associated with this series are located in the visible part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], these lines are historically referred to as &quot;H-alpha&quot;, &quot;H-beta&quot;, &quot;H-gamma&quot; and so on, where H is the element hydrogen.

Although physicists were aware of atomic emissions before 1885, they lacked a tool to accurately predict where the spectral lines should appear.  The Balmer equation predicts the four visible absorption/emission lines of hydrogen with high accuracy.  Balmer's equation inspired the [[Rydberg equation]] as a generalization of it, and this in turn led physicists to find the [[Lyman series|Lyman]], [[Paschen series|Paschen]], and [[Brackett series]] which predicted other absorption/emission lines of hydrogen found outside the [[visible spectrum]].

The familiar red [[H-alpha]] spectral line of hydrogen gas, which is the transition from the shell ''n'' = 3 to the Balmer series shell ''n'' = 2, is one of the conspicuous colors of the universe.  It contributes a bright red line to the spectra of [[emission nebula|emission]] or ionization nebula, like the [[Orion Nebula]], which are often [[H II regions]] found in star forming regions.  In true-color pictures, these nebula have a distinctly pink color from the combination of visible Balmer lines that hydrogen emits.

Later, it was discovered that when the spectral lines of the hydrogen spectrum are examined at very high resolution, they are found to be closely-spaced doublets. This splitting is called [[fine structure]].  It was also found that excited electrons could jump to the Balmer series ''n''=2 from orbitals where ''n'' was greater than 6, emitting shades of violet when doing so.
[[Image:Deuterium lamp 1.png|thumb|right|300px|Two of the Balmer lines (α and β) are clearly visible in this emission spectrum of a [[deuterium lamp]].]]

==Balmer's formula==
Balmer noticed that a single number had a relation to every line in the hydrogen spectrum that was in the [[visible light]] region.  That number was 364.56&amp;nbsp;nm.  When any integer higher than 2 was squared and then divided by itself minus 4, then that number multiplied by 364.56 gave a wavelength of another line in the visible hydrogen spectrum.  By this formula he was able to show that certain measurements of lines made in his time by [[spectroscopy]] were slightly inaccurate measurements and his formula predicted lines that were later found although had not yet been observed.  His number also proved to be the limit of the series.

The Balmer equation could be used to find the [[wavelength]] of the absorption/emission lines and was originally presented as follows (save for a notation change to give Balmer's constant as ''B''):

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\ = B\left(\frac{m^2}{m^2 - n^2}\right) = B\left(\frac{m^2}{m^2 - 2^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength.
:''B'' is a constant with the value of 3.6456×10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; m or 364.56 nm.
:''n'' is equal to 2
:''m'' is an integer such that ''m'' &gt; ''n''.

In 1888 the physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] generalized the Balmer equation for all transitions of hydrogen.  The equation commonly used to calculate the Balmer series is a specific example of the [[Rydberg formula]] and follows as a simple reciprocal mathematical rearrangement of the formula above (conventionally using a notation of '''n''' for '''m''' as the single integral constant needed):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{4}{B}\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right) = R_\mathrm{H}\left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right) \quad \mathrm{for~} n=3,4,5,...&lt;/math&gt; 

where λ is the wavelength of the absorbed/emitted light and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Rydberg constant]] for hydrogen. The Rydberg constant is seen to be equal to &lt;math&gt;4/B&lt;/math&gt; in Balmer's formula, and this value, for an infinitely heavy nucleus, is &lt;math&gt;4/(3.6456*10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; meter) = 10,973,731.57 meter&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CODATA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/codata.pdf |title=CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2006 |work=Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) |publisher=[[NIST]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in astronomy==
The Balmer series is particularly useful in [[astronomy]] because the Balmer lines appear in numerous stellar objects due to the abundance of hydrogen in the [[universe]], and therefore are commonly seen and relatively strong compared to lines from other elements.  

The [[stellar classification|spectral classification]] of stars, which is primarily a determination of surface temperature, is based on the relative strength of spectral lines, and the Balmer series in particular are very important.  Other characteristics of a star can be determined by close analysis of its spectrum include [[surface gravity]] (related to physical size) and composition.

Because the Balmer lines are commonly seen in the spectra of various objects, they are often used to determine [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]] due to [[doppler shift]]ing of the Balmer lines.  This has important uses all over astronomy, from detecting [[binary star]]s, [[exoplanet]]s, compact objects such as [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s (by the motion of hydrogen in [[accretion disk]]s around them), identifying groups of objects with similar motions and presumably origins ([[moving group]]s, [[star cluster]]s, [[galaxy cluster]]s, and debris from collisions), determining distances (actually [[redshift]]s) of galaxies or [[quasar]]s, and identifying unfamiliar objects by analysis of their spectrum.  

Balmer lines can appear as [[absorption line|absorption]] or [[emission line|emission]] lines in a spectrum, depending on the nature of the object observed.  In [[star]]s, the Balmer lines are usually seen in absorption, and they are &quot;strongest&quot; in stars with a surface temperature of about 10,000 [[kelvin]] ([[spectral type]] A).  In the spectra of most spiral and irregular galaxies, [[active galaxy|AGN]]s, [[H II region]]s and [[planetary nebula|planetary]] [[nebula]]e, the Balmer lines are emission lines.

In stellar spectra, the H-epsilon line (transition 7-2) is often mixed in with another absorption line caused by ionized [[calcium]] known by astronomers as &quot;H&quot; (the [[Fraunhofer lines|original designation]] given by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]]).  That is, H-epsilon's wavelength is quite close to CaH at 396.847&amp;nbsp;nm, and cannot be resolved in low resolution spectra.  The H-zeta line (transition 8-2) is similarly mixed in with a neutral [[helium]] line seen in hot stars.

In optics, the '''Beer-Lambert law''', also known as '''Beer's law''' or the '''Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law''' is an empirical relationship that relates the absorption of light to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling.

==Equations==


There are several ways in which the law can be expressed:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\alpha lc \,&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; {I_{1}\over I_{0}} = 10^{-\alpha l c}&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; A = -\log_{10}\frac{I_1}{I_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \frac{4 \pi k}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; 
Here:
*A is absorbance
*''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intensity of the incident light 
*''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the intensity after passing through the material
*''l'' is the distance that the light travels through the material (the path length)
*''c'' is the concentration of absorbing species in the material 
*&amp;alpha; is the ''absorption coefficient'' or the molar absorptivity of the absorber
*&amp;lambda; is the wavelength of the light
*''k'' is the extinction coefficient

In essence, the law states that there is a logarithmic dependence between the transmission of light through a substance and the concentration of the substance, and also between the transmission and the length of material that the light travels through. Thus if ''l'' and &amp;alpha; are known, the concentration of a substance can be deduced from the amount of light transmitted by it.

The units of ''c'' and &amp;alpha; depend on the way that the concentration of the absorber is being expressed. If the material is a liquid, it is usual to express the absorber concentration ''c'' as a [[mole fraction]] i.e. a dimensionless fraction.  The units of &amp;alpha; are thus reciprocal length (e.g. cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). In the case of a gas, ''c'' may be expressed as a density (units of reciprocal length cubed, e.g. cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;), in which case &amp;alpha; is an ''absorption cross-section'' and has units of length squared (e.g. cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). If concentration ''c'' is expressed in [[mole (unit)|mole]]s per unit [[volume]], &amp;alpha; is a [[molar absorptivity]] given in units of mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; or sometimes [[litre|L]] mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The value of the absorption coefficient &amp;alpha; varies between different absorbing materials and also with wavelength for a particular material. It is usually determined by experiment.

In spectroscopy and spectrophotometry, the law is almost always defined in terms of common logarithms and powers of 10 as above. In general optics, the law is often defined in an alternate exponential form:

:&lt;math&gt; {I_{1}\over I_{0}} = e^{-\alpha' l c}&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; A' = - \alpha' l c = -\ln \frac{I_1}{I_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The values of &amp;alpha;' and ''A''' are approximately 2.3 (≈ln 10) times smaller than the corresponding values of &amp;alpha; and ''A'' defined in terms of base-10 functions. Therefore, care must be taken when interpreting data that the correct form of the law is used.

The law tends to break down at very high concentrations, especially if the material is highly [[scattering]]. If the light is especially intense, [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] processes can also cause variances.

==  Beer-Lambert law in the atmosphere ==

This law is also applied to describe the attenuation of solar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. In this case, there is scattering of radiation as well as absorption. The Beer-Lambert law for the atmosphere is usually written

:&lt;math&gt;I_n=(I_o/R^2)\,\exp(-(k_a+k_g+k_{NO2}+k_w+k_{O3}+k_r) m)&lt;/math&gt; ,

where each &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt; is an extinction coefficient whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering it describes:

*&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; refers to aerosols (that absorb and scatter)
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are uniformly mixed gases (mainly carbon dioxide (&lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt;)  and molecular oxygen(&lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;) which only absorb)
*&lt;math&gt;NO_2&lt;/math&gt; is nitrogen dioxide, mainly due to urban pollution (absorption only)
*&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is water vapour absorption
*&lt;math&gt;O_3&lt;/math&gt; is ozone (absorption only)
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is Rayleigh scattering from molecular oxygen (&lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;) and nitrogen (&lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt;) (responsible for the blue color of the sky).

&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the ''optical mass'', a term basically equal to &lt;math&gt;1/\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the solar azimuth (the solar angle with respect to a direction perpendicular to the Earth's surface at the observation site).

This equation can be used to retrieve &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt;, the aerosol optical thickness, which is necessary for the correction of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of aerosols in climate.

==History==
Beer's law was independently discovered (in various forms) by Pierre Bouguer in 1729, Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1760 and August Beer in 1852.

The '''Berkeley Geochronology Center''' ('''BGC''') is a [[501(c)|non-profit]] [[geochronology]] [[research institute]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. It was originally a research group in the laboratory of [[University of California Berkeley]] [[geophysics|geophysicist]] and [[geochronology|geochronologist]] [[Garniss Curtis]], now [[Emeritus|professor emeritus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Swisher|first=Carl C.|coauthors=Garniss H. Curtis, and Roger Lewin|title=Java Man: How Two Geologists Changed Our Understanding of Human Evolution|pages=107–108|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn-13=9780226787343}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group is now an independent scientific research institute directed by the  geologist and geochronologist [[Paul Renne]], adjunct professor of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences at Berkeley.

In 1985, Curtis, set to retire in 1989, moved the group from his lab at the University to the basement of the independent [[Donald Johanson|Institute for Human Origins]] (IHO), at the suggestion of [[United States of America|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Francis Clark Howell|F. Clark Howell]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  The geochronologists worked separately from the IHO, although IHO contained their bureaucratic infrastructure, until 1989 when they became officially known as the Institute for Human Origins Geochronology Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;   In 1994 the group officially split from the IHO based on different viewpoints of their respective missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;KalbKalb2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalb|first=Jon|title= Adventures in the Bone Trade: The Race to Discover Our Ancestors in Ethiopia's Afar Depression|pages=298–299|date=2000|publisher= Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|isbn-13=9780387987422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  

The Institute specializes in fundamental questions of the age of the earth, using state-of-the-art instrumentation to find the age of rocks that will answer questions about [[geology]] and [[geobiology]] in [[History of the Earth|earth history]].  The institute is capable of performing gas extraction, and thermal ionization [[mass spectrometry]] analysis on rocks up to billions of years old using the techniques of [[argon–argon dating]] and [[uranium-lead dating]].  BGC also performs [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] analysis to  establish correlating or independent ages from the fossilized magnetic fields.  The staff includes research scientists specializing in various geological periods and areas, in addition to postdoctoral scholars and graduate students.  Scientists at BGC have also been active in dating extraterrestrial materials such as meteorites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last= Whitehouse|first=David|title='Four-billion-year chill' on Mars|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4703055.stm|date=2005-07-21|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Split from Institute for Human Origins==
Both Curtis and IHO founder, [[Donald Johanson]], were known to have egos that might &quot;clash&quot;, but Howell thought that bringing the two research groups together could benefit both.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  The IHO's mission included publicizing the anthropology of ancient human ancestors to the general public, and the geochronology scientists felt the anthropologists emphasized this at the expense of more basic science, while the paleoanthropologist felt the geochronologists were devoting too much research time and funding to general geology questions not related to the institute's primary mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  The anthropologists had more public recognition in the press, while the geochronologists were obtaining more scientific grant moneys and publishing more scientific papers.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;  The split was acrimonious and garnered negative publicity for some of those involved from their peers in professional organizations, particularly as [[Gordon Getty]], the single largest donor, and a board member of IHO, withdrew funding to the parent institute (IHO), while providing start-up moneys to the geochronology group. &lt;ref name=&quot;SwisherEtAl2001&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KalbKalb2000&quot; /&gt;

'''Binding energy''' is the [[mechanical energy]] required to disassemble a whole into separate parts. A bound system has a lower [[potential energy]] than its constituent parts; this is what keeps the system together. The usual convention is that this corresponds to a ''positive'' binding energy.

In general, binding energy represents the [[mechanical work]] which must be done in acting against the forces which hold an object together, while disassembling the object into component parts separated by such sufficient distance that further separation requires negligible additional work.

[[Electron binding energy]] is a measure of the energy required to free electrons from their atomic orbits.

Nuclear binding energy is derived from the [[strong nuclear force]] and is the [[energy]] required to disassemble a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] into free unbound [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s. At the [[quantum chemistry|atomic level]], the binding energy of the atom is derived from [[electromagnetic interaction]] and is the [[ionization energy|energy]] required to disassemble an atom into free electrons and a nucleus. In [[astrophysics]], [[gravitational binding energy]] of a celestial body is the energy required to disassemble it into space debris (dust and gas). This quantity is not to be confused with the [[gravitational potential energy]], which is the energy required to separate two bodies, such as a celestial body and a satellite, to infinite distance, keeping each intact (the latter energy is lower).

==Mass defect==
Because a bound system is at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents, its mass must be less than the total mass of its unbound constituents. For systems with low binding energies, this &quot;lost&quot; mass after binding, may be fractionally small. For systems with high binding energies, however, the missing mass may be an easily measurable fraction. 

Since all forms of energy in a system (which has no net [[momentum]]) have mass, the question of where the missing mass of the binding energy goes is of interest. The answer is that this mass does not &quot;disappear&quot; into energy (a common misconception); rather, transformed to heat or light, this mass may ''move away'' to another location. The &quot;mass defect&quot; from binding energy is therefore only mass which has moved. However, it remains mass, because mass is conserved in systems for any given single observer, so long as the system remains closed. Thus, if binding energy mass is transformed into heat, the system must be cooled (the heat removed) before the mass-deficit appears in the cooled system. In that case, the removed heat (which has mass itself when measured in the original inertial frame) represents exactly the mass &quot;deficit&quot;. 

For example, when two large objects (such as the earth and a meteor) are attracted by a [[gravitational field]] and collide, the energy for the heat of impact is extracted from the gravitational field of the objects. However, the system does ''not'' lose mass (which represents its binding energy) ''until'' this heat is radiated into space, and this space is no longer counted as part of the original system (equivalent to opening the original system). 

Closely analogous considerations apply in chemical and nuclear considerations. However, in nuclear reactions, the fraction of mass which may be removed as light or heat, and which then appears as binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than other forces. 

In nuclear reactions, the &quot;light&quot; which must be [[radiation|radiated]] to remove binding energy may be in the form of direct [[gamma radiation]]. Again, however, no mass-deficit can in theory appear until this radiation has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.

The energy given off during either [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission]] is the difference between the binding energies of the fuel and the fusion or fission products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, once evolved heat and radiation have been removed.

== Atomic binding energy ==

The binding energy for a single atom is given by

&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = \Delta m \cdot c^2 = (m_s - m_b) \cdot c^2 = (Z \cdot m_p + N \cdot m_n - m_b) \cdot c^2&lt;/math&gt;

where

:''c'' is the [[speed of light]];
:''m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the separated [[nucleon]]s;
:''m&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the bound [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]];
:''Z'' is the atomic number of the bound nucleus;
:''m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of one [[proton]];
:''N'' is the number of [[neutron]]s;
:''m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of one neutron.

=== Specific quantitative example: a deuteron ===
A deuteron is the nucleus of a [[deuterium]] atom, and consists of one [[proton]] and one [[neutron]]. The experimentally-measured masses of the constituents as free particles are

: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;proton&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.007825 [[unified atomic mass unit|u]];
: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt;= 1.008665 u;
: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;proton&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.007825 + 1.008665 = 2.01649 u.

The mass of the deuteron (also an experimentally measured quantity) is

: Atomic mass &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H = 2.014102 u.

The mass difference = 2.01649 - 2.014102 = 0.002388 u. Since the [[energy density|conversion between rest mass and energy]] is 931.494MeV/u, a deuteron's binding energy is calculated to be

: 0.002388 u × 931.494 MeV/u = 2.224 MeV.

Thus, expressed in another way, the binding energy is [0.002388/2.01649] x 100% = about 0.1184% of the total energy corresponding to the mass. This corresponds to 1.07 x &lt;math&gt;10^{14}&lt;/math&gt; J/kg = 107 TJ/kg.

== Nuclear binding energy curve ==
In the [[periodic table of elements]], the series of light elements from [[hydrogen]] up to [[sodium]] is observed to exhibit generally increasing binding energy per nucleon as the [[atomic mass]] increases. This increase is generated by increasing forces per nucleon in the nucleus, as each additional nucleon is attracted by all of the other nucleons, and thus more tightly bound to the whole.

The region of increasing binding energy is followed by a region of relative stability (saturation) in the sequence from [[magnesium]] through [[xenon]]. In this region, the nucleus has become large enough that nuclear forces no longer completely extend efficiently across its width. Attractive nuclear forces in this region, as atomic mass increases, are nearly balanced by repellant electromagnetic forces between protons, as [[atomic number]] increases. 

Finally, in elements heavier than xenon, there is a decrease in binding energy per nucleon as atomic number increases. In this region of nuclear size, electromagnetic repulsive forces are beginning to gain against the strong nuclear force. 

At the peak of binding energy, nickel-62 is the most tightly-bound nucleus, followed by iron-58 and iron-56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fewell | first = M. P. | title=The atomic nuclide with the highest mean binding energy | journal=American Journal of Physics | year=1995 | volume=63 | issue=7 | pages=653-658 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995AmJPh..63..653F }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is the basic reason why iron and nickel are very common metals in planetary cores, since they are produced profusely as end products in [[supernova]]e).

The existence of a ''maximum'' in binding energy in medium-sized nuclei is a consequence of the trade-off in the effects of two opposing forces which have different range characteristics. The attractive nuclear force ([[strong nuclear force]]), which binds protons and neutrons equally to each other, has a limited range due to a rapid exponential decrease in this force with distance. However, the repelling electromagnetic force, which acts between protons to force nuclei apart, falls off with distance much more slowly (as the inverse square of distance). For nuclei larger than about four nucleons in diameter, the additional repelling force of additional protons more than offsets any binding energy which results between further added nucleons as a result of additional strong force interactions; such nuclei become less and less tightly bound as their size increases, though most of them are still stable. Finally, nuclei containing more than 209 nucleons (larger than about 6 nucleons in diameter) are all too large to be stable, and are subject to spontaneous decay to smaller nuclei.

[[Nuclear fusion]] produces energy by combining the very lightest elements into more tightly-bound elements (such as hydrogen into [[helium]]), and [[nuclear fission]] produces energy by splitting the heaviest elements (such as [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]) into more tightly-bound elements (such as [[barium]] and [[krypton]]). Both processes produce energy, because middle-sized nuclei are the most tightly bound of all.

=== Semiempirical formula ===
For a nucleus with A nucleons including Z protons, a semiempirical formula for the binding energy per nucleon is

&lt;math&gt;E/A=a-b/\sqrt[3]{A}-c(Z/\sqrt[3]{A^2})^2-d(N-Z)^2/\sqrt[3]{A^{3+3}}\pm e/\sqrt[4]{A^{3+4}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the binding energy is in MeV for the following numerical values of the constants: &lt;math&gt;a=14.0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;b=13.0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;c=0.585&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;d=19.3&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;e=33&lt;/math&gt;.

The first term &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is called the saturation contribution and ensures that the B.E. per nucleon is the same for all nuclei to a first approximation.

The term &lt;math&gt;-b/A^{1/3}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a surface tension effect and is proportional to the number of nucleons that are situated on the nuclear surface. It is largest for light nuclei.

The term &lt;math&gt;-cZ^2/A^{4/3}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the Coulomb electrostatic repulsion. This becomes more important as &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; increases.

The symmetry correction term &lt;math&gt;-d(N-Z)^2/A^2\,&lt;/math&gt; takes into account the fact that in the absence of other effects the most stable arrangement has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. This is because the ''n-p'' interaction in a nucleus is stronger than either the ''n-n'' or ''p-p'' interaction.

The pairing term &lt;math&gt;\pm e/A^{7/4}&lt;/math&gt; is purely empirical. It is + for even-even nuclei and − for odd-odd nuclei.

The following table gives the binding energy per nucleon in MeV for selected isotopes.

|Al&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;| 8.42 ||align=&quot;center&quot;| 8.33

|U&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt; ||align=&quot;center&quot;| 7.56 ||align=&quot;center&quot;| 7.58
|}

=== Measuring the binding energy ===
As seen above in the example of deuterium, nuclear binding energies are large enough that they may be easily measured as fractional [[mass]] deficits, according to the equivalence of mass and energy. The atomic binding energy is simply the amount of energy (and mass) released, when a collection of free [[nucleons]] are joined together to form a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. All nuclei which last long enough to be weighed, are measurably lighter than a corresponding collection of free protons and neutrons. 

Nuclear binding energy can be easily computed from the easily measurable difference in mass of a nucleus, and the sum of the masses of the number of free neutrons and protons that make up the nucleus. Once this mass difference, called the '''mass defect''' or '''mass deficiency''', is known, Einstein's [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''² can be used to compute the binding energy of any nucleus. (As a historical note, early nuclear physicists used to refer to computing this value as a &quot;packing fraction&quot; calculation.)

For example, the [[atomic mass unit]] (1.000000 '''u''') is ''defined'' to be 1/12 of the mass of a &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atom—but the atomic mass of a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H atom (which is a proton plus electron) is 1.007825 '''u''', so each nucleon in &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C has lost, on average, about 0.8% percent of its mass in the form of binding energy.

In '''physics''' and '''chemistry''', specifically in [[NMR]] (nuclear magnetic resonance) or [[MRI]] (magnetic resonance imaging), or [[ESR]] (electron spin resonance) the '''Bloch equations''' are a set of macroscopic equations that are used to calculate the nuclear magnetization '''M''' = (''M''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;) as a function of time when [[relaxation (NMR)|relaxation times]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are present. These are [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenological]] equations that were introduced by [[Felix Bloch]] in 1946.
&lt;ref&gt;F Bloch, ''Nuclear Induction'', Physics Review '''70''', 460-473 (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes they are called the [[equations of motion]] of nuclear magnetization. 

==Bloch equations in laboratory (stationary) frame of reference==
Let '''M'''(''t'') = (''M&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''), ''M&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''), ''M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')) be the nuclear magnetization. Then the Bloch equations read:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_x(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _x - \frac {M_x(t)} {T_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_y(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _y - \frac {M_y(t)} {T_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _z - \frac {M_z(t) - M_0} {T_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where γ is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] and '''B'''(''t'') = (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;(t)) is the [[magnetic flux density]] experienced by the nuclei.
The ''z'' component of the magnetic flux density '''B''' is sometimes composed of two terms: 
*one, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is constant in time, 
*the other one, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;(t), is time dependent. It is present in [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]] and helps with the spatial decoding of the NMR signal. 
'''M'''(''t'') &amp;times; '''B'''(''t'') is the [[cross product]] of these two vectors.
''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the steady state nuclear magnetization (that is, for example, when t → ∞); it is in the ''z'' direction.

With no relaxation (that is both ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ∞) the above equations simplify to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_x(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_y(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = \gamma ( \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  ) _z&lt;/math&gt;

or, in vector notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \bold {M}(t)} {d t} = \gamma  \bold {M} (t) \times \bold {B} (t)  &lt;/math&gt;

This is the equation for [[Larmor precession]] of the nuclear magnetization ''M'' in an external magnetic flux density '''B'''.

The relaxation terms, 

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( -\frac {M_x} {T_2},  -\frac {M_y} {T_2}, -\frac {M_z - M_0} {T_1} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

represent an established physical process of transverse and longitudinal relaxation of nuclear magnetization '''M'''.

===Bloch equations are macroscopic equations===
These equations are not ''microscopic'': they do not describe the equation of motion of individual nuclear magnetic moments. These are governed and described by laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. 

Bloch equations are ''macroscopic'': they describe the equations of motion of macroscopic nuclear magnetization that can be obtained by summing up all nuclear magnetic moment in the sample.

===Alternative form of Bloch equations===
The above form is simplified assuming

:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy} = M_x + iM_y \text{  and  } B_{xy} = B_x + iB_y &lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' = &amp;radic;(-1). After some algebra one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_{xy}(t)} {d t} = -i \gamma \left ( M_{xy} (t) B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) \right ) -
\frac {M_{xy}} {T_2} &lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = i \gamma \left ( M_{xy} (t) \overline{B_{xy} (t)} - 
\overline {M_{xy}} (t) B_{xy} (t) \right )
- \frac {M_z - M_0} {T_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\overline {M_{xy}} = M_x - i M_y &lt;/math&gt;.

The real and imaginary parts of ''M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' correspond to ''M&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively.
''M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' is sometimes called '''transverse nuclear magnetization'''.

==Bloch equations in rotating frame of reference (outline)==
In rotating frame of reference the it is easier to understand the behaviour of nuclear magnetization '''M'''. This is the motivation: 

===Solution of Bloch equations with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → &amp;infin;===
Assume that:
*at ''t'' = 0 the transverse nuclear magnetization ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;(0) experiences a constant magnetic flux density '''B'''(''t'') = (0, 0, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;);
*''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is positive;
*there are no longitudinal and transverse relaxations (that is ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → &amp;infin;). 

Then the Bloch equations are simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_{xy}(t)} {d t} = -i \gamma  M_{xy} (t) B_{0}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_z(t)} {d t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

These are two (not coupled) [[linear differential equations]]. Their solution is:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy}(t) = M_{xy} (0) e^{-i \gamma B_{0} t}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;M_z(t) = M_0 = \text{const} \,&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;!-- do not delete &quot;\,&quot;, it improved display of the formula on certain browsers. ---&gt;

Thus the transverse magnetization, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, rotates around the ''z'' axis with [[angular frequency]] ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = γ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in counterclockwise direction (this due to the negative sign in the exponent).
The longitudinal magnetization, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; remains constant in time. This is also how the transverse magnetization appears to an observer in the '''laboratory frame of reference''' (that is to a '''stationary observer''').

''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is translated in the following way into observable quantities of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''): Since

:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy}(t) = M_{xy} (0) e^{-i \gamma B_{z0} t} = M_{xy} (0) \left [ \cos (\omega _0 t) - i \sin (\omega_0 t) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;M_{x}(t) = \text {Re} \left (M_{xy} (t) \right ) = M_{xy} (0) \cos (\omega _0 t)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;M_{y}(t) = \text {Im} \left (M_{xy} (t) \right ) = -M_{xy} (0) \sin (\omega _0 t)&lt;/math&gt;,

where Re(''z'') and Im(''z'') are functions that return the real and imaginary part of complex number ''z''. In this calculation it was assumed that ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;(0) is a real number.

===Transformation to rotating frame of reference===

This is the conclusion of the previous section: in a constant magnetic flux density ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; along ''z'' axis the transverse magnetization ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; rotates around the this axis in counterclockwise direction with angular frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If the observer were  around the same axis in  counterclockwise direction with angular frequency  Ω, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; it would appear to him 

It is often more convenient to describe the physics and mathematics of nuclear magnetization in a '''rotating frame of reference''': Let (''x''&amp;prime;, ''y''&amp;prime;, ''z''&amp;prime;) be a Cartesian coordinate system that is rotating around the static magnetic field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (given in the '''laboratory reference system''' (''x'', ''y'', ''z'')) with angular frequency Ω. This is equivalent to assuming that:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{xy}(t) = e^{-i \Omega t} M_{xy}'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_{z}(t) = M_{z}'&lt;/math&gt;

What are the equations of motion of ''M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')&amp;prime; and ''M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'')&amp;prime;?

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d M_{xy}'(t)} {d t} = \frac {d M_{xy}(t) e^{+i \Omega t}} {d t} =
e^{+i \Omega t} \frac {d M_{xy}(t) } {d t} + i \Omega e^{+i \Omega t} M_{xy} =
e^{+i \Omega t} \frac {d M_{xy}(t) } {d t} + i \Omega M_{xy}'
&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute from the Bloch equation in laboratory frame of reference:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \frac {d M_{xy}'(t)} {d t} &amp; = e^{+i \Omega t} \left [-i \gamma \left ( M_{xy} (t) B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) \right ) -
\frac {M_{xy}} {T_2} \right ] + i \Omega M_{xy}' = \\

&amp; = \left [-i \gamma \left ( M_{xy} (t) e^{+i \Omega t} B_z (t) - M_z (t) B_{xy} (t) e^{+i \Omega t}\right ) -
\frac {M_{xy} e^{+i \Omega t} } {T_2} \right ] + i \Omega M_{xy}' = \\

&amp; = -i \gamma \left ( M_{xy}' (t) B_z' (t) - M_z' (t) B_{xy}' (t) \right ) + i \Omega M_{xy}' -
\frac {M_{xy}'} {T_2}  = 

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Simple solutions of Bloch equations (outline)==

===Relaxation of transverse nuclear magnetization ''M&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;''===

===Relaxation of longitudinal nuclear magnetization ''M&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''===

[[Image:Redshift blueshift.svg|thumb|Redshift and blue shift]]
'''Blue shift''' is the shortening of a transmitted signal's [[wavelength]], and/or an increase in its [[frequency]], due to the [[relativistic Doppler effect]], which indicates that the object is moving toward the observer. The name comes from the fact that the shorter-wavelength end of the optical [[spectrum]] is the [[blue]] (or [[Violet (color)|violet]]) end, hence, when visible [[light]] is compacted in wavelength, it is shifted towards the &quot;blue&quot; end of the spectrum. Since the longer-wavelength end of the visible [[electromagnetic spectrum]] is ''[[red]]'', the opposite effect, of a lengthening of a signal's wavelength, is referred to as [[redshift]]ing.

While the terms &quot;redshifting&quot; and &quot;blueshifting&quot; imply significantly redder or bluer light, only the most distant galaxies and those moving at speeds far above average emit light that arrives with perceptible red or blue tinges. For the most part, shifting is not a visible phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Quest of the Universe|first=Karl F.|last=Kuhn|coauthors=Theo Koupelis|year=2004|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=0763708100|pages=122–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These terms and conventions (&quot;blue&quot; = compaction, &quot;red&quot;= diffusing) are used even when referring to signals outside the optical range (for instance, [[radio wave]]s, [[x-rays]] and [[gamma rays]]).

==Astronomy==
[[Redshift]] is much more noted due to its importance to modern [[astronomy]]. While the general [[redshift]] of starlight is seen as evidence for an expanding universe, there are a few examples of blue shift in astronomy:
* The [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is moving towards our own [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]] within the [[Local Group]]; thus, when observed from earth, its light is undergoing a blue shift.
* When observing spiral galaxies, the side spinning towards us will have a slight blue shift (see [[Tully-Fisher relation]]).
* Also, [[Blazar]]s are known to propel [[relativistic jet]]s towards us, emitting [[synchrotron radiation]] and [[Bremsstrahlung]] that appears blue shifted.
* Nearby stars such as [[Barnard's Star]] are moving towards us, resulting in a very small blue shift.
===Cause of blueshift in astronomy===
These are the known possible causes of blue shift in astronomy:
# Movement of the source towards us, as seen in
## the edge of a rotating galaxy moving towards us
## In [[blazar]]s which propel [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[Relativistic jet|jets]] towards us
## Some galaxies [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1969ApJ...157L.155B&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c07726] and quasars [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005ApJ...618..601A&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c07726]

[[Image:Bottom-up vs top down.svg|right|350px|thumb|Bottom-up versus top-down proteomics]]
'''Bottom-up [[proteomics]]''' is a common method to identify proteins and characterize their amino acid sequences and [[Post-translational_modification|post-translational modifications]] by [[Proteolysis|proteolytic digestion]] of proteins prior to analysis by [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12634793&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aebersold R, Mann M |title=Mass spectrometry-based proteomics |journal=Nature |volume=422 |issue=6928 |pages=198–207 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12634793 |doi=10.1038/nature01511 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17023639&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chait BT |title=Chemistry.

[[Image:Bradbury-Nielsen on.gif|right|thumb|200 px|Schematic top view of a Bradbury-Nielsen shutter with voltages on (deflecting).]]
A '''Bradbury-Nielsen shutter''' (or '''Bradbury-Nielsen gate''') is a type of electrical ion gate, which was first proposed in an article by [[Norris Bradbury]] and Russel A. Nielsen, where they used it as an [[electron]] filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norris E. Bradbury and Russel A. Nielsen | title = Absolute Values of the Electron Mobility in Hydrogen  | year = 1936 | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 388–93 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.49.388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are used in the field of [[mass spectrometry]] where they are used in both [[time-of-flight|TOF]] mass spectrometers and in [[ion mobility spectrometer]]s, as well as [[Hadamard transform]] mass spectrometers (a variant of TOF-MS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joel R. Kimmel, Friedrich Engelke, and Richard N. Zare | title = Novel method for the production of finely spaced Bradbury–Nielson gates | year = 2001 | journal = [[Review of Scientific Instruments]] | volume = 72 | issue = 12 | pages = 4354–4357 | doi = 10.1063/1.1416109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;BNG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Oh Kyu Yoon, Ignacio A. Zuleta, Matthew D. Robbins, Griffin K. Barbula, and Richard N. Zare | title = Simple Template-Based Method to Produce Bradbury-Nielsen Gates | year = 2007 | journal = [[Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry]] | volume = 18 | pages = 1901-1908 | doi = 10.1016/j.jasms.2007.07.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bradbury-Nielsen shutter is ideal for injecting short pulses of ions and can be used to improve the mass resolution of TOF instruments by reducing the initial pulse size as compared to other methods of ion injection.

==Theory of Operation==
The concept behind the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter is to apply a [[high frequency]] [[voltage]] in an 180° out-of-phase manner to alternate wires in a grid which is orthogonal to the path of the ion beam. This results in [[charged particles]] only passing directly through the shutter at certain times in the voltage phase (φ=nπ/2), when the potential difference between the grid wires is zero. At other times the ion beam is deflected to some angle by the potential difference between the neighboring wires. This deflection is divergent with ions that pass through alternate slits being deflected in opposite directions.  The deflection angle &lt;ref name=&quot;BNG&quot; /&gt; can be calculated by 

tan α = k V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

where α is the deflection angle, k is a deflection constant, V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the wire voltage (+V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; on one wire set and -V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; on the other), and V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ion acceleration voltage in eV.  The deflection constant k can be calculated by

k = π / 2ln[cot(πR/2d)]

where R is the wire radius and d is the wire spacing. 

==Micromachined ion gates==
A Bradbury-Nielsen shutter [[micromachine]]d from a [[silicon wafer]] has been reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17966990&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zuleta IA, Barbula GK, Robbins MD, Yoon OK, Zare RN |title=Micromachined bradbury-nielsen gates |journal=Anal.

In astronomy, the '''broad iron K line''' is a [[spectral line]] that is an accurate measure of a [[black hole]]'s immense gravitational force. The name refers to the shape, on a [[spectrometer|spectrogram]], of light emitted by iron atoms near the black hole surface. The light loses energy as it climbs out of the black hole's gravitational well, causing the spectral line to be [[redshift|stretched toward lower frequencies]].

A series of observations by the Japanese [[ASTRO-E|Suzaku]] satellite conducted in 2005 and 2006 demonstrates that the broad iron K line is found coming from almost all galaxies and that the signal is real, from strong gravity, and not noise due to poor resolution.  Recent data suggests a connection between [[quasi-periodic oscillations]] and the broad Iron K line.

Scientists believe that they will be able to use the broad iron K line to image black holes.

[[Image:Alpha calutron tank.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|An alpha calutron tank removed from the magnet for recovery of uranium-235.]]
A '''calutron''' is a [[mass spectrometer]] used for [[isotope separation|separating the isotopes]] of [[uranium]]. It was developed by [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fepi2.htm |title=Lawrence and His Laborator |accessdate=2007-09-03 |year=1981 |work=LBL Newsmagazine |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Manhattan Project]] and was similar to the [[cyclotron]] invented by Lawrence. Its name is a [[concatenation]] of Cal. U.-tron, in tribute to the [[University of California]], Lawrence's institution and the contractor of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] laboratory.&lt;ref name='OSTI ID: 20699216'&gt; {{cite journal|title=The Uranium Bomb, the Calutron, and the Space-Charge Problem|journal=Physics Today|date=2005-05-01|first=William E.|last=Parkins|coauthors=|volume=58|issue=5|pages=45–51|doi= 10.1063/1.1995747}}|url=http://masspec.scripps.edu/MSHistory/timelines/time_pdf/1947_ParkinsWE.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; They implemented industrial scale [[uranium enrichment]] at the [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] plant established during the war and provided much of the uranium used for the &quot;[[Little Boy]]&quot; [[nuclear weapon]], which was dropped onto [[Hiroshima]] in 1945.

In a mass spectrometer, a vaporized sample is bombarded with high energy [[electrons]], which cause the sample components to become positively charged [[ions]]. They are then accelerated and subsequently deflected by [[magnetic field]]s, ultimately colliding with a plate and producing a measurable [[electric current]].  Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are bent less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations.   The [[mass]] of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. An ordinary mass spectrometer is designed to analyse the composition of very small samples; the calutron uses the same principle, but is designed to separate substantial quantities of known isotopes.

Initially a type of calutron later called Alpha was used; it enriched uranium to about 15% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Another type, called Beta, was later designed to further enrich the output of Alpha, optimising the design for the smaller quantities of already enriched feedstock.

Due to the wartime copper shortage the electromagnets were made using thousands of tons of silver borrowed from the U.S. Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=THE SILVER LINING OF THE CALUTRONS | year=2002 | publisher=Oak Ridge National Lab | url =http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter1sidebar6.htm | work =ORNL Review | pages = | accessdate = 2009-04-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=D.

Calutrons use very substantial amounts of electrical power. It is estimated that calutrons built in [[Iraq]] by the [[Baath]] regime of [[Sadam Hussein]] required about 140MW for 90 calutrons&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=25608 News article with estimate of power requirements of Iraq's calutrons by [[IAEA]]. Retrieved 22 Apr 09]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Magnetic separation was later abandoned in favor of the more complicated, but more effective, [[gaseous diffusion]] method.

==Calutrons and the Manhattan project==

===Uranium isotope separation===
The world did not lack methods for separating [[isotope]]s when it discovered the possible utility of a [[kilogram]] of [[uranium-235]] (&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U). Known techniques, pursued simultaneously in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]], included [[Ultracentrifuge|ultra-centrifugation]], [[diffusion]] across thermal or [[osmotic]] pressure barriers, and deflection in [[electric]] and [[magnetic]] fields. The last method appealed to Lawrence, who had made his reputation on the precise control of beams of charged particles. The principle is simple: when passing between the poles of a magnet, a monoenergetic beam of ions of naturally occurring uranium splits into several streams according to their momentum, one per isotope, each characterized by a particular radius of curvature; collecting cups at the ends of the semicircular trajectories catch the homogeneous streams.

[[Image:Diagram of uranium isotope separation in the calutron.png|thumb|left|300px|Diagram of uranium isotope separation in the calutron.]] 
Most physicists in 1941 doubted that electromagnetic separation would succeed in practice because they expected that the mutual repulsion of the like-charged ions (the [[space charge]] effect) would prevent the formation of narrow beams. But Lawrence, who had seen a line of positively charged ions pour from his cyclotron, had the 37-inch (94&amp;nbsp;cm) cyclotron modified to demonstrate the feasibility of electromagnetic separation of uranium isotopes using the principle of the [[mass spectrograph]]. &quot;It will not be a calamity,&quot; he wrote Compton, if uranium turned out to have no military applications; but if &quot;fantastically positive and we fail to get them first, the results for our country may well be a tragic disaster.&quot; By December 1941 the uranium ion beam was passing 5 microamperes to the collector; a small amount, but enough to assure Lawrence that space charge would not be a formidable problem.

The fact that beams of uranium ions could be concentrated well enough to yield small quantities of [[isotope]]s suitable for laboratory research by no means assured that electromagnetic separation could be worked on the industrial scale necessary to make a kilogram of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. The process has little to work on, only the slight difference in mass: 1.25 percent-between uranium 235 and 238. Because the lighter ions respond slightly more to the magnetic field than the heavier, their trajectories bend in a tighter arc. At the end of their semicircular travel, the ions of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U are more plentiful on the inside than on the outside of the beam. But the maximum separation even in the ideal case is small, only one-tenth inch for an arc with a diameter of 37 inches (94&amp;nbsp;cm). Actual beams are far from ideal.

===The alpha calutron===
[[Image:Calutron emitter.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|[[Frank Oppenheimer]] (center right) and [[Robert Lyster Thornton|Robert Thornton]] (right) examine the 4-source emitter for the improved alpha calutron]]
Many technical problems had to be solved before even a prototype could be tested in the field of the nearly completed 184-inch (4.67 m) magnet. The beams, though of low power, could melt the collectors during long hours of operation; water cooling was installed for the collectors and tank liner. [[Electric arc]]s were contrived to ionize the [[uranium tetrachloride]] feed. Ways were devised to extract the enriched uranium that collected at the receiver, and the still valuable feed material that condensed along with [[chloride]] &quot;gunk&quot; all over the inside of the tank. Scrapers were made to clean the exit slits of the feed sources regularly to prevent the accumulated &quot;crud&quot; from reducing beam strength. Lawrence's optimistic conclusion: by the fall of 1942 ten calutrons, each with a 100-milliampere source and all operating within the 184-inch field, would produce four grams of [[enriched uranium]] a day. The [[S-1 Uranium Committee]] that oversaw the uranium project for [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] recommended expending $12 million to create a plant with 25 times that capacity before the fall of 1943. Lawrence did not doubt that other means, particularly reactor production of [[fissile]] [[plutonium]], might ultimately be the most efficient way to a bomb. But in mid-1942 no reactor worked, and the calutron did.

The calutron design settled on in 1942, called &quot;alpha,&quot; provided for enrichment of natural uranium to about 15 percent &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Much effort went into designing powerful ion sources and aptly shaped, eventually [[Parabola|parabolic]] collecting slots. The many modifications and security codes proliferated whimsical names: sources Plato, Cyclops, Bicyclops, and Goofy mated with receivers Gloria, Irene, Mona, or Zulu. Ions from Plato and his friends traversed an arc 48 inches (1.22 m) in radius to reach collector slits placed 0.6 inch (15&amp;nbsp;mm) apart. The guiding magnetic field was [[shim (engineering)|shimmed]] not by the old black art, but in obedience to calculations. Accurately machined and installed, the shims greatly increased the usable beam that reached the collectors.

[[Image:Oak Ridge Y-12 Alpha Track.jpg|left|thumb|300 px|Alpha Track Calutron at the Y-12 Plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee from the Manhattan Project, used for uranium enrichment.]]

===Scaling up at Oak Ridge===
Among results obtained with the 184-inch magnet was a design superior to it for large-scale calutrons, the so-called &quot;XA.&quot; The prototype of the magnets to be installed at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]], XA was a rectangular, three-coil magnet giving a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side-by-side. It had room for four alpha tanks, each with a double source. By the spring of 1943, convinced that the Germans might be ahead, General [[Leslie Groves]] decided to skip the scheduled pilot plant: procedures for alpha operation at Oak Ridge came from the XA and a scale model of the production magnet alone. Tests of the first full-scale system installed there, the XAX, were scheduled for July.

The spring and early summer of 1943 brought hundreds of trainees to Berkeley from  [[Eastman Chemical Company|Tennessee Eastman Company]], the operator for the Oak Ridge plant. The Laboratory labored to ensure that the test XA magnet system and alpha units were working by April in spite of delays in delivery of steel. Between April and July the training sessions ran continuously. In June a migration that by 1944 would reach 200 started for Oak Ridge. Laboratory expenditures exceeded half a million dollars a month.

During the Manhattan Project the operators, mostly women, worked in shifts covering 24 hours a day. Gladys Owens is the young lady on the right above and closest to the camera, where she spent eight months of her life &quot;watching meters and adjusting dials&quot; without knowing what she was actually doing.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://smithdray1.net/angeltowns/or/go.htm |title=The Calutron Girls |accessdate=2007-09-01 |last=Smith |first=D. Ray }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The first wave of [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] workers at Oak Ridge had to see that the XAX magnet worked. Then runs could begin on the first production system, or &quot;racetrack;&quot; a 24-fold magnification of the XA that could hold 96 calutron alpha tanks. To minimize magnetic losses and [[steel]] consumption, the assembly was curved into an oval 122 feet (37 m) long, 77 feet (23 m) wide and 15 feet (4.6 m) high. Want of copper for the large coils to produce the magnetic fields prompted a solution possible only in wartime: Groves borrowed 14,700&amp;nbsp;[[short ton]]s (13,300&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s, 429 million [[troy ounce]]s) of pure silver from a government vault for the purpose; all was later returned, the last few tons in 1970. Late in the summer of 1943 the XAX was ready for testing. After a week of difficulty, it cleared the hurdle for full-scale racetrack runs.

The first two of five projected racetracks started up in November and failed from contaminated cooling oil; the second was limping in January, but produced 200 grams of uranium enriched to 12 percent &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U by the end of February 1944, its fifth of the total goal of one kilogram of enriched uranium per month. By April four racetracks were functioning, including the repaired number 1. They required constant attention. Many people from the Laboratory helped modify the units to reach production goals. 

The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate. Then Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education took over. [[Kenneth Nichols]] compared unit production data, and pointed out to [[Ernest Lawrence]] that the young “hillbilly” girl operators were outproducing his Ph.Ds. They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors. The girls were trained like soldiers not to reason why, while “the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials” &lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Kenneth D. ‘’The Road to Trinity page 131 (1987, Morrow, New York) ISBN 068806910X  &lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for operation passed entirely to Tennessee Eastman after the spring of 1944, and the Laboratory staff at Oak Ridge turned their attention to redesigning the calutron system for higher efficiency.

===The beta calutron===
Many at the Laboratory, especially [[Edward Lofgren]] and [[Martin Kamen]], thought that a second stage would be necessary to reach the required enrichment. Groves approved the idea. In the spring of 1943, during training at Berkeley for alpha operations, design began on the second or beta stage. Because beta would have only the enriched product of alpha as feed, it would process proportionately less material; its beam therefore did not need to be as broad, nor its dimensions as large, as alpha's. Beta design emphasized recovery, not only of the further enriched output but also of the already enriched feed. The first units were tried at Oak Ridge in late February 1944, but the sources had to be redesigned, and even by June difficulties persisted in recovering the precious beta feed strewn throughout the calutron. Process efficiencies stayed low: only 4 or 5 percent of the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U in the feed ended up in the output. A better source of enriched uranium feed would have to be found to create the 10 kilograms or so of 90 percent &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U that [[Robert Oppenheimer]] thought necessary for a bomb.

The [[gaseous diffusion]] procedure for separation of uranium isotopes, which had consumed more money than the calutron, had not met its design goals by late 1944. Groves decided that it could not be counted on to produce high enrichment, and that whatever it did produce would have to be supplemented with other less enriched uranium and processed through beta calutrons. To augment the calutron feed, the [[Manhattan Engineering District]] constructed a further plant at Oak Ridge, this one working by [[thermal diffusion]], a method developed by [[Philip Abelson]].

===Weapons-grade uranium===
In the critical production period in the first months of 1945, the calutrons, particularly the six betas of 36 tanks each, produced weapons-grade &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U using feed from the modified alpha calutrons, the small output from the gaseous diffusion plant, and whatever the new thermal process had to offer. Virtually all the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U sent by courier on the train to [[Chicago]] and on to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] had passed through the beta calutrons. From these shipments Oppenheimer's physicists assembled the bomb that was to destroy [[Hiroshima]].

==Modern calutrons==
After the 1990 [[Gulf War]], [[UNSCOM]] determined that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium.&lt;ref&gt; William Langewiesche, '' Point of No Return'', Atlantic Magazine, Jan/Feb 2006, p107, citing the work of Mark Hibbs, Nucleonics Week, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Canadian Penning Trap Mass Spectrometer''' ('''CPT''') is one of the major pieces of experimental equipment that is installed on the [[Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System|ATLAS]] superconducting heavy-ion linac facility at the Physics Division of the [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. It was developed and operated by physicist [[Guy Savard]] and a collaboration of other scientists at Argonne, the [[University of Manitoba]], [[McGill University]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[State University of New York]]. 

== Development ==
The CPT was originally built for the [[TASCC|Tandem Accelerator Superconducting Cyclotron]] (TASCC) facility at [[Chalk River Laboratories]] in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. However, it was transferred to Argonne National Laboratory when the TASCC accelerator was decommissioned in 1998 due to funding issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TJN-41MHFHC-17&amp;_user=1722207&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000053990&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1722207&amp;md5=4c620ed80f2930d6ee677867c070647d&lt;/ref&gt; 
The CPT [[spectrometer]] is designed to provide high-precision mass measurements of [[radioactivity|short-lived]] [[isotopes]] using [[radio-frequency]] (RF) fields. Accurate mass measurements of particular isotopes such as [[selenium|selenium-68]] are important in the understanding of the detailed [[reaction mechanism]]s involved in the [[rp-process|rapid-proton capture process]], which occurs in astrophysical events like [[supernova|supernovae explosions]] and [[X-ray burst]]s. An X-ray burst is one possible site for the rp-process mechanism which involves the [[accretion]] of hydrogen and helium from one star onto the surface of its [[neutron star]] binary companion. Mass measurements are required as key inputs to network calculations used to describe this process in terms of the abundances of the nuclides produced, the [[Light curve|light-curve]] profile of the X-ray bursts, and the energy produced. In the current configuration, more than 100 [[radiation|radioactive]] isotopes have been measured with half-lives much less than a second and with a precision (Δm/m) approaching 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Recently, a novel injection system, the [[RFQ Beam Coolers|RF gas cooler]], has been installed on the CPT to allow fast reaction products to be decelerated, thermalized and bunched for rapid and efficient injection. This enhances the investigative capabilities of the CPT on isotopes around the [[Isotope#Nuclear properties and stability|N=Z line]] with particular emphasis on isotopes of interest to low-energy tests of the [[electroweak interaction]] and the rp-process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Carbohydrate NMR''' is the application of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) to structural and conformational analysis of [[carbohydrate]] molecules. The study of [[carbohydrate chemistry]] today relies heavily on NMR spectroscopy. It is a tool that allows the carbohydrate chemist to determine the structure of [[monosaccharides]] and [[oligosaccharides]] from synthetic and natural sources. It is also a useful tool for determining sugar conformations. 



Modern high field strength NMR instruments used for carbohydrate samples, typically 500 MHz or greater, are able to run a suite of 1D and 2D experiments to determine primary structure and conformation of carbohydrate compounds. 

== Sensitivity and Sample Size ==
In addition to ever increasing magnet size several other factors determine the sensitivity of an NMR instrument. [[NMR tube|Shigemi tubes]] are ideal for small sample sizes and are available matched to a variety of deuterated NMR solvents. Cold probes are available that cryogenically cool the NMR systems radio frequency (rf) receiver coils and pre-amplifier to provide increased sensitivity, reducing thermal noise.

== Carbohydrate chemical shift ==
Common chemical shift ranges for nuclei within carbohydrate residues are:
*Typical &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR chemical shifts of carbohydrate ring protons are 3 – 6 ppm. 
*Typical &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR chemical shifts of carbohydrate ring protons are 60 – 110 ppm

In the case of simple monosaccharide molecules, all protons are typically separated at a high enough field strength (usually &gt; 500MHz).

Typically the [[anomer]]ic protons are found shifted further downfield (higher ppm) on the NMR spectrum then other ring protons, generally 4-6 ppm. This often makes these signals the most diagnostic component of the spectrum.

The equatorial anomeric proton of an α-pyranoside is found downfield of the axial anomeric proton of a β-pyranoside. This can be accounted for by the deshielding effect of the ring oxygen which has closer proximity to an equatorial anomeric proton. Additionally, the anisotropic effects of circulating σ electrons form a deshielded region around the equatorial proton.

The anomeric carbon is typically found at 90-110 ppm, typical of any acetal carbon. The use of chemical shift for determining C-1 stereochemistry is unreliable, but the carbon of a β-anomer is usually found downfield relative to the α-anomer.

=== Non-anomeric centers ===
Typically the non-anomeric protons are found from 3 - 4 ppm. As expected some spectral overlap is seen, but with today’s high field instruments individual resonances can usually be resolved for monosaccharides. 
Typically the non-anomeric carbons are found from 60 – 85 ppm. As expected the secondary carbons will be found further downfield from a primary carbon.

== Oligosaccharide NMR ==
Oligosaccharide &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectra tend to be a mess in the region of the spectra from 3 – 4 ppm. Quite often the individual signals are overlapped, and cannot be distinguished in the simple 1-D experiment. It is therefore advantageous to utilize 2D experiments

== COSY or Correlation spectroscopy ==
COSY, or Correlation SpectroscopY, is often useful for carbohydrate structures due to the extended spin systems found in these molecules. The cross peaks in a 2D - COSY spectrum indicate couplings (2 and 3 bond) between two protons. Using this coupling information we can “walk” around a monosaccharide ring determining each proton, provided there is an obvious entry point, usually the anomeric proton.

== TOCSY (Totally Correlated Spectroscopy) ==
The 2D - TOCSY experiment is similar to the 2D - COSY experiment, in that cross peaks of coupled protons are observed. However, the additional information obtained in a TOCSY is correlations for all the protons in the spin system. In the case of oligosaccharides, each sugar residue is an isolated spin system, so it is possible to differentiate all the protons of a specific sugar residue. A 1D version of TOCSY is also available and by irradiating a single proton the rest of the spin system can be revealed. 

Recent advances in this technique include the 1D - CSSF - TOCSY ('''C'''hemical '''S'''hift '''S'''elective '''F'''ilter - TOCSY) experiment. This produces higher quality spectra and allows coupling constants to be reliably extracted and used to help determine stereochemistry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Carbon-13 NMR''' ('''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR''' or sometimes simply referred to as carbon NMR) is the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to carbon. It is analogous to proton NMR  and allows the identification of carbon atoms in an organic molecule just as proton NMR identifies hydrogen atoms. As such &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR is an important tool in chemical structure elucidation in organic chemistry.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR detects only the Carbon-13 isotope of carbon, whose natural abundance is only 1.1%, because the main carbon isotope, Carbon-12, is not detectable by NMR since it has zero spin.

==Implementation==
&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR has a number of complications that are not encountered in proton NMR.  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR is much less sensitive to carbon than &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR is to hydrogen since the major isotope of carbon, the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope, has a spin quantum number of zero and so is not magnetically active and therefore not detectable by NMR. Only the much less common &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope, present naturally at 1.1% natural abundance, is magnetically active with a spin quantum number of 1/2 (like &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) and therefore detectable by NMR.  Therefore, only the few &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei present resonate in the magnetic field, although this can be overcome by isotopic enrichment of e.g. protein samples.  In&amp;nbsp;addition, the [[../gyromagnetic ratio/]] (6.728284 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; rad T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is only 1/4 that of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, further reducing the sensitivity.  The overall
''receptivity'' of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is about 4 orders of magnitude lower than&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=R. M. Silverstein, G. C. Bassler and T. C. Morrill| title=Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds|publisher=Wiley| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 


&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''[[Vanillin]] C-13 NMR spectrum'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Another potential complication results from the presence of large one bond [[J-coupling]] constants between carbon and hydrogen (typically from 100 to 250 Hz).  In order to suppress these couplings, which would otherwise complicate the spectra and further reduce sensitivity, carbon NMR spectra are proton [[NMR decoupling|decoupled]] to remove the signal splitting. Couplings between carbons can be ignored due to the low natural abundance of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.  Hence in contrast to typical proton NMR spectra which show multiplets for each proton position, carbon NMR spectra show a single peak for each chemically non-equivalent carbon atom.   
 
In further contrast to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, the intensities of the signals are not normally proportional to the number of equivalent &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms and are instead strongly dependent on the number of surrounding [[Spin (physics)|spins]] (typically &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H). Spectra can be made more quantitative if necessary by allowing sufficient time for the nuclei to relax between repeat scans. 

High field magnets with internal bores capable of accepting larger sample tubes (typically 10&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter for &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR versus 5&amp;nbsp;mm for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR), the use of relaxation reagents &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Applications range from quantification of [[drug]] purity to determination of the composition of high molecular weight synthetic [[polymers]].  

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C [[chemical shift]]s follow the same principles as those of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, although the typical range of chemical shifts is much larger than for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H (by a factor of about 20).  The chemical shift reference standard for 
&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is the carbons in [[../tetramethylsilane]] (TMS), whose chemical shift is considered to be 0.0 ppm.

&lt;/div&gt;

==DEPT spectra==
[[Image:DEPT spectra.jpg|thumb|300px|right|DEPT spectra of propyl benzoate]]
DEPT stands for '''D'''istortionless '''E'''nhancement by '''P'''olarization '''T'''ransfer. It is a very useful method for determining the presence of primary, secondary and [[tertiary carbon]] atoms. The DEPT experiment differentiates between CH, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups by variation of the selection angle parameter (the tip angle of the final &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H pulse): 
*45° angle gives all carbons with attached protons (regardless of number) in phase
*90° angle gives only CH groups, the others being suppressed
*135° angle gives all CH and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a phase opposite to CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
Signals from quaternary carbons and other carbons with no attached protons are always absent (due to the lack of attached protons). 

The polarization transfer from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H to &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C has the
secondary advantage of increasing the sensitivity over the normal &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C
spectrum (which has a modest enhancement from the [[Nuclear Overhauser effect|NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect)]] due to the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H decoupling).
===The peaks seen in a 13C NMR===
The peaks seen in a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectrum are a result of different '''Isotopomers'''. For example consider [[ethanol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH). Ethanol will have 2 simple '''isotopomers''' one in which the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atom is on the [[methyl]] group i.e. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and one isotopomer in which the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atom is on the [[methylene]] i.e. CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH.

This gives rise to 2 peaks in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C [[NMR spectrum]].

Note the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms do not show up in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR. 

Also given that &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is only present in 1% abundance, there is a very small chance of also seeing the [[isotopologue]] in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, wherein both carbon atoms are &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms (i.e. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH). These atoms would [[../J-coupling|couple]], giving satellites off the main peaks in a normal &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR spectrum and forming the basis for INADEQUATE (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C–&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C correlation) experiments.

'''Carbon satellites''' are small peaks that can be seen shouldering the main peaks in an [[NMR]] [[NMR spectrum|spectrum]].  These peaks can occur in the NMR spectrum of any NMR active atom (e.g. [[Fluorine-19 NMR|19F]] or [[Phosphorus-31 NMR|31P NMR]]) where those atoms adjoin a carbon atom (and where the spectrum is not 13C-decoupled, which is usually the case).  However, Carbon satellites are most often encountered in [[proton NMR]]. 

In the example of [[proton NMR]], these peaks are not the result of [[proton NMR|proton-proton coupling]], but result from the coupling of 1H atoms to an adjoining [[Carbon-13]] atom. These small peaks are known as carbon satellites as they are small and appear around the main 1H peak i.e. [[satellite]] (around) to them.  Carbon satellites are small because [[Carbon-13]] only makes up about 1% of the atomic carbon content of [[carbon]], the rest of the carbon atoms are predominantly NMR inactive [[Carbon-12]].  Carbon satellites always appear as an evenly spaced pair around the main 1H peak. This is because they are the result of 1% of the 1H atoms coupling to an adjoined [[Carbon-13|13C atom]] to give a wide doublet (Carbon-13 has a spin of a half).  Note, if the main 1H-peak has proton-proton coupling, then each satellite will be a miniature version of the main peak and will also show this 1H-coupling, e.g. if the main 1H-peak is a doublet, then the carbon satellites will appear as miniature doublets, i.e. one doublet on either side of the main 1H-peak.  

For other NMR atoms (e.g. 19F or 31P atoms), the same applies as above, but obviously where the proton atom is replaced with that oterh NMR active atom e.g. 31P. 

Sometime other peaks can be seen around 1H peaks, these are known as [[spinning sidebands]] and are related to the rate of spin of an [[NMR tube]].  

Carbon satellites (and spinning sidebands) should not be confused with impurity peaks. 

==Uses==
[[File:Stilbene_cis_structure.svg|thumb|right|[[(Z)-Stilbene|Cis-Stilbene]]]] [[File:Stilbene_trans_structure.svg|thumb|right|[[(E)-Stilbene|Trans-Stilbene]]]] '''Carbon satellites''' can be used to obtain structural information, which is not available by looking at the main peaks in the [[NMR]] [[NMR spectrum|spectrum]].

This usually occurs when the purely [[C-12]] compound is symmetrical but where the 1% of the compound which has a [[C-13]] atom in it is no longer symmetrical.

For example, you can not tell if [[stilbene]] (Ph-'''CH=CH'''-Ph) has a [[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]]- or [[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]- [[double bond]] just by examining at the main peaks in the [[1H NMR]] spectrum.  The =CH- proton does not couple to the adjacent =CH- proton as the molecule is [[symmetrical]].  However 1% of the stilbene molecules will have a 13C atom on one of these double bond carbons (i.e. Ph-'''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH=&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CH'''-Ph). In this situation, the proton adjacent to 13C atom will [[NMR spectroscopy|couple]] to the 13C atom to give a wide [[NMR spectroscopy|doublet]]. Also, as this molecule is no longer symmetric the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;= proton will now couple to the adjacent &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;=  proton, causing a further doubleting.  Thus this additional coupling (additional to the 13C coupling) is diagnostic of the type of double bond, and will allow one to determine if the stilbene molecule has a cis- or trans- configuration i.e. by examining the size of the diagnostic [[NMR spectroscopy|J coupling constant]] from -CH=CH- bond. Thus only a single 1H NMR spectrum is need, albeit with close inspection of the satellite peaks, rather than any further complex [[NMR]] or derivative chemical experiments.

The same would be see for [[1,2-Dichloroethene]].&lt;ref name=Gunther1&gt;{{cite book

Luthria, Editor pp.241-273, AOCS Press., Champaign, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;, and to images of planetary systems in astronomy, but different instrumentation is employed for making observations on such widely different systems.

Chemical imaging instrumentation is composed of three components: a radiation source to illuminate the sample, a spectrally selective element, and usually a detector array (the camera) to collect the images. When many stacked spectral channels ([[wavelength]]s) are collected for different locations of the microspectrometer focus on a line or planar array in the focal plane, the data is called hyperspectral; fewer wavelength data sets are called multispectral. The data format is called a hypercube. The data set may be visualized as a three-dimensional block of data spanning two spatial dimensions (x and y), with a series of wavelengths (lambda) making up the third (spectral) axis. The hypercube can be visually and mathematically treated as a series of spectrally resolved images (each image plane corresponding to the image at one wavelength) or a series of spatially resolved spectra. The analyst may choose to view the spectrum measured at a particular spatial location; this is useful for chemical identification. Alternatively, selecting an image plane at a particular wavelength can highlight the spatial distribution of sample components, provided that their spectral signatures are different at the selected wavelength.

Many materials, both manufactured and naturally occurring, derive their functionality from the spatial distribution of sample components. For example, extended release pharmaceutical formulations can be achieved by using a coating that acts as a barrier layer. The release of active ingredient is controlled by the presence of this barrier, and imperfections in the coating, such as discontinuities, may result in altered performance. In the semi-conductor industry, irregularities or contaminants in silicon wafers or printed micro-circuits can lead to failure of these components. The functionality of biological systems is also dependent upon chemical gradients – a single cell, tissue, and even whole organs function because of the very specific arrangement of components. It has been shown that even small changes in chemical composition and distribution may be an early indicator of disease. 

Any material that depends on chemical gradients for functionality may be amenable to study by an analytical technique that couples spatial and chemical characterization. To efficiently and effectively design and manufacture such materials, the ‘what’ and the ‘where’ must both be measured. The demand for this type of analysis is increasing as manufactured materials become more complex. Chemical imaging techniques not only permit visualization of the spatially resolved chemical information that is critical to understanding modern manufactured products, but it is also a non-destructive technique so that samples are preserved for further testing.

==History==
Commercially available laboratory-based chemical imaging systems emerged in the early 1990s (ref. 1-5). In addition to economic factors, such as the need for sophisticated electronics and extremely high-end computers, a significant barrier to commercialization of infrared imaging was that the focal plane array (FPA) needed to read IR images were not readily available as commercial items. As high-speed electronics and sophisticated computers became more commonplace, and infrared cameras became readily commercially available, laboratory chemical imaging systems were introduced.

Initially used for novel research in specialized laboratories, chemical imaging became a more commonplace analytical technique used for general R&amp;D, quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) in less than a decade. The rapid acceptance of the technology in a variety of industries (pharmaceutical, polymers, semiconductors, security, forensics and agriculture) rests in the wealth of information characterizing both chemical composition and morphology. The parallel nature of chemical imaging data makes it possible to analyze multiple samples simultaneously for applications that require high throughput analysis in addition to characterizing a single sample.

==Principles==
Chemical imaging shares the fundamentals of vibrational spectroscopic techniques, but provides additional information by way of the simultaneous acquisition of spatially resolved spectra. It combines the advantages of digital imaging with the attributes of spectroscopic measurements. Briefly, [[vibrational spectroscopy]] measures the interaction of light with matter. Photons that interact with a sample are either absorbed or scattered; photons of specific energy are absorbed, and the pattern of absorption provides information, or a fingerprint, on the molecules that are present in the sample. 

On the other hand, in terms of the observation setup, chemical imaging can be carried out in one of the following modes: (optical) [[absorption]], [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] (fluorescence), (optical) [[transmittance|transmission]] or [[scattering]] (Raman). A consensus currently exists that the fluorescence ([[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]) and Raman [[scattering]] modes are the most sensitive and powerful, but also the most expensive. 

In a transmission measurement, the radiation goes through a sample and is measured by a detector placed on the far side of the sample. The energy transferred from the incoming radiation to the molecule(s) can be calculated as the difference between the quantity of photons that were emitted by the source and the quantity that is measured by the detector. In a diffuse reflectance measurement, the same energy difference measurement is made, but the source and detector are located on the same side of the sample, and the photons that are measured have re-emerged from the illuminated side of the sample rather than passed through it. The energy may be measured at one or multiple wavelengths; when a series of measurements are made, the response curve is called a [[spectrum]]. 

A key element in acquiring spectra is that the radiation must somehow be energy selected – either before or after interacting with the sample. Wavelength selection can be accomplished with a fixed filter, tunable filter, spectrograph, an interferometer, or other devices. For a fixed filter approach, it is not efficient to collect a significant number of wavelengths, and multispectral data are usually collected. Interferometer-based chemical imaging requires that entire spectral ranges be collected, and therefore results in hyperspectral data. Tunable filters have the flexibility to provide either multi- or hyperspectral data, depending on analytical requirements. 

Spectra may be measured one point at a time using a single element detector (single-point mapping), as a line-image using a linear array detector (typically 16 to 28 pixels) (linear array mapping), or as a two-dimensional image using a Focal Plane Array (FPA)(typically 256 to 16,384 pixels) (FPA imaging). For single-point the sample is moved in the x and y directions point-by-point using a computer-controlled stage. With linear array mapping, the sample is moved line-by-line with a computer-controlled stage. FPA imaging data are collected with a two-dimensional FPA detector, hence capturing the full desired field-of-view at one time for each individual wavelength, without having to move the sample. FPA imaging, with its ability to collected tens of thousands of spectra simultaneously is orders of magnitude faster than linear arrays which are can typically collect 16 to 28 spectra simultaneously, which are in turn much faster than single-point mapping.

===Terminology===
Some words common in spectroscopy, optical microscopy and photography have been adapted or their scope modified for their use in chemical imaging. They include: resolution, field of view and magnification. There are two types of resolution in chemical imaging. The spectral resolution refers to the ability to resolve small energy differences; it applies to the spectral axis. The [[Angular resolution|spatial resolution]] is the minimum distance between two objects that is required for them to be detected as distinct objects. The spatial resolution is influenced by the [[field of view]], a physical measure of the size of the area probed by the analysis. In imaging, the field of view is a product of the magnification and the number of pixels in the detector array. The magnification is a ratio of the physical area of the detector array divided by the area of the sample field of view. Higher magnifications for the same detector image a smaller area of the sample.

=== Types of vibrational chemical imaging instruments===
Chemical imaging has been implemented for mid-infrared, near-[[infrared spectroscopy]] and [[Raman spectroscopy]]. As with their bulk spectroscopy counterparts, each imaging technique has particular strengths and weaknesses, and are best suited to fulfill different needs. 

====Mid-infrared chemical imaging====
Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy probes fundamental molecular vibrations, which arise in the spectral range 2,500-25,000 nm.  Commercial imaging implementations in the MIR region typically employ Fourier Transform Infrared ([[FT-IR]]) interferometers and the range is more commonly presented in [[wavenumber]], 4,000 – 400 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The MIR absorption bands tend to be relatively narrow and well-resolved; direct spectral interpretation is often possible by an experienced spectroscopist.  MIR spectroscopy can distinguish subtle changes in chemistry and structure, and is often used for the identification of unknown materials. The absorptions in this spectral range are relatively strong; for this reason, sample presentation is important to limit the amount of material interacting with the incoming radiation in the MIR region. Most data collected in this range is collected in transmission mode through thin sections (~10 micrometres) of material. Water is a very strong absorber of MIR radiation and wet samples often require advanced sampling procedures (such as [[attenuated total reflectance]]). Commercial instruments include point and line mapping, and imaging.  All employ an FT-IR interferometer as wavelength selective element and light source. 

[[Image:FIRST measurement of SF6 and NH3.jpg|thumb||300px|Remote chemical imaging of a simultaneous release of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at 1.5km using the FIRST imaging spectrometer&lt;ref&gt;M.

Legault, High-Performance Field-Portable Imaging Radiometric Spectrometer Technology For Hyperspectral imaging Applications, Proc. SPIE 5994, 59940N, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]]For types of MIR microscope, see [[Microscopy#Infrared microscopy]].

[[Infrared window|Atmospheric windows]] in the infrared spectrum are also employed to perform chemical imaging remotely.  In these spectral regions the atmospheric gases (mainly water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) present low absorption and allow infrared viewing over kilometer distances.  Target molecules can then be viewed using the selective absorption/emission processes described above.  An example of the chemical imaging of a simultaneous release of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is shown in the image.

====Near-infrared chemical imaging====
The analytical near infrared (NIR) region spans the range from approximately 700-2,500 nm. The absorption bands seen in this spectral range arise from overtones and combination bands of O-H, N-H, C-H and S-H stretching and bending vibrations. Absorption is one to two orders of magnitude smaller in the NIR compared to the MIR; this phenomenon eliminates the need for extensive sample preparation.  Thick and thin samples can be analyzed without any sample preparation, it is possible to acquire NIR chemical images through some packaging materials, and the technique can be used to examine hydrated samples, within limits. Intact samples can be imaged in transmittance or diffuse reflectance. 

The lineshapes for overtone and combination bands tend to be much broader and more overlapped than for the fundamental bands seen in the MIR. Often, multivariate methods are used to separate spectral signatures of sample components.  NIR chemical imaging is particularly useful for performing rapid, reproducible and non-destructive analyses of known materials&lt;ref&gt;Novel Techniques for Microspectroscopy and Chemical Imaging Analysis of Soybean Seeds and Embryos.(2002).  Baianu, I.C., Costescu, D.M., and You, T. ''Soy2002 Conference'', Urbana, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Near Infrared Microspectroscopy, Chemical Imaging and NMR Analysis of Oil in Developing and Mutagenized Soybean Embryos in Culture. (2003). Baianu, I.C., Costescu, D.M., Hofmann, N., and Korban, S.S.  ''AOCS Meeting, Analytical Division''.&lt;/ref&gt;.  NIR imaging instruments are typically based on one of two platforms: imaging using a tunable filter and broad band illumination, and line mapping employing an FT-IR interferometer as the wavelength filter and light source.

====Raman chemical imaging====
The Raman shift chemical imaging spectral range spans from approximately 50 to 4,000 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; the actual spectral range over which a particular Raman measurement is made is a function of the laser excitation frequency. The basic principle behind [[Raman spectroscopy]] differs from the MIR and NIR in that the x-axis of the Raman spectrum is measured as a function of energy shift (in cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) relative to the frequency of the laser used as the source of radiation. Briefly, the Raman spectrum arises from inelastic scattering of incident photons, which requires a change in polarizability with vibration, as opposed to infrared absorption, which requires a change in dipole moment with vibration. The end result is spectral information that is similar and in many cases complementary to the MIR. The Raman effect is weak - only about one in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; photons incident to the sample undergoes Raman scattering. Both organic and inorganic materials possess a Raman spectrum; they generally produce sharp bands that are chemically specific. [[Fluorescence]] is a competing phenomenon and, depending on the sample, can overwhelm the Raman signal, for both bulk spectroscopy and imaging implementations.

Raman chemical imaging requires little or no sample preparation. However, physical sample sectioning may be used to expose the surface of interest, with care taken to obtain a surface that is as flat as possible. The conditions required for a particular measurement dictate the level of invasiveness of the technique, and samples that are sensitive to high power laser radiation may be damaged during analysis. It is relatively insensitive to the presence of water in the sample and is therefore useful for imaging samples that contain water such as biological material.

===Fluorescence imaging (visible and NIR)===
This [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] microspectroscopy mode is the most sensitive
in both visible and FT-NIR microspectroscopy, and has therefore numerous biomedical, biotechnological and agricultural applications. There are several powerful, highly specific and sensitive fluorescence techniques that are currently in use, or still being developed; among the former are FLIM, FRAP, FRET and FLIM-FRET; among the latter are
NIR fluorescence and probe-sensitivity enhanced NIR fluorescence microspectroscopy and nanospectroscopy techniques (see &quot;Further reading&quot; section).

==Sampling and samples==
The value of imaging lies in the ability to resolve spatial heterogeneities in solid-state or gel/gel-like samples. Imaging a liquid or even a suspension has limited use as constant sample motion serves to average spatial information, unless ultra-fast recording techniques are employed as in fluorescence correlation microspectroscopy or FLIM obsevations where a single molecule may be monitored at extremely high (photon) detection speed. High-throughput experiments (such as imaging multi-well plates) of liquid samples can however provide valuable information. In this case, the parallel acquisition of thousands of spectra can be used to compare differences between samples, rather than the more common implementation of exploring spatial heterogeneity within a single sample.  

Similarly, there is no benefit in imaging a truly homogeneous sample, as a single point spectrometer will generate the same spectral information.  Of course the definition of homogeneity is dependent on the spatial resolution of the imaging system employed.  For MIR imaging, where wavelengths span from 3-10 micrometres, objects on the order of 5 micrometres may theoretically be resolved. The sampled areas are limited by current experimental implementations because illumination is provided by the interferometer. Raman imaging may be able to resolve particles less than 1 micrometre in size, but the sample area that can be illuminated is severely limited. With Raman imaging, it is considered impractical to image large areas and, consequently, large samples. FT-NIR chemical/hyperspectral imaging usually resolves only larger objects (&gt;10 micrometres), and is better suited for large samples because illumination sources are readily available. However, FT-NIR microspectroscopy was recently reported to be capable of about 1.2 micron (micrometer) resolution in biological samples&lt;ref&gt;Near Infrared Microspectroscopy, Fluorescence Microspectroscopy,Infrared Chemical Imaging and High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analysis of Soybean  Seeds, Somatic Embryos and Single Cells., Baianu, I.C. et al. 2004., In ''Oil Extraction and Analysis.'', D. Luthria, Editor pp.241-273, AOCS Press., Champaign, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, two-photon excitation FCS experiments were reported to have attained 15 nanometer resolution on biomembrane thin films with a special coincidence photon-counting setup. 

===Detection limit===
The concept of the detection limit for chemical imaging is quite different than for bulk spectroscopy, as it depends on the sample itself. Because a bulk spectrum represents an average of the materials present, the spectral signatures of trace components are simply overwhelmed by dilution. In imaging however, each pixel has a corresponding spectrum. If the physical size of the trace contaminant is on the order of the pixel size imaged on the sample, its spectral signature will likely be detectable. If however, the trace component is dispersed homogeneously (relative to pixel image size) throughout a sample, it will not be detectable.  Therefore, detection limits of chemical imaging techniques are strongly influenced by particle size, the chemical and spatial heterogeneity of the sample, and the spatial resolution of the image.

===Data analysis===
Data analysis methods for chemical imaging data sets typically employ mathematical algorithms common to single point spectroscopy or to image analysis.  The reasoning is that the spectrum acquired by each detector is equivalent to a single point spectrum; therefore pre-processing, [[chemometrics]] and pattern recognition techniques are utilized with the similar goal to separate chemical and physical effects and perform a qualitative or quantitative characterization of individual sample components. In the spatial dimension, each chemical image is equivalent to a digital image and standard image analysis and robust statistical analysis can be used for feature extraction.

==Mechanism==
In a CI experiment, ions are produced through the collision of the analyte with ions of a reagent gas that are present in the [[ion source]].  Some common reagent gases include:  [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[isobutane]].  Inside the ion source, the reagent gas is present in large excess compared to the analyte.  Electrons entering the source will preferentially ionize the reagent gas.  The resultant collisions with other reagent gas molecules will create an ionization [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].  Positive and negative ions of the analyte are formed by reactions with this plasma.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPA&quot; /&gt;

Self chemical ionization occurs when the reagent ion is an ionized form of the analyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ac00226a011 | title = Chemical ionization in Fourier transform mass spectrometry | year = 1981 | author = Sahba.

===Negative chemical ionization (NCI)===
Chemical ionization for gas phase analysis is either positive or negative. Almost all neutral analytes can form positive ions through the reactions described above.

In order to see a response by negative chemical ionization, the analyte must be capable of producing a negative ion (stabilize a negative charge) for example by [[electron capture ionization]].  Because not all analytes can do this, using NCI provides a certain degree of selectivity that is not available with other, more universal ionization techniques (EI, PCI).  NCI can be used for the analysis of compounds containing acidic groups or electronegative elements (especially halogens).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=de Hoffmann|first=Edmond|coauthors=Vincent Stroobant|title=Mass Spectrometry:  Principles and Applications|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=Toronto|date=2003|edition=Second| isbn = 0471485667|page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the high electronegativity of [[halogen]] atoms, NCI is a common choice for their analysis.  This includes many groups of compounds, such as [[polychlorinated biphenyls|PCBs]]&lt;ref name=&quot;J3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kontsas|first=Helena|coauthors=Kaija Pekari|date=2003-07-05|title=Determination of polychlorinated biphenyls in serum using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization for exposure estimation|journal=Journal of Chromatography B|publisher=Elsevier, Ltd.|volume=791|issue=1-2|pages=117–125|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6X0P-48B5FR8-D&amp;_user=1069125&amp;_coverDate=07%2F05%2F2003&amp;_alid=759548054&amp;_rdoc=3&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=7220&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=8&amp;_acct=C000051259&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1069125&amp;md5=a1aa7b8733e3fe4a2e0cb1bc49509fc0|accessdate=2008-06-26|doi=10.1016/S1570-0232(03)00216-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[pesticides]]&lt;ref name=&quot;J2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rivera-Rodríguez|first=Laura B. |coauthors=Ricardo Rodríguez-Estrella, James Jackson Ellington and John J.

===Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)===
Chemical ionization in an atmospheric pressure electric discharge is called [[atmospheric pressure chemical ionization]]. The analyte is a gas or liquid spray and ionization is accomplished using an atmospheric pressure corona discharge. This ionization method is often coupled with [[high performance liquid chromatography]] where the mobile phase containing eluting analyte sprayed with high flow rates of nitrogen and the aerosol spray is subjected to a corona discharge to create ions.

 apt-get install sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin
: When installator finish downloading it'll display the licence, just scroll it down to the end of it and agree typing &quot;yes&quot;.&lt;br&gt;


== Installation from package ==
:1. If you don't want to install Java from repositories. then:&lt;br&gt;
::a. Download &quot;self-extracting file&quot; from: [http://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp?locale=pl&amp;host=www.java.com java.com].&lt;br&gt;
::b. Move the package to: &quot;/usr/lib/jvm&quot; folder.&lt;br&gt;
::c. Go to &quot;/usr/lib/jvm&quot; folder using Terminal as root:&lt;br&gt;
 cd /usr/lib/jvm
::d. Check is the package there:&lt;br&gt;
 ls
::e. Install it typing &quot;yes&quot; on the end of the licence:&lt;br&gt;
 sh jre-version-linux-i586.bin
::f. Create Java plug-in symbolic link to web browser plug-in folder:&lt;br&gt;
 cd /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
 ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-version/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
::g. You can make symbolic link using Midnight Commander, just mark &quot;libjavaplugin_oji.so&quot; and then choose&lt;br&gt;
:: File tab-&gt; SymLink to &quot;/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins&quot; folder. 
[[File:Java1en.png|center|550px]]


== OpenJava ==
: Open source Java version installation:&lt;br&gt;
 apt-get install openjdk-6-jre openjdk-6-jre-headless openjdk-6-jre-lib
: and it's web browser plug-in:&lt;br&gt;
 apt-get install icedtea6-plugin


== Verification ==
: After installation you can check is your Java installed correctly or is the latest version: [http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp java.com]

In [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), the '''chemical shift''' describes the dependence of nuclear magnetic energy levels on the electronic environment in a [[molecule]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spectrometric Identification of organic Compounds'' Silverstein, Bassler, Morrill 4th Ed. ISBN 047109700&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Spectroscopy'' William Kemp 3th Ed. ISBN 0333417674 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Basic &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H - &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR spectroscopy'' Metin Balei ISBN 0444518118&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical shifts are relevant in [[NMR spectroscopy]] techniques such  [[proton NMR]] and [[carbon-13 NMR]].
 
An atomic nucleus can have a magnetic moment ([[nuclear spin]]), which gives rise to different energy levels and [[resonance]] frequencies in a [[magnetic field]]. The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (note that electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of the same type of nucleus (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, ...), and with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus. This is reflected in the spin energy levels (and resonance frequencies). The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of the same kind of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the chemical shift. The size of the chemical shift is given with respect to a reference frequency or reference sample (see also ''chemical shift referencing''), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.
 
The chemical shift is of great importance for [[NMR spectroscopy]], a technique to explore molecular properties by looking at [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] phenomena.


==Operating frequency==
The operating frequency [[Omega|ω]] of a magnet is calculated from the [[Larmor equation]]
 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_{0} = \gamma * B_0\,&lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt; is the actual strength of the magnet in units like [[tesla (unit)|teslas]] or [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]], and [[Gamma|γ]] is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the nucleus being tested which is in turn calculated from its [[magnetic moment]] [[Mu|μ]] and [[spin number]] I with the [[nuclear magneton]] μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[Planck constant]] h:
 
: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{\mu\,\mu_N}{hI}\,&lt;/math&gt; 
 
Thus, the proton operating frequency for a 7 [[Tesla|T]] magnet is calculated as:
 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega_{0} = \frac{2.79*5.050\,10^{-27}\,J/T}{6.62\,10^{-34}\,J\cdot s*1/2}*7\,T*10^{-6}\, = 297 MHz\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Chemical shift referencing==
Chemical shift [[Delta (letter)|δ]] is usually expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm) by [[frequency]], because it is calculated from: 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{\mbox{difference in precession frequency between two nuclei}}{\mbox{operating frequency of the magnet}}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Since the numerator is usually in [[hertz]], and the denominator in [[megahertz]], delta is expressed in ppm. 
 
The detected frequencies (in Hz) for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si nuclei are usually referenced against TMS ([[tetramethylsilane]]), which is assigned the chemical shift of zero.  Other standard materials are used for setting the chemical shift for other nuclei.
 
Thus, an NMR signal at 300 Hz from TMS at an applied frequency of 300MHz has a chemical shift of:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{300Hz}{300*10^6Hz}=1*10^{-6}= 1\,ppm \,&lt;/math&gt;
 
Although the frequency depends on the applied field the chemical shift is independent of it. On the other hand the resolution of NMR will increase with applied magnetic field resulting in ever increasing chemical shift changes.

==The induced magnetic field==
The electrons around a nucleus will circulate in a magnetic field and create a secondary induced magnetic field. This field opposes the applied field as stipulated by [[Lenz's law]] and the nucleus is therefore said to be '''shielded'''. Trends in chemical shift are explained based on the degree of shielding or deshielding.
   
Nuclei are found to resonate in a wide range to the left (or more rare to the right) of the internal standard. When a signal is found with a higher chemical shift:
* the applied effective magnetic field is lower, if the resonance frequency is fixed, (as in old traditional CW spectrometers)
* the frequency is higher, when the applied magnetic field is static, (normal case in FT spectrometers)
* the nucleus is more deshielded
* the signal or shift is '''downfield''' or at '''low field''' or paramagnetic
 
Conversely a lower chemical shift is called a '''diamagnetic shift''', and is '''upfield''' and more shielded.

==Factors causing chemical shifts==
Important factors influencing chemical shift are electron density, [[electronegativity]] of neighboring groups and anisotropic induced magnetic field effects. 

Electron density shields a nucleus from the external field. For example in proton NMR the electron-poor [[tropylium]] ion has its protons downfield at 9.17 ppm, those of the electron-rich [[cyclooctatetraenyl]] anion move upfield to 6.75 ppm and its dianion even more upfield to 5.56 ppm.

A nucleus in the vicinity of an [[electronegative]] atom experiences reduced electron density and the nucleus is therefore deshielded. In [[proton NMR]] of [[alkyl halide|methyl halides]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;X) the chemical shift of the methyl protons increase in the order I &gt; Br &gt; Cl &gt; F from 2.16 ppm to 4.26 ppm reflecting this trend. In [[carbon NMR]] the chemical shift of the carbon nuclei increase in the same order from around -10 ppm to 70 ppm. Also when the electronegative atom is removed further away the effect diminishes until it can be observed no longer.  
 
[[Anisotropic]] induced magnetic field effects are the result of a local induced magnetic field experienced by a nucleus resulting from circulating electrons that can either be paramagnetic when it is parallel to the applied field or diamagnetic when it is opposed to it. It is observed in [[alkene]]s where the double bond is oriented perpendicular to the external field with pi electrons likewise circulating at right angles. The induced magnetic field lines are parallel to the external field at the location of the alkene protons which therefore shift downfield to a 4.5 ppm - 7.5 ppm range. The three-dimensional space where a nucleus experiences diamagnetic shift is called the shielding zone with a cone-like shape aligned with the external field.   

:[[Image:NMR alkenes.png|400px|Induced magnetic field of alkenes in external magnetic fields, field lines in grey]]

The protons in [[aromatic]] compounds are shifted downfield even further with a signal for [[benzene]] at 7.73 ppm as a consequence of a [[diamagnetic ring current]]. 

[[Alkyne]] protons by contrast resonate at high field in a 2-3 ppm range. For alkynes the most effective orientation in the external field in parallel with electrons circulation around the triple bond. In this way the acetylenic protons are located in the cone-shaped shielding zone hence the upfield shift.

==Magnetic properties of most common nuclei==
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C aren't the only nuclei susceptible to NMR experiments. A number of different nuclei can also be detected, although the use of such techniques is generally rare due to small relative sensitivities in NMR experiments (compared to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) of the nuclei in question, the other factor for rare use being their slender representation in nature/organic compounds.

CIDNP (Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization), often pronounced like &quot;kidnap&quot;, is a non-Boltzmann nuclear spin state distribution produced in thermal or photochemical reactions, usually from colligation and diffusion, or disproportionation of radical pairs, and detected by NMR spectroscopy as enhanced absorption or emission signals. CIDNP was discovered in 1967 by Bargon and Fischer, and, independently, by Ward and Lawler. Early theories were based on dynamic nuclear polarisation (hence the name). The subsequent experiments, however, have found that in many cases DNP fails to explain CIDNP polarization phase. In 1969 an alternative explanation was proposed by Closs, and, independently, by Kaptein and Oosterhoff, which relied on the ability of nuclear spin interactions to alter the recombination probability in reactions that proceed through radical pairs. This mechanism, known as the Radical Pair Mechanism is currently accepted as the most common cause of CIDNP. There are, however, exceptions, and the DNP mechanism was found to be operational, for example, in many fluorine-containing radicals.

==Radical Pair Mechanism==

The generation of CIDNP in a typical photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and approximately half of the molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.



The radical pair may either cross over to a singlet electron state and then recombine, or separate and perish in side reactions. The relative probability of these two pathways for a given radical pair depends on the nuclear spin state and leads to the nuclear spin state sorting and observable nuclear polarization.

==Applications==

Detected as enhanced absorptive or emissive signals in the NMR spectra of the reaction products, CIDNP has been exploited for the last 30 years to characterise transient free radicals and their reaction mechanisms. In certain cases, CIDNP also offers the possibility of large improvements in NMR sensitivity. The principal application of this '''photo-CIDNP technique''', as devised by Kaptein in 1978, has been to proteins in which the aromatic amino acid residues histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine can be polarized using flavins or other aza-aromatics as photosensitisers. The key feature of the method is that only solvent accessible histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues can undergo the radical pair reactions that result in nuclear polarization. Photo-CIDNP has thus been used to probe the surface structure of proteins, both in native and partially folded states, and their interactions with molecules that modify the accessibility of the reactive side chains.

Although usually observed in liquids, the photo-CIDNP effect has also been detected in solid state, for example on &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N nuclei in photosynthetic reaction centres, where significant nuclear polarization can accumulate as a result of spin selection processes in the electron transfer reactions.

'''Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy''', also called Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy (CARS), is a form of [[spectroscopy]] used primarily in [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and related fields. It is sensitive to the same vibrational signatures of molecules as seen in [[Raman spectroscopy]], typically the nuclear vibrations of chemical bonds. Unlike Raman spectroscopy, CARS employs multiple photons to address the molecular vibrations, and produces a signal in which the emitted waves are coherent with one another. As a result, CARS is orders of magnitude stronger than spontaneous Raman emission. CARS is a third-order [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] process involving three [[laser]] beams: a pump beam of frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, a [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] beam of frequency 
ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and a probe beam at frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;. These beams interact with the sample and generate a coherent optical signal at the [[anti-Stokes]] frequency (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;+ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter is resonantly enhanced when the frequency difference between the pump and the Stokes beams (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) coincides with the frequency of a [[Raman resonance]], which is the basis of the technique's intrinsic [[vibrational contrast mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;A Review of the Theory and Application of Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sas/sas/1977/00000031/00000004/art00001 Applied Spectroscopy, Volume 31, Number 4, July/August 1977, pp. 253-271(19)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering: from
proof-of-the-principle experiments to femtosecond CARS and higher order wave-mixing generalizations [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/73500427/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 Journal of Raman Spectroscopy, Volume 31, Issue 8-9 , pp. 653 - 667]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The acronym CARS, which invokes a seemingly inadvertent relation to automobiles, is actually closely related to the birth story of the technique. In 1965, a paper was published by two researchers of the Scientific Laboratory at the [[Ford Motor Company]], P. D. Maker and R. W. Terhune, in which the CARS phenomenon was reported for the first time.&lt;ref&gt; Study of Optical Effects Due to an Induced Polarization Third Order in the Electric Field Strength [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v137/i3A/pA801_1 Physical Review, Volume 137, Issue 3A, pp. 801-818]&lt;/ref&gt;  Maker and Terhune used a pulsed ruby laser to investigate the third order response of several materials. They first passed the ruby beam of frequency ω through a [[Raman shifter]] to create a second beam at ω-ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, and then directed the two beams simultaneously onto the sample. When the pulses from both beams overlapped in space and time, the Ford researchers observed a signal at ω+ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the blue-shifted CARS signal. They also demonstrated that the signal increases significantly when the difference frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; between the incident beams matches a Raman frequency of sample. Maker and Terhune called their technique simply 'three wave mixing experiments'. The name coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy was assigned almost ten years later, by Begley et al. at Stanford University in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=APPLAB000025000007000387000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes Applied Physics Letters, Volume 25, Issue 7 , pp. 387-390]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this vibrationally sensitive nonlinear optical technique is commonly known as CARS.

==Principle==
[[Image:CARS diagram.png|thumb|right|250 px|CARS energy diagram]]
The CARS process can be physically explained by using either a classical [[Harmonic oscillator|oscillator]] model or by using a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model that incorporates the energy levels of the molecule. Classically, the Raman active vibrator is modeled as a (damped) [[harmonic oscillator]] with a characteristic frequency of ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;. In CARS, this oscillator is not driven by a single optical wave, but by the difference frequency (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) between the pump and the Stokes beams instead. This driving mechanism is similar to hearing the low combination tone when striking two different high tone piano keys: your ear is sensitive to the difference frequency of the high tones. Similarly, the Raman oscillator is susceptible to the difference frequency of two optical waves. When the difference frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; approaches ω&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, the oscillator is driven very efficiently. On a molecular level, this implies that the electron cloud surrounding the chemical bond is vigorously oscillating with the frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. These electron motions alter the optical properties of the sample, i.e. there is a periodic modulation of the [[refractive index]] of the material. This periodic modulation can be probed by a third laser beam, the probe beam. When the probe beam is propagating through the periodically altered medium, it acquires the same modulation. Part of the probe, originally at ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt; will now get modified to ω&lt;sub&gt;pr&lt;/sub&gt;+ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-ω&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the observed anti-Stokes emission. Under certain beam geometries, the anti-Stokes emission may diffract away from the probe beam, and can be detected in a separate direction.

While intuitive, this classical picture does not take into account the quantum mechanical energy levels of the molecule. Quantum mechanically, the CARS process can be  understood as follows. Our molecule is initially in the [[Stationary state|ground state]], the lowest energy state of the molecule. The pump beam excites the molecule to a [[Virtual State (physics)|Virtual State]]. A [[virtual state]] is not an [[eigenstate]] of the molecule and it can not be occupied but it does allow for transitions between otherwise uncoupled real states. If a Stokes beam is simultaneously present along with the pump, the [[virtual state]] can be used as an instantaneous gateway to address a vibrational eigenstate of the molecule. The joint action of the pump and the Stokes has effectively established a coupling between the ground state and the vibrationally excited state of the molecule. The molecule is now in two states at the same time: it resides in a coherent [[superposition]] of states. This coherence between the states can be probed by the probe beam, which promotes the system to a virtual state. Again, the molecule cannot stay in the virtual state and will fall back instantaneously to the ground state under the emission of a photon at the anti-Stokes frequency. The molecule is no longer in a superposition, as it resides again in one state, the ground state. In the quantum mechanical model, no energy is deposited in the molecule during the CARS process. Instead, the molecule acts like a medium for converting the frequencies of the three incoming waves into a CARS signal (a parametric process). There are, however, related coherent Raman process that occur simultaneously which do deposit energy into the molecule.

==Comparison to Raman spectroscopy==
CARS is often compared to Raman spectroscopy as both techniques probe the same Raman active modes. Raman can be done using a single continuous wave (CW) laser whereas CARS requires (generally) two pulsed laser sources. The Raman signal is detected on the red side of the incoming radiation where it might have to compete with other fluorescent processes. The CARS signal is detected on the blue side, which is free from fluorescence, but it comes with a non-resonant contribution. 
The differences between the signals from Raman and CARS (there are many variants of both techniques) stems largely from the fact that Raman relies on a spontaneous transition whereas CARS relies on a coherently driven transition. The total Raman signal collected from a sample is the incoherent addition of the signal from individual molecules. It is therefore linear in the concentration of those molecules and the signal is emitted in all directions. The total CARS signal comes from a coherent addition of the signal from individual molecules. For the coherent addition to be additive, phase-matching must be fulfilled. For tight focusing conditions this is generally not a restriction. Once phase-matching is fulfilled the signal amplitude grows linear with distance so that the power grows quadratically. This signal forms a collimated beam that is therefore easily collected. The fact that the CARS signal is quadratic in the distance makes it quadratic with respect to the concentration and therefore especially sensitive to the majority constituent. The total CARS signal also contains an inherent non-resonant background. This non-resonant signal can be considered as the result of (several) far off-resonance transitions that also add coherently. The resonant amplitude contains a phase shift of Pi over the resonance whereas the non-resonant part does not. The spectral line shape of the CARS intensity therefore resembles a Fano-profile which is shifted with respect to the Raman signal. To compare the spectra from multi-component compounds, the (resonant) CARS spectral amplitude should be compared to the Raman spectral intensity. 

Theoretically Raman spectroscopy and CARS spectroscopy are equally sensitive as they use the same molecular transitions. However, given the limits on input power (damage threshold) and detector noise (integration time), the signal from a single transition can be collected much faster in practical situation (a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) using CARS. Imaging of known substances (known spectra) is therefore often done using CARS. 
Given the fact that CARS is a higher order nonlinear process, the CARS signal from a single molecule is larger than the Raman signal from a single molecule for a sufficiently high driving intensity. However at very low concentrations, the advantages of the coherent addition for CARS signal reduces and the presence of the incoherent background becomes an increasing problem. 

Since CARS is such a nonlinear process there are not really any 'typical' experimental numbers. One example is given below under the explicit warning that just changing the pulse duration by one order of magnitude changes the CARS signal by three orders of magnitude. The comparison should only be used as an indication of the order of magnitude of the signals. 200 mW average power input (CW for the Raman), in a 0.9NA objective with a center wavelength around 800&amp;nbsp;nm, constitutes a power density of 26 MW/cm,&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (focal length = 1.5 micrometre, focal volume = 1.16 micrometre&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, photon energy = 2.31 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; J or 1.44 eV). The Raman cross section for the vibration of the aromatic ring in Toluene around 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;-29&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/molecule*steradian. Therefore the Raman signal is around 26 10&lt;sup&gt;-22&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule*steradian or 3.3 10&lt;sup&gt;-21&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule (over 4Pi). That is 0.014 photon/sec*molecule. The density of Toluene = 0.8668 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Molecular mass = 92.14 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; kg/mol. Therefore the focal volume (~1 cubic micrometre) contains 6 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; molecules. Those molecules together generate a Raman signal in the order of 2 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; W (20pW) or roughly one hundred million photons/sec (over a 4Pi solid angle). A CARS experiment with similar parameters (150 mW at 1064&amp;nbsp;nm, 200 mW at 803.5&amp;nbsp;nm, 15ps pulses at 80Mhz repetition frequency, same objective lens) yields roughly 17.5 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; W (on the 3000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; line, which has 1/3 of the strength and roughly 3 times the width). This CARS power is roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; higher than the Raman but since there are 6 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; molecules, the signal per molecule from CARS is only 4 10&lt;sup&gt;-25&lt;/sup&gt; W/molecule*sec or 1.7 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; photons/molecule*sec. If we allow for two factors of three (line strength and line width) than the spontaneous Raman signal per molecule still exceeds the CARS per molecule by a more than two orders of magnitude. The coherent addition of the CARS signal from the molecules however yields a total signal that is much higher than the Raman.

The sensitivity in many CARS experiments is not limited by the detection of CARS photons but rather by the distinction between the resonant and non-resonant part of the CARS signal.

==Applications==

CARS is used for species selective microscopy and combustion diagnostics. The first exploits the selectivity of vibrational spectroscopy whereas the latter is aimed at temperature measurements; the CARS signal is temperature dependent. The strength of the signal scales (non-linearly) with the difference in the ground state population and the vibrationally excited state population. Since the population of states follows the temperature dependent [[Boltzmann Distribution]], the CARS signal carries an intrinsic temperature dependence as well. This temperature dependence makes CARS a popular technique for monitoring the temperature of hot gases and flames.

The '''Collaborative Computing Project for NMR''' (CCPN) is a project that aims to bring together computational aspects of the  scientific community involved in [[NMR spectroscopy]], especially those who work in the field of [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein NMR]]. The general aims are to link new and existing NMR software via a common data standard and provide a forum within the community for the discussion of NMR software and the scientific methods it supports. CCPN was initially started in 1999 in the [[United Kingdom]] but collaborates with NMR and software development groups worldwide.

==The Collaborative Project for the NMR Community==
The Collaborative Computing project for [[NMR spectroscopy]]  was set up in with three main aims; to create a common standard for representing NMR spectroscopy related data, to create a suite of new open-source NMR software packages and to arrange meetings for the NMR community, including conferences, workshops and courses in order to discuss and spread best-practice within the NMR community, for both computational and non-computational aspects. Primary financial support for CCPN comes from the BBSRC; the UK [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]]. CCPN is part of an array of collaborative computing projects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccp.ac.uk/ BBSRC Collaborative Computational Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; (CCP) and follows in a similar vein to the successful and well-established [[Collaborative Computational Project Number 4|CCP4]] project for [[X-ray crystallography]]. CCPN is also supported by [[European Union]] grants, most recently as part of the Extend-NMR project;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extend-nmr.eu The Extend-NMR project]&lt;/ref&gt; which links together several software producing groups from across Europe.

CCPN is governed by an executive committee which draws its members from academics throughout the UK NMR community. This committee is chosen at the CCPN Assembly Meeting where all UK based NMR groups may participate and vote. The day-to-day work of CCPN, including the organisation of meetings and software development, is handled by an informal working group, coordinated by Ernest Laue at the [[University of Cambridge]], which comprises the core group of staff and developers, as well as a growing number of collaborators throughout the world who contribute to coordinated NMR software development.

==NMR Data Standards==
The many different software packages available to the [[NMR spectroscopy]] community have traditionally employed a number of different data [[File format|formats]] and standards to represent computational information. The inception of CCPN was partly to look at this situation and to develop a more unified approach. It was deemed that multiple, informally connected data standards not only made it more difficult for a user to move from one program to the next, but also adversely affected data fidelity, harvesting and database deposition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The CCPN project: an interim report on a data model for the NMR community.&quot; (2002) ''Nat Struct Biol''.  '''9'''(6):416-8&lt;/ref&gt; To this end CCPN has developed a common data standard for NMR, referred to as the CCPN data model, as well as software routines and libraries that allow access, manipulation and storage of the data. The CCPN system works alongside the Bio Mag Res Bank&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/ Bio Mag Res Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to handle archiving NMR database depositions; the CCPN standard is for active data exchange and in-program manipulation.

Although NMR spectroscopy remains at the core of the data standard it naturally expands into other related areas of science that support and complement NMR. These include [[Molecule|molecular]] and [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] description, three-dimensional [[Structural biology|biological structures]], sample preparation, [[workflow]] management and software setup. The CCPN libraries are created using the principles of [[model-driven architecture]] and [[Automatic programming|automatic code generation]]; the CCPN data model provides a specification for the automatic generation of [[Application programming interface|APIs]] in multiple languages. To date CCPN provides APIs to its data model in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] programming languages. Through its collaborations, CCPN continues to link new and existing software via its data standards. To enable interaction with as much external software as possible, CCPN has created a format conversion program. This allows data to enter from outside the CCPN scheme and provides a mechanism to translate between existing data formats. The open-source CcpNmr FormatConverter software was first released in 2005 and is available for download (from CCPN and [[SourceForge]]) but is also recently accessible as a [[web application]].

==CCPN Software Suite==
[[Image:CCPN Hncoca.png|thumb|right|150px|Three dimensional protein [[NMR spectroscopy|NMR spectra]] viewed with CCPN software. The illustrated spectra are from [[HNCOCA experiment|HNcoCA]] and [[HNCA experiment|HNCA]] experiments; used here to assign the sequence of [[amino acid]]s in a [[protein]] chain. ]]

As well as enabling data exchange, CCPN aims to develop software for processing, analysis and interpretation of [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] NMR data. To this end CCPN has created CcpNmr Analysis; a graphical program for spectrum visualisation, assignment and NMR data analysis. Here, the requirement was for a program that used a modern [[graphical user interface]] and could run on many types of computer. It would be supported and maintained by CCPN and would allow modification and extension, including for new NMR techniques. The first version of Analysis was released in 2005 and is now at version 2.1. Analysis is built directly on the CCPN data model and its design is partly inspired by the older ANSIG.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Kraulis, &quot;ANSIG: A Program for the Assignment of Protein 1H 2D NMR spectra by Interactive Graphics&quot; (1989) ''J. Magn. Reson'' 24, pp 627-633&lt;/ref&gt;  and SPARKY&lt;ref&gt;T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; programs, but it has continued to develop from the suggestions, requirements and computational contributions of its user community. Analysis is freely available to academic and non-profit institutions. Commercial users are required to subscribe to CCPN for a moderate fee. CCPN software, including Analysis, is available for download at the CCPN web site&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/ccpn/software/downloads-v2/ CCPN Downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by an active [[Joint Information Systems Committee|JISC]] email discussion group.

==CCPN Meetings==
Through its meetings CCPN provides a forum for the discussion of computational and experimental NMR techniques. The aim is to debate and spread best practice in the determination of macromolecular information, including structure, dynamics and biological chemistry. CCPN continues to arrange annual conferences for the UK NMR community (the current being the ninth) and a series of workshops to discuss and promote data standards. Because it is vital to the success of CCPN as a software project and as a coordinated NMR community, its software developers run courses to teach the use of CCPN software and its development framework. They also arrange visits to NMR groups to introduce the CCPN program suite and to gain an understanding of the requirements of users.

CCPN is especially keen to enable young scientists to contribute to and attend its meetings. Accordingly, wherever possible CCPN tries to keep conference fees at a minimum by using contributions that come from our industrial sponsorship and software subscriptions.

The DRC is characterized by the following paramters, that can be modified: RPq (the corresponding q parameter from the [[Mathieu equation]]), RPa (the corresponding a parameter from the [[Mathieu equation]]), which refer to the voltage applied to the quadrupole rods and the gas flow of the reaction gas.

Ammonia gas is the best solution for the majority of interferences, but it is far for being the perfect gas. Sometimes, for specific [[isotope]]s, other gas must be used for better results or even mathematical correction, if no gas offers a satisfactory advantage.

==Collisional reaction interface (CRI)==

Kalinitchenko, Patent Application under the Patents Cooperation Treaty WO 2004/012223 A1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Wang'&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.varianinc.com/image/vimage/docs/products/spectr/icpms/articles/adv_note_1.pdf |title=Principles and performance of the Collision Reaction Interface for the |accessdate=2009-01-20 |last=Wang |first=XueDong |coauthors=Iouri Kalinitchenko |format=PDF |publisher=Varian }}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the [[Bruker]] ICP-MS  destroying interfering ions. These ions are removed by injecting a collisional gas (He), or a reactive gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or a mixture of the two, directly into the plasma as it flows through the skimmer cone and/or the sampler cone. Supplying the reactive/collisional gas into the tip of the skimmer cone and/or into the tip of the sampler cone induces extra collisions and reactions that destroy polyatomic ions in the passing plasma.

==Axial field technology==
Axial field technology (AFT) is a patented improvement of DRC made by Perkin-Elmer, which consists in two supplementary rods placed in the DRC cell, smaller than normal quadrupole's rods, with the purpose of &quot;pushing&quot; the ions faster to the exit by generating a supplementary electric potential, minimizing the time needed for the gas to be in the DRC and improving analysis speed. The suplimetary potential of the AFT rods does not contribute significantly to the global energy, but drastically improve ion passage time.

==Collision cell technology with kinetic energy discrimination==
[[Thermo Scientific]]'s XSeries2 instrument utilizes a collision/reaction cell for interference removal, consisting of a non-consumable hexapole and chicane ion deflector, which takes the ion beam off-axis and leads to low instrument backgrounds of &lt;0.5 integrated counts per second (icps) at vacant masses such as 5 and 220.  This hexapole is inherently part of the Thermo lens system and is present in the ion path, regardless of the use of the collision cell.  The collision/reaction gas mixtures can be 1% NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in He, 7% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in He and 100% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are reactive gasses and the He is a collisional gas.  The 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; generation cell utilizes kinetic energy discrimination, which employes running the quadrupole bias slightly less negative (more positive) than the hexopole bias. Polyatomic ions generated within the plasma can have larger atomic radii than analyte ions of similar mass, i.e. the interferent NaAr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (mass 63) is larger than the analyte Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (mass 63). Thus, when using a collisional/reactive gas mixture, these larger species undergo more collisions/reactions in the cell, in which they lose increasingly more energy, and are then excluded from the quadrupole mass filter by the kinetic energy barrier.

==Octopole reaction system==
Another implementation of this type of interference removal is an octopole (instead of a quadrupole) collision cell, implemented by [[Agilent]]'s 7500 series. The octopole reaction system (ORS)) uses only helium or hydrogen and the volume of the cell is smaller than that of a DRC. The small molecules of helium and hydrogen collide with the large, unwanted polyatomic ions formed in the plasma and break them up into other ions that can be separated in the quadrupole mass analyser. However, unlike the DRC the OCR system is based only on collision reactions and not on chemical reactions.

'''Collisional excitation''' is a process in which the [[translational energy]] of a collision partner is converted into the [[internal energy]] of a reactant species.

==Astronomy==
In astronomy, collisional excitation gives rise to [[spectral line]]s in the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of [[astronomical object]]s such as [[planetary nebula]]e and [[H II region]]s.

In these objects, most [[atom]]s are [[ionisation|ionised]] by [[photon]]s from hot [[star]]s embedded within the nebular [[gas]], stripping away [[electrons]]. The emitted electrons, (called [[photoelectron]]s), may collide with atoms or ions within the gas, and [[excitation|excite]] them.  When these excited atoms or ions revert to their [[ground state]], they will emit a photon.  The spectral lines formed by these photons are called ''collisionally excited lines'' (often abbreviated to CELs).

CELs are only seen in gases at very low densities (typically less than a few thousand particles per cm³).  At higher densities, the reverse process of '''collisional de-excitation''' suppresses the lines.  Even the hardest [[vacuum]] produced on earth is still too dense for CELs to be observed.  For this reason, when CELs were first observed by [[William Huggins]] in the spectrum of the [[Cat's Eye Nebula]], he did not know what they were, and attributed them to a hypothetical new element called ''Nebulium''.  However, the lines he observed were later found to be emitted by extremely rarefied [[oxygen]].

CELs are very important in the study of gaseous nebulae, because they can be used to determine the density and temperature of the gas.

==Mass spectrometry==
Collisional excitation in [[mass spectrometry]] is the process where an ion collides with an atom or molecule and leads to an increase in the internal energy of the ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=collisional excitation|file=C01159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular ions are [[accelerate]]d to high [[kinetic energy]] and then collide with neutral gas molecules (e.g. [[helium]], [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]). In the collision some of the kinetic energy is converted into [[internal energy]] which results in fragmentation in a process known as [[collision-induced dissociation]].

'''Consolidated Engineering Corporation''' was a chemical instrument manufacturer from 1937 to 1960 when it became a subsidiary of [[Böwe Bell &amp; Howell|Bell and Howell Corp]].

==History==
CEC was founded in 1937 by [[Herbert Hoover, Jr.]] as sole proprietor.  Dr. [[Harold Washburn]] was hired in 1938 as VP for Research, with a mandate to develop instruments applicable to [[petroleum]] prospecting.

Mr. Hoover was trained as a mining engineer and Dr. Washburn had a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Electrical Engineering]].   His thesis Professor was E.O. Lawrence, a [[physicist]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Four physicists from [[California Institute of Technology]] were hired into the Research Dept. in a project to develop a [[mass spectrometer]].  The initial product was the 21-101 Mass Spectrometer delivered in December 1942, installed in early 1943, initial price $12,000, with no options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reminiscences of the early days of mass spectrometry in the petroleum|journal=Organic Mass Spectrometry|year=1986|first=Seymour|last=Meyerson|coauthors=|volume=21|issue=4|pages=197–208|doi= 10.1002/oms.1210210406|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110438931/ABSTRACT|format=|accessdate=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CEC_103C_HRes'&gt; {{Citation| first=Charles | last=Judson| coauthors=| contribution=Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation CEC 100 Series mass Spectrometers| title=American Society for Mass Spectrometry| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=| place=| pages=| date=| year=| id= | contribution-url=http://www.asms.org/portals/0/CEC_103C_HRes.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Consolidated MS.gif|thumb|left|300 px|Consolidated Engineering Corporation Mass Spectrometer, Patent 2341551]]

CEC became a publicly held corporation in 1945, with Mr. Hoover selling all of his stock.  Philip Fogg became President.  The name changed to Consolidated Electrodynamics Corp. in 1955, because some states required that a service engineer for an engineering company be a licensed engineer in that state.  

The mass spectrometer products and other analytical instrument products were separated from other product lines in a “Chemical Instruments” marketing department sometime between 1945 and 1948 with Harold Wiley as Manager for Chemical Instruments. The Chemical Instruments Department became the Analytical and Control Division in about 1959 with Harold Wiley as General Manager.  This name was later changed to the Analytical Instruments Div.    

CEC became a subsidiary of Bell and Howell Corp. in 1960.  In 1968 the CEC Corporation was dissolved and CEC became the Electronics Instrument Group of Bell and Howell. In the mid-1970s the Analytical Instruments Div. of Bell and Howell was sold to the Instrument Div. of duPont.

Over the years, mass spectrometry proved to be a widely used and powerful analytical technique and a variety of laboratory instruments became available from several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grayson, Michael A. |title=Measuring mass: from positive rays to proteins |publisher=Chemical Heritage Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-941901-31-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DuPont abandoned the analytical instruments business in the late 1970s, however, CEC’s mass spectrometer heritage did not end there.

In the mid-1950s, CEC had split off a subsidiary, Consolidated Systems Corporation, to produce custom instruments and systems.  Lawrence G. Hall carried CEC mass spectrometer know-how to CSC and led their team to put the first mass spectrometer in space on a National Aeronautics and Space Administration upper atmosphere research satellite, Explorer 17, in 1963.  Nine more satellites and the Pioneer Venus spacecraft carried CSC magnetic sector and quadrupole mass spectrometer analyzers built for NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Empirical Model of Global Thermospheric Temperature and Composition Based on Data From the Ogo 6 Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer|journal= J.

In 1967, this business became Perkin-Elmer Corporation’s Applied Sciences Division, located in Pomona, CA. ASD mass spectrometers monitored the respiratory function of returning Apollo astronauts and were evaluated in NASA and U.S. Navy test programs for manned atmosphere monitoring.   They were deployed on Skylab (the first U.S. space laboratory),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Skylab experiment M-171, Metabolic Activity: results of the first manned mission|journal=Acta Astronautica|year=1975|first=E.L.|last=Michel|coauthors= J.A.

In the early 1970’s, General Manager Bliss M. Bushman led ASD’s expansion as a manufacturer of mass spectrometer-based submarine atmosphere monitors and commercial products. Their Central Atmosphere Monitoring System, now in its third generation, has been standard equipment on U.S. Navy submarines for over three decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=No More Loose Fillings Or Slow Embalming.

They are deployed in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, steel and oil refining industires, among others.

ASD became Orbital Sciences Corporation’s Sensor Systems Division in 1993 and developed the Major Constituent Analyzer for the International Space Station's atmosphere. SSD was sold again in 2001, becoming Hamilton Sundstrand Space, Land and Sea, Pomona Site, a few months after SSD's MCA began continuous on-orbit operation aboard Space Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=International Space Station (ISS) Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA) On-Orbit Performance|journal=SAE International Journal of Aerospace |year=2009|first= Souzan|last=Maleki Thoresen|coauthors=George Steiner, John Granahan|volume=1|issue=1|pages=33–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pomona Site is updating and expanding the MCA for Orion, NASA’s new manned spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Orion Air Monitor; an Optimized Analyzer for Environmental Control and Life Support|journal=SAE International Journal of Aerospace |year=2009|first= David E.|last= Burchfield|coauthors=William Niu, George Steiner|volume=1|issue=1|pages=201–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Oak Ridge National Laboratories, Pomona Site developed an ion trap mass spectrometer chemical detection system for chemical warfare agents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mass Spectrometer Can Detect Weapons of Mass Destruction|journal=Oak Ridge National Laboratory Review|year=2000|first|last=|coauthors=|volume=33|issue=3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these units are now being deployed on U.S. Army reconnaissance vehicles.   When fitted for bio-aerosol sampling, CBMS II has also demonstrated effective biological warfare agent detection.

To this day, Hamilton Sundstrand Pomona Site continues the heritage of CEC, the company that pioneered the development and sale of mass spectrometers for chemical analysis.

'''Correlation spectroscopy''' (COSY) is one of several types of two-dimensional [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy.  Other types of two-dimensional NMR include '''J-spectroscopy''', '''exchange spectroscopy''' (EXSY), and [[Nuclear Overhauser effect]] spectroscopy (NOESY).  Two-dimensional NMR spectra provide more information about a molecule than one-dimensional NMR spectra and are especially useful in determining the structure of a [[molecule]], particularly for molecules that are too complicated to work with using one-dimensional NMR.  The first two-dimensional experiment, '''COSY''', was proposed by Jean Jeener, a professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, in 1971.  This experiment was later implemented by Walter P. Aue, Enrico Bartholdi and [[Richard R. Ernst]], who published their work in 1976.&lt;!-- {{ref|2D_NMR}} --&gt;

== Principles ==
A two-dimensional NMR experiment involves a series of one-dimensional experiments.  Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them.  It is the timing, frequencies, and intensities of these pulses that distinguish different NMR experiments from one another.  During some of the delays, the nuclear spins are allowed to freely precess (rotate) for a determined length of time known as the '''evolution time'''.  The frequencies of the nuclei are detected after the final pulse.  By incrementing the evolution time in successive experiments, a two-dimensional data set is generated from a series of one-dimensional experiments.&lt;!-- {{ref|2D_NMR_time_incrementation}} --&gt;

An example of a two-dimension NMR experiment is the homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY) sequence, which consists of a pulse (p1) followed by an evolution time (t1) followed by a second pulse (p2) followed by a measurement time (t2).  A computer is used to compile the spectra as a function of the evolution time (t1).  Finally, the [[Fourier transform]] is used to convert the time-dependent signals into a two-dimensional spectrum.

The two-dimensional spectrum that results from the COSY experiment shows the frequencies for a single [[isotope]] (usually hydrogen, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) along both axes.  (Techniques have also been devised for generating heteronuclear correlation spectra, in which the two axes correspond to different isotopes, such as &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.)  The intensities of the peaks in the spectrum can be represented using a third dimension.  More commonly, intensity is indicated using contours or different colors.  The spectrum is interpreted starting from the diagonal, which consists of a series of peaks.  The peaks that appear off of the diagonal are called cross-peaks.  The cross-peaks are symmetrical (both above and below) along the diagonal and indicate which hydrogen atoms are spin-spin coupled to each other.  One can determine which atoms are connected to one another by only a few chemical bonds by matching the center of a cross-peak with the center of each of two corresponding diagonal peaks.   The peaks on the diagonal when matched with cross-peaks are coupled to each other.

For example:  a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule [[2-butanone]] would show three peaks on the diagonal, due to the three distinct hydrogen groups.  By drawing a line straight down from a cross-peak to the point on the diagonal directly above or below it, and then drawing a line from the cross-peak directly across to another peak on the diagonal, one can determine which peaks are coupled.  This is done in such a way that the lines from the cross-peak form a 90° angle between the two peaks on the diagonal. The matching peaks, as determined by using the cross-peaks, indicate which hydrogens are coupled, giving a clearer understanding of the structure of the molecule under examination.

[[Image:progesteroneCOSY.png|300px|right|thumb|2D [[proton]]-COSY experiment on Progesterone]] 

To the right is an example of a COSY NMR spectrum of [[progesterone]] in DMSO-d6.  The spectrum that appears along both the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axes is a regular one dimensional &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;H NMR spectrum.  The COSY is read along the diagonal - where the bulk of the peaks appear.  Cross-peaks appear symmetrically above and below the diagonal.

== COSY NMR ==
COSY-90 is the most common COSY experiment.  In COSY-90, the sample is irradiated with a radio frequency pulse, p1, which tilts the nuclear spin by 90°. After p1, the sample is allowed to freely precess during an evolution period (t1). A second 90° pulse, p2, is then applied, after which the experimental data are acquired. This is done repeatedly using a series of different evolution periods (t1). At the conclusion of data acquisition the data is Fourier transformed in each dimension to generate the two dimensional spectrum. It is only because the evolution period is varied that cross-peaks appear in the spectrum.

[[Image:Pulsefrequency1.png|400px|right|thumb|In COSY NMR, the resonance signal from the sample is read in period t2 following two experimental magnetic pulses p1 and p2 separated by a variable period t1.]]

Cross-peaks result from a phenomenon called '''magnetization transfer'''. Depending on the experiment, this transfer can be achieved through space or bonds, or even through chemical or physical means.  In COSY, magnetization transfer occurs through the bonds.  

Another member of the COSY family is '''COSY-45'''.  In COSY-45 a 45° pulse is used instead of a 90° pulse for the first pulse, p1.  The advantage of a COSY-45 is that the diagonal-peaks are less pronounced, making it simpler to match cross-peaks near the diagonal in a large molecule.  Additionally, the relative signs of the coupling constants can be elucidated from a COSY-45 spectrum.  This is not possible using COSY-90.{{ref|COSY45_vs_COSY90}}  Overall, the COSY-45 offers a cleaner spectrum while the COSY-90 is more sensitive.  Related COSY techniques include double quantum filtered COSY and multiple quantum filtered COSY.

COSY NMR has useful applications.  Organic chemists often use COSY to elucidate structural data on molecules that are not satisfactorily represented in a one-dimensional NMR spectrum.  Using cross-peaks, along with the diagonal spectrum, one can often discover much about the structure of an unknown molecule.

== NOESY ==
In NOESY, the [[Nuclear Overhauser effect]] (NOE) between nuclear spins is used to establish the correlations.
Hence the cross-peaks in the resulting two-dimensional spectrum connect resonances from spins that are spatially close.  NOESY spectra from large biomolecules can often be assigned using [[Sequential Walking]].

The NOESY experiment can also be performed in a one-dimensional fashion by pre-selecting individual resonances. The spectra are read with the pre-selected nuclei giving a large, negative signal while neighboring nuclei are identified by weaker, positive signals.   This only reveals which peaks have measurable NOEs to the resonance of interest but obviously takes much less time than the full 2D experiment. In addition, if a pre-selected nucleus changes environment within the time scale of the experiment, multiple negative signals may be observed. This offers exchange information similar to EXSY (i.e. exchange spectroscopy) NMR spectroscopy.

== HMBC &amp; HMQC ==
HMQC (Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence) and HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Coherence) are 2D inverse correlation techniques that allow for the determination of connectivity between two different nuclear species. HMQC is selective for direct coupling and HMBC gives longer range couplings (2-4 bond coupling).

A '''Daly detector''' is a gas phase [[ion]] detector that consists of a metal &quot;doorknob&quot;, a [[scintillator]] ([[phosphor]] screen) and a [[photomultiplier]].&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Daly, [http://link.aip.org/link/?RSINAK/31/264/1 Scintillation Type Mass Spectrometer ion Detector]. ''Rev. Sci. Instr.'' '''3''', ''31'', 264-267 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after its inventor Norman Richard Daly. Daly detectors are typically used in [[mass spectrometer]]s.

==How it works==
Ions that hit the doorknob release secondary electrons. A high voltage (ca. -20,000 V) between the doorknob and the scintillator accelerates the electrons onto the phosphor screen where they are converted to photons. These photons are detected by the [[photomultiplier]].

The advantage of the Daly detector is that the photomultiplier can be separated by a window, which lets the photons through from the high vacuum of the mass spectrometer, which an otherwise possible contamination prevented and which extends detector life span. The Daly detector also allows for a higher acceleration after the field free region of a [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]] flight tube, which can improve the sensitivity for high mass ions.

'''Delayed extraction''' is a method used with a [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]] in which the accelerating voltage is applied after some short time delay following pulsed [[laser desorption/ionization]] from a flat surface of target plate or, in other implementation, pulsed  [[electron ionization]] or [[Resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization]] in some narrow space between two plates of the ion extraction system. The extraction delay can produce time-of-flight compensation for ion energy spread and improve [[mass resolution]].

== Implementation ==
Resolution can be improved in time-of-flight mass spectrometer with ions produced at high vacuum conditions (better than few microTorr) by allowing the initial packet ions to spread in space due to their translational energy before being accelerated into the flight tube. With ions produced by [[electron ionization]] or laser ionization of atoms or molecules from a rarefied gas, this is referred to as &quot;time-lag focusing&quot;&lt;ref name=Wiley1955&gt;{{citation | last = Wiley | first =  W.

M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a conductive surface of target plate, this is referred as  &quot;delayed extraction.&quot;

With delayed extraction, the [[mass resolution]] is improved due to the correlation between velocity and position of the ions after those have been produced in the ion source. Ions produced with greater [[kinetic energy]] have a higher [[velocity]] and during the delay time move closer to the extraction electrode before the accelerating voltage is applied across the target or pulsed electrode. The slower ions with less kinetic energy stay closer to a surface of the target electrode or pulsed electrode when the accelerating voltage is applied and therefore start being accelerated at a greater potential compared to the ions farther from the target electrode. With the proper delay time, the slower ions will receive enough extra potential energy to catch the faster ions after flying some distance from the pulsed acceleration system. Ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will then drift through the flight tube to the detector in the same time.

[[Image:DAPPI.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization schematic]]
'''Desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI)''' is an atmospheric-pressure ionization technique for [[mass spectrometry]]. DAPPI enables direct analysis of solid samples without pretreatment and analysis of samples deposited on surfaces by means of a jet of hot solvent vapour and [[vacuum ultraviolet]] light. The hot jet thermally desorbs the sample from a surface and the vaporized sample is [[ionized]] by the vacuum ultraviolet light and consequently sampled into a mass spectrometer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haapala M, Pól J, Saarela V, Arvola V, Kotiaho T, Ketola RA, Franssila S, Kauppila TJ, Kostiainen R |title=Desorption Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=79 |issue=20 |pages=7867–7872 |year=2007 |doi=10.1021/ac071152g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desorption and ionization mechanisms==
The main desorption mechanism in DAPPI is thermal desorption due to rapid heating of the surface. Therefore DAPPI only works well for surfaces of low thermal conductivity. The ionization mechanism depends on the [[analyte]] and [[solvent]] used and for example the following analyte (M) ions may be formed: [M + H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [M - H]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;+•&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;-•&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Luosujärvi L, Arvola V, Haapala M, Pól J, Saarela V, Franssila S, Kotiaho T, Kostiainen R, Kauppila TJ |title=Desorption and Ionization Mechanisms in Desorption Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=80 |issue=19 |pages=7460–7466 |year=2008 |doi=10.1021/ac801186x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
DAPPI has the potential to analyze both [[chemical polarity|polar]] (e.g. [[verapamil]]) and nonpolar (e.g. [[anthracene]]) compounds. Performance of DAPPI has also been demonstrated on direct analysis of illicit drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kauppila TJ, Arvola V, Haapala M, Pól J, Aalberg L, Saarela V, Franssila S, Kotiaho T, Kostiainen R |title=Direct analysis of illicit drugs by desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization |journal=Rapid Commun.

'''Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)''' is an [[ambient ionization]] technique that can be used in [[mass spectrometry]] for [[chemical analysis]].  It is an [[atmospheric pressure]] [[ion source]] that ionizes gases, liquids and solids in open air under [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] conditions.  It was developed in 2004 by Professor Graham Cooks ''et al.''. from Purdue University and is now available commercially by Prosolia Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Z. Takáts, J.M. Wiseman, B. Gologan, R.G. Cooks|title=Mass Spectrometry Sampling Under Ambient Conditions with Desorption Electrospray Ionization|journal=Science|volume=306|pages=471–473 |year=2004 |doi=10.1126/science.1104404 |pmid=15486296 |issue=5695}}&lt;/ref&gt; DESI is a similar ionization technique to Direct Analysis in Real Time ([[DART ion source|DART]]) in its versatility, applications and analysis time.  It is different in that some sample preparation is required; liquid samples have to be deposited on a desired surface and allowed to dry and gases have to be adsorbed unto a material.

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:DESI ion source.jpg|thumb|right|400 px|Schematic diagram of the DESI ion source]]
DESI is a combination of [[electrospray]] (ESI) and desorption (DI) ionization methods.
Ionization takes place by directing an electrically charged mist to the sample surface that is a few millimeters away.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16237663&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Takáts Z, Wiseman JM, Cooks RG |title=Ambient mass spectrometry using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI): instrumentation, mechanisms and applications in forensics, chemistry, and biology |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1261–75 |year=2005 |pmid=16237663 |doi=10.1002/jms.922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrospray mist is attracted to the surface by applying a voltage on the sample holder.  After ionization, the ions travel through air into the atmospheric pressure interface which is connected to the mass spectrometer.  DESI is a technique that allows for ambient ionization of a trace sample at atmospheric pressure, with little sample preparation.

===Ionization mechanism===

In DESI there are two kinds of ionization mechanism, one that applies to low molecular weight molecules and another to high molecular weight molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16237663&quot;/&gt; High molecular weight molecules, such as proteins and peptides show electrospray like spectra where multiply charged ions are observed.  This suggests desorption of the analyte, where multiple charges in the droplet can easily be transferred to the analyte.  The charged droplet hits the sample, spreads over a diameter greater than its original diameter, dissolves the protein and rebounces.  The droplets travel to the mass spectrometer inlet and are further desolvated.  The solvent typically used for the electrospray is a combination of methanol and water.

For the low molecular weight molecules, ionization occurs by charge transfer: an electron or a proton.  There are three possibilities for the charge transfer.  First, charge transfer between a solvent ion and an analyte on the surface.  Second, charge transfer between a gas phase ion and analyte on the surface; in this case the solvent ion is evaporated before reaching the sample surface.  This is achieved when the spray to surface distance is large.  Third, charge transfer between a gas phase ion and a gas phase analyte molecule. This occurs when a sample has a high vapour pressure.

:&lt;math&gt;A^- _{(aq)} + S_{(s)} \to A_{(aq)} + S^-_{(s)}\,\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^- _{(g)} + S_{(s)} \to A_{(g)} + S^-_{(s)}\,\qquad(2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^- _{(g)} + S_{(g)} \to A_{(g)} + S^-_{(g)}\,\qquad(3)&lt;/math&gt;

The ionization mechanism of low molecular weight molecules in DESI is similar to [[DART ion source|DART’s]] ionization mechanism, in that there is a charge transfer that occurs in the gas phase.

==Ionization efficiency==
[[Image:DESI side view.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Side view of DESI ion source along with a table containing typical values for the geometric parameters]]
The ionization efficiency of DESI is complex and depends on several parameters such as, surface effects, electrospray parameters, chemical parameters and geometric parameters.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16237663&quot;/&gt; Surface effects include chemical composition, temperature and electric potential applied.  Electrospray parameters include electrospray voltage, gas and liquid flow rates.
Chemical parameters refers to the sprayed solvent composition, e.g. addition of NaCl.  Geometric parameters are α, β, d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (see figure on the right).

Furthermore, α and d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; affect the ionization efficiency, while β and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affect the collection efficiency.  Results of a test performed on a variety of molecules to determine optimal α and d1 values show that there are two sets of molecules: high molecular weight (proteins, peptides, oligosaccharide etc.) and low molecular weight (dizazo dye, stereoids, caffeine, nitroaromatics etc.).  The optimal conditions for the high molecular weight group are high incident angles (70-90º) and short d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; distances (1–3&amp;nbsp;mm).  The optimal conditions for the low molecular weight group are the opposite, low incident angles (35-50º) and long d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; distances (7–10&amp;nbsp;mm).  These test results indicate that each group of molecules has a different ionization mechanism; described in detail in the Principle of operation section.

The sprayer tip and the surface holder are both attached to a 3D moving stage which allow to select specific values for the four geometric parameters: α, β, d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Deuterium NMR''' is NMR spectroscopy of deuterium (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;D), an isotope of hydrogen. Deuterium is an isotope with spin = 1, unlike hydrogen which is spin = 1/2.  Deuterium NMR has a range of chemical shift similar to proton NMR but with poor resolution.  It may be used to verify the effectiveness of deuteration: a deuterated compound will show a peak in deuterium NMR but not proton NMR.&lt;ref&gt;http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/nmr/techniques/1d/row1/h.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Deuterium NMR spectra are especially informative in the solid state because of its relatively small quadrupole moment in comparison with those of bigger quadrupolar nuclei such as chlorine-35, for example.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''Direct-EI LC-MS interface''' is a simple coupling technique between [[liquid chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]] ([[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]]) developed by Achille Cappiello and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniurb.it/SA/italiano/achilleweb/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Cappiello, G. Famiglini, E. Pierini, P. Palma, H. Trufelli, ''Advanced Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Interface Based on Electron Ionization''. Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 5364-5372.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the direct and efficient introduction of a liquid effluent into an [[electron ionization]] (EI) source where typical, library searchable [[mass spectra]] are generated. The gas-phase principle of EI offers plenty of application possibilities for the detection of a wide range of [[HPLC]] amenable compounds showing, at the same time, a valid opposition to adverse [[matrix effects]]. In fact, although atmospheric pressure ionization techniques have revolutionized the role of LC-MS, the related analytical methods are often plagued by inaccurate quantitative results due to unavoidable and unpredictable effects from matrix components. The technology illustrated here provides a robust and straightforward access to classical, well-characterized electron ionization data for a variety of LC applications and readily interpretable spectra from electronic libraries for different areas of research interest such as environment, [[food safety]], [[pharmaceutical]], [[biomedical]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cappiello, G. Famiglini, E. Pierini, P. Palma, H. Trufelli Advanced Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Interface Based on Electron Ionization. Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 5364-5372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electron ionization mass spectrometry (EIMS) are two analytical techniques that, in principle, seem to be incompatible. However, because these two approaches share a great deal of applications in the analysis of suitable molecules, typically less than 1000 u, a large effort has been devoted by the scientific community to develop a reliable, easy-to-use, and flawless interface. The first successful and commercially available device to combine EI and HPLC was designed by Willoughby and Browner in 1984&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Willoughby, R.F. Browner 1984. Monodisperse aerosol generation interface for coupling liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Anal. Chem. 1984, 56, 2625-2632.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was based on the conversion of the solute into a beam of particles, after the formation of spray droplets and the elimination of the [[solvent]] vapors through a multi-stage [[momentum]] separator. Although its efficient interfacing mechanism and a unique trait, particle beam performance was sometimes inadequate to an increasing number of new, demanding applications and was quickly replaced by a family of [[atmospheric pressure ionization]]-based interfaces (API) when they became commercially available. However, the possibility to record an EI spectrum from an HPLC application remained a challenge for a long time. The first Direct-EI prototype was first presented in 2002&lt;ref&gt;A. Cappiello, G. Famiglini, F. Mangani, P. Palma A Simple Approach for Coupling Liquid Chromatography and Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002, 13, 265–273&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed an innovative approach that improved interfacing performance compared to that of particle beam and opened new opportunities for LC-MS applications.

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Direct-EI v2.jpg|thumb|500px|alt=full|Scheme of a Direct-EI, LC-MS interface.]]
The interfacing mechanism is contained inside a common EI source, like that found in any GC-MS system. The liquid phase from a nano HPLC column is admitted from the capillary column port, where the connection tubing and the [[nebulizer]] are first introduced and sealed to prevent vacuum loss. The mechanism is based on the formation of an [[aerosol]] in high-vacuum conditions, followed by a quick droplet desolvation and final vaporization of the solute prior to the ionization. The completion of the process is quick and complete and reduces chances of thermal decomposition as reported in the Figure,where a scheme of the interface is shown. The core of the interface is represented by the micro-nebulizer. The nebulizer tip protrudes into the ion source so that the spray expansion is completely contained inside the ion volume. The eluate emerges as liquid phase at a flow rate of 300-500 nL/min, and any premature in-tube solvent evaporation is prevented by a convenient thermal insulation of the nebulizer and the connecting tubing from the surrounding source heat. The high temperature of the [[ion source]], between 300 and 400°C, has a double function: to compensate for the [[latent heat of vaporization]] during the droplet desolvation, and to convert the solute into the gas phase. If all components of this simple interface are correctly placed and sized, then each substance separated by the nano-column is smoothly converted into the gas phase, the peak profile is nicely reproduced, and high quality mass spectra are generated. Major advantages of this technical solution are the following:
* It delivers high-quality, fully library matchable mass spectra of most sub-1 kDa molecules amenable by HPLC.
* It is a [[chemical ionization]] free interface (unless operated intentionally) with accurate reproduction of the expected [[isotope]] ion abundances.
* Response is never influenced by matrix components in the sample or in the [[mobile phase]].
* It can be considered a universal detector for small molecules because response is not related to compound polarity.

==Performance and applications==
=== Mass spectral quality ===

A key feature of this interface is to produce top quality EI spectra from compounds dissolved in a liquid phase. In this case, quality is intended as a measure of the degree of success in a virtual comparison with thousands of spectra stored in the electronic libraries. Identification capability in real-world applications, when peaks are small and noise is high, can be greatly influenced by the quality of ionization. A [[NIST]] library version 2.0d was used for comparison. In this case, identification capability is not compromised by the presence of solvent vapor residues and matching quality tops that of a typical [[GC-MS]] system.

===Response versus matrix composition===
In [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI), coeluted matrix components can influence signal intensity through a competition for available charges and for the access to the droplet surface for gas-phase emission, thus creating the so-called matrix effects. Matrix effects can occur at different stages of the interfacing process leading to unpredictably enhanced or suppressed signal response. Direct-EI interface, using a gas phase ionization technique, can eliminate most matrix effects observed with ESI. In fact, it is influenced neither by the mobile phase nor by other matrix components so that the signal response is always proportional only to [[analyte]] concentration. This simplifies sample preparation procedures that can be very complex and time consuming prior to ESI&lt;ref&gt;A. Cappiello, G. Famiglini, P. Palma, E. Pierini, V. Termopoli, H. Trufelli Overcoming Matrix Effects in Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2008, 80, 9343–9348&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Other performance aspects===
The evaluation of the performance cannot be considered complete without considering the [[limit of detection]], the range of linear response and the signal [[reproducibility]]. EI is known as a low-efficiency ionization technique. Because less than 1/10 000 of the gas-phase sample molecules are ionized, impressive detection limits cannot be expected. However, the efficient interfacing mechanism of this interface allows [[picogram]]-level detection limit in [[selected ion monitoring]] (SIM) for most substances. On the other hand, soft ionization techniques such as ESI are, in some cases, far more efficient but generate fewer fragment ions. The cost of this attitude is paid in terms of structural information so that a second analyzer to generate [[MS/MS]] spectra is an obligation. A typical EI spectrum, in general, has extensive structural information, and a cheaper, single-stage mass spectrometer might be sufficient for analyte characterization or identification. As a rule of the thumb, [[nanogram]]-level sensitivity is obtained in full-scan mode for most substances. Linearity and reproducibility are two point of strength of the interface. Up to four orders of magnitude linearity with RSD lower than 10% are common values in many applications.

===Applications===
Direct-EI may offer a clear advantage over ESI in several applications, but it may excel in the following cases:
*Large number of compounds of different polarities and chemical properties:&lt;ref&gt;G. Famiglini, P. Palma, V. Termopoli, H. Trufelli, A. Cappiello Single-step LC-MS method for the simultaneous determination of GC-amenable organochlorine and LC-amenable phenoxy acids pesticides Anal. Chem. 2009, 81, 7373–7378&lt;/ref&gt; EI can offer a shortcut, do-it-all solution when hard-to-detect substances are included or and when a combination of positive and negative ion detection runs are required for complete coverage of analyte detection.
*Characterization of unknowns: library matching offer an unquestionable and invaluable tool for compound identification.
*Detection  of non [[chromophoric]] compounds that also give poor or no signal with API: for these compounds additional HPLC detectors such as [[evaporative light scattering detector]] (ELSD), [[refractive index]] (RI) or [[corona discharge]] aerosol detector (CAD) are also available but each of them has limitations which restrain obtaining a universal detection with reasonable sensitivity. EI-MS would offer a suitable solution for this type of compounds, in terms of sensitivity and universal response. GC is anyway feasible only for compounds with high to medium volatility and therefore cannot be adopted for a full characterization of mixtures of complex nature. The possibility of hyphenating EI to HPLC separation represents an ideal solution.
*Quantitative analyses in presence of matrix effects: EI-MS offers a superior performance compared to ESI or [[APCI]] when intruding interferences from complex matrices pass clean up procedure and cause signal suppression or enhancement.

[[Image:orbit3.gif|thumb|right|200px|Diagram showing how a smaller object (such as an [[extrasolar planet]]) orbiting a larger object (such as a [[star]]) could produce changes in position and velocity of the latter as they orbit their common [[center of mass]] (red cross).]]

'''Doppler spectroscopy''', also known as [[radial velocity]] measurement, is a [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] method for finding extrasolar planets.  It involves the observation of [[Doppler shift]]s in the [[spectrum]] of the star around which the [[planet]] orbits.

It is extremely difficult to directly observe extrasolar planets directly because they are very faint at interstellar distances, although the first claims of direct observations were made in 2004 and 2005.  As a result, planets outside of our [[solar system]] are usually discovered using indirect methods, through the effect of the planet on an object that is easier to observe, such as the parent star.  Successful methods include Doppler spectroscopy, [[astrometry]], [[pulsar]] timing, [[Astronomical transit|transits]], and [[Gravitational microlensing]].  Almost all of the known extrasolar planets have been discovered using Doppler spectroscopy.

== History ==
[[Otto Struve]] proposed in 1952 the use of powerful [[spectrograph]]s to detect distant planets. He described how a very large planet, as large as [[Jupiter]], for example, would cause its parent star to wobble slightly as the two objects orbit around their center of mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBSERV&quot;&gt;[[Otto Struve]], &quot;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1952Obs....72..199S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=0&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES Proposal for a project of high-precision stellar radial velocity work]&quot; ''[[The Observatory]]'' 72 (1952): 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted that the small Doppler shifts to the light emitted by the star, caused by its continuously varying radial velocity, would be detectable by the most sensitive spectrographs as tiny [[red shift]]s and [[blue shift]]s in the star's emission. However, the technology of the time produced radial velocity measurements with errors of 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[m/s]] or more, making them useless for the detection of orbiting planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;RVM&quot;&gt;[[David Darling (astronomer)|David Darling]], &quot;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/R/radialvelmeth.html radial velocity method]&quot; ''The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Space Flight'', April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The expected changes in radial velocity are very small – Jupiter causes the [[Sun]] to change velocity by about 13&amp;nbsp;m/s over a period of 12 years, and the [[Earth]]'s effect is only 0.1&amp;nbsp;m/s over a period of 1 year – so long-term observations by instruments with a very high [[Optical resolution|resolution]] are required.&lt;ref name=&quot;RVM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolszczan&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.astro.psu.edu/users/alex/astro497_2.pdf Doppler spectroscopy and astrometry - Theory and practice of planetary orbit measurements]&quot;, [http://www.astro.psu.edu/users/alex/Teaching_spring06.html Astronomy 497: Astronomy of Extrasolar Planets], [[Alex Wolszczan]], Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, [[Penn State University]], Spring 2006. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in spectrometer technology and observational techniques in the 1980s and 1990s produced instruments capable of detecting the first of many new extrasolar planets. [[51 Pegasi b]], the first extrasolar planet to be detected, was discovered in October 1995 using Doppler spectroscopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNE&quot;&gt;[[R. Paul Butler|R. P. Butler]], et al. &lt;!--R. P. Butler, J. T. Wright, G. W. Marcy, D. A Fischer, S. S. Vogt, C. G. Tinney, H. R. A. Jones, B. D. Carter, J. A. Johnson, C. McCarthy, A. J. Penny,--&gt; &quot;[http://exoplanets.org/cne.pdf Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets]&quot; ''[[Astrophysical Journal]].'' Vol. 646 (2006):2-3, 25-33. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Since that date, nearly 300 exoplanet candidates have been identified, and most have been detected by Doppler search programs based at
the [[Keck Observatory|Keck]], [[Lick Observatory|Lick]], and [[Anglo-Australian Observatory|Anglo-Australian]] Observatories (respectively, the California, Carnegie and Anglo-Australian planet searches), and teams based at the [[Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNE&quot;/&gt;

The Bayesian Kepler periodogram is a mathematical [[algorithm]], used to detect single or multiple [[extrasolar planets]] from successive [[radial velocity]] measurements of the star they are orbiting.  It was probably been founded in 2005.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} It involves a [[Bayesian statistical analysis]] of the radial velocity data, using a [[Prior probability|prior]] [[probability distribution]] over the space determined by one or more sets of Keplerian orbital parameters.  This analysis may be implemented using the [[Markov chain]] [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) method.

The method has been applied to the [[HD 208487]] system, resulting in an apparent detection of a second planet with a period of approximately 1000 days; however, this may be an artifact of stellar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gregory | title=A Bayesian Kepler periodogram detects a second planet in HD 208487 | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | month=February | year=2007 | volume=374 | issue=4 | pages=1321–1333 | accessdate=2008-12-19 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.11240.x | bibcode=2007MNRAS.374.1321G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wright et al. |  title=Four New Exoplanets and Hints of Additional Substellar Companions to Exoplanet Host Stars | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=657 | issue=1 | pages=533–545 | year=2007 | month=March | day=1 | doi=10.1086/510553 | bibcode=2007ApJ...657..533W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method was also applied to the [[HD 11964]] system, where it found an apparent planet with a period of approximately 1 year; this was not found in re-reduced data, suggesting that this detection was an artifact of the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Bayesian periodogram finds evidence for three planets in HD 11964|author=Gregory, P.

== Procedure ==
A series of observations is made of the spectrum of light emitted by a star. Periodic variations in the star's spectrum may be detected, with the [[wavelength]] of characteristic [[spectral line]]s in the spectrum increasing and decreasing regularly over a period of time. These variations may be indicative of the radial velocity of the star being altered by the presence of planet orbiting the star, causing Doppler shifts in the light emitted by the star.

If an extrasolar planet is detected, its [[mass]] can be determined from the changes in the star's radial velocity. A graph of measured radial velocity versus time will give a characteristic curve ([[sine curve]] in the case of a circular orbit), and the amplitude of the curve will allow the planet's mass to be calculated.

===Example===
[[Image:Doppler Shift vs Time.jpg|frame]]

The graph to the right illustrates the [[sine curve]] created using Doppler spectroscopy to observe the radial velocity of an imaginary star which is being orbited by a planet in a circular orbit. Observations of a real star would produce a similar graph, although [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] in the orbit will distort the curve and complicate the calculations below.

This theoretical star's velocity shows a periodic variance of ±1&amp;nbsp;m/s, suggesting an orbiting mass that is creating a gravitational pull on this star. Using [[Kepler]]'s [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|third law of planetary motion]], the observed period of the planet's orbit around the star (equal to the period of the observed variations in the star's spectrum) can be used to determine the planet's distance from the star (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;r^3=\frac{GM_{star}}{4\pi^2}P_{star}^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''r'' is the distance of the planet from the star
*''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]]
*''M&lt;sub&gt;star&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the star &lt;!-- how is this determined?--&gt;
*''P&lt;sub&gt;star&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the observed period of the star

Having determined &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity of the planet around the star can be calculated using [[Newton]]'s [[law of gravitation]], and the [[orbit equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;V_{PL}=\sqrt{GM_{star}/r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_{PL}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of planet.

The mass of the planet can then be found from the calculated velocity of the planet:

&lt;math&gt;M_{PL}=\frac{M_{star}V_{star}}{V_{PL}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_{star}&lt;/math&gt; is the observed velocity of parent star. The observed Doppler velocity, &lt;math&gt;K = V_{star}\sin(i)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''i'' is the [[inclination]] of the planet's orbit to the line perpendicular to the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]].

Thus, assuming a value for the inclination of the planet's orbit and for the mass of the star, the observed changes in the radial velocity of the star can be used to calculate the mass of the extrasolar planet.

== Problems ==

[[Image:dopspec-inline.gif|thumb|270px|A representation of a star orbited by a planet. All the movement of the star is along the viewer's line-of-sight; Doppler spectroscopy will give a true value of the planet's mass.]]
[[Image:doppspec-above.gif|thumb|270px|In this case none of the star's movement is along the viewer's line-of-sight and the Doppler spectroscopy method will not detect the planet at all.]]

The major problem with Doppler spectroscopy is that it can only measure movement along the line-of-sight, and so depends on a measurement (or estimate) of the inclination of the planet's orbit to determine the planet's mass. If the orbital plane of the planet happens to line up with the line-of-sight of the observer, then the measured variation in the star's radial velocity is the true value. However, if the orbital plane is tilted away from the line-of-sight, then the true effect of the planet on the motion of the star will be greater than the measured variation in the star's radial velocity, which is only the component along the line-of-sight. As a result, the planet's [[true mass]] will be higher than expected.

To correct for this effect, and so determine the true mass of an extrasolar planet, radial velocity measurements must be combined with [[astrometry|astrometric]] observations, which track the movement of the star across the plane of the sky, perpendicular to the line-of-sight. Astrometric measurements allows researchers to check whether objects that appear to be high mass planets are more likely to be [[brown dwarf]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RVM&quot;/&gt;

A further problem is that the gas envelope around certain types of stars can expand and contract, and some stars are [[variable star|variable]]. This method is unsuitable for finding planets around these types of stars, as changes in the stellar emission spectrum caused by the intrinsic variability of the star can swamp the small effect caused by a planet.

The method is best at detecting very massive objects close to the parent star - so-called &quot;[[hot Jupiter]]s&quot; - which have the greatest gravitational effect on the parent star, and so cause the largest changes in its radial velocity. Observation of many separate spectral lines and many orbital periods allows the [[signal to noise ratio]] of observations to be increased, increasing the chance of observing smaller and more distant planets, but planets like the Earth remain undetectable with current instruments.

[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) in the [[geomagnetic field]] is conventionally referred to as '''Earth's field NMR (EFNMR)'''. Note that the same acronym is used for [[electric field NMR]].

EFNMR is a special case of [[low field NMR]].

When placed in a constant magnetic field and stimulated (perturbed) by a pulsed or alternating magnetic field, NMR active nuclei (such as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H or &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) resonate at frequencies characteristic of the [[isotope]]. The resonant frequencies and signal strengths are proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. Thus in the 21 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnetic field that may be found in high resolution laboratory [[NMR spectroscopy|NMR spectrometers]], protons resonate at 900 MHz. However in the Earth's magnetic field the same nuclei resonate at audio frequencies of around 2 kHz, generating very weak signals. 

The location of a nucleus within a complex molecule affects the chemical environment experienced by the nucleus. Thus different [[hydrocarbon]] molecules containing NMR active nuclei in different positions within the molecule produce slightly different patterns of resonant frequencies. Analysis of the frequency spectrum allows the structure of the molecule to be determined.

== Applications ==

Applications of EFNMR include:

* [[Proton precession magnetometer]]s (PPM) or [[proton magnetometer]]s, which produce magnetic resonance in a known sample in the magnetic field to be measured, measure the sample's resonant frequency, then calculate and display the field strength. 

* EFNMR spectrometers, which use the principle of [[NMR spectroscopy]] to analyse molecular structures in a variety of applications, from investigating the structure of ice crystals in polar ice-fields, to rocks and hydrocarbons in the field.

* Earth's field [[MRI]] scanners, which use the principle of [[magnetic resonance imaging]].

The advantages of the Earth's field instruments over conventional (high field strength) instruments include the portability of the equipment giving the ability to analyse substances on site, and their lower cost. The much lower geomagnetic field strength, that would otherwise result in poor signal-to-noise ratios, is compensated by homogeneity of the Earth's field giving the ability to use much larger samples. Their relatively low cost and simplicity make them good educational tools. 

Examples (illustrated) are the [http://www.teachspin.com/instruments/earths_field_NMR/index.shtml TeachSpin] and [http://www.magritek.com/terranova.html Terranova MRI] instruments.

Although those commercial EFNMR spectrometers and MRI instruments aimed at universities etc. are necessarily sophisticated and are too costly for most hobbyists, internet search engines find data and designs for basic proton precession magnetometers which claim to be within the capability of reasonably competent electronic hobbyists or undergraduate students to build from readily available components costing no more than a few tens of US dollars.

== Mode of operation ==

[[Free Induction Decay]] (FID) is the magnetic resonance due to [[Larmor precession]] that results from the stimulation of nuclei by means of either a ''pulsed dc magnetic field'' or a ''pulsed resonant frequency (rf) magnetic field'', somewhat analogous respectively to the effects of plucking or bowing a stringed instrument. Whereas a pulsed rf field is usual in conventional (high field) NMR spectrometers, the pulsed dc polarising field method of stimulating FID is usual in EFNMR spectrometers and PPMs. 

EFNMR equipment typically incorporates several coils, for stimulating the samples and for sensing the resulting NMR signals. Signal levels are very low, and specialised electronic [[amplifiers]] are required to amplify the EFNMR signals to usable levels. The stronger the polarising magnetic field, the stronger the EFNMR signals and the better the [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s. The main trade offs are performance versus portability and cost.

Since the FID resonant frequencies of NMR active nuclei are directly proportional to the magnetic field affecting those nuclei, we can use widely available NMR spectroscopy data to analyse suitable substances in the [[Earth's magnetic field]].

For more context and an explanation of NMR principles, please refer to the main articles on [[NMR]] and [[NMR spectroscopy]].

== Proton EFNMR frequencies ==

The geomagnetic field strength and hence precession frequency varies with location and time.

: Larmor precession frequency =  [[magnetogyric ratio]] x magnetic field
: Proton magnetogyric ratio =  42.576&amp;nbsp;Hz/μT (also written 42.576&amp;nbsp;MHz/T or 0.042576&amp;nbsp;Hz/nT)
: Earth's magnetic field:  30 μT near Equator to 60 μT near Poles, around 50 μT at mid-latitudes.

Thus [[proton]] (hydrogen nucleus) EFNMR frequencies are [[audio frequencies]] of about 1.3&amp;nbsp;kHz near the Equator to 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz near the Poles, around 2&amp;nbsp;kHz being typical of mid-latitudes. These frequencies are in the [[ULF]] [[radio frequency]] band.

Examples of molecules containing hydrogen nuclei useful in proton EFNMR are [[water]], [[hydrocarbons]] such as [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], and [[carbohydrates]].

== History ==
Early NMR instruments were developed in the 1950s using [[thermionic valve]] ([[vacuum tube]]) circuits (see for example Scientific American's, Amateur Scientist, by C. L. Stong April, 1959). Sir [[Peter Mansfield]]'s first acquaintance with NMR was an undergraduate project to develop a [[transistorized]] EFNMR spectrometer in the late 1950's [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2003/mansfield-autobio.html]. Following that introduction to NMR, he went on to invent an [[MRI]] scanner, for which he shared a Nobel prize.

The '''Eckart conditions'''&lt;ref&gt; C. Eckart, ''Some studies concerning rotating axes and polyatomic molecules'', Physical Review,
vol. 47, pp. 552-558 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; simplify the  molecular Schrödinger equation  that arises in the second step of the  [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]]. They allow the separation of the nuclear center of mass motion and (partly) the rotational motion from the internal vibrational motions. 
Although the rotational and vibrational motions of the nuclei in a molecule cannot be fully separated, the Eckart conditions minimize the (Coriolis) coupling between these motions. 

== Definition Eckart conditions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_A&lt;/math&gt; be the coordinate vector of nucleus ''A'' (&lt;math&gt;A=1,\ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;) 
with respect to a special body-fixed frame with origin in the center of mass of the molecule, a so-called Eckart frame.&lt;ref&gt;L. C. Biedenharn and J. D. Louck, ''Angular Momentum in Quantum Physics'', Addison-Wesley, Reading (1981) p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; The  mass of nucleus ''A'' is ''M''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. We suppose that the [[potential energy surface]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{R}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{R}_N)&lt;/math&gt; has a (deep) minimum for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^0_A&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A=1,\ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;); this means that the molecule is assumed to have a well-defined geometry (a ''semi-rigid'' molecule). The equilibrium coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^0_A&lt;/math&gt; are expressed with respect to the Eckart frame.

We define ''displacement coordinates'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}_A\equiv\mathbf{R}_A-\mathbf{R}^0_A&lt;/math&gt;.
The displacement coordinates satisfy the  ''translational'' Eckart conditions, if:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{A=1}^N M_A \mathbf{d}_A = 0 .
&lt;/math&gt;
The ''rotational'' Eckart conditions for the displacements are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{A=1}^N M_A \mathbf{R}^0_A \times \mathbf{d}_A = 0, 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; indicates a [[vector product]].

==Separation of external and internal coordinates==
Displacement coordinates that satisfy the Eckart conditions
are usually referred to as ''internal molecular coordinates''. To clarify this nomenclature
we define first ''external molecular coordinates''. 

The nuclear configuration space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3N&lt;/sup&gt; arising in the second step of the [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]] is a linear space of dimension 3''N''. One can renormalize its basis and obtain so-called ''mass-weighted'' coordinates, or one can introduce a generalized inner product with
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{M} \equiv \operatorname{diag}(\mathbf{M}_1, \mathbf{M}_2, \ldots,\mathbf{M}_N)
\quad\textrm{and}\quad
\mathbf{M}_i\equiv  \operatorname{diag}(M_i, M_i, M_i)
&lt;/math&gt;
playing the role of positive definite metric. That is, an inner product in the space is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\mathbf{f}|\mathbf{d}\rangle \equiv  \mathbf{f}^\mathrm{T}\, \mathbf{M}\, \mathbf{d} =
\sum_{A=1}^N \sum_{\alpha=x,y,z} M_A 
f_{A\alpha} \,d_{A\alpha}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We will follow the second route. 

The following 3''N''-dimensional vectors are '''external coordinates'''
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{T} \equiv \operatorname{col}(\mathbf{t},\, \mathbf{t},\ldots, \mathbf{t})
\quad\textrm{and}\quad
\mathbf{S}\equiv \operatorname{col}( \mathbf{s}\times\mathbf{R}_1^0,\,  \mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{R}_2^0,\ldots,\mathbf{s}\times\mathbf{R}_N^0 ), 
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''t''' and '''s''' are arbitrary triplets of real numbers (3-dimensional column vectors). 
The subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3N&lt;/sup&gt; of all vectors '''T''' and '''S''' is of dimension 6, for it
is easy to show that the 6 vectors obtained from unit vectors '''t''' and '''s''' ['''t'''=(1,0,0),
'''t'''=(0,1,0),  '''s''' = (1,0,0), etc.] are orthogonal and hence linearly independent.
We write this 6-dimensional subspace as '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; and the total configuration space
becomes 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{R}^{3N} = \mathbf{R}_\textrm{ext}\oplus\mathbf{R}_\textrm{int},
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; is the 3''N'' - 6 dimensional [[orthogonal complement]] of '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;. The elements of '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; are '''internal coordinates'''. We 
show that they obey the Eckart conditions. We also show that, conversely, vectors obeying the Eckart conditions are in the space '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\mathbf{T}| \mathbf{d}\rangle =
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A \mathbf{t}^\textrm{T} \mathbf{d}_A =
\mathbf{t}^\textrm{T} \sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A  \mathbf{d}_A = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
because 
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{d}\equiv \operatorname{col}(\mathbf{d}_1, \mathbf{d}_2,\ldots, \mathbf{d}_N)
&lt;/math&gt;
is in the orthogonal complement of '''T'''. Now, since '''t''' is arbitrary,
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{t}^\textrm{T} \sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A  \mathbf{d}_A = 0 \Longleftrightarrow 
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A  \mathbf{d}_A = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
which are the translational Eckart conditions. In a very similar manner,
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle\mathbf{S}| \mathbf{d}\rangle =
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A (\mathbf{s} \times\mathbf{R}_A^0 )^\textrm{T}\, \mathbf{d}_A =
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A \mathbf{s}^\textrm{T}\, \left(\mathbf{R}_A^0 \times \mathbf{d}_A\right) = 
\mathbf{s}^\textrm{T}\,\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A  \mathbf{R}_A^0 \times \mathbf{d}_A = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
because 
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{d}\,&lt;/math&gt;
is in the orthogonal complement of '''S'''. Finally, since '''s''' is arbitrary
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{s}^\textrm{T} \sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A    \mathbf{R}_A^0 \times \mathbf{d}_A = 0 \Longleftrightarrow 
\sum_{A=1}^{N} M_A \mathbf{R}_A^0 \times \mathbf{d}_A = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
which are the rotational Eckart conditions.

== Relation to the harmonic approximation ==

In the harmonic approximation to the nuclear vibrational problem, expressed in displacement coordinates, one must solve the [[generalized eigenvalue problem ]]
:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{H}\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{M} \mathbf{C} \boldsymbol{\Phi},
&lt;/math&gt;
where  '''H''' is a 3''N'' x 3''N'' symmetric matrix of second derivatives of the potential &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{R}_1, \mathbf{R}_2,\ldots, \mathbf{R}_N)&lt;/math&gt;. '''H''' is the [[Hessian matrix]] of ''V'' in the equilibrium &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_1^0,\ldots,  \mathbf{R}_N^0&lt;/math&gt;. The diagonal matrix '''M''' contains the masses on the diagonal. 
The  diagonal matrix &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; contains the eigenvalues, while
the columns of '''C''' contain the eigenvectors.

It can be shown that the  invariance  of ''V'' under simultaneous translation over '''t'''  of all nuclei implies that the vectors '''T''', introduced above,  are eigenvectors
of eigenvalue zero. From the invariance of ''V'' under an infinitesimal rotation of all nuclei  around '''s''' it can been shown that also the vectors
'''S''' are eigenvectors of eigenvalue zero.  Thus, the 6 columns of '''C''' corresponding to eigenvalue zero, are determined  algebraically. (If the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved numerically, one will find in general 6 linearly independent linear combinations of '''S''' and '''T'''). 
The eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue zero is at least of dimension 6 (often it is exactly of dimension 6, since the other eigenvalues, which are [[force constant]]s, are never zero for molecules in their ground state). Thus, '''T''' and '''S''' correspond to the overall (external) motions: translation and rotation, respectively. They are ''zero-energy modes'' because space is homogeneous (force-free) and isotropic (torque-free).

By the definition in this article the non-zero frequency modes are internal modes, since they   are within the orthogonal complement of  '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;. The generalized orthogonalities:
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{M} \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{I} &lt;/math&gt; 
applied to the &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot; (zero-eigenvalue) columns of '''C'''
are in fact the Eckart conditions.

[[Image:Einzel_lens.png|thumb|300px|Implementation of an Einzel lens showing the ion path. Six plates are parallel to the ion flight path with the middle plate at a particular potential.]]
An '''einzel lens''' is a charged particle lens that focuses without changing the energy of the beam. It consists of three or more sets of cylindrical or rectangular tubes in series along an axis. It is used in [[ion optics]] to focus [[ion]]s in flight which is accomplished through manipulation of the [[electric field]] in the path of the ions. 

The lens elements are symmetric so the ions will regain their initial [[energy]] on exiting the lens although the [[velocity]] of the outer particles will be altered such that they converge on to the axis.  This causes the outer particles to arrive at the [[focus (optics)|focus]] intersection slightly later than the ones that travel along a straight path as they have to travel an extra distance.

==Theory==
[[Image:Einzel_lens_3d.png|thumb|right|250 px|A perspective view of an einzel lens.]]
The equation for the change in radial velocity for a particle as it passes between any pair of cylinders in the lens is:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta v_r = \int \frac{qE_r(r,z)}{m_0v_z} dz&lt;/math&gt;

z is the axis passing through the middle of the lens. r is the direction normal to z.  If the lens is constructed with cylindrical plates, the field is symmetrical around z.  &lt;math&gt;E_r(r,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the electric field in the radial direction for a particle at a particular radial distance and distance across the gap, &lt;math&gt;m_o&lt;/math&gt; the rest mass of the particle passing through the field, &lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the particle and q is the charge of the particle. The integral occurs over the gap between the plates. This is also the interval where the lensing occurs.  

The pair of plates is also called an electrostatic immersion lens, thus an einzel lens can be described as two or more electrostatic immersion lenses.  Solving the equation above twice to find the change in radial velocity for each pair of plates can be used to calculate the focal length of the lens.   

==Application to television tubes==
[[Image:Einzel_lens_ions.png|thumb|right|300px|Path of ions as they travel through an einzel lens. The ion mass is 200 kDa accelerated to 40 kV, the middle plate potential is at 200 V and the plate size is 1m (note that these values are atypical for illustrative purposes).]]
The einzel lens principle in a simplified form was also used as a focusing mechanism in modern display and television cathode ray tubes,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Radio and Television&quot; by C. A. Quarrington, 1952-1963.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Television Receiver Servicing&quot; by E. A. W. Spreadbury, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  and has the advantage of providing a good sharply focused spot throughout the useful life of the tube's electron gun, with minimal or no readjustment needed (many mono TVs did not have or need focus controls), although in high-resolution mono displays and all colour CRT displays an (engineer-adjustable) focus potentiometer control is provided.

'''Electric field NMR''' (EFNMR) spectroscopy differs from conventional [[NMR]] in that a sample containing suitable [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] is polarised by a strong dc [[electric field]] instead of a constant [[magnetic field]]. The nuclei are stimulated (perturbed) by means of an alternating magnetic field, generated by passing an alternating current through a set of coils. The resulting magnetic resonance signal is small, and as in conventional NMR is typically sensed using a second set of coils and an amplifier.

Note that the same acronym is used for [[Earth's field NMR]].

The shifting and splitting of [[spectral line]]s of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external static [[electric field]] is referred to as the [[Stark effect]].

'''Electrical mobility''' is the ability of charged particles (such as [[electron]]s or [[proton]]s) to move through a medium in response to an [[electric field]] that is pulling them. The separation of ions according to their mobility in gas phase is called [[Ion mobility spectrometry]], in liquid phase it is called [[electrophoresis]].

==Theory==
When a [[charged particle]] in a [[gas]] or [[liquid]] is acted upon by a uniform [[electric field]], it will be accelerated until it reaches a constant [[drift velocity]] according to the formula:
: &lt;math&gt;\,v_d = \mu E&lt;/math&gt; 

where 
: &lt;math&gt;\, v_d&lt;/math&gt; is the drift velocity (m/s)
: &lt;math&gt;\, E&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the applied electric field (V/m)
: &lt;math&gt;\, \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(V.s))

In other words, the electrical mobility of the particle is defined as the ratio of the drift velocity to the magnitude of the electric field:
: &lt;math&gt;\,\mu = \frac{v_d}{E}&lt;/math&gt;

Electrical mobility is proportional to the net [[electric charge|charge]] of the particle.  This was the basis for [[Robert Millikan]]'s demonstration that electrical charges occur in discrete units, whose magnitude is the charge of the [[electron]].

Electrical mobility of spherical particles much larger than the mean free path of the molecules of the medium is inversely proportional to the [[diameter]] of the particles; for spherical particles much smaller than the mean free path, the electrical mobility is inversely proportional to the square of the particle diameter.

==Mobility in gas phase==
Mobility is defined for any species in the gas phase, encountered mostly in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics and is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{q}{m\, \nu_m}&lt;/math&gt; 

where 

:&lt;math&gt;\, q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of the species,

:&lt;math&gt;\, \nu_m&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum transfer collision frequency, and

:&lt;math&gt;\, m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass.

Mobility is related to the species' '''diffusion coefficient''' &lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; through an exact (thermodynamically required) equation known as the [[Einstein relation]]:

&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{q}{k\, T}D&lt;/math&gt;,

where

:&lt;math&gt;\, k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\, T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas]] temperature, and 
:&lt;math&gt;\, D&lt;/math&gt; is a measured quantity that can be estimated. If one defines the [[mean free path]] in terms of [[momentum transfer]], then one gets:

&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{\pi}{8}\lambda^2 \nu_m&lt;/math&gt;.

But both the ''momentum transfer mean free path'' and the ''momentum transfer collision frequency'' are difficult to calculate. Many other mean free paths can be defined. In the gas phase, &lt;math&gt;\, \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is often defined as the diffusional mean free path, by assuming a simple approximate relation is exact:

&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{2}\lambda \,v&lt;/math&gt;, 

when &lt;math&gt;\, v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[root mean square]] speed of the gas molecules: 

&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt {{3\, k\, T}\over{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\, m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the diffusing species. This approximate equation becomes exact when used to define the diffusional mean free path.

==Applications==
Electrical mobility is the basis for [[electrostatic precipitation]], used to remove particles from exhaust gases on an industrial scale.  The particles are given a charge by exposing them to ions from an [[electrical discharge]] in the presence of a strong field.  The particles acquire an electrical mobility and are driven by the field to a collecting electrode.

Instruments exist which select particles with a narrow range of electrical mobility, or particles with electrical mobility larger than a predefined value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=E. O. Knutson and K. T. Whitby | title=Aerosol classification by electric mobility: Apparatus, theory, and applications | journal=J. Aerosol Sci. | year=1975 | volume=6 | pages=443–451 | doi=10.1016/0021-8502(75)90060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former are generally referred to as &quot;differential mobility analyzers&quot;.  The selected mobility is often identified with the diameter of a singly-charged spherical particle, thus the &quot;electrical-mobility diameter&quot; becomes a characteristic of the particle, regardless of whether it is actually spherical.

'''Electromagnetic radiation''' (often abbreviated '''E-M radiation''' or '''EMR''') is a [[phenomenon]] that takes the form of [[wave propagation|self-propagating]] [[wave]]s in a [[vacuum]] or in [[matter]]. It comprises [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]] components, which [[oscillate]] in phase perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy [[Wave propagation|propagation]]. Electromagnetic radiation is classified into several types according to the [[frequency]] of its wave; these types include (in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength): [[radio waves]], [[microwave]]s,  [[infrared|infrared radiation]], [[visible spectrum|visible light]], [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s. A small and somewhat variable window of frequencies is [[sense]]d by the [[eye]]s of various [[organism]]s; this is what is called the [[visible spectrum]]. The [[photon]] is the quantum of the electromagnetic interaction and the basic &quot;unit&quot; of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation and is also the force carrier for the electromagnetic force. The photon is, in a sense, what's waving.

EM radiation carries [[energy]] and [[momentum]] that may be imparted to [[matter]] with which it interacts.

== Physics ==
=== Theory ===
[[Image:Visible EM modes.png|thumb|Shows three electromagnetic modes (blue, green and red) with a distance scale in micrometres along the x-axis.]]
{{main|Maxwell's equations}}
'''Electromagnetic waves''' were first postulated by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and subsequently confirmed by [[Heinrich Hertz]]. Maxwell derived a [[Electromagnetic wave equation|wave form of the electric and magnetic equations]], revealing the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields, and their symmetry. Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured [[speed of light]], Maxwell concluded that [[light]] itself is an EM wave.

According to [[Maxwell's equations]], a spatially-varying [[electric field]] generates a time-varying [[magnetic field]] and ''vice versa''. Therefore, as an oscillating electric field generates an oscillating magnetic field, the magnetic field in turn generates an oscillating electric field, and so on.  These oscillating fields together form an electromagnetic wave.

A [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]].

=== Properties ===
[[Image:Light-wave.svg|thumb|left|350px|Electromagnetic waves can be imagined as a self-propagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields. This diagram shows a plane linearly polarized wave propagating from right to left. The electric field is in a vertical plane and the magnetic field in a horizontal plane.]]
[[Image:Onde electromagnetique.svg|thumb|left|350px]]

The [[physics]] of electromagnetic radiation is [[electrodynamics]]. [[Electromagnetism]] is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics. Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of [[superposition principle|superposition]] so that a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field will contribute to the fields present in the same space due to other causes: as they are [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition. For instance, a travelling EM wave incident on an atomic structure induces oscillation in the [[atom]]s of that structure, thereby causing them to emit their own EM waves, [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissions]] which alter the impinging wave through interference. These properties cause various phenomena including [[refraction]] and [[diffraction]].

Since light is an oscillation it is not affected by travelling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum.  However in nonlinear media, such as some [[crystal]]s, interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields&amp;nbsp;— these interactions include the [[Faraday effect]] and the [[Kerr effect]].

In refraction, a wave crossing from one medium to another of different [[density]] alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by [[Snell's law]]. Light disperses into a visible [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] as light is shone through a prism because of the wavelength dependent refractive index of the prism material ([[Dispersion (optics)|Dispersion]]).

EM radiation exhibits both wave properties and [[Subatomic particle|particle]] properties at the same time (see [[wave-particle duality]]). Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in a large number of experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. Upon absorption of light, it is not too difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy. Strictly speaking, however, this alone is not evidence of &quot;particulate&quot; behavior of light, rather it reflects the quantum nature of ''matter''&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.qo.phy.auckland.ac.nz/talks/photoelectric.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt; 

There are experiments in which the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves appear in the same experiment, such as the self-interference of a single [[photon]]. ''True'' single-photon experiments (in a quantum optical sense) can be done today in undergraduate-level labs.&lt;sup&gt;[http://people.whitman.edu/~beckmk/QM/grangier/Thorn_ajp.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt; When a single photon is sent through an [[interferometer]], it passes through both paths, interfering with itself, as waves do, yet is detected by a [[photomultiplier]] or other sensitive detector only once.

=== Wave model ===
[[Image:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|right|White light being [[dispersion (optics)|separated]] into its components.]]
An important aspect of the nature of light is [[frequency]]. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in [[hertz]], the [[SI]] unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per [[second]]. Light usually has a spectrum of frequencies which sum together to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction.

A wave consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the [[wavelength]]. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v=f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the speed of the wave (''[[speed of light|c]]'' in a vacuum, or less in other media), ''f'' is the frequency and λ is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant.

[[Interference (wave propagation)|Interference]] is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive interference.

The energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called [[radiant energy]].

=== Particle model ===
{{seealso|Quantization (physics)|Quantum optics}}

Electromagnetic radiation has particle-like properties as discrete packets of energy, or [[quanta]], called [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The frequency of the wave is proportional to the particle's energy.  Because photons are emitted and absorbed by charged particles, they act as transporters of [[energy]].  The energy per [[photon]] can be calculated from the [[Planck–Einstein equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;

As a photon is absorbed by an [[atom]], it excites an [[electron]], elevating it to a higher [[energy level]]. If the energy is great enough, so that the electron jumps to a high enough energy level, it may escape the positive pull of the nucleus and be liberated from the atom in a process called [[photoionisation]]. Conversely, an electron that descends to a lower energy level in an atom emits a photon of light equal to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies.

Together, these effects explain the emission and absorption spectra of [[light]]. The dark bands in the absorption spectrum are due to the atoms in the intervening medium absorbing different frequencies of the light. The composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption spectrum. For instance, dark bands in the light emitted by a distant [[star]] are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. A similar phenomenon occurs for [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]. As the electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons. This is manifested in the [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] spectrum of [[nebula]]e. Today, scientists use this phenomenon to observe what elements a certain star is composed of. It is also used in the determination of the distance of a star, using the [[red shift]].

=== Speed of propagation ===
{{main|Speed of light}}

Any electric charge which accelerates, or any changing magnetic field, produces electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic information about the charge travels at the speed of light. Accurate treatment thus incorporates a concept known as [[retarded time]] (as opposed to advanced time, which is unphysical in light of [[causality]]), which  adds to the expressions for the electrodynamic [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]]. These extra terms are responsible for electromagnetic radiation. When any wire (or other conducting object such as an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]) conducts [[alternating current]], electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the electric current. At the quantum level, electromagnetic radiation is produced when the wavepacket of a charged particle oscillates or otherwise accelerates. Charged particles in a [[stationary state]] do not move, but a superposition of such states may result in oscillation, which is responsible for the phenomenon of radiative transition between quantum states of a charged particle.

Depending on the circumstances, electromagnetic radiation may behave as a [[wave]] or as [[photon|particle]]s.  As a wave, it is characterized by a velocity (the [[speed of light]]), [[wavelength]], and [[frequency]].   When considered as particles, they are known as [[photon]]s, and each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by [[Max Planck|Planck's]] relation ''E = hν'', where ''E'' is the energy of the photon, ''h'' = 6.626 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J·s is [[Planck's constant]], and ''ν'' is the frequency of the wave.

One rule is always obeyed regardless of the circumstances: EM radiation in a vacuum always travels at the [[speed of light]], ''relative to the observer'', regardless of the observer's velocity. (This observation led to [[Albert Einstein]]'s development of the theory of [[special relativity]].)

In a medium (other than vacuum), [[velocity of propagation|velocity factor]] or [[refractive index]] are considered, depending on frequency and application.  Both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum.

== Thermal radiation and electromagnetic radiation as a form of heat ==
{{main|Thermal radiation}}

The basic structure of [[matter]] involves charged particles bound together in many different ways. When electromagnetic radiation is incident on matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy depends on the situation. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may also get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to [[thermal equilibrium]] and manifesting itself as thermal energy in the material. With a few exceptions such as [[fluorescence]], [[harmonic generation]], [[photochemical reaction]]s and the [[photovoltaic effect]], absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by heating the material. This happens both for infrared and non-infrared radiation. Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food. In addition to infrared [[lasers]], sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet lasers can also easily set paper afire. Ionizing electromagnetic radiation can create high-speed electrons in a material and break chemical bonds, but after these electrons collide many times with other atoms in the material eventually most of the energy gets downgraded to thermal energy, this whole process happening in a tiny fraction of a second. That infrared radiation is a form of heat and other electromagnetic radiation is not, is a widespread [[misconception]] in physics. ''Any'' electromagnetic radiation can heat a material when it is absorbed.

The inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is responsible for thermal radiation. Much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged particles, and this energy can be radiated away from the matter. The resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of matter, with the deposited energy heating the material. Radiation is an important mechanism of [[heat transfer]].

The electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is effectively a form of thermal energy, having maximum [[entropy|radiation entropy]]. The [[thermodynamic potentials]] of electromagnetic radiation can be well-defined as for matter. Thermal radiation in a cavity has energy density (see [[Planck's Law]]) of

:&lt;math&gt;{U\over V} = \frac{8\pi^5(kT)^4}{15 (hc)^3},&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the above with respect to temperature, we may say that the electromagnetic radiation field has an effective volumetric [[heat capacity]] given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{32\pi^5 k^4 T^3}{15 (hc)^3},&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, EM radiation (the designation 'radiation' excludes static electric and magnetic and [[near and far field|near fields]]) is classified by wavelength into [[radio]], [[microwave]], [[infrared]], the [[visible region]] we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma rays]]. Arbitrary electromagnetic waves can always be expressed by [[Fourier analysis]] in terms of sinusoidal monochromatic waves which can be classified into these regions of the spectrum. 

The behavior of EM radiation depends on its wavelength.  Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EM radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.
[[Spectroscopy]] can detect a much wider region of the EM spectrum than the visible range of 400&amp;nbsp;nm to 700&amp;nbsp;nm.  A common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2&amp;nbsp;nm to 2500&amp;nbsp;nm. Detailed information about the physical properties of objects, gases, or even stars can be obtained from this type of device. It is widely used in [[astrophysics]]. For example, [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emit]] [[radio wave]]s of [[wavelength]] 21.12 [[centimetre|cm]].

'''Soundwaves are not electromagnetic radiation.''' At the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum, about 20 Hz to about 20kHz, are frequencies that might be considered in the audio range, however, electromagnetic waves cannot be directly perceived by human ears. Sound waves are the osscilating compression of molecules. To be heard, electromagnetic radiation must be converted to air pressure waves, or if the ear is submerged, water pressure waves.

=== Light ===
{{main|Light}}

EM radiation with a [[wavelength]] between approximately 400 [[nanometre|nm]] and 700&amp;nbsp;nm is directly detected by the [[human]] [[eye]] and perceived as visible [[light]]. Other wavelengths, especially nearby infrared (longer than 700&amp;nbsp;nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 400&amp;nbsp;nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when visibility to humans is not relevant.

If radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off of an object, say, a bowl of fruit, and then strikes our eyes, this results in our [[visual perception]] of the scene. Our brain's visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues, and through this not-entirely-understood psychophysical phenomenon, most people perceive a bowl of fruit.

At most wavelengths, however, the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses.  Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum, and our technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths. [[Optical fiber]] transmits light which, although not suitable for direct viewing, can carry data that can be translated into sound or an image. The coding used in such data is similar to that used with radio waves.

=== Radio waves ===
Radio waves can be made to carry information by varying a combination of the [[amplitude]], frequency and phase of the wave within a frequency band.

When EM radiation impinges upon a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], it couples to the conductor, travels along it, and [[radio frequency induction|induces]] an electric current on the surface of that conductor by exciting the electrons of the conducting material. This effect (the [[skin effect]]) is used in antennas. EM radiation may also cause certain molecules to absorb energy and thus to heat up; this is exploited in [[microwave oven]]s.

== Derivation ==
Electromagnetic waves as a general phenomenon were predicted by the classical laws of [[electricity]] and magnetism, known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. If you inspect Maxwell's equations without sources (charges or currents) then you will find that, along with the possibility of nothing happening, the theory will also admit nontrivial solutions of changing electric and magnetic fields. Beginning with Maxwell's equations for [[free space]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0  \qquad \qquad \qquad \ \ (1)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}  \qquad \qquad \ (2)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \qquad \qquad \qquad \ \ (3)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}  \qquad \quad \ (4)&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is a vector differential operator (see [[Del]]).

One solution,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;,
is trivial.

To see the more interesting one, we utilize [[List of vector identities|vector identities]], which work for any vector, as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \right) = \nabla \left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} \right) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

To see how we can use this take the curl of equation (2):

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} \right) = \nabla \times \left(-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \right) \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ \ (5) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the left hand side:

::&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} \right) = \nabla\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \right) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} =  - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} \qquad \ \ (6) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where we simplified the above by using equation (1).

Evaluate the right hand side:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \right) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \right) = -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} \quad \ \ \ \ (7)&lt;/math&gt;

Equations (6) and (7) are equal, so this results in a vector-valued [[differential equation]] for the electric field, namely

::{|cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border:2px solid #ccccff&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Applying a similar pattern results in similar differential equation for the magnetic field:

::{|cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border:2px solid #ccccff&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

These differential equations are equivalent to the [[wave equation]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the speed of the wave in free space and
::''f'' describes a displacement

Or more simply:
::&lt;math&gt;\Box f = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; is [[d'Alembert operator|d'Alembertian]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\Box = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \ &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that in the case of the electric and magnetic fields, the speed is:

::&lt;math&gt;c_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which, as it turns out, is the [[speed of light]] in free space. Maxwell's equations have unified the permittivity of free space &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, the permeability of free space &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the speed of light itself, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Before this derivation it was not known that there was such a strong [[Electromagnetic wave equation|relationship]] between light and electricity and magnetism.

But these are only two equations and we started with four, so there is still more information pertaining to these waves hidden within Maxwell's equations. Let's consider a generic vector wave for the electric field.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the constant amplitude, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is any second differentiable function, &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction of propagation, and &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{x}} &lt;/math&gt;is a position vector. We observe that &lt;math&gt;f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right)&lt;/math&gt; is a generic solution to the wave equation. In other words
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right)&lt;/math&gt;,
for a generic wave traveling in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; direction.

This form will satisfy the wave equation, but will it satisfy all of Maxwell's equations, and with what corresponding magnetic field?

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{E}_0 f'\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The first of Maxwell's equations implies that electric field is orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \hat{\mathbf{k}} \times \mathbf{E}_0 f'\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c_0} \hat{\mathbf{k}} \times \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

The second of Maxwell's equations yields the magnetic field. The remaining equations will be satisfied by this choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Not only are the electric and magnetic field waves traveling at the speed of light, but they have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes, &lt;math&gt;E_0 = c_0 B_0&lt;/math&gt;, which can be seen immediately from the [[Poynting vector]]. The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same direction as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

From the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left; but this picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. On a quantum level, it is described as [[photon polarization]].

'''Electron ionization''' ('''EI''', formerly known as '''electron impact''') is an ionization method in which energetic [[electron]]s interact with gas phase atoms or molecules to produce [[ion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=electron ionization|file=E01999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is widely used in [[mass spectrometry]], particularly for gases and volatile [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]].

==Principle of operation==

[[Image:Schematic diagram of an EI ion source.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Diagram representing an electron ionization ion source]]

The following [[Phase (matter)|gas phase]] reaction describes the electron ionization process &lt;ref&gt;R. Davis, M. Frearson, (1987). ''Mass Spectrometry – Analytical Chemistry by Open Learning'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, London.&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;M + e^- \to M^{+\bullet} + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;

where M is the analyte molecule being ionized, e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is the electron and M&lt;sup&gt;+•&lt;/sup&gt; is the resulting ion.

In an EI ion source, electrons are produced through [[thermionic emission]] by heating a wire filament that has [[Current (electricity)|electric current]] running through it. The electrons are accelerated to 70 eV in the region between the filament and the entrance to the ion source block.  The accelerated electrons are then concentrated into a beam by being attracted to the trap electrode. The sample under investigation which contains the neutral molecules is introduced to the [[ion source]] in a perpendicular direction to the e- beam.  Close passage of highly energetic electrons, referred to as a &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt; ionization source, causes large fluctuations in the electric field around the neutral molecules and induces ionization and fragmentation &lt;ref&gt;K. Robinson &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; Undergraduate Instrumental Analysis, 6th ed. Marcel Drekker, New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[radical ion|radical cation]] products are then directed towards the mass analyzer by a repeller electrode.  The ionization process often follows predictable cleavage reactions that give rise to fragment ions which, following detection and signal processing, convey structural information about the analyte. 

The ionization efficiency and production of fragment ions depends strongly on the chemistry of the analyte and the [[energy]] of the electrons. At low energies (around 20 [[Electronvolt|eV]]), the interactions between the electrons and the analyte molecules do not transfer enough energy to cause ionization. At around 70 eV, the [[Louis-Victor de Broglie|de Broglie]] [[wavelength]] of the electrons matches the length of typical bonds in organic molecules (about 0.14 nm) and energy transfer to organic analyte molecules is maximized, leading to the strongest possible ionization and fragmentation. Under these conditions, about 1 in 1000 analyte molecules in the source are ionized. At higher energies, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons becomes smaller than the bond lengths in typical analytes; the molecules then become &quot;transparent&quot; to the electrons and ionization efficiency decreases.

[[Image:Cont dynode detector.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|Continuous dynode electron multiplier]]
An '''electron multiplier''' is a vacuum-tube structure that multiplies incident charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1063/1.1740838 | title = An Improved Electron Multiplier Particle Counter | year = 1947 | last1 = Allen | first1 = James S. | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 18 | pages = 739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a process called [[secondary emission]], a single [[electron]] can, when bombarded on secondary emissive material, induce emission of roughly 1 to 3 [[electron]]s. If an [[electric potential]] is applied between this metal plate and yet another, the emitted electrons will accelerate to the next metal plate and induce [[secondary emission]] of still more electrons. This can be repeated a number of times, resulting in a large shower of electrons all collected by a metal anode, all having been triggered by just one. 

==Operation==

The avalanche can be triggered by any charged particle hitting the starting electrode with sufficient energy to cause secondary emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.55.966 | title = The Detection of Single Positive Ions, Electrons and Photons by a Secondary Electron Multiplier | year = 1939 | last1 = Allen | first1 = James | journal = Physical Review | volume = 55 | pages = 966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the electron multiplier is often used as an ion detector.  It could also be triggered by a photon causing vacuum photoemission of at least one electron.  In a [[photomultiplier]] tube, a photo-emissive surface is followed by an electron multiplier with several sequential multiplying electrodes called dynodes. Because these electrodes are separate from each other, this might be called a &quot;discrete-dynode&quot; multiplier. A voltage divider chain of resistors is usually used to place each dynode at a potential 100-200v more positive than the previous one.

[[File:Electron multiplier.svg|thumb|right|The Continuous Electron Multiplier]]

A &quot;continuous-dynode&quot; structure is feasible if the material of the electrodes has a high resistance, so that the functions of secondary-emission and voltage-division are merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1063/1.1716957 | title = Resistance Strip Magnetic Photomultiplier for the Extreme Ultraviolet | year = 1960 | last1 = Heroux | first1 = L. | last2 = Hinteregger | first2 = H. E. | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 31 | pages = 280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often built as a funnel of glass coated inside with a thin film of semi-conducting material, with negative high voltage applied at the wider input end, and positive voltage near ground applied at the narrower output end.  Electrons emitted at any point are accelerated a modest distance down the funnel before impacting the surface, perhaps on the opposite side of the funnel.  At the destination end a separate electrode (anode) remains necessary to collect the multiplied electrons. This structure is also known as (single) channel electron multiplier (CEM), and one of the most common is sold under the trade name Channeltron.

Another geometry of continuous-dynode electron multiplier is called the [[microchannel plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1063/1.1683743 | title = Collection Efficiency of Continuous Dynode Electron Multiple Arrays | year = 1969 | last1 = Burroughs | first1 = E. G. | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 40 | pages = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1016/0029-554X(79)90734-1 | title = Microchannel plate detectors | year = 1979 | last1 = Ladislas Wiza | first1 = J | journal = Nuclear Instruments and Methods | volume = 162 | pages = 587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be considered a 2-dimensional parallel array of very small continuous-dynode electron multipliers, built together and powered in parallel too. Each microchannel is generally parallel-walled, not tapered or funnel-like.

==Applications==

In [[mass spectrometry]] electron multipliers are often used as a detector of ions that have been separated by a mass analyzer of some sort. They can be of the continuous-dynode type, and may have a curved horn-like funnel shape, or they can have discrete dynodes as in a [[photomultiplier]].

'''Electron paramagnetic resonance''' (EPR) or '''electron spin resonance''' (ESR) [[spectroscopy]] 
is a technique for studying [[chemical species]] that have one or more unpaired [[electron]]s, such as organic and inorganic [[free radical]]s or [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] possessing a [[transition metal]] [[ion]]. The basic physical concepts of EPR are analogous to those of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), but it is electron spins that are excited instead of [[spin (physics)|spin]]s of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].  Because most stable molecules have all their electrons paired, the EPR technique is less widely used than NMR.  However, this limitation to [[paramagnetic]] species also means that the EPR technique is one of great specificity, since ordinary chemical solvents and matrices do not give rise to EPR spectra.

EPR was first observed in [[Kazan State University]] by the [[Soviet]] physicist [[Yevgeniy Zavoyskiy]] in 1944, and was developed independently  at the same time by [[Brebis Bleaney]] at [[Oxford University]].

[[Image:EPR spectometer.JPG|thumb|right|300px||EPR [[spectrometer]]]]

==EPR theory==
=== Units and constants ===

* [[Magnetic field]] strength is denoted by ''B'' or ''B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and is measured in [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (T) in the [[SI]] system. However, in EPR spectroscopy fields are commonly reported using the [[CGS]] unit the [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] (G), where 1 G = 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; T.
* [[Planck's constant]] ''h'' = 6.6261 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J s
* [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k'' = 1.3807 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Bohr magneton]] ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 9.2740 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; J T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Origin of an EPR signal ===

Every electron has a [[magnetic moment]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[quantum number]] s = 1/2, with magnetic components m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2 and m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;ndash;1/2.  In the presence of an external magnetic field with strength ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the electron's magnetic moment aligns itself either parallel (m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;ndash;1/2) or antiparallel (m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2) to the field, each alignment having a specific energy (see the [[Zeeman effect]]). The parallel alignment corresponds to the lower energy state, and the separation between it and the upper state is &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''E = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron's so-called [[g-factor]] (see also the [[Landé g-factor|Landé ''g''-factor]]).  This equation implies that the splitting of the energy levels is directly proportional to the [[magnetic field]]'s strength, as shown in the diagram below.
[[Image:EPR splitting.jpg|centre|300 px||Splitting of electron spin states]]

An unpaired electron can move between the two energy levels by either absorbing or emitting  electromagnetic radiation of energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; such that the resonance condition, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;E, is obeyed.  Substituting in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;''E = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' leads to the fundamental equation of EPR spectroscopy: ''h&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Experimentally, this equation permits a large combination of frequency and magnetic field values, but the great majority of EPR measurements are made with microwaves in the 9000 &amp;ndash; 10000&amp;nbsp;MHz (9 &amp;ndash; 10&amp;nbsp;GHz) region, with fields corresponding to about 3500 G (0.35 T).  See below for other field-frequency combinations.

In principle, EPR spectra can be generated by either varying the photon frequency incident on a sample while holding the magnetic field constant, or doing the reverse.  In practice, it is usually the frequency which is kept fixed. A collection of [[paramagnetic]] centers, such as free radicals, is exposed to microwaves at a fixed frequency.  By increasing an external magnetic field, the gap between the m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = +1/2 and m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;ndash;1/2 energy states is widened until it matches the energy of the microwaves, as represented by the double-arrow in the diagram above.  At this point the unpaired electrons can move between their two spin states.  Since there typically are more electrons in the lower state, due to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (see below), there is a net absorption of energy, and it is this absorption which is monitored and converted into a spectrum.

[[Image:EPR lines.png|right|300 px]]

As an example of how ''&lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be used, consider the case of a free electron, which has ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.0023,&lt;ref&gt;B. Odom et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. '''97''', 030801 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and the simulated spectrum shown at the right in two different forms.  For the microwave frequency of 9388.2&amp;nbsp;MHz, the predicted resonance position is a magnetic field of about ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; / ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.3350 tesla = 3350 gauss, as shown.  Note that while two forms of the same spectrum are presented in the figure, most EPR spectra are recorded and published only as first derivatives.

Because of electron-nuclear mass differences, the [[magnetic moment]] of an electron is substantially larger than the corresponding quantity for any nucleus, so that a much higher electromagnetic frequency is needed to bring about a spin resonance with an electron than with a nucleus, at identical magnetic field strengths.  For example, for the field of 3350 G shown at the right, spin resonance occurs near 9388.2&amp;nbsp;MHz for an electron compared to only about 14.3&amp;nbsp;MHz for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei.  (For NMR spectroscopy, the corresponding resonance equation is ''&lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' where ''g&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' depend on the nucleus under study.)

===Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution===

In practice, EPR samples consist of collections of many paramagnetic species, and not single isolated paramagnetic centers. If the population of radicals is in thermodynamic equilibrium, its statistical distribution is described by the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ n_\text{upper} }{ n_\text{lower} } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ E_\text{upper}-E_\text{lower} }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ \Delta E }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ \epsilon }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ h\nu }{ kT }\right) }&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_\text{ upper }&lt;/math&gt; is the number of paramagnetic centers occupying the upper energy state, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature in [[Kelvin]]. At 298 K, X-band microwave frequencies (&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 9.75&amp;nbsp;GHz) give &lt;math&gt;n_\text{upper} / n_\text{lower}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 0.998, meaning that the upper energy level has a smaller population than the lower one.  Therefore, transitions from the lower to the higher level are more probable than the reverse, which is why there is a net absorption of energy. 

The sensitivity of the EPR method (i.e., the minimum number of detectable spins &lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt;) depends on the photon frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt;N_{\text{min}} = \frac{k_1V}{Q_0k_f \nu^2 P^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the sample's volume, &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is the unloaded [[Q factor|quality factor]] of the microwave cavity (sample chamber), &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; is the cavity filling coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the microwave power in the spectrometer cavity. With &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; being constants, &lt;math&gt;N_min&lt;/math&gt; ~ &lt;math&gt;(Q_0\nu^2)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt; ~ &lt;math&gt;\nu^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.5. In practice, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can change vary from 0.5 to 4.5 depending on spectrometer characteristics, resonance conditions, and sample size. In other words, the higher the spectrometer frequency the lower the detection limit (&lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt;), meaning greater sensitivity.

==EPR spectral parameters==

In real systems, electrons are normally not solitary, but are associated with one or more atoms. There are several important consequences of this:
# An unpaired electron can gain or lose angular momentum, which can change the value of its ''g''-factor, causing it to differ from ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.  This is especially significant for chemical systems with transition-metal ions.
# If an atom with which an unpaired electron is associated has a non-zero nuclear spin, then its magnetic moment will affect the electron. This leads to the phenomenon of [[hyperfine coupling]], analogous to [[J-coupling]] in NMR, splitting the EPR resonance signal into doublets, triplets and so forth.
# Interactions of an unpaired electron with its environment influence the shape of an EPR spectral line.  Line shapes can yield information about, for example, rates of chemical reactions.
# The ''g''-factor and hyperfine coupling in an atom or molecule may not be the same for all orientations of an unparied electron in an external magnetic field.  This [[anisotropy]] depends upon the electronic structure of the atom or molecule (e.g., free radical) in question, and so can provide information about the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.

===The ''g'' factor===

Knowledge of the ''g''-[[lande g-factor|factor]] can give information about a paramagnetic center's electronic structure. An unpaired electron responds not only to a spectrometer's applied magnetic field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but also to any local magnetic fields of atoms or molecules. The effective field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; experienced by an electron is thus written

&lt;center&gt;''B''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1 - &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;'' includes the effects of local fields (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be positive or negative).  Therefore, the ''h&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;'' resonance condition (above) is rewritten as follows:

&lt;center&gt;''h&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''g&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1 - σ) &lt;/center&gt;

The quantity ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(1 - σ) is denoted ''g'' and called simply the ''g''-factor, so that the final resonance equation becomes

&lt;center&gt;''h&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = gμ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;

This last equation is used to determine ''g'' in an EPR experiment by measuring the field and the frequency at which resonance occurs. If ''g'' does not equal ''g''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; the implication is that the ratio of the unpaired electron's spin magnetic moment to its angular momentum differs from the free electron value.  Since an electron's spin magnetic moment is constant (approximately the Bohr magneton), then the electron must have gained or lost angular momentum through spin-orbit coupling.  Because the mechanisms of spin-orbit coupling are well understood, the magnitude of the change gives information about the nature of the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.

===Hyperfine coupling===

Since the source of an EPR spectrum is a change in an electron's spin state, it might be thought that all EPR spectra would consist of a single line.  However, the interaction of an unpaired electron, by way of its magnetic moment, with nearby nuclear spins, results in additional allowed energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra.  In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei.  The [[hyperfine coupling]] constant of a nucleus is directly related to the spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself.

Two common mechanisms by which electrons and nuclei interact are Fermi-contact interaction and dipolar interaction.  The former applies largely to the case of isotropic interactions (independent of sample orientation in a magnetic field) and the latter to the case of anisotropic interactions (spectra dependent on sample orientation in a magnetic field).  Spin polarization is a third mechanism for interactions between an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin, being especially important for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;-electron organic radicals, such as the benzene radical anion.  The symbols &quot;a&quot; or &quot;A&quot; are used for isotropic hyperfine coupling constants while &quot;B&quot; is usually employed for anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, &quot;a&quot; refers to the hyperfine splitting constant, a line spacing measured in magnetic field units, while A and B refer to hyperfine coupling constants measured in frequency units.  Splitting and coupling constants are proportional, but not identical.  The book by Wertz and Bolton has more information (pp. 46 and 442).&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the isotropic hyperfine splitting pattern for a radical freely tumbling in a solution (isotropic system) can be predicted.  

* For a radical having M equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of I, the number of EPR lines expected is 2MI + 1.  As an example, the methyl radical, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei each with I = 1/2, and so the number of lines expected is 2MI + 1 = 2(3)(1/2) + 1 = 4, which is as observed.

* For a radical having M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and a group of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of lines expected is (2M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1)(2M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1).  As an example, the methoxymethyl radical, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), has two equivalent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei each with I = 1/2 and three equivalent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei each with I = 1/2, and so the number of lines expected is (2M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1)(2M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1) = [2(2)(1/2) + 1][2(3)(1/2) + 1] = [3][4] = 12, again as observed.

[[Image:EPR methyl.jpg|right|400px||Simulated EPR spectrum of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical]]

* The above can be extended to predict the number of lines for any number of nuclei.

While it is easy to predict the number of lines a radical's EPR spectrum should show, the reverse problem, unraveling a complex multi-line EPR spectrum and assigning the various spacings to specific nuclei, is more difficult.  

In the oft-encountered case of I = 1/2 nuclei (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P), the line intensities produced by a population of radicals, each possessing M equivalent nuclei, will follow [[Pascal's triangle]].  For example, the spectrum at the right shows that the three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical give rise to 2MI + 1 = 2(3)(1/2) + 1 = 4 lines with a 1:3:3:1 ratio.  The line spacing gives a hyperfine coupling constant of a&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 23 G for each of the three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei.  Note again that the lines in this spectrum are ''first derivatives'' of absorptions.    

[[Image:EPR methoxymethyl.jpg|right|400px||Simulated EPR spectrum of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) radical]]
As a second example, consider the methoxymethyl radical,  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).  The two equivalent methyl hydrogens will give an overall 1:2:1 EPR pattern, each component which is further split by the three methoxy hydrogens into a 1:3:3:1 pattern to give a total of 3 x 4 = 12 lines, a triplet of quartets.  A simulation of the observed EPR spectrum is shown at the right, and agrees with the 12-line prediction and the expected line intensities.  Note that the smaller coupling constant (smaller line spacing) is due to the three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger coupling constant (line spacing) is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the unpaired electron.  It is often the case that coupling constants decrease in size with distance from a radical's unpaired electron, but there are some notable exceptions, such as the ethyl radical (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Resonance linewidth definition===

Resonance linewidths are defined in terms of the magnetic induction ''B'', and its corresponding units, and are measured along the ''x'' axis of an EPR spectrum, from a line's center to a chosen reference point of the line. These defined widths are called halfwidths and possess some advantages: for asymmetric lines values of left and right halfwidth can be given. The halfwidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_h&lt;/math&gt; is the distance measured from the line's center to the point in which [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] value has half of maximal absorption value in the center of [[resonance]] line. First inclination width &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; is a distance from center of  the line to the point of maximal absorption curve inclination. In practice, a full definition of linewidth is used. For symmetric lines, halfwidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_{1/2} = 2\Delta B_h&lt;/math&gt;, and full inclination width &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_{max} = 2\Delta B_{1s}&lt;/math&gt;

== EPR applications ==

EPR spectroscopy is used in various branches of science, such as [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], for the detection and identification of [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]]s and paramagnetic centers.  EPR is a sensitive, specific method for studying radicals thought to be formed in chemical reactions, and to identify the reactions themselves.  For example, when water ice (frozen H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is decomposed by exposure to high-energy radiation, radicals such as H, OH, and HO2 are produced.  Such radicals can be identified and studied by EPR.  Organic and inorganic radicals can be detected in electrochemical systems and in materials exposed to UV light.  In many cases, the reactions to make the radicals and the reactions of the radicals are of interest, while in other cases EPR is used to provide information on a radical's geometry and the orbital of the unpaired electron.  

[[medicine|Medical]] and [[biology|biological]] applications of EPR also exist.  Although radicals are very reactive, and so do not normally occur in high concentrations in biology, special reagents have been developed to spin-label molecules of interest.  These reagents are particularly useful in biological systems.  Specially-designed nonreactive radical molecules can attach to specific sites in a [[cell (biology)|biological cell]], and EPR spectra can then give information on the environment of these so-called [[spin label|spin-label]] or [[spin probe|spin-probes]].
 
EPR spectroscopy can only be applied to systems in which the balance between radical decay and radical formation keep a free radical's concentration above the detection limit of the spectrometer used.  This can be a particularly severe problem in studying reactions in liquids.  An alternative approach is to slow down reactions by studying samples held at [[cryogenic]] temperatures, such as 77 K ([[liquid nitrogen]]) or 4.2 K (liquid helium).  An example of this work is the study of radical reactions in single crystals of amino acids exposed to x-rays, work that leads to [[activation energy|activation energies]].

EPR also has been used by anthropologists for the dating of teeth.  Radiation damage over long periods of time creates free radicals in tooth enamel, which can then be examined by EPR and, after proper calibration, dated.

Radiation-sterilized foods have been examined with EPR spectroscopy, the aim being to develop methods to determine if a particular food sample has been irradiated and to what dose.

== High-field-high-frequency measurements ==

High-field-high-frequency EPR measurements are sometimes needed to detect subtle spectroscopic details. However, for many years the use of electromagnets to produce the needed fields above 1.5 T was impossible, due principally to limitations of traditional magnet materials. The first multifunctional millimeter EPR spectrometer with a superconducting solenoid was described in the early 1970s by Prof. Y. S. Lebedev's group (Russian [[Institute of Chemical Physics]], [[Moscow]]) in collaboration with L. G. Oranski's group (Ukrainen Physics and Technics Institute, Donetsk) which began working in the [[Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics]], [[Chernogolovka]] around 1975.[http://hf-epr.nytka.org] Two decades later, a W-band EPR spectrometer was produced as a small commercial line by the German [[Bruker|Bruker Company]] [http://www.bruker.de], initiating the expansion of W-band EPR techniques into medium-sized academic laboratories.  Today there still are only a few scientific centers in the world capable of high-field-high-frequency EPR, among them are the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in [[Grenoble]], [[France]], the [[National High Magnetic Field Laboratory]] in [[Tallahassee]], [[USA]], the [[Leibniz-Institut für Festkörper- und Werkstoffforschung Dresden|IFW]] in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], the Institute of Physics of Complex Matter in [[Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]], and the Huygens Laboratory of [[Leiden University]] in [[the Netherlands]].

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The EPR waveband is stipulated by the frequency or wavelength of a spectrometer's microwave source (see Table).  

EPR experiments often are conducted at X and, less commonly, Q bands, mainly due to the ready availability of the necessary microwave components (which originally were developed for radar applications).  A second reason for widespread X and Q band measurements is that electromagnets can reliably generate fields up to about 1 tesla. However, the low spectral resolution over ''g''-factor at these wavebands limits the study of paramagnetic centers with comparatively low anisotropic magnetic parameters.  Measurements at &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 40&amp;nbsp;GHz, in the millimeter wavelength region, offer the following advantages:
 
# EPR spectra are simplified due to the reduction of second-order effects at high fields.
# Increase in orientation selectivity and sensitivity in the investigation of disordered systems.
# The informativity and precision of pulse methods, e.g., [[ENDOR]] also increase at high magnetic fields.
# Accessibility of spin systems with larger zero-field splitting due to the larger microwave quantum energy ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.
# The higher spectral resolution over ''g''-factor, which increases with irradiation frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and external magnetic field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is used to investigate the structure, polarity, and dynamics of radical microenvironments in spin-modified organic and biological systems through the [[spin label]] and probe method. The figure shows how spectral resolution improves with increasing frequency.
# Saturation of paramagnetic centers occurs at a comparatively low microwave polarizing field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, due to the exponential dependence of the number of excited spins on the radiation frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. This effect can be successfully used to study the relaxation and dynamics of paramagnetic centers as well as of superslow motion in the systems under study.
# The cross-relaxation of paramagnetic centers decreases dramatically at high magnetic fields, making it easier to obtain more-precise and more-complete information about the system under study.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://hf-epr.nytka.org High-Frequency EPR Group] of the Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences for more information about high-field EPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''emission spectrum''' of a chemical element or chemical compound is the relative intensity of each frequency of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the element's atoms or the compound's molecules when they are returned to a ground state.

Each element's emission spectrum is unique. Therefore, spectroscopy can be used to identify the elements in matter of unknown composition. Similarly, the emission spectra of molecules can be used in chemical analysis of substances.

==Emission (Light)==
In [[physics]], '''emission''' is the process by which [[energy]] in the form of a [[photon]] is released by a particle, for example, by an [[atom]] whose [[electron]]s make a transition between two electronic [[energy level]]s. The emitted energy is in the form of a photon with a specific frequency.
The [[Beam emittance|emittance]] of an object quantifies how much light is emitted by it. This may be related to other properties of the object through the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]].
For most substances, the amount of emission varies with the [[temperature]] and the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic composition]] of the object, leading to the appearance of [[color temperature]] and [[emission lines]]. Precise measurements at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via [[emission spectroscopy]].

==Origins==
When the [[electrons]] in the atom are excited, for example by being heated, the additional [[energy]] pushes the electrons to higher energy orbits. When the electrons fall back down and leave the excited state, energy is re-emitted in the form of a [[photon]].  The wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency) of the photon is determined by the difference in energy between the two states.  These emitted photons form the element's emission spectrum.  

The fact that only certain colors appear in an element's atomic emission spectrum means that only certain frequencies of light are emitted. Each of these frequencies are related to energy by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\text{photon}} = h\nu,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the energy of the photon, ''ν'' is its [[frequency]], and ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].
This concludes that only [[photon]]s having certain energies are emitted by the atom. The principle of the atomic emission spectrum explains the varied colors in [[neon sign]]s, as well as chemical [[flame test]] results mentioned above.

The frequencies of light that an atom can emit are dependent on states the electrons can be in. When excited, an electron moves to a higher energy level/orbital. When the electron falls back to its ground level the light is emitted.

===Radiation from molecules===
As well as the electronic transitions discussed above, the energy of a molecule can also change via [[Rotational transition|rotational]], [[Vibrational transition|vibrational]], and [[Vibronic transition|vibronic]] (combined vibrational and electronic) transitions.  These energy transitions often lead to closely-spaced groups of many different spectral lines, known as [[spectral bands]].  Unresolved band spectra may appear as a spectral continuum.

Molecular emission is the mechanism behind the [[sulfur lamp]] and the [[deuterium arc lamp]].

==Emission spectroscopy==
Light consists of electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths. Therefore, when the elements or their compounds are heated either on a flame or by an electric arc they emit energy in form of light. Analysis of this light, with the help of [[spectroscope]] gives us a discontinuous spectrum. A spectroscope or a spectrometer is an instrument which is used for separating the components of light, which have different wavelengths. The spectrum appears in a series of lines called the line spectrum. This line spectrum is also called the Atomic Spectrum because it originates in the element. Each element has a different atomic spectrum. The production of line spectra by the atoms of an element indicate that an atom can radiate only a certain amount of energy. This leads to the conclusion that electrons cannot have just any amount of energy but only a certain amount of energy.

The emission spectrum can be used to determine the composition of a material, since it is different for each [[Chemical element|element]] of the [[periodic table]]. One example is [[astronomical spectroscopy]]: identifying the composition of [[star]]s by analysing the received light.
The emission spectrum characteristics of some elements are plainly visible to the naked eye when these elements are heated. For example, when platinum wire is dipped into a [[strontium]] nitrate solution and then inserted into a flame, the strontium atoms emit a red color. Similarly, when [[copper]] is inserted into a flame, the flame becomes green. These definite characteristics allow elements to be identified by their atomic emission spectrum. Not all lights emitted by the spectrum are viewable to the naked eye, it also includes ultra violet rays and infra red lighting,
an emission  is formed when an excited gas is viewed directly though a spectroscope.

'''Emission spectroscopy''' is a [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technique which examines the wavelengths of [[photon]]s emitted by atoms or molecules during their transition from an [[excited state]] to a lower energy state. Each element emits a characteristic set of discrete wavelengths according to its [[electronic structure]], by observing these wavelengths the elemental composition of the sample can be determined. Emission spectroscopy developed in the late 19th century and efforts in theoretical explanation of atomic emission spectra eventually led to [[quantum mechanics]].

There are many ways in which atoms can be brought to an excited state. Interaction with electromagnetic radiation is used in [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], protons or other heavier particles in [[Particle-Induced X-ray Emission]] and electrons or X-ray photons in [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[X-ray fluorescence]]. The simplest method is to heat the sample to a high temperature, after which the excitations are produced by collisions between the sample atoms. This method is used in [[flame emission spectroscopy]], and it was also the method used by [[Anders Jonas Ångström]] when he discovered the phenomenon of discrete emission lines in 1850s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Although the emission lines are caused by a transition between quantized energy states and may at first look very sharp, they do have a finite width, i.e. they are composed of more than one wavelength of light. This [[spectral line broadening]] has many different causes.

'''Emission spectroscopy''' is often referred to as '''optical emission spectroscopy''', due to the light nature of what is being emitted.

==History==

Emission lines from hot gases were first discovered{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} by [[Anders Jonas Ångström|Ångström]], and the technique was further developed by [[David Alter]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]].

See [[spectrum analysis]] for details.

==Experimental technique in flame emission spectroscopy==

The solution containing the relevant substance to be analysed is drawn into the burner and dispersed into the flame as a fine spray.  The solvent evaporates first, leaving finely divided [[solid]] particles which move to hottest region of the flame where gaseous [[atoms]] and [[ions]] are produced.  Here [[electrons]] are excited as described above.  It is common for a [[monochromator]] to be used to allow for easy detection.

On a simple level, flame emission spectroscopy can be observed using just a [[Bunsen burner]] and samples of metals.  For example, [[sodium]] metal placed in the flame will glow yellow, whilst [[calcium]] metal particles will glow red, and [[copper]] placed into the flame will create a green flame.

==Emission coefficient==
'''Emission coefficient''' is a [[coefficient]] in the power output per unit time of an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] source, a calculated value in [[physics]]. It is also used as a measure of [[natural environment|environmental]] emissions (by mass) per MWh of [[electricity generation|electricity generated]], see: [[Emission factor]].

=== Scattering of light ===

In [[Thomson scattering]] a charged particle emits radiation under incident light. The particle may be an ordinary atomic electron, so emission coefficients have practical applications.

If '''''X''''' d''V'' dΩ dλ is the energy scattered by a volume element d''V'' into solid angle dΩ between wavelengths λ and λ+dλ per unit time then the Emission [[coefficient]] is '''''X'''''.

The values of '''''X''''' in Thomson scattering can be [[Thomson scattering|predicted]] from incident flux, the density of the charged particles and their Thomson differential cross section (area/solid angle).
   
=== Spontaneous Emission ===

A warm body emitting photons has a monochromatic emission coefficient relating its temperature and total power radiation, this is sometimes called the second &quot;Einstein coefficient&quot;, and can be deduced from quantum mechanical theory.

==Energy spectrum==
An '''energy spectrum''' is a distribution energy among a large assemblage of particles.    It is a statistical representation of the wave energy as a function of the wave frequency, and an empirical estimator of the spectral function. For any given value of energy, it determines how many of the particles have that much energy.

The particles may be atoms, photons or a flux of elementary particles.

The [[Schrödinger equation]] and a set of boundary conditions form an eigenvalue problem. A possible value ('''''E''''') is called an eigenenergy. A non-zero solution of the [[wave function]] is called an eigenenergy state, or simply an [[eigenstate]]. The set of eigenvalues {'''''E'''''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;} is called the energy spectrum of the particle. 

The electromagnetic spectrum can also be represented as the distribution of electromagnetic radiation according to energy. The relationship among the wavelength (usually denoted by Greek &quot;&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&quot;), the frequency (usually denoted by Greek &quot;&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;&quot;), and the energy '''''E''''' are:

: &lt;math&gt;E = h \nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the speed of light and ''h'' is Planck's Constant.

An example of an energy spectrum in the physical domain is ocean waves breaking on the shore. For any given interval of time it can be observed that some of the waves are larger than others. Plotting the number of waves against the amplitude (height) for the interval will yield the energy spectrum of the set.&lt;ref name=energy-spectrum/&gt; 

=== Optical Spectroscopy and Astrophysics Application ===
Energy spectra are often used in astrophysical spectroscopy.  &lt;blockquote&gt;
The quantity plotted, energy units, is the wavelength times the energy per unit wavelength and thus accurately represents the amount of energy at any wavelength. The energy per unit wavelength and the energy per unit frequency peak at significantly different wavelengths due the reciprocal relation between frequency and wavelength. Using energy units avoids this problem, since (wavelength * flux per unit wavelength) = (frequency * flux per unit frequency). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some modern spectrophotometers, such as the Perkin Elmer 950, include an energy scan option.  This is additionally useful in cases where a reference cell is not practical or when absorbance / transmittance is off-scale.

=== Description ===

A comprehensive set of measures is developed to assess an innovation’s locus, type, and characteristics. The measure described on this page is one of these measures. It is found that the concepts of competence destroying and competence enhancing are composed of two distinct constructs that, although correlated, separately characterize an innovation: new competence acquisition and competence enhancement/destruction. Scales are developed to measure these constructs and show that new competence acquisition and competence enhancing/destroying are different from other innovation characteristics including core/peripheral and incremental/radical, as well as architectural and generational innovation types.

Following the typical process of scale construction, the empirical analysis is divided into four stages:
#content face validity analysis with expert judges.
#scale puriﬁcation through exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis.
#assessment of discriminant and convergent validity through analysis of covariance structures.
#nomological validity through the analysis of the effect of innovation characteristics on time to introduction and commercial success.

=== Definition ===

New competence acquisition concerns the extent to which the innovation requires the ﬁrm to reach beyond its existing experience base to acquire new competences.

=== Items ===

*INNOVATION involved fundamentally new concepts or principles for BUSINESS UNIT.

=== Description ===

A comprehensive set of measures is developed to assess an innovation’s locus, type, and characteristics. The measure described on this page is one of these measures. It is found that the concepts of competence destroying and competence enhancing are composed of two distinct constructs that, although correlated, separately characterize an innovation: new competence acquisition and competence enhancement/destruction. Scales are developed to measure these constructs and show that new competence acquisition and competence enhancing/destroying are different from other innovation characteristics including core/peripheral and incremental/radical, as well as architectural and generational innovation types.

Following the typical process of scale construction, the empirical analysis is divided into four stages:
#content face validity analysis with expert judges.
#scale puriﬁcation through exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis.
#assessment of discriminant and convergent validity through analysis of covariance structures.
#nomological validity through the analysis of the effect of innovation characteristics on time to introduction and commercial success.

=== Items ===

*INNOVATION was successfully implemented by UNIT.
*INNOVATION has been commercially successful for UNIT.
*INNOVATION has met UNIT’s expectations regarding the innovation’s impact on sales.

== Discussion on talk page of bookshelf ==
 
For several years the main place to discuss language books has been the
[[Wikibooks_talk:Languages_bookshelf]]. However, since the bookshelves are phased out, we might consider to close that discussion and continue here? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:45, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

Agreed
[[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 12:27, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

== Standards and Problems ==

I have to admit that I'm very skeptical about the idea of standardizing language learning books. There has been quite some discussion on this on the [[Wikibooks_talk:Languages_bookshelf]] but I think these are good ideas and suggestions, but nothing more, not even guidelines. 

For example, I have worked a lot on the German wikibook about Spanish, which is a grammar book instead of a language course. Nonetheless, it is one of the most successful German wikibooks. I also worked on the English wikibook [[Spanish_by_Choice]], which is far from a language course, but which is rather popular in the form of PDFs distributed via a podcast. 

In my opinion, instead of focusing on a standard for language learning books, we should focus on the real problems: How to get authentic, interesting content? How to get audio files? How to implement exercises? There are many difficult challenges when writing a language learning book on wikibooks; establishing a standard is not part of it. 

--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:45, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:I'm trying to take ideas that most of the wikibooks I've seen have attempted to do already.  For those guidelines I'm referring to the general language course style books, rather than grammar books or those teaching more specific topics.  I don't want to make drastic changes to anything, I want to make a sort of 'aim' for any new wikibooks to make it easier to get them written, and to create a clear direction for those being improved, as many of the original contributors are no longer around.  It seems to me as if the books are mostly going to be edited by newcomers now, and because they can't start books from scratch with their own ideas (because they've already been half-written for years), wikibooks are more attractive if it looks like there's an active community for their topic and they have a clear idea of what improvements they should be making.  So rather than a standard, I see it more as a goal for newcomers who are daunted by the task of a half-written book in someone else's style.

:--[[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 12:23, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::Well, one 'aim' would be to have more recordings by native speakers. And a cleaner layout. I think I should shut up and start working on the [[German]] wikibook. :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:40, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

Complete standardization of such a widely varied topic is sure to be damn near impossible. Structures in some languages are more complex than in others, and structures commonly used in one language may be rare in another. It makes more sense in Esperanto, for example, to introduce past and future tenses of verbs before basic prepositions, which is not true in most languages. Providing sections with phrases and vocabulary relating to travelling (getting a taxi, asking directions, etc.) make perfect sense in languages like Spanish, French and Japanese, but make no sense in Esperanto (where in the world are you ever going to find a use for hiring a taxi in Esperanto?). Providing sections with phrases and vocabulary relating to asking people how they feel and how they are doing make sense in Spanish, French and Esperanto, but due to the nature of Japanese culture they avoid such probing questions more often than not. And so on and so forth. I agree with Mr. Kraus: ideas and suggestions, but nothing more - not even guidelines.

However, there are ''other'' ways you can promote standardization across language books that will be useful to both writers and readers. For example, it may be a good idea to create a set of standard language markup templates. In the Esperanto book I use {{tlx|lang eo}}. All it does is mark up whatever you supply in span tags that tell the browser what language the enclosed text is (eo is Esperanto), which may assist in font selection for display, and optionally adds some formatting to visually mark the word as non-English (italics). (It could also add whatever page it is used on to a category of pages that use that language, allowing experts to review whether the language is used correctly. There are a number of other possibilities for this trick.)

What I have been thinking of doing is creating a base &quot;language markup&quot; template (possibly {{tlx|lang}}) that is a standard base for all other language mark up templates - so that {{tlx|lang eo}} could be defined as simply as {{tlx|lang|eo}} (with all parameters being passed through: {{tlx|lang eo|style{{=}}whatever}} would be {{tlx|lang|eo|style{{=}}whatever}}). All other language books can then either use {{tlx|lang}} directly (as in: {{tlx|lang|fr}} for French), or, better yet, derive their own template based on it (as in: {{tlx|lang fr}} which in turn calls {{tlx|lang|fr}}).

If we do this, then, by default, all language books (that use such templates) could have a consistent look-and-feel whenever they display text in the other language (for example, the text could be italicized, unless specifically set not to), yet, if necessary, specific languages could override the default look-and-feel if they need to. It's not quite &quot;standardization&quot;, but it helps authors (by providing them an easy and consistent way to mark up foreign languages, and at the same time giving notice to experts that the language was used and thus might need to be checked) and it helps readers (by providing them with a consistent look-and-feel when foreign language phrases or words are used, and by giving their browser a clue how to render the text better).

Following on this logic, other templates could be created to mark up things like other-language-to-English translations in a consistent and pseudo-standardized way: {{tlx|translation eo|libro|book}} could expand to ''libro'' (&quot;book&quot;) and {{tlx|translation ja|本|book|translit=hon}} could expand to 本 (''hon'', &quot;book&quot;), both by way of a common {{tlx|translation}} template. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 13:11, 19 July 2010 (UTC)

:I goofed on the template display code for that Japanese example. It should be {{tlx|translation ja|本|book|translit{{=}}hon}}. I am going to be bold and create the templates, so that I can demonstrate with working examples. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 16:10, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

::Alright, this is how the basic {{tlx|lang}} template works, with {{tlx|lang|es|¡Hola!}}: {{lang|es|¡Hola!}}
::This is the {{tlx|lang fr}} template, which is based on {{tlx|lang}}, with {{tlx|lang fr|Salut!|style{{=}}color:green}}: {{lang fr|Salut!|style=color:green}}
::And this is how to turn off italicizing, with {{tlx|lang|de|Hallo!|style{{=}}font-style:normal}}: {{lang|de|Hallo!|style=font-style:normal}}
::All are marked up in the (X)HTML properly as the language they are supposed to be. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 16:42, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

::: Good idea; I'll add this to {{tlx|French/Inline word}} and possibly to {{tlx|French/Translations table}} instances via JavaScript. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 17:17, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

::::{{tlx|French/Translations table}} is another example of a useful language template that can be &quot;standardized&quot; - eventually (I'm not ready for it yet) I'll want something similar for the Esperanto wikibook, at which point I'll probably use {{tlx|French/Translations table}} as a base. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 12:55, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

==Sources==

Would it be useful to draw up a common list of reliable sources for each language? (including printed and online resources.) Books sometimes reference Wikipedia but I see that some articles have been tagged as lacking sufficient sources e.g. [[Wikipedia:French_articles_and_determiners]]. I also find forums like about.com and Wordreference.com very useful, but can they be used as sources? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 11:14, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:I use about.com a lot.  For vocabulary I mostly use wiktionary because I deem it more useful that non-collaborative dictionaries.  Grammar should be lying around in dictionary appendices. But I think a list of online sources at least would be good. [[User:Italienmoose|Italienmoose]] ([[User talk:Italienmoose|talk]]) 12:14, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

: I suppose the advantage of Wikipedia is that we are free to copy the material with suitable attributions. It just becomes a problem if it is deleted over there. Printed reference books have the advantage of stability over time, so I would say that they should be used in preference to online resources when naming sources for particular points of language. I have just bought &quot;A Comprehensive French Grammar&quot; by Glanville Price which I think is the kind of authoritative text that all contributors should have to hand. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:43, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

: A resource with content useful to all language books would make sense, but information regarding specific languages might be more useful on a contributor's guide for that book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 12:56, 25 December 2010 (UTC)

==Terminology==
I think the grammatical terminology in many references (including Wikipedia) is over-technical for direct use in our textbooks. Would it be useful to draw up a table mapping grammatical terminology onto plainer English phrases, which would be less offputting for the readers? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 11:14, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:I'm not a native English speaker; thus, I'm very interested in this. I once wrote an introduction to Spanish grammar: [[Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_grammar]]. What do you think of its terminology? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:43, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

::Assuming that your target audience is the same as for the podcasts (people with credit cards), then I think your terminology is fine. Though perhaps &quot;denote&quot; sounds a bit mathematical, and you could use &quot;are used for&quot; or &quot;indicate&quot; instead. One GCSE school text book I have seen, goes to great pains to avoid technical terminology, even avoiding terms like &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;conjugation&quot;! You probably don't need to go that far for your audience, and if you have followed the style of the podcasts themselves then everything can be justified with reference to those. For material aimed at a younger audience, a bit of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; might be appropriate. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:58, 6 June 2010 (UTC)

:::Do you think that it makes sense to avoid terms like &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;person&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;conjugation&quot;? After all, it doesn't hurt to learn the most basic grammar terms, does it? And no, the audience is not limited to people with credit cards (the only reason I am linking to a commercial web site is that the Creative Commons Attribution license requires me to do so). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 01:06, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

::::Which terms to use depends on the target audience for each book, and conversely the terms used contribute to defining the target audience. I am just suggesting that we could label different grammatical terms as say &quot;low&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;high&quot; difficulty and authors here could choose whatever level they thought was suitable for their book. Then if people were using source references with a more academic style than the style chosen for their book, they could easily map the terminology onto the appropriate level. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 18:34, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

: I doubt that would be productive. Decide whether the use of that term is useful and if so, then add a description to the language book directly, or improve Wikipedia if you reference it. If it can't be explained in-line, simpler terms won't cut it and a proper article with a detailed description and examples will be needed. There is a reason why we have the terminology.
: That said, this is a volunteer project. If you want to start such a reference, by all means do. Just realise the immense task and the small number of contributors. I'd encourage you to fix what we have rather than start another unfinished palace... --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:17, 24 December 2010 (UTC)

== Suggestions ==

Right off the bat, I'm sorry if creating this is a faux pas. I'm relatively new to the workings of Wiki sites, and I'm not familiar with the rules.
If everything's alright, I'll start. Other than the numerical ratings we're allowed to give, I haven't seen any areas where learners have given feedback on the content available at Wikibooks. There's no way to bring attention to the areas that need it. Provided that it's not some cardinal sin of Wikimedia, I'd like to start one so that those able to write may better know what to write.

Most sections of the [[Ukrainian]] book are heavier on examples than they are on rules. There are no guides to masculine/feminine, singular/plural, infinitive/past/present/future/command, and so on, and I find myself having to work with the (usually unclear) lessons I get from a Google search. If somebody familiar with the language could add more rules and exceptions to the book, especially the [[Ukrainian/Words|Ukrainian Words]] chapter, that would be much appreciated.
[[User:Ismailzali|Ismailzali]] ([[User talk:Ismailzali|talk]]) 15:12, 12 December 2010 (UTC)

: Welcome to Wikibooks and the world of wikis. There are few [[WB:PAG|rules]] but the best place to provide feedback is on the discussion page for the module (i.e. page) you're commenting on, or the main book talk page, should there be one. That said, most of the Wikibooks language books are dormant and lacking contributors. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 23:37, 15 December 2010 (UTC)

=Introduction=

The physical nature of engineering materials can be described by a set of measurable properties.  This chapter defines these measures and discusses their implications in a broad sense.  It also covers Material Science, i.e. the science of producing materials with intended properties, and outlines different types of engineering materials and their characteristic qualities.  Later in the book, some of these matters will be further investigated by the powerful theories of Continuum Mechanics, FEM etc., which will bring a much more potent and general understanding of solid materials.

=Introduction=

This section covers both qualitative and quantifiable physical properties of solids.

A viable knowledge of mechanical engineering rests on a basic understanding of engineering materials; and the behavior of such materials is the empirical foundation upon which the entire science of solid mechanics is built.  Although this is the very beginning, a basin of information is presented that facilitate powerful and sophisticated reasoning by even the simplest means.

=Introduction=

All solid materials display an approximately linear response to moderate loads.  This is manifested in Hooke's law:

 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_x = \frac{\sigma_x - \nu (\sigma_y + \sigma_z)}{E} &lt;/math&gt; 
 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_y = \frac{\sigma_y - \nu (\sigma_x + \sigma_z)}{E}  &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_z = \frac{\sigma_z - \nu (\sigma_x + \sigma_y)}{E} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sigma=&lt;/math&gt; the normal stress&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E=&lt;/math&gt; the elastic modulus (Young's modulus)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\epsilon=&lt;/math&gt; the normal tension

The figure below illustrates the stress-strain curve of some material.  Hooke's law is valid in the linear interval marked &quot;Elastic region&quot;.  The term elastic, as in elastic deformation, refers to the absence of energy dissipation and permanent deformation.  Elastic deformations retract upon unloading.  &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Tensile Testing=
{{stub}}
Young's modulus can be measured by tensile testing of specimens such as the one in the picture below.  

[[File:Traction sample.png|thumb|center|300px|Tensile testing.]]&lt;br&gt;

Equation (1) gives

 &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \epsilon} &lt;/math&gt;

Although, the procedure may seem perfectly straight forward at a glimpse, there are certain things that should be noted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Broad Implications=

As is the case with many elementary physical laws, Hooke's law, stating the linear correlation between load and deformation, spans the small and simple, and the big and complex.  For instance, the theory is a good approximation of simple test specimens subjected to axial loading.  Naturally, it is also an accurate physical model for linear springs.  And it is even valid for very complex structures, so long as they respond linearly.  These are all trivial and perhaps self-evident statements, yet they are powerful and important.   

==Load and Stress==

To expand on this, let's consider an initially stress free quasi-static linear-elastic mechanical system that is subjected to one load &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; which has some fixed direction and point of application.  The global equilibrium of the system is sustained by a pattern of internal stresses in the structure.  The specific shape of the stress pattern is required to achieve equilibrium at each point in the structure.  That is, if the stress magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; at some point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; differed from the equilibrium state &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; by a factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the system would automatically strive to reach the unique pattern of equilibrium.  One could however obtain a new equilibrium state that abides the new condition at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by altering the stress levels in the material surrounding &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by the same factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.  A state of equilibrium is thus reached if

\begin{equation} \sigma_i = k \sigma_{i0} \end{equation}

If the refactoring of the stress magnitudes is propagated throughout the system, including the point at which the load is applied, global equilibrium will be achieved.  Consequently, also the magnitude of the load itself would have to be altered by the factor &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in this scenario.  Hence we can write

&lt;math&gt; F = k F_0 &lt;/math&gt;     (2)

Equation () and () yields

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_i = \frac{\sigma_{i0} F}{F_0} = k_i F&lt;/math&gt;     (3)

Where &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. &lt;br&gt;

Equation () is only true if the normalized stress pattern is unaffected by the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; in the considered interval.  If instead, the system is nonlinear, i.e. responds differently depending on the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt;, equation () is not be true/reliable.

==Load and Strain==

Moreover, Hookes law and equation () gives us

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{xi} = \frac{\sigma_{xi} - \nu (\sigma_{yi} + \sigma_{zi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{xi} - \nu (k_{yi} + k_{zi})}{E} = F k'_{xi} &lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{yi} = \frac{\sigma_{yi} - \nu (\sigma_{xi} + \sigma_{zi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{yi} - \nu (k_{xi} + k_{zi})}{E} = F k'_{yi} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{zi} = \frac{\sigma_{zi} - \nu (\sigma_{xi} + \sigma_{yi})}{E}
= F \frac{k_{yi} - \nu (k_{xi} + k_{yi})}{E} = F k'_{zi} &lt;/math&gt;

==Load and Displacement==

Let's consider a path &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; that runs through a continuous linear elastic body.  &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; has two endpoints &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The relative change &lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12}&lt;/math&gt; in distance in some direction between the two points can be formulated

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F \int_{P_1}^{P_2} \! k(s) \, ds = F k_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

==Displacement and Strain==

From equation () and () we get

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F k_{12} = \frac{k_{12}}{k'_i} \epsilon_i = k'_{i12} \epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Displacement and Stress==

From equation () and () we get

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S_{12} = F k_{12} = \frac{k_{12}}{k_i} \sigma_i = k_{i12} \sigma_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalization==

Moving on to a more general point of view, we state the following definition 

&lt;math&gt;\psi = C \psi' &lt;/math&gt;     (3) 

Where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi'&lt;/math&gt; are some linearly dependent structural measures at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

From equation (3) and the superposition principle we conclude that

 &lt;math&gt;\psi = c_0 + c_1 \psi'_1 + c_2 \psi'_2 +...+ c_{n-1} \psi'_{n-1} + c_n \psi'_n&lt;/math&gt;     (4) 

The independent parameters of (4) can be obtained by performing &lt;math&gt;&gt;=n&lt;/math&gt; tests/calculations.  It follows that it is easy to, for instance, scale linear test results according to different safety factors.

It is important to know whether or not the structure is linear before drawing any critical conclusions from the theory of elasticity.  Common sources of non-linear behavior in a structure are material, geometric, contact and dynamic effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Additional Aspects=

The simplistic view on elasticity presented in this section is useful in many ways. It should be noted however, that it is incomplete. The chapter &lt;i&gt;Continuum Mechanics&lt;/i&gt; presents a theory of how 2D and 3D stress and strain fields interact.  Moreover, the material property &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, may be influenced by several factors, including: temperature, aging and rate of deformation. Therefore, keep in mind that there is more to come on this subject later on in the book.

A material's capacity to endure plastic deformation without breaking is called ductility.  Mild steel, copper and gold are all examples of ductile materials.  

The picture to the left displays a test specimen which has undergone a ductile failure during tensile load.

This looks to me like a violation of [[WB:HOST]].  So I'm bringing it here to get a reading on the question from the Wikibooks community. [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:35, 27 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment''': I've been studying the [[WB:HOST]], and I agree, in a strict sense it violate the paragraph of not publishing original research, there is text in the book which has never been published before. On the other hand most of the material in the book has been published in newspapers, radio programs, music articles and program notes for the scores, and the book is an attempt to collect all the different material in one place. We are very few who contributes to the book, and the main purpose of my contribution is to illustrate the text with scores and sound samples, which needs to be given the right license etc. [[User:Martin Lohse|Martin Lohse]] ([[User talk:Martin Lohse|talk]]) 07:55, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment''': Relevance of the book: An important tool in a composers development is the study of contemporary techniques of other composer, for inspiration or rejection, which makes a few but dedicated readers to the book. [[User:Martin Lohse|Martin Lohse]] ([[User talk:Martin Lohse|talk]]) 08:07, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} I think the operative text is '''Wikibooks pages are not Personal homepages.''' The issue is, I think, that we have a user with the name &quot;Martin Lohse&quot; writing a book about one &quot;Martin Lohse&quot;, a still-living composer. We do not know that the two &quot;Martin Lohse&quot;'s are the same person; a researcher could have taken his subject's name as a form of tribute. Not that that matters much; given the name similarity, we can assume identity for the nonce. In that case, is this work on Martin Lohse of academic value? Are there courses outside of Martin Lohse's studio that teach his music, and could this text be of use in such courses? I think that is what would distinguish a self-published academic work from a vanity homepage. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 08:15, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} While the concerns about [[WB:HOST]] are justified, I feel the proposal of the book is not necessarily a violation of project scope. It is definitely possible to present and discuss a topic starting from a particular application or a case study. Two loosely-related examples:
:* In a teacher-formation university course (don't know what the proper English term for that is) one could have a course on psychology of education entitled &quot;Psychoanalysis, Education and Culture&quot;. While the works on education written from the perspective of psychoanalysis are just a small subset of the overall body of knowledge in the area of psychology of education, studying them provides a framework for reflections about general, overarching questions on the subject.
:* Compare the following two wikibooks on the Haskell programming language: [[Haskell]] and [[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours]]. Both of them are intended to be tools for learning the language. While the former follows a more conventional textbook style, the latter proposes a rather arcane concrete task and presents the features and workings of Haskell as they are needed to perform the task. The approaches are very different, and aimed at different audiences, but are perfectly valid (both books are featured, BTW).
:In this spirit, a book that presented an overview and discussion of composition techniques in contemporary classical music using the works of Martin Lohse as a case study would, if properly referenced, be a valid proposition. That would probably require important changes in writing tone in some of the pages in order to &quot;de-personalize&quot; the text (and of course a renaming of the book), but such changes sound quite feasible at this point.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 19:14, 28 May 2010 (UTC)

:{{Comment}} There is some valid content there but the name and scope should be altered. Something in the lines &quot;The classical composer&quot;. I mostly agree with [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] but there are some particularities that make this even more problematic than the examples given. Sadly the author decided to focus the work only on this one subject recent creations, this can be seen as blatant self promotion or at least not having a NPOV and being OR, that puts in check any validity the project could have as an educational aid. There is still few content in there so I would be happy in having the book tagged as a breaking NPOV to see if the editor understands and fixes the issues, the project with the right editor could be extremely useful...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:53, 29 May 2010 (UTC)

:'''Comment''' - I have warned the author of OR, so I hope he will cite his sources to avoid being accused of it. However, OR and NPOV seem to be the only problems that I see. To a certain extent it can act as a self-study book for music enthusiasts. If it ''is'' a personal homepage, though, the book would focus on his life rather than his musical techniques. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 00:58, 29 May 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' to Wikiversity. The book could be improved and has valid content separating it from the strict scope it has is fundamental to be of any value here.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:37, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' to Wikiversity - it would have the additional benefit of giving the authors more leeway to structure the contents and interaction with &quot;developing composers&quot;. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 12:42, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:'''Transwiki''' - gee, why hadn't I thought of that? :) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 12:54, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol redirect vote.svg|15px]] '''Transwiki''' to Wikiversity. It's a good idea, what is the best way to make the transfer? For now, it would be nice to make the book with the contents as it is, and maybe later it would be possible to use some of the contents for a more general book about contemporary techniques in classical music, which, I think, could be a great book on wikibook.

{{closed|The result of the discussion was [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]]'''Non-admin closure''' (withdrawn by nom, which is me.) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ( [[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]] ) 02:27, 5 June 2010 (UTC)}}
I personally don't like this book. It is filled with nothing but four pictures. The first one is a funny-looking copyleft picture. The second one is a strange public domain pirate. The third one is a really odd mad scientist picture - looks like a copyvio of Dr Twobrains of WordGirl, in fact. &lt;/sarcasm&gt; The last one is the Wikipe-tan which I personally dislike and is not that suitable for Wikijunior. There is no target scope defined. Also, as a reference for everyone the previous nomination is at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Wikijunior:Coloring Book]], which I unfortunately was unable to participate in as I was at Wikipedia at the time. Also, as a 'reply' to Swift's comment in that discussion, I don't think colouring is anything but a preschool activity, which is intended to be fun for kids rather than educational. Unlike maths problems (I think (s)he is referring to the Mathematics Worksheets wikibook, whose exact name I've forgotten).

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''. My position remains the same as before; see the previous discussion for details, but it boils down to this not being textbook material.  ''What does it teach?''  The answer: nothing.  Why don't we make a book with crossword puzzles or a book with [[w:Sudoku|Sudoku]] puzzles?  That's not what Wikibooks is and I don't support this book, unchanged since a single creation edit in May 2007, being kept. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:14, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' nothing has changed since the last discussion in 3 March 2010. It seems to me that rehashing the discussion to be premature at this time, with all considerations to Kayau and Adrignola opinions. It was established that the work was inside the parameters of acceptable content (textbook is not a requirement of Wikijunior). Taste even if an acceptable argument will always have a low impact on the outcome of RfDs (consider what could happen otherwise) and regarding the educational value of this type of books it has also been addressed in the previous discussion.
:In any case since all images are now on commons, so no content will be lost, if we get a participation on this discussion of a similar size of the previous one, if I'm blocking, I'll change my vote.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:29, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I agree that nothing has changed since last time. Wikijunior does not require that books be textbooks, or in fact require books to be educational. Wikijunior books are only required to be fun for kids, which this book is for the right age group. I could also urge that for the right age group this book is educational because kids learn to color and to use their imagination. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:05, 4 June 2010 (UTC)
::Wikijunior is for educational material, period.  The original grant on which it was established was for education, and {{nowrap|[[Wikibooks:What is Wikijunior]]}} still makes it IMO quite clear that the purpose of Wikijunior is educational.  A non-educational project would be something completely different from the current project.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:36, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:Non-binding [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - There are two separate issues to consider here. The first one is that pre-school activities like colouring ''are'' educational. Otherwise why would teachers have the kids doing them? From my non-specialist point of view, I would go as far as saying that teaching colours and having the children exercise their creativity are just as important goals as, say, introducing them to maths. The &quot;not a textbook&quot; argument does not apply either - not standing as a standalone reading material for kids is not a problem; after all, pretty much any educational material for small kids will be meant to be used with supervision of teachers/parents/etc. That being said, I agree that this book qualifies as an undeveloped stub, given that it has just pictures without elaborating any useful context for kids or educators (and the pictures don't look that great for their intended purpose, either). For that reason, I state my vote as weak/non-binding, in the same spirit of Panic's. An alternative possibility to a keep/delete outcome would be a merge to some book in the vein of [[Wikijunior:Colors]], maybe as a page discretely linked from the [[Wikijunior:Colors/For Parents|For Parents]] page as an &quot;additional resource&quot;. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 14:45, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''  Reason for nomination last time was that this book is not educational, and the general sense seemed to be that coloring books are somewhat educational, some more than others, and this one needs improvement.  This seemed reasonable to me, as nominator that time around.  No book should be subjected to frequent RFDs for a non-urgent reason (for one thing it's apt to generate a certain level of background sympathy for the book), but especially not when the prospect of eventual improvement was woven into the arguments for keeping it.  It wouldn't be taken amiss if, at ''very'' long intervals (think, four or six months), one were to ping the community at the projects reading room about the need to improve this book.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:36, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

:: Tanks for putting it into words. I would support an addition to the deletion policy to protect books being repeatedly nominated for RfD. Not only is the reasons you state above valid, but it also unbalances the RfD process. Considering that after a deletion it is required to open a undeletion process and a Keep can be simply restarted. Some time protection could work, but consider the work under discussion, no change was made to the work or project rules, the statement made in the first discussion remain valid (probably making the arguments on past discussion count to the renewed process would work). I think putting some stronger words on the policy so to avoid rehashing would suffice, since this discussion outcome would probably be expected by a more experienced Wikibookian. As the active majority, extra care is needed to avoid creating unbalances and inconsistencies as they will always be unfair and disruptive.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:22, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

[[File:Definition of equivalent width.jpg|thumb|A diagram indicating the equivalent width corresponding to the absorption line, which is shown in red.]]

The '''equivalent width''' of a [[spectral line]] is a measure of the of the area of the line on plot of [[luminous intensity|intensity]] versus [[wavelength]]. It is found by forming a rectangle with a height equal to that of continuum emission, and finding the width such that the area of the rectangle is equal to the area in the spectral line. It is a measure of the strength of spectral features that is primarily used in [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name = &quot;co&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Carroll, Bradly; Ostlie, Dale | title = An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics | publisher = Pearson Addison-Wesley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0321442849 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=zaSpQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Formally, the equivalent width is given by the equation

&lt;math&gt;W_\lambda = \int (1 - F_\lambda / F_0) d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = &quot;formation_of_stars&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Stahler, Steven; Palla, Francesco | title = The Formation of Stars | publisher = Wiley-VCH | isbn = 3527405593 | year = 2004 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Cx98QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; represents the continuum intensity on either side of the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] (or [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]]) feature, while &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the intensity across the entire wavelength range of interest. Then &lt;math&gt;W_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the width of a hypothetical line which drops to an intensity of zero and has the &quot;same integrated flux deficit from the continuum as the true one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;formation_of_stars&quot;/&gt; This equation can be applied to either emission or absorption, but when applied to emission, the value of &lt;math&gt;W_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and so the absolute value is used.

==Applications==
The equivalent width is used as a quantitative measure of the strength of spectral features. The equivalent width is a convenient choice because the shapes of spectral features can vary depending upon the configuration of the system which is producing the lines. For instance, the line may experience [[Doppler broadening]] due to motions of the gas emitting the photons. The photons will be shifted away from the line center, thus rendering the height of the emission line a poor measure of its overall strength. The equivalent width, on the other hand, &quot;measures the fraction of energy removed from the spectrum by the line,&quot; regardless of the broadening intrinsic to the line or a detector with poor [[spectral resolution|resolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spitzer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Spitzer, Lyman | title = Physical Processes in the Interstellar Medium | publisher = Wiley-VCH | year = 1998 | isbn = 0471022322 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=YPG3AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the equivalent width can in many conditions yield the number of absorbing or emitting atoms.&lt;ref name = &quot;co&quot;/&gt;

Measurements of the equivalent width of the [[Balmer series|Balmer alpha]] transition in [[T Tauri star]]s are used in order to classify individual T Tauri stars as being classical or weak-lined.&lt;ref name=&quot;formation_of_stars&quot;/&gt; The equivalent width can also be used in studying [[star formation]] in [[Lyman series|Lyman alpha]] [[galaxy|galaxies]], as the equivalent width of the Lyman alpha line is related to the star formation rate in the galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;lae&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dijkstra, Mark; Westra, Eduard | title = Star formation indicators and line equivalent width in Lya galaxies | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 401 | issue = 4 | pages = 2343–2348 | year = 2010 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.401.2343D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ernst angle'''  is the [[flip angle]] (a.k.a. &quot;tip&quot; or &quot;nutation&quot; angle) for a particular spin that gives the maximal signal in the least amount of time when signal averaging over many transients. This relationship was developed by Richard Ernst, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1991/|title=1991 Nobel Laureates in Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1719961|title=Application of Fourier transform spectroscopy to magnetic resonance (1966) Rev. Sci. Inst. v.37, p.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following equation relates the Ernst angle, theta, to the experimental interpulse delay, d1; the duration of the [[../Glossary#Free induction decay/]], aka &quot;acquisition time&quot;, or &quot;at&quot;; and the [[..//Glossary#T1 relaxation|longitudinal relaxation time/]] of the spin in question, T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;cos(\theta)=e^{-(d1+at)/T_1}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if one wishes to get the best signal from a resonance with T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=3 sec, and one wishes to use d1=1sec and at=2sec, the optimal tip angle is 68 degrees.

This relationship is especially important in [[../Magnetic Resonance Imaging/]] (MRI), where interscan delays (d1) and acquisition times (at) are often short relative to the signal's T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; value. In MRI, there is typically just one resonance being observed - H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O - and the T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O depends on its local environment. Note that d1 and at together may be referred to collectively as TR in the MRI community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''excitation wavelength''' describes the light shone on a sample to transfer energy to (&quot;to excite&quot;) a light-reactive chemical group in any compound. Its unit is usually given in nanometers (nm). 

An example is the green fluorescent protein (GFP), which can be excited with light of 488&amp;nbsp;nm, to induce a fluorescence at 509&amp;nbsp;nm.

Excitation wavelength is based upon how much energy a specific group can absorb and reemit.  Energy, however, can only be transferred in discrete units called quanta.  Based upon the electron configuration of each chemical group, its electrons will be able to absorb a certain amount of quanta and move up in energy level.  Upon returning to their original states, the electrons release more of these packets of energy, though at a different level.  The release of this energy is the level of fluorescence achieved.

Can someone clean up this bit under Timers, please?
&quot;You can see some of the 8086 compatible timer chips like 8253/54 also they are the same have three independent timers internally but 8254 can work with higher frequencies and is used to generate interrupt like Memory refresh interrupt ,Time of day TOD interrupt and the last one is used to generate the speaker frequencies.&quot;

[[File:Mail3.png|center|600px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Mail4.png|center|600px]]

Pluggable functions were introduced in [[Version 1.5.1|WordPress 1.5.1]] These functions let you override certain core functions via [[Plugin API|plugins]]. The most up-to-date list of core functions that WordPress allows plugins to override is available in &lt;code&gt;wp-includes/pluggable.php&lt;/code&gt;. WordPress loads the built-in functions only if they are undefined after all plugins have been loaded.

'''Note:''' A function can only be reassigned this way once, so you can’t install two plugins that plug the same function for different reasons. For safety, it is best to always wrap your functions with &lt;code&gt;if ( !function_exists() )&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise you '''will''' produce fatal errors on plugin activation.

== Reference ==

; [[Function_Reference/get_currentuserinfo|&lt;tt&gt;get_currentuserinfo()&lt;/tt&gt;]] : Grabs the information of the current logged in user, if there is one.  Essentially a wrapper for get_userdata(), but it also stores information in global variables.
; [[Function_Reference/get_userdata|&lt;tt&gt;get_userdata($userid)&lt;/tt&gt;]] : Pulls user information for the specified user from the database.
; &lt;tt&gt;get_userdatabylogin($user_login)&lt;/tt&gt; : Pulls user information for the specified user from the database.
; [[Function Reference/wp_mail|&lt;tt&gt;wp_mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers = &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;]] : A convenient wrapper for PHP's mail function.
; &lt;tt&gt;wp_login($username, $password, $already_md5 = false)&lt;/tt&gt; : Returns &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; if the specified username and password correspond to a registered user.
; &lt;tt&gt;auth_redirect()&lt;/tt&gt; : If a user is not logged in, he or she will be redirected to WordPress' login page before being allowed to access content on the page from which this function was called.  Upon successfully logging in, the user is sent back to the page in question.
; [[Function Reference/wp_redirect|&lt;tt&gt;wp_redirect($location)&lt;/tt&gt;]] : Redirects a browser to the ''absolute URI'' specified by the &lt;tt&gt;$location&lt;/tt&gt; parameter.
; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;wp_setcookie($username, $password, $already_md5 = false, $home = '', $siteurl = '')&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; : Sets the WordPress cookies for a logged in user.  See [[WordPress Cookies]].
; &lt;tt&gt;wp_clearcookie()&lt;/tt&gt; : Clears the cookies for a logged in user.  See [[WordPress Cookies]].
; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;wp_notify_postauthor($comment_id, $comment_type='')&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: Emails the author of the comment's post the content of the comment specified.
; &lt;tt&gt;wp_notify_moderator($comment_id)&lt;/tt&gt; : Informs the administrative email account that the comment specified needs to be moderated.  See [[Administration_Panels|Administration]] &gt; [[Administration_Panels#General|Settings]] &gt; [[Settings_General_SubPanel|General]].

== Example ==
 
An example of what you can do with a pluggable function is replace the default email handler. To do this, you'd need to write a plugin that defines a &lt;tt&gt;wp_mail()&lt;/tt&gt; function. The default &lt;tt&gt;wp_mail()&lt;/tt&gt; function looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
function wp_mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers = '') {
  if( $headers == '' ) {
    $headers = &quot;MIME-Version: 1.0\n&quot; .
      &quot;From: &quot; . get_settings('admin_email') . &quot;\n&quot; . 
      &quot;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\&quot;&quot; . get_settings('blog_charset') . &quot;\&quot;\n&quot;;
  }

  return @mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

But, for example, if you wanted to CC all your mail to another address, you could use this code in a plugin:

&lt;pre&gt;
if(!function_exists('wp_mail')) :
function wp_mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers = '') {
  if( $headers == '' ) {
    $headers = &quot;MIME-Version: 1.0\n&quot; .
      &quot;From: &quot; . get_settings('admin_email') . &quot;\n&quot; . 
      &quot;Cc: dummy@example.com\n&quot;;
      &quot;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\&quot;&quot; . get_settings('blog_charset') . &quot;\&quot;\n&quot;;
  }

  return @mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
}
endif;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that if you plug a core function like this the original is no longer available. I.e., the elegant solution here would have been to write a function that tacks our Cc header on the end of the exising &lt;tt&gt;$headers&lt;/tt&gt; string then call the original &lt;tt&gt;wp_mail()&lt;/tt&gt; with the extra header. However this would not work as the original &lt;tt&gt;wp_mail()&lt;/tt&gt; does not exist if you plug it.</text>

WPBannerMeta can be used at varying levels of complexity, from the very simple to the extremely complicated. Simple options are listed here first, with complexity increasing down the page. 

WPBannerMeta takes two different types of parameters, formatting and display. The formatting parameters customise the meta-template for a particular project, defining link targets, categories, images and text. All formatting parameters use UPPERCASE and underscores (_), instead of spaces (eg. &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|PROJECT=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|NOTE_1_CAT= &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). Display parameters customize the template output for each individual ''page'' that the banner is displayed on. These are the parameters which are entered on the talk page (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|quality=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|priority=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) and they must be 'passed through' the project banner to the meta-template underneath. To 'pass' the parameter &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, you need to include the code {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;foo={{{foo|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}.

In the examples below, a WikiProject banner will be constructed for the WikiProject Languages.  

===Simple options===
*&lt;code&gt;'''PROJECT'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)''&amp;nbsp;– the name of the project without the word &quot;WikiProject&quot;, used in a variety of contexts; first letter should usually be capitalized. {{nowrap|''Eg: &lt;code&gt;'''Tulips'''&lt;/code&gt;''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''substcheck'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; this allows the template to detect if it has been substituted instead of transcluded and give an error message. '''''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;substcheck=&lt;includeonly&gt;{{subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;substcheck}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''
**&lt;code&gt;'''small'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the size parameter ''must'' be passed through the template to enable the correct display. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;small={{{small|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''category'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the 'category' parameter ''must'' be passed through the template to enable category optout. ''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;category={{{category|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''.
**&lt;code&gt;'''listas'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the 'listas' parameter ''must'' be passed through the template. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;listas={{{listas|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;BANNER_NAME={{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the full page name of the banner. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Template:WikiProject Languages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''PROJECT_LINK'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; it is assumed that the project is located at '''&lt;code&gt;&quot;Wikibooks:WikiProject &amp;lt;PROJECT&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;'''. If this is not the case, then define the full link to the project page in this parameter. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''IMAGE_LEFT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the location of an image to use in the top-left corner of the banner. '''''Do not''''' include the &quot;''File:''&quot; prefix.

===Assessment===
Many projects use an assessment schema to grade their pages by quality and a corresponding priority scale to place their pages in order of priority.
*&lt;code&gt;'''quality'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)''&amp;ndash; the quality parameter must be passed through, if the quality scale is used. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;quality={{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''QUALITY_SCALE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; configures the quality scale; possible options are:
***standard &amp;ndash; enables the 'standard' quality scale (FB, A, B, C, Start, Stub, NB). (This is the default behavior, if the ''quality'' parameter is used.)
***extended &amp;ndash; enables the 'standard' quality scale plus some additional values (Category, Subject, Project and Template).
***inline &amp;ndash; allows for a simple custom quality scale to be used, generally used with {{tl|Quality mask}}.
***subpage &amp;ndash; allows for a more complex custom quality scale to be used using a subpage called ''/quality''. See [[#Custom masks|custom masks]] below for further details.
*&lt;code&gt;'''priority'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if defined, enables the standard priority scale (Top, High, Mid, Low, NB, Unknown). {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;priority={{{priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''importance'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if defined, enables the standard importance scale (Top, High, Mid, Low, NB, Unknown). {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;priority={{{priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}} Only one of the priority/importance parameters should be used.
**&lt;code&gt;'''priority_SCALE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; configures the priority/importance scale, if used. The possible options are:
***standard &amp;ndash; enables the 'standard' priority scale (Top, High, Mid, Low, Bottom, NB and Unknown). (This is the default behavior.)
***inline &amp;ndash; allows for a simple custom priority or importance scale to be defined, generally with {{tl|Priority mask}}.
***subpage &amp;ndash; allows for a more complex custom priority/importance scale to be used using a subpage called ''/priority''.
*&lt;code&gt;'''ASSESSMENT_LINK'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the link to a WikiProject-specific quality (and/or priority) scale. If there is a page at '''&lt;code&gt;&quot;Wikibooks:WikiProject &amp;lt;PROJECTLINK&gt;/Assessment&quot;&lt;/code&gt;''' then this will be used by default. To override this, you can set this parameter to '''no'''.
*&lt;code&gt;'''ASSESSMENT_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; pages are sorted into categories based on their quality; so pages in featured books on languages would be categorized by default into ''Category:FB-quality languages pages''. If this parameter is defined, featured pages would instead be categorized into Category:FB-quality &lt;code&gt;ASSESSMENT_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;language pages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:FB-quality language pages]]''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''COMMENTS'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; some projects may want to use a subpage of the page's talk page to post brief, assessment-related comments about the page. If these comments are placed in a &quot;'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FULLPAGENAME}}/Comments&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''&quot; subpage, then this parameter will cause the banner to automatically display. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''COMMENTS_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if this parameter is defined, pages which have comments are sorted into Category:&lt;code&gt;COMMENTS_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. By default, these pages are categorized into Category:&lt;tt&gt;PROJECT&lt;/tt&gt; pages with comments. {{nowrap|''Eg: (alternate) '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Language pages with comments&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → Category:Language pages with comments}}''. A value of &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; results in no categorization.

===Alerts and notes===
Built into WPBannerMeta is the ability to display a number of other fields that contain useful information about the page. There are also three predefined fields for:
# pages in need of immediate attention;
# pages in need of an |infobox.
The parameters are:
*&lt;code&gt;'''attention'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; pass this parameter through to enable the use of the attention note. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;attention={{{attention|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}, then by including &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|attention=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the talk page.
**&lt;code&gt;'''ATTENTION_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying the attention note will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;ATTENTION_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. By default, they are categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;PROJECT&lt;/code&gt; pages needing attention. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Language pages needing attention&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:Language pages needing attention]]''}}. A value of &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; results in no categorization.
*&lt;code&gt;'''infobox'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; pass this parameter through to enable the use of the needs-infobox note. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;infobox={{{needs-infobox|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}, then by including &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|needs-infobox=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the talk page.
**&lt;code&gt;'''INFOBOX_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying the needs-infobox note will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;INFOBOX_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. By default, they are categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;PROJECT&lt;/code&gt; pages needing infoboxes. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Language pages needing infoboxes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:Language pages needing infoboxes]]''}}. A value of &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; results in no categorization.
*&lt;code&gt;'''note 1'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; pass this parameter through to trigger any defined note. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;note 1={{{needs-photo|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}, then by including &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|needs-photo=yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the talk page. Up to ten notes can be specified in the core banner.
**&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_1_TEXT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the text of note 1. ''Eg: This page needs a sound bite from a native speaker''. If this is left blank there is no visual output.
**&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_1_IMAGE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; an image can be defined for each note. Remember that all images '''''must''''' be free, not fair-use.  {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Crystal Clear app kaboodle.png&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_1_FORMAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; optional formatting (color, etc.) for the table cell which contains the image, if any, for the note. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;background:blue&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_1_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying note 1 will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;NOTE_1_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Language pages needing sound bites&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:Language pages needing sound bites]]}}''
*&lt;code&gt;'''COLLAPSED'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; when more than a threshold number of notes and alerts are triggered on a page, they are automagically collapsed into a show/hide box.  The threshold number can be customized by setting this parameter to the maximum number of notes on a page that will ''not'' trigger the collapse.  The default is 3, so if three notes are triggered on a page, they will not be collapsed, but if a fourth is also triggered, the collapse box appears.  So setting {{para|COLLAPSED|0}} will ''always'' create a collapse box (if there are any notes to fill it), while {{para|COLLAPSED|999}} will never trigger a collapse box. See also the [[Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks/notecounter|/notecounter hook]]. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;6&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''NOTE_SIZE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of the image used for the icons. (It is recommended to precede the size with &quot;x&quot; as this specifies the height of the image instead of the width, which results in a neater banner because all rows have equal height.) The default is a height of 25px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;x30px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}

===Task forces===
WPBannerMeta can accommodate up to five task forces, each with its own image, links and importance scale, if desired. The following parameters are available:
*&lt;code&gt;'''tf 1'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; this parameter ''must'' be passed through to enable and trigger the display of the task force section. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;tf 1={{{french|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_LINK'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the full page name of the task force's project page. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/French language task force&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_NAME'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the way the task force's name will appear in its piped link; redundant when {{para|TF_1_TEXT}} is used. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;the French language task force&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_NESTED'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, a link of the form &quot;'''/ &lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{{TF_1_LINK}}}|{{{TF_1_NESTED}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&quot; is added after the main project's name when the banner is collapsed inside a {{tl|WikiProjectBannerShell}}. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;French&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_TEXT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, replaces the default &quot;This page is supported by...&quot; text. ''Eg:&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;This page is within the scope of the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Languages/French task force|French task force]]. New members are always welcome!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''''' If defined to be &quot;none&quot;, then no output will be displayed, although appropriate categories will still be added.
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_IMAGE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; an image can be defined for each task force. Remember that all images '''''must''''' be free, not fair-use. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_QUALITY'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, enables the quality categorizations for the main project (eg: Category:FB-quality language pages) to be duplicated for the task force. The quality arising from {{para|quality}} and {{para|QUALITY_SCALE}} will be used; {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;yes&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''tf 1 priority'''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;ndash; if defined, enables the use of a separate priority (or importance, if used) scale for the task force.{{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;tf 1 priority={{{french-priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_ASSESSMENT_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required if quality or priority assessments are used)'' &amp;ndash; the assessment category to be used for the task force-specific quality and priority assessments. Identical in syntax to {{para|ASSESSMENT_CAT}}. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;French language pages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:FB-quality French language pages]]}}''
**&lt;code&gt;'''TF_1_MAIN_CAT'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; if defined, all pages displaying &quot;tf 1&quot; will be categorized into Category:&lt;code&gt;TF_1_MAIN_CAT&lt;/code&gt;. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;French language pages&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' → [[:Category:French language pages]]''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''TF_SIZE'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; the size of the taskforce icons. (It is recommended to precede the size with &quot;x&quot; as this specifies the height of the image instead of the width, which results in a neater banner because all rows have equal height.) The default is a height of 25px. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;x30px&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}

==Advanced features==
===Hooks===
{{see also|Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks}}
WPBannerMeta incorporates a number of 'hooks' where advanced or customized features can be added. These should take the form of a subtemplate passed to the relevant hook parameter. Any relevant parameters should then be passed to the hook template &amp;ndash; it may be necessary to repeat parameters that are already passed to the main template ({{para|category|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{category|¬}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{para|quality|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} are commonly used). If you write a hook that you think other projects could use, please copy or move it to a subpage of [[Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks]] and add it to the list on that page.

===Custom masks===
{{see also|Template:Quality mask/doc}}
WPBannerMeta uses a mask to normalize the values given to the {{para|quality}} parameter, to ensure that invalid inputs are discarded (e.g. {{para|quality|cheesecake}}) and that equivalent inputs appear the same (eg {{para|quality|FB}} and {{para|quality|fB}}).  This mask effectively controls which extended assessment scale values are accepted by the template (eg &quot;Template-quality&quot;, &quot;Project-quality&quot;, etc).  Projects which want to use more obscure assessment qualities or to ''not'' use all of the standard qualities (e.g. not using &quot;C-quality&quot;) can define their own custom mask, which will override WPBannerMeta's default.

==Other details==
This meta-template ''automatically'' categorizes all instances (i.e. specific project banners) into a subcategory of [[:Category:WikiProject banners]]. It is not necessary to include a category link in the documentation for each project banner.

The core WPBannerMeta template:
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/core|/core]]

To reduce the byte-count of banners that do not make full use of WPBannerMeta's features, most of the optional features are broken out into subpages:
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/comments|/comments]] &amp;ndash; the message which is displayed when {{para|COMMENTS|yes}} is defined.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/doc|/doc]] &amp;ndash; the documentation you are now reading.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/priorityscale|/priorityscale]] &amp;ndash; the priority classification system.
**[[Template:WPBannerMeta/priority|/priority]] &amp;ndash; used in conjunction with [[Template:Priority mask]] to normalize the value of the {{para|priority}} parameter.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/istemplate|/istemplate]] &amp;ndash; tests the type of the current page (i.e. book talk page, templatepage, or demonstration).
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/locwarning|/locwarning]] &amp;ndash; warns when the banner template is used on a non-talk page.
**[[Template:WPBannerMeta/substwarning|/substwarning]] &amp;ndash; warns when a banner template is substituted.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/note|/note]] &amp;ndash; an individual note.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/taskforce|/taskforce]] &amp;ndash; the code for each task force display.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/templatepage|/templatepage]] &amp;ndash; the categories and notes that only appear on the template page.
*[[Template:WPBannerMeta/qualityscale|/qualityscale]] &amp;ndash; the quality classification system.
**[[Template:WPBannerMeta/quality|/quality]] &amp;ndash; used in conjunction with [[Template:Quality mask]] to normalize the {{para|quality}} input.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|template shortcut}} template.

It can be used to show the names of shortcuts to a template.

It can take up to six shortcuts as parameters. 

=== Usage ===

If you want to indicate that &lt;nowiki&gt;{{uw-vandalism1}} has shortcuts named {{uw-v1}}, {{uw-vandal1}}, and {{uw-vand1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, then you could use one of:

{{template shortcut|uw-v1}}
{{tlx|template shortcut|uw-v1}}
{{clear}}

{{template shortcut|uw-v1|uw-vand1}}
{{tlx|template shortcut|uw-v1|uw-vand1}}
{{clear}}

{{template shortcut|uw-v1|uw-vand1|uw-vandal1}}
{{tlx|template shortcut|uw-v1|uw-vand1|uw-vandal1}}
{{clear}}

=== Additional parameters ===

This template has some additional parameters. 

&quot;float=left&quot; makes this template flow to the left of the page instead:

{{template shortcut|float=left|uw-v1}}
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template shortcut|float=left|uw-v1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{clear}}

&quot;pre=something&quot;, &quot;pre2=something&quot; and &quot;pre3=something&quot; feeds some text to show before the shortcut links but within the braces. This is mostly used to indicate that the template should be used with substitution. Then you can do like this:

{{template shortcut|pre=subst:|uw-v1|uw-vand1}}
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template shortcut|pre=subst:|uw-v1|uw-vand1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{clear}}

{{template shortcut|uw-v1|pre2=subst:|uw-vand1|pre3=subst:|uw-vandal1}}
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{template shortcut|uw-v1|pre2=subst:|uw-vand1|pre3=subst:|uw-vandal1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{clear}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===

This template inserts a left-floating transparent div that matches the right-floating div created by the CollapsibleTables javascript code.  It can be added to the header cells of tables to ensure that the header text remains centrally-aligned; otherwise the right-floating div can 'push' the header text slightly to the left.

''Please note that this is a hack.''

Template to produce single or multiple non-breaking spaces (&quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;big&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;s). Uses {{tl|loop}}.

; Syntax : &lt;code&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{spaces|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''N''}}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where the optional parameter ''N'' is the desired number of consecutive non-breaking spaces (numeric, with a range of 1 to 15).

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{spaces}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;produces a single non-breaking space. You may also use {{tl|nbsp}} (which redirects to this template) as a shortcut for a single non-breaking space.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
This template is designed for use in WikiProject banners, and provides an easy way to construct a bespoke class mask. The ''class'' parameter must be passed to the template as the first unnamed parameter.

===Implementation in [[Template:WPBannerMeta]]===
The template provides the default classification masks for a WikiProject's quality scales, and is also used by the majority of projects which use a custom quality mask. It can be used in two different ways:
*with {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|subpage}} and placed on the /quality subpage of the WikiProject's banner template. In this case, specific guidance on how the template works with the chosen parameters is displayed on this page.
*with {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|inline}} and placed directly inside the ''quality'' parameter. However this method is ''not'' suitable for projects which use either of the following:

=== Use on subpages ===
When used on a /quality subpage (e.g. with {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|subpage}}) the template should be called in the following way:
&lt;pre&gt;{{quality mask&lt;noinclude&gt;/templatepage&lt;/noinclude&gt; | {{{quality|}}}
 |topic=
 |optional parameters
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
This allows the [[Template:Quality mask/templatepage|/templatepage]] to be displayed which provides useful documentation and category prompts on the subpage.
* the ''topic'' parameter defines the main naming scheme of the assessment categories used by the project and is used to check the existence of the categories that are required. For example, if your project uses categories such as ''Category:B-Class mathematics pages'', etc. then set {{para|topic|mathematics}}.
** if the template uses taskforces, parameters ''topic1'', ''topic2'', ''topic3'', ''topic4'' and ''topic5'' can be used to check for the necessary categories.
 
Neither of the above are required for the {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|inline}} version.

=== Inline use ===
When used &quot;inline&quot; (e.g. with {{para|QUALITY_SCALE|inline}}), the call to /templatepage and the ''topic'' parameters are not required, and the template should be called in the following way:
&lt;pre&gt;{{quality mask | {{{quality|}}} | optional parameters }}&lt;/pre&gt;
Bear in mind that if the banner uses any hooks, you will need to set the options each time ''quality'' is used. Therefore the subpage method may be more useful in these cases.

=== Optional parameters ===
* ''FQS'' - if set to &quot;yes&quot;, switches on the following additional classifications. Individual classifications may then be switched off by setting their respective lowercase parameters (see below) to &quot;no&quot;.
** Project
** Category
** Subject
** Template
* ''forceNB'' - if set to &quot;yes&quot;, will automatically classify pages tagged as {{para|quality|NB}} depending on the namespace of the page. The default setting is &quot;no&quot;.

=== The lowercase parameter syntax ===
Add a classification in '''lowercase''' as the name of a parameter followed by the value &quot;yes&quot;. For example
&lt;pre&gt;|project=yes&lt;/pre&gt;
would add the Project-classification. This is the simplest way of adding a classification but has the following two limitations:
* The name of the classification must have an initial capital letter and all following letters in lowercase. In other words, the capitalization must be of the form Xxxxxx.
* It is not possible to use this method to add a shortcut or alternative alias for a different classification, for example &quot;Sub&quot; for Subject-class.
If either of these are required, the upperclass parameter syntax must be used (see below).

If {{para|FQS|yes}} is used, then a value of &quot;no&quot; may be used to switch off that individual classification. Thus
&lt;pre&gt;{{quality mask|{{{quality|}}}
 |topic=physics
 |FQS=yes
 |subject=no
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
would support all of the additional classifications listed above ''except'' Subject-class.

=== The UPPERCASE parameter syntax ===
Add a classification in '''uppercase''' as the name of a parameter followed by the ''exact name'' of the classification (including the required case) as the value of the parameter. For example
&lt;pre&gt;|SL=SL&lt;/pre&gt;
would add SL-class and
&lt;pre&gt;|CHEESECAKE=CheeseCake&lt;/pre&gt;
would add CheeseCake-class.

You can use this method to add a shortcut or alias for a classification. For example
&lt;pre&gt;|bplus = yes
|B+ = Bplus&lt;/pre&gt;
would have the effect that an input of either B+ or Bplus would result in Bplus-class.

=== Example 1: subpage ===
The following code is placed in the banner template:
&lt;pre&gt;
|QUALITY_SCALE = subpage
 |quality = {{{quality|}}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
and on the /quality subpage, the following code is used:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{quality mask&lt;noinclude&gt;/templatepage&lt;/noinclude&gt; | {{{quality|}}}
 |topic=Zimbabwe
 |FQS=yes
 |redirect=yes
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this case all of the &quot;extended&quot; quality classifications are used, plus the additional Redirect-class. Because the {{para|topic}} parameter is set, specific documentation will be displayed on the /quality subpage.

=== Example 2: inline ===
The following code is placed in the banner template:
&lt;pre&gt;
|QUALITY_SCALE = inline
 |quality = {{quality mask | {{{quality|}}} | category=yes }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the standard quality classifications are used, plus the additional Category-class.

=== Subtemplates ===
* [[Template:Quality mask/templatepage|/templatepage]] - the documentation that is displayed on /quality subpages
** [[Template:Quality mask/templatepage/row|/templatepage/row]] - used by /templatepage
* [[Template:Quality mask/doc|/doc]] - the documentation you are reading now
** [[Template:Quality mask/doc/custom|/doc/custom]] - for information on building your own quality mask

      <text xml:space="preserve">This template subpage contains a mask which normalizes the input passed to {{para|quality}}.  This can be thought of as the 'default' mask, but it is possible for banners to define their own individual masks with wider or fewer choices of acceptable inputs.  

If the page corresponding to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{BANNER_NAME}}}/quality&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; exists and &lt;code&gt;QUALITY_SCALE=subpage&lt;/code&gt; is set in the banner, then control is passed to the code on that page to normalize the input, and no modification is performed by the WPBannerMeta itself. The following parameter is available to be used:
*{{para|quality}}

Some caveats:
*{{tl|WPBannerMeta/qualityscale}} treats a null output from the mask as &quot;unassessed&quot;
*{{tl|WPBannerMeta/importancescale}} handles importance ratings differently when the mask outputs &quot;&lt;tt&gt;NB&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;

Any alternative mask needs to be carefully designed to handle all inputs correctly, with care given to case-insentivity, etc.

{{important|Please '''do not''' just copy the contents of this subpage to create a custom mask.  If the banner does not need to have a significantly different handling of the {{para|quality}} inputs, then leave the default mask in place.}}

===Examples===

The following code accepts only the standard assessment scale with a few extras:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{#switch:{{lc:{{{quality|}}}}}
 |fb       = FB
 |a        = A
 |b        = B
 |c        = C
 |start    = Start
 |stub     = Stub
 |template = Template
 |subject  = Subject
 |category = Category
 |project  = Project
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

An example using all classifications and namespace detection:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{#switch: {{lc:{{{quality}}}}}
 |fb   = FB
 |a    = A
 |b    = B
 |c    = C
 |start= Start
 |stub = Stub
 |nb                   = NB
 |category|cat|categ   = Category
 |template|temp|templ  = Template
 |project              = Project
 |#default={{#switch:{{NAMESPACE}}
  |Category talk       = Category
  |Wikibooks talk      = Project
  |Subject talk        = Subject
  |Template talk       = Template
 }}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Generic self-documentation===
A minor problem with the examples above is that someone clicking the link from the banner template to see the custom mask will be presented with a blank page (you have to edit the page to see there's actually code). A simple solution is to add a local wrapper to your code, replacing the basic structure:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{#switch: {{lc:{{{quality}}}}}

...

}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
with this one:
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;noinclude&gt;:''[[Template:WPBannerMeta#Custom masks|Custom mask]]
used by {{tl|{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}:''
&amp;lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude&gt;{{#switch: {{lc:{{{quality}}}}}

...

}}&amp;lt;noinclude&gt;&amp;lt;/pre&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template documentation|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

--&gt;{{documentation|content=This page holds the custom quality mask for the [[Template:{{BASEPAGENAME}}]]. It uses {{tl|quality mask}}, a template for constructing quality masks according to individual WikiProjects' wishes. The following table shows the output of the mask, with the current parameter definitions, for different inputs and namespaces.

=== Classification based on ''quality'' parameter ===
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Input&lt;br /&gt;(not case-specific)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Icon&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Quality&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

}}&lt;/table&gt;

=== Classification based on namespace ===
In addition, if ''quality'' {{#ifeq:{{{forceNB}}}|yes|is equal to NB, or&amp;#32;}}is empty, undefined or unrecognized, then the classification will be deduced from the namespace of the page when possible.

&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Namespace&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Icon&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Quality&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

In all other circumstances, pages will be classified as ''Unassessed'' and placed in [[:Category:Unassessed{{#if:{{{topic|}}}|&amp;#32;{{{topic}}}|-Class}} pages]].

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template is designed to be used by WikiProject banner templates to normalize the ''importance'' parameter.

The priorities ''top'', ''high'', ''mid'', and ''low'' may be enabled or disabled. However ''NB'' and ''Unknown'' may not be disabled.

=== Syntax ===
Typically this template should be placed on the /priority subpage of a WikiProject banner template.
&lt;pre&gt;{{priority mask&lt;noinclude&gt;/templatepage&lt;/noinclude&gt;
 |1={{{priority|}}}
 |quality={{{quality|}}}
 |top=
 |high=
 |mid=
 |low=
 |bottom=
 |no=
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

===Parameters===
*&lt;code&gt;'''priority'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' this parameter must be passed as the first unnamed parameter in all cases.
*&lt;code&gt;'''quality'''&lt;/code&gt; ''(Required)'' &amp;ndash; the 'quality' parameter must be passed to allow the mask to automatically set the priority of non-book pages to NB. {{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;quality={{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
{{nowrap|''Eg: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;priority={{{priority|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''''}}
*&lt;code&gt;'''top'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specifies whether ''Top-priority'' is used, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;'''high'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specifies whether ''High-priority'' is used, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;'''mid'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specifies whether ''Mid-priority'' is used, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
*&lt;code&gt;'''low'''&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; specifies whether ''Low-priority'' is used, defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.

The '''triple bowline''' can be used to make an improvised rope chair. The legs go in two loops and the torso goes in the third. To tie it, tie a [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]] with a [[Knots/Parts of the knot|bight]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">First of all, thanks for checking out this book on DarkBASIC. It's the first WikiBook on the subject of DarkBASIC Programming. Not everyone can program, but in the information age I believe that it's necessary for everyone to gain the skills to use different types of technology. Especially, computers and programming. Today and for the next 30 days you'll learn a lot about DarkBASIC Programming and a lot about what you can accomplish using a computer. DarkBASIC is all about making DirectX do your evil bidding and your domination of the world of computer game programming. I hope you read and contribute to this book, as well as rant because then I can fix stuff others will insult. I hope you enjoy!

In this tutorial I'm going to assume you have no prior programming experience, or else you wouldn't be reading this book. You would pick up the manual, compare it to C++, and program in DarkBASIC easily. First of all not to scare you but game programming is not easy and secondly you are not going to make a &lt;insert copycat blockbuster game here&gt; killer or clone or whatever in DarkBASIC for a long time. I'm also going to assume you have v1.0 of the &quot;classic&quot; or non-pro edition of DarkBASIC or else with another version you'll have some problems running this code unfortunately. Programming is not a new concept, and there are many hundreds of languages such as DarkBASIC out there, one such programming language comparable to DarkBASIC is BlitzBASIC, and you may have heard of Visual Basic.

== So what is programming?  ==

This isn't a stupid question. Programming is not just making applications for Windows, or talking a language your computer understands. Programming is input, process, and output. If you take computer sciences, chances are you'll be doing program outlines, but right now you're a hobbyist programmer so let's keep it simple. Not all of us know VC++ or Pascal. DarkBASIC is game oriented. You can make applications in it, but it's harder.  There are no message boxes in the version we'll be using. But DarkBASIC is easy and fun, especially for beginner's and junior programmers. Instead of having to write 1000+ lines of code to put a 2d character on screen you'll write one, instead of writing a massive program to make a cube spin you'll write a simple and human readable one in 20 or less lines. If you have no patience, take it slow and easy and don't move on until you understand it all or else you'll be bald by the time you finish this wikibook. I will say this: this book is a work in progress. I'll be finished as soon as possible so, bare with me please. Programming is simply entering lines of code that once compiled, or is run, tells the computer to follow out a task until it's done. What's involved is input, or you programming; processing or computing; and finally output, what you get to see. 
[[Image:Input-process-output.JPG]]


'''Figure 1.1'''(This is the Model of Input, Process and Output.)
'''So you know:''' A coder is another word for a programmer.



All programs follow the above method, since every program is (1) certainly programmed, (2) is certainly compiled, and (3) certainly displays results. Now, just what is code then? Code is the recipe for your program. Computers won't do a task wrong. You'll do the task 
wrong. To keep your program from doing things that could harm computers, the compiler(or program that checks to see if the program works) runs the program and generates syntax errors (if there's something wrong). These syntax errors, tell you that you made a mistake and you must fix it before you can see your program(in most cases). So, computers don't make mistakes.

There are many sorts of errors also! The most common is called ''' a syntax error '''. A syntax error are mistakes in your program's code. A programming language like a written language is incorrect if it contains things that are gibberish. Like in English, asdfjdj is not a word, it's gibberish. Just like in DarkBASIC, print is a command, where as printf is not. Another kind of error is called a run-time error, this is when your program compiles but you don't get the results you want. Such as if your writing is sloppy, the word &quot;hello&quot; may look like jello and the person will get the wrong information from it. Run-time errors are things that aren't suppose to happen, like when in your favorite video game, when a character can sometimes walk through a wall, or the program crashing when this happens.


The process of fixing your mistakes is called debugging. You'll get familiar with this; half your time or more will be spent doing debugging. So as much as possible, save, compile, debug, and run. It'll save you lots of anger, and stress. Finally remember this: with computers, the language goes through assembly or getting put into binary, and sent back to your programming language. If the binary pattern is correct, then you have no syntax errors. Remember, 0s are off or false, and 1s are on or true. Remember when I said assembly above? 


Well, here's how it works. First off, you compile or check syntax, then the code you entered passes through what's called machine language or assembly (its name changes depending on what its doing when it's compiling its assembler). Then it becomes pure binary (which is not human readable but meant for computers; they cannot understand anything other than 0s and 1s). Then it is sent back to the compiler where if the binary matches what's correct, it gets executed. If it doesn't, you get a syntax error and must debug. Now, don't quote me on that but that's basically what happens. So now you're ready to begin programming in DarkBASIC and will know what I talk about.

One more thing: DarkBASIC is not case sensitive.  If you don't know what this means, it means that DarkBASIC does not distinguish between upper-case letters and lower-case ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alrighty, you came back. Good, let's hope you have played around with the DarkBASIC editor. Before you find out what the hello world tradition is (older programmers don't spoil it for them!), I think I should tell you something. The DarkBASIC editor is not very windows friendly, so make sure you download an IDE you like and then link it to the DarkBASIC. 

'''So you know:''' an IDE is an integrated development environment. It allows programming to be easier for professionals and beginners alike. For now, don't worry what an IDE is too much, you're only beginning after all.

Okay, now then time to get to the tradition.


''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;This is Dbtutor's wikibook on DarkBASIC Programming!!&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code''

Copy and paste this source code into the IDE or editor (whichever) and run it. What you get is the easiest program you'll ever write in DarkBASIC. The hello world example is proud tradition of beginning programmers, so let's carry it on. Hello World Program puts the text hello world on the screen. But what are the quotation marks for? The quotation marks are used to show what you want to put on the screen. Otherwise, it would look like one big command. 

'''Your Assignment:'''

Replace Hello World with any text you want&lt;br&gt;



First of all, I hope you completed the assignment above.  In case you haven't, or had problems with this program I'll show you how. Okay, let's say you want to print a couple of things and you need it spaced for readability. Remember I said that print, prints the things inside the quotes? Well they're called strings, now strings are characters that you can change and manipulate. With no string to technically print, you'll just get a blank space. Now for all on one line you use a semi-colon(;). Experiment with these two methods above until you understand them. In DarkBASIC, your program already ends on its own doesn't it? 



But, it's good practice if you use the command &quot;end&quot; where your program needs to quit. So after the print commands in hello world, insert the command &quot;end&quot;. Now, go to file and build EXE, save the EXE in whatever folder you want and run it. Technically it should just be a flash so quick you cannot see it. That's where you need some sort of waiting system, or input just to let you see the results. So delete the exe and open up DarkBASIC again, in our hello world before the end command insert a wait key. What a wait key does is allow the famous press of any key for the program to end, so rebuild the exe of this program and now run it. The program isn't very windows friendly is it? At the top of the program put in these commands:

''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Set window on
Set window layout 1,1,1
Set Window title &quot;Hello World - A Friendly Greeting From DarkBASIC&quot;
Set window position 100,200
Set window size 640,480

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code ''

Now run the hello world program, see what happens? We now have a nice little window friendly environment. But hey, if you're on a different computer with different settings you'll miss some of the text, and what on earth are all those numbers for anyways? Okay the numbers are the X coordinates and the Y coordinates in case you didn't do math in school X is horizontal and Y is vertical. In case, you don't know what those words are X runs left and right or across, and Y runs up and down. So X &amp; Y are 2 axes so we have 2 dimensions, when we get to 3d expect to get dimensional for a paragraph or two. Now then for our last part of the day, let's find out how to change the position of where our text goes.

''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Set cursor 1,50

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code''

----


Insert this piece of code above, right above the first Print statement. Our program is long now and we may also forget what some of the things above do. Welcome to comments, the Rem command lets you make notes, anything after Rem is ignored. You should always comment your code, so that others can understand it, and so you can know what you where thinking when you coded it and why you coded it the way you did. Remember, comment heavily!!

'''So you know:''' Rem is short for Remark, and if I haven't told you yet BASIC stands for Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.  

Here's what your program should look like in the end, roughly:


'''Hello World Program Results'''

&lt;pre&gt;

Rem Setup the window
Set window on 
Set window layout 1,1,1
Set window title &quot;Hello World Program&quot;
Set window position 100,200
Set window size 640,480

Rem put the first line of text 50 pixels down
Set cursor 1,50
Print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;A friendly greeting from DarkBASIC!&quot;

Rem wait for the press of any key
Wait key
Rem then end
End

&lt;/pre&gt;

'''End of the Program'''


Before we go here's a quiz:


:'''In DarkBASIC Strings Start With a:'''
:A)#
:B)*
:C)'
:D)&quot;

:'''And they end with a:'''
:A)%
:B)^
:C)&amp;
:D)&quot;

:'''BASIC stands for:'''
:A)Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
:B)Bears Are Purposely Stealing International Cookies
:C)Beginner's Alphanumeric String Informed Code
:D)Beginning All Inserted Symbolic Intel Coding

:'''In 2d there are 2 axis which are they:'''
:A)U &amp; V
:B)X &amp; Y
:C)U &amp; V(in textures), X &amp; Y also
:D)Z &amp; U

:'''Rem can make comments for how many lines:'''
:A)1 or More
:B)1 or less
:C)Single Line
:D)Double Line



'''Okay Here Are the Answers, no cheating!'''
:1 &amp; 2 is obviously D.
:3 is A.
:4 If you said anything but Z &amp; U you should be on the right track but C is the best answer while
:B can be considered the most correct one.
:5 is C.

====Assignment:====

Experiment with the IDE and the DarkBASIC window commands.
Comment the hello world program when done.
Make a program that contains only comments.
Look up IDE on wikipedia.
Look around the DarkBASIC website(http://www.thegamecreators.com).

      </contributor>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, we're almost at the end of your first week  
experiencing DarkBASIC programming or at least this book! Okay, 
the fundamentals are all about logic, developing programs, design, 
setting outlooks and the building blocks. This is not application 
oriented, it's more game oriented as DarkBASIC is for game programming. 
You'll find out about conditions, variables, logic and more. Remember, 
awhile ago when I brought up 0s and 1s, well a better way of looking at 
them is TRUE and FALSE. DarkBASIC is simple, so there are no boolean operators 
or are there? Let's say you declare a variable called, oh, let's say A. For 
now A = 0 until we say A = 1, there's another value called B and it's equal 
to 1. If we had C = 1 when A or B is true or if C = 1 when A and B equal true, 
but what if neither of these values are true? Then we'd have to use 
another value and our program quickly looks like this:


:if A or B = 1
:C = 1
:else
:D = 1
:endif



That's logic, that's conditions, that's the if/endif command. Now I 
didn't indent above which I should have so anytime you use if/endif I 
want you to indent for the statements used okay? If you copied / pasted 
the above snippet in DarkBASIC and compiled it, you'd get no errors but 
if you'd ran this program you'd just get nothing. Why? They're just values 
and there is really no output to the screen involved, so let's change 
this program a bit.


'''Simple Conditional Statements Program''' 

&lt;pre&gt;

Rem we can also use a ` to comment quickly I will do that
Rem from now on!

`Declare some variables
a = 1
b = 0

`The conditional statement
if a or b = 1
   c = 1
else
   d = 1
endif

if c = 1 then Print &quot;Condition C is Met&quot;
if d = 1 then Print &quot;Condition D is Met&quot;
wait key
end

&lt;/pre&gt;

As you saw I used variables above, in case you didn't know variables 
are a way of storing data which can change. As you saw above if I changed 
the OR operator to a AND b = 1 then we'd have a whole new ball game on our 
hands. But let's sidetrack a little, if you wanted to remove the text on the 
screen you have to use this command &quot;cls&quot; which means clear screen. You can also change the
transparency value of cls by simply putting a value ranging from 
0 to 255 after the cls command. And I'll show you in a few lessons on how you can change the 
screen color to whatever you wish! You may be wondering about variables 
in DarkBASIC there are roughly three data types

&lt;pre&gt;
Rem Clear the Screen
cls
Rem String Data
&quot;Wikibooks rock!&quot;
&quot;My name is John Smith&quot;
&quot;Look I'm a string!&quot;
Rem the number below is a real number or a floating point decimal
35.5555
Rem the number below that is an integer number
12345
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are! For, good practice at the start of all your programs 
put cls, in other languages until you clear the screen you have text on 
the screen. For example, in pascal unless you clear the screen you get the
same text leftover from your last modification. Indenting is also important 
but we'll get to that later. So why comment or indent? In team efforts or 
open source projects it makes your program more human readable, also it's 
easier to read and locate, plus you'll need to remember what's happening 
when you come back to your project later on and you might forget. Back to variables, 
you can name variables whatever you want but make sure they're not 
to long and they briefly describe what it does or used for. 

Here are some variable examples

&lt;pre&gt;
string$ = &quot;Hey I'm a string and I love it!&quot;
float# = 333.445
integer = -11111
&lt;/pre&gt;

So why are there symbols in front of the variables? This shows what 
kind of variable we're dealing with, a $ is a string? A real or float 
is a #, in some languages there is no symbol in front of the values which 
can be a bit confusing. So again this makes it more human readable. So when designing software make sure it's source code is human readable! Get into good habits in programming like indenting - it'll save you and others time. 
For now, clear your mind and come back again tomorrow.



Alright it's time for some input other than press any key. Wouldn't you like 
to make your own game like Mad Libs? I'm trying to make one now in Visual C++, well in DarkBASIC you have to use the Input command. The input command needs a prompt(optional) and then a variable to store the input taken in. 
So what would this look like?

&lt;pre&gt;

Remstart
Input Example
By Dbtutor
Yes you can have groups of comments
Remend

Input &quot;Insert Name Here &quot;,name$
Print name$;&quot; is your name&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember semi-colons? Well they can also separate your string 
from a variable(even if it is another string strange eh?). You can also 
have input as just a variable input so it would look like this.

&lt;pre&gt;
Input a$
&lt;/pre&gt;

Oh yes you can use floats and integers also using input! Above where 
I use a comma you can also use a semi-colon if you prefer. Remstart means everything after it is a comment so beware, it will make everything 
a comment until you use the Remend command. What if you're database 
programming in DarkBasic(not a good practice use Visual Basic instead I advise!) and you have a hundred clients that need to be stored in variables? 
You can use the Dim command!

&lt;pre&gt;
Dim arrayname(arrayvalue,arrayvalue2(optional),arrayvalue3(optional)
arrayname(arrayvalue) = value
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let me show a more indepth example, and you can still use 
strings, integers and floats as long as you follow the 
rules(remember which symbol if any goes in front!).

A good dim statement

&lt;pre&gt;
dim list$(10)
list$(0) = &quot;Milk&quot;
list$(1) = &quot;Bread&quot;
list$(2) = &quot;Whatever&quot;
Etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

A bad dim statement

&lt;pre&gt;
dim list$(10)
list$(1) = &quot;Whatever&quot;
list$(11) = &quot;This is a no no - you can't exceed the array declared value!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hopefully you've been using these methods now, if not go 
review everything and put them into practice. 

'''Your Assignment'''

Write a Mad Libs game

Quiz is coming up! For now write that Mad Libs game and 
take it easy for awhile.



Before we start here's a quiz! Told ya!

'''#6 Corrected by: Cody C Oebel'''

Note: if A = 1, and B = 0,Without knowing the expression for what
C will equal if A =1, and B = 0 tell's nothing of what C should equal . 
I Corrected answer for # 6 which should be D, or N/A.

Correct answer for 6 is N/A , or D  






Okay, nice job if you didn't cheat and got a good mark or else try 
again until you do so. Let's take some time now to learn about game design 
a tad. Okay, let's take Donkey Kong Country it's a great graphical game and 
it's very fun. But some say that it has bad game design, in a sense it does 
you collect things that have no real value, does nothing special for the player. Let's look at Super Mario Bros.


You collect coins to give the player an extra life and a higher score, 
you collect green mushrooms to also get a quick extra life, your main attack 
is jumping and you must avoid falling off the platforms, there is lots for 
the player to discover on their own, you finally collect big mushrooms to be stronger and if your lucky a flower to get a sort of hippy firepower. 
That's a good outlook when designing a platform game, it's alright to 
loosely base design on other successful games but don't outright 
copycat it.


Now let's look at some Apogee games, Biomenace for example is like 
mario only more matured you have a gun but the basis for a good platformer 
is there. The game is based around the new advantage for the player as your 
gun is your survival. In space invaders, you do not collect things but 
it's a classic survival game, the arcade basis is survive as long as 
possible, get the highest score, with limited resources and powerups 
to temporarily allow prolonged survival through the hard parts. Let's look 
at an RPG, for example Final Fantasy is about your character 
growing and learning, it also has focus on the story. 


There are no real levels as you build your character until he's the ultimate 
in the universe and then defeat the main baddy, so really it's you the man. 
Focus on the main area of your game and build around it, I have done this for awhile and generally my games are liked. Do not make the game too hard, and if you find it fun after millions of test phases it's good. If you the 
designer feel any lukewarmness around any part of the game, change it until 
you feel happy. try to imagine what a total stranger will feel! Design is as important 
as making it work, without design how will you create a game? You have nothing 
to go on except making it up as you go. Remember, before all else is gameplay, then multimedia, then story and finally test your game and put it all together. Play games to see what makes them fun!


Now, let's look at some operators. These are things that help us use math and logic in
Dark Basic, they should be straightforward.

'''Operators'''

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; is Greater Than
&lt; is Less Than
&gt;= is Greater than or equal to
&lt;= is Less than or equal to
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now let's apply the above to condition statements.

&lt;pre&gt;
`10 = 9 is not 1 it's 0 
`So no text will be printed
if 10 = 9 then print &quot;That'll never happen&quot;
`But 10 is greater then or equal to itself
if 10 &gt;= 10 then Print &quot;This will always happen&quot;
`10 is greater then 8 
if 10 &gt; 8 then Print &quot;10 is bigger then 8 no doubt&quot;  
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In number crunching we'll see square roots and all the math commands in DarkBASIC but for now we'll just deal with the rnd command.

Here's the Syntax:

&lt;pre&gt;
variable = rnd(value)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Unfortunately rnd runs from 0 to the set range value, I do not know 
how to change it I'm afraid but if you need help consider asking a 
question on the DarkBASIC forums: [http://www.thegamecreators.com 
The Game Creators]. This link takes you to the homepage of DarkBASIC I 
have no username on the forum but did before, but since everyone was too 
eager to cut each other's throats I stopped visiting. Follow the rules to 
a tee or they'll bury you, and make sure you know what you're posting 
and expect the worst. Sorry, for scaring you but sometimes it's the truth 
I've had lots of feelings hurt and been angered at the sheer cruelness of 
the users before. Now then let's make a guessing game!!




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from a reader: You can get around this problem by simply using &quot;value&quot;
as one less than the highest number you want to get to, and then adding 1,
for example, if I want to generate a random number from 1 to 6 (like a
standard 6-sided dice):

variable = rnd(5) + 1

We use the value of 5 because that is one less than 6 (the number that we want).
This will generate a number from 0 to 5, and then add one, creating a number
from 1 to 6. Hope this helps, and I would have asked before adding this, but I
didn't see your contact info anywhere.

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wowzers! You started off programming hello world and now you've made 
a guessing game! Keep up the good work, if you're brave enough to show off 
your program at the newcomer's corner at the DarkBASIC forums. Now what 
does gosub do? Gosub stands for Go Subroutine, it's just a shorter geekier 
way of saying it. You need to have a label to jump too, and the label must be declared like so.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from another reader: I have noticed that if you write the following line
&lt;pre&gt;
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1
if value = 1 then value = 2
if value = 2 then value = 3
if value = 3 then value = 4
if value = 4 then value = 5
if value = 5 then value = 6
if value = 6 then value = 7
if value = 7 then value = 8
if value = 8 then value = 9
if value = 9 then value = 10
&lt;/pre&gt;
The game will choose a number, and then increase it until it reaches 10. All you have to do is to press 10 when you're asked for the number and you won. To correct the problem, write the program as this:

end
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the game will only choose a number from 1 to 9, all you have to do next is to quess it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from another reader: I found that there is an easier way to do the correction above.
Dbtutor wanted a number one through ten and your correction only brought the number through 1 to 9.
Also because of the way you wrote this, the probability of getting a 1 is higher 
now than getting any other number. An easier way to fix this is like this...
&lt;pre&gt;

`Ask the users for their name

`To solve the 0 being a value problem just add 1 instead 
value = rnd(9)+1
`the value down here is now no longer needed making the program less sloppier

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:

gosub checkguess

checkguess:

Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is a much easier way to take 0 out of the options of random numbers
while not affecting your probability at all. In the future, if you need a 
random number then use

&lt;pre&gt;
value = rnd(x)+1 
'with x being one less than you want to go to, I hope that helped.
&lt;/pre&gt;






&lt;pre&gt;

mylabel:
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are, experiment a bit with labels to see what they can do. 
You can return to the last label you leaped to by using the return 
command.

Okay that's a day, go take a nap or something lol! :D



I think I said the lesson would end with Day 7, I was wrong. Now let's 
learn about functions. Functions are used to make your own commands that 
are absent from DarkBASIC. They are also used to perform functions isn't 
it obvious. DarkBASIC has no object oriented programming or OOP so you can 
use functions to substitute if you are a very decent programmer. 
So how do you use a function?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from reader: DarkBASIC Professional supports OOP with user defined
types and with pointers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a Simple Function:

&lt;pre&gt;
hello_world(1)
wait key
end

function hello_world(1)
  Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note from a reader: The above code includes a parameter to the function that is technically illegal in the BASIC language! The (1) following the function name should produce an error because the '1' would be considered to be the parameter's variable name and variable names can not start with a numeral. For DarkBASIC to allow such errors through promotes sloppy programming and would confuse new programmers if they were to 'upgrade' to more professional BASIC programming languages such as Microsoft's Visual BASIC (Ok, semi-professional!)
Also, given the nature of the function, no parameters are needed so the correct code should be as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
hello_world()
wait key
end

function hello_world()
   Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

Functions go at the end of your program and if your program runs into a function 
declaration beware! You can use exitfunction to exit a function easily. 
The brackets that follow a function's name can contain a list of parameters required by the function.
The list should be made up of the variable names to be used for each parameter.
Let's say we would like to place the &quot;Hello World&quot; message anywhere on the screen. We could provide
the x &amp; y coordinates as parameters to the hello_world() function as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
hello_world(20,10)
wait key
end

function hello_world(x,y)
   set cursor x,y
   print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example you can see when we called the hello_world function at the start we provided
2 numbers. When the function is called, these numbers are placed into x and y so that x = 20 and y = 10.
These parameter variables are local only to the function which means they will not change any other variables
of the same name that are outside the function (unless those variables are made global which starts to make
this introduction to functions get more complicated so we will leave that until later).
The best way to use functions is by creating a library with your own commands/procedures.
For example, you can make your own output command by modifying our hello_world function:

&lt;pre&gt;
function output(x,y,msg$)
   set cursor x,y
   print msg$
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using this you can in a sense use Object Oriented Programming, if your a more advanced user.

Example of a Library in DarkBASIC

&lt;pre&gt;
`Basic Function Example

#include &quot;myfunctionlib.dba&quot;
x = 100
y = 10
hello_world(x,y)

`Now we have our own command!

Rem #####################################################################################

`Note the example below was not included in the above program it was in a different file named my
`functionlib.dba
`A little function library

function hello_world(x,y)
set cursor x,y
Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

The #include command in VC++ works like so: 

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
using namespace std;
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In DarkBASIC a library works similarly but not exactly like the 
C++ example. Now you've learned what a function is and does!

Assignment:

Use functions and libraries to make a Mad Libs game.
Make your own command, like one for adding and so on.



This will probably be the last day in the life of lesson 3. We have 
been doing most of the time application and software programming. But 
soon enough we will write a game per day starting with Pong going to 
BreakOut and more. Unfortunately we won't write a Role Playing Game, for 
development of a role playing game takes months and roughly 5,000 or so
lines of code including tools we need to create. 


The Design Process of Software Is Like So

&lt;pre&gt;
The Software I want to Develop Is
It's Main Purpose Is
Problems That Need to be Solved
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;


In fact there's a method that involves a series of pictures 
that I cannot recall and another method similar to the one above. 
I hope you learned something about DarkBASIC programming during the 
course of Lesson 3. Day 9 will continue in the next lesson...

      <text xml:space="preserve">===&lt;center&gt;Day 9 Cont'd&lt;/center&gt;===
 
This lesson is all but one day long. When it's done, we'll move on 
to 2d don't expect mario or pong yet first thing we'll be doing is 
learning string manipulation, in about a day or so then we'll move on 
to images and whatnot. Who likes math? Not me, that's why we'll be 
getting DarkBASIC to do math for us. It'll be easier then using 
a calculator you won't even have to think about it.

Typical Math Operators

&lt;pre&gt;
+ is Increment of a value
= is equal to
- is decrement of a value
÷ is the division symbol. (ALT + 246 to create the ASCII symbol for division)

X multipying
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay, first of all by increment I mean increasing a value by 
whatever and vice versia with decrement as you decrease values. 

Typical Programming Operators

&lt;pre&gt;
+ still addition
= is equal to
- is subtraction
/ is division
* is Multiplication
&lt; is less than
&gt; is greater than
&lt;&gt; is not equal to
&lt;= is less than or equal to
&gt;= is greater than or equal to
:= is assigned the value of...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember the above like you remember Christmas or you'll have 
problems doing math in programming! I can go on with more operators 
but it's not needed in a simple language like DarkBASIC as most of 
the math is taken care of by easier commands like wrapvalue.

This example may be easy but here it is

&lt;pre&gt;
`Math Example
`By Dbtutor

a = 1+2
b = 3-7
c = 9/3
d = 10*2

Print a
Print b
Print c
Print d
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Most people have already known what was going to happen 
and what was going on. 

Here's some easy stuff!

&lt;pre&gt;
`Few math examples

a = 67

hexofa$ = hex$(a) ` hex$ returns value of 'a' as a hexdecimal string.
binaryofa$ = bin$(a) ` bin$ returns value of 'a' as a binary string.

b = 3

c = sqr(b)

inc d
dec e

Print a
Print hexofa$
Print binaryofa$
Print b
Print c
Print d
Print e
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Why you'd need these above commands is beyond me, you only 
need them in rare situations, for more examples of math in 
DarkBASIC consult the DarkBASIC editor's command reference under math.
For now it's over with...

Trust me loops are useful, they do tedious tasks and they're easy to work with.

Take for example a lottery program

&lt;pre&gt;
Dim lottery(100)
lottery(1) = 1
lottery(2) = 2
lottery(3) = 3
lottery(4) = 4
etc...
Print Lottery(1)
Print lottery(2)
Print Lottery(3)
etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above way is for squares, and people without loop knowledge.

Done with a loop
&lt;pre&gt;
`Let's image the dim command above is down here
for a = 1 to 100
     Print lottery(a)
next a
&lt;/pre&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from reader: You can't print &quot;lottery(a)&quot; as it does not exist, instead write this:                                                    
                                                                
dim lottery(100)
for a = 1 to 100
print a
next a
wait key
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using loops remember to indent it makes the program more 
human readable for others. With loops we can finally have more 
advanced input, input without variables, well some variables. Let's 
look at some loops then.

Repeat/Until

&lt;pre&gt;
Repeat
   `what the loop does here
until conditionmet
&lt;/pre&gt;

While/Endwhile

&lt;pre&gt;
While conditionmet
   `What the loop does
endwhile
&lt;/pre&gt;

Do/Loop

&lt;pre&gt;
do
    `task here
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember the only way to exit a loop is by quitting which is a no|no, 
the exit command which is the best way, or a gosub command. In some loops, 
the loop ends once a condition is met, and in others after a task is done 
it exits. If you paid attention you should know what I'm talking about. 
Day's over go eat, sleep, take a walk, whatever come back tomorrow!

=== Day 11 ===

This is the advanced input section, if we want a system key we 
can easily use commands like spacekey(), etc. Go have a look at them, 
they are the easiest to understand, find out how to disable them from being 
able to be pressed in DarkBASIC also while you are there. For other keys 
there's two ways basically scancode(value) which is different per country's keyboard, a Spanish keyboard is different then a British one, and you have to find a value! Or you can use ASCII values, which has a humorous pronunciation(it's pronounced ass key :P). Find out what ASCII stands for at Wikipedia, just type it in the search box and there you go. You can find Wikipedia at[http://www.wikipedia.org CLICK HERE TO GO TO WIKIPEDIA] in case your just curious because I forget I believe it's American Standard Character 
Something Something. We will be using the ASCII because it's the same for every computer 
and no need to use numeric values.

Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
`Loops are needed for input BTW
do
   if inkey$() = &quot;charhere&quot; then exit
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's a key example

&lt;pre&gt;
do
  if inkey$() = &quot;a&quot; then print &quot;Lowercase A&quot;
  if inkey$() = &quot;A&quot; then Print &quot;Uppercase A&quot;
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember A is different from a when using inkey$(). Now the lesson's 
over with, for an assignment find out what ASCII stands for and experiment
with the inkey$().

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Day 12 ===

Day 12 already, you're progressing towards a great career in programming 
DarkBASIC and programming in general! Lots of people have trouble writing 
files in DarkBASIC, and some have problems with Data types and more. This 
lesson will take a lot of time to cover, I'm going to say 5 days for you and 
about 2 weeks for me to write them. Hopefully, I'll get them done before but 
if not well you just have to wait for me or another to contribute. Today, 
we'll learn how to save a file.

Take for example this scenario

&lt;pre&gt;
text$ = &quot;Hey guess what open me up in notepad and see what happens!&quot;
set dir &quot;C:/&quot;
if file exist(&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;) = 1  
   delete file &quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
endif
open to write 1,&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
write string 1,text$
close file 1
open to read 1,&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
read string 1,newtext$
Print newtext$
close file 1
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

What a mouth full! In machine language it takes several thousand lines 
to do this same exact thing crazy or what! As you found out, the code 
above creates a string variable, moves the directory we'll be working in 
to c drive, if the file exist deletes it(or else we cannot overwrite it as 
it already exists), writes the file, closes it, opens it to read the contents, uses a new string to contain the line of text, then Prints it and finally you have to press any key before it ends. Now that's great! But remember 
the extension? You can change it to create your own files. You can also write 
various things such as: bytes, characters, and so on. To see more of what 
you can write view the command reference under the DarkBASIC help file. We'll just be using string for now and later byte.

This example will generate a syntax error and I'll tell you why now

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
delete file &quot;wrong.txt&quot;
open to write 1,&quot;wrong.txt&quot;
write string 1,a
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember numbers are not strings, to make a number a string we can do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
a$ = str$(a)
b = val(a$)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The command str$ changes a number into a value, and the command val 
changes a string into a value. There are many other odd things you can 
do with strings as well which you can see under the DarkBASIC help file 
command reference of strings. See some examples and change them around a bit. 

Here's a useless kinda piece of software for strings

&lt;pre&gt;
`Crazy Strings
`By Dbtutor

cls
message$ = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;ASC() returns the ASCII number of the first letter in the str&quot;
Print asc(message$)
Print &quot;Len counts how many characters in a string&quot;
Print len(message$)
Print &quot;Mid gets the middle write characters of a string&quot;
midval = 3
Print mid$(message$,midval)
Print &quot;Here's the binary of the number 678&quot;
Print bin$(678)
Print &quot;Here's the hex of that number&quot;
Print hex$(678)
Print &quot;There are many more ways of destroying strings&quot;
Print &quot;Much are useless, but take a gander at them&quot;
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you saw above manuiplating strings is easy but pretty much useless. 
In some situations they are useful like a file manager tool which 
we'll be making very soon along with some other file stuff. In the 2d 
tutorial's final part we'll use files to make a very simple tool 
very much like ZZT or MegaZeux. There's lots to cover so bear with me! 
On day 13 we'll be learning more ways of writing files, remember byte? 
Well you can use it to write a value to a file. I used txt has my 
extension, try using .dat, .ini, etc. You can even make one up! Using write, 
you can also write word or an integer value, a long or long integer value, 
and even a float. Why I don't know. 

Good Example of Writing A File:

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
b$ = str$(a)
if file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 then delete file &quot;a&quot;
open to write &quot;a&quot;,1
write string 1,b$
close file 1
if file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 then readit = 1
if readit = 1
   open to read 1,&quot;a&quot;
   read string 1,c$
   d = val(c$)
   Print d
   Print &quot;Same thing! Use val and str! Their better!&quot;
   wait key
   end
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note: from Cody Oebel'''

the above code fails to work properly, and will not compile and run.

I found the If file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 ...  the = 1 is ambiguous, and is not needed.

below is my version of this code snippet

&lt;pre&gt;
`Edit by Cody C Oebel:
 
 g = 11
 set dir &quot;c:/&quot;
 b$ = str$(g)
 if file exist(&quot;a.txt&quot;) then delete file &quot;a.txt&quot;
 open to write 1, &quot;a.txt&quot;
 write string 1, b$
 close file 1
 if file exist (&quot;a.txt&quot;)
 open to read 1, &quot;a.txt&quot;
 read string 1, z$
 d = val(z$)
 print d
 print &quot;This should work now, and is smaller amount of code&quot;
 wait key
 endif
 end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, see what I mean? Later we'll be using current directories and 
file branching statements to make a simple file browser. Very simple! 
Write byte is sometimes used for example in tilemappers and so on but the 
standard is write string because it's simple. Remember keep it 
simple stupid!

Let's write an array
&lt;pre&gt;
dim a$(10)
a$(1) = &quot;jsdakjlakljldsaf&quot;
a$(2) = &quot;ashjajasjhsjks&quot;

save array a$(10),&quot;array.ini&quot;

load array a$(10),&quot;array.ini&quot;

for a = 1 to 10
  Print a$(a)
next a

wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''NOTE: Again this code above did not work: By Cody Oebel'''

Here is my working version for other readers to see the minor mistakes.

Also note at the bottom of the compiler it shows you the format

for save array, and load array e.g. Filename, array.

I also added the variable stringname filename$ to contain &quot;array.ini&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;
dim a$(10)
filename$ = &quot;array.ini&quot;
a$(1) = &quot;jsdakjlakljldsaf&quot;
a$(2) = &quot;ashjajasjhsjks&quot;
set dir &quot;c:/&quot;
save array filename$, a$(10)

load array filename$, a$(10)

for a = 1 to 10
  Print a$(a)
next a

wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we can save big ole arrays, database programming anyone? 
Remember our guessing game? Go back and fix it up a bit so that you 
can include this newly learned code in it. You've learned a lot about 
files so far. Perpare for directories on Day 13!

=== Day 13 ===

Day 13 arrived and we're only two days away from the half way point. 
That's great news, as soon as you can be a master programmer in 
DarkBASIC the better! Well, really DarkBASIC takes awhile to master, not 
to scare you but I'm not a master programmer either. If you know somebody with 
a good game it's usually not that they're the best programmer but 
just a great game maker. Some DarkBASIC users have gone on to make 
commercial games such as: Dumbo &amp; Cool, Star Wraith, etc. DarkBASIC 
is great for games and team efforts. Not so for applications as you'll 
find out today.

Here's a simple file manager

&lt;pre&gt;
Input &quot;Set directory to: &quot;;direct$
set dir direct$
&lt;/pre&gt;

You don't get to see files do you? We can easily view files and 
whatever using some simple commands. Remember some are tedious, but 
when in use with loops! Now this is a file manager, you change dirs, 
view files, and whatnot, it's not a professional tool, it's showing you 
the ropes. But before we do it's time to have a look at a better 
file manager.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Simple File Manager
`By Dbtutor

`Get the directory to use
setdirect$ = get dir$()

`Set the directory to the current directory
set dir setdirect$

`Current amount of items
items = 10

find first
Print get file name$(1)

for a = 2 to items
  find next
  Print get file name$(a)
next a

Wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt; 

Wow, that's cool and all but there's no user input and no file 
manipulation dus this program is file system viewer. Just like 
windows explorer! Really nowadays writing a file manager is pretty 
much useless especially if it's ugly. But file managers in your program 
in DarkBASIC allows better productivity then in typing in the file 
name or directory and whatnot. We're not going back to the DOS days 
God forbid type in a command and hope it works! Remember I said tedious? 
Well there is a much better way to write the following program above. Don't 
worry we'll be writing a file manager later! Before I show you a more 
productive way.

Follow these instructions:

&lt;pre&gt;
Go to http://www.computechtenerife.com/
Register as a user.
Click on Dark Basic Support and then Downloads
Scroll down and find the function libraries
Click on the Db file selector
Download and extract the files for usage later
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay now that's done we can see a better way of doing things in 
the file system viewer world. We're only a few blocks away from 
the file manager.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Simple File Viewer
`By Dbtutor

set dir &quot;C:\&quot;

Perform checklist for files
for a = 1 to checklist quantity()
  Print checklist string$(a)
next a

Wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

See how many lines less we have? There is other perform checklist for 
things such as directories and devices. Go have a look and change 
perform checklist for files command with a few of them.


Now remember that file manager library you downloaded, if you 
haven't guessed we'll be modding some of the code inside the include 
file(not the function library) to make our own modded file manager. Remember 
the library is copyright to a DarkBASIC user known as TDK_MAN one of the 
best DarkBASIC programmers out there besides you(just flattering) I'm sure 
you could beat him at his game after 30 years. Just kidding if your reading 
this TDK no offense. He's made lots of DarkBASIC programs including MatEdit 
which we'll be using later on in the 3d chapters along with a 3d moddler and whatnot. 

Here's the Source Code

&lt;pre&gt;

There you are a easy file manager thanks to other peoples function 
libraries! You can find lots on TDK's site(http://www.matedit.com/db.htm). 
Along with tutorials for functions and more. That's all for Day 13, there 
was no quiz for awhile so expect a lot of quizzes later on. I couldn't 
find anything worth quizzing you on. There will be lotsa data going on 
in Day 14.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 14&lt;/center&gt;===

We already know what variables are, but you haven't used data 
statements yet. Data statements work very easily, you just put 
data, space and then put all the types of data.

Examples of Data

&lt;pre&gt;
data &quot;strings&quot;,12,5.6,&quot;and integers and floats tooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!&quot;
data 12
data &quot;string me&quot;
data 5.50
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can have lots of data types in one statement as long as you 
separate them with commas. That's useful but how can we read the data? 
Well we can use read.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Read Example
data 4
read var1
Print var1
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use restore to reset the data pointer you'll see what I'm 
talking about later. It's good practice to use different labels to 
store different data.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Big Data Example
gosub datastored

datastored:
data 1234
data 12
data 1
data 4
data 56 
gosub readdata

readdata:
read var1
read var2
read var3
read var4
read var5

print var1
Print var2
Print var3
print var4
Print var5
&lt;/pre&gt;

First it stores data then reads it, you can do this backwards 
if you want. Whichever way you read and store data it works. Now we're
into games, no explaining(well some) just pure games programming. 
We'll program a game a day woohoo let's go now!

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Day 15 ===

The half way point, finally after all that coding and reading and days. 
This chapter we'll be making a text adventure using more text commands 
you'll now learn. Plus you'll learn how to clear the screen in various 
colors, and oh boy you're gonna enjoy this lesson. 

You probably thought, my God does the text always have to be white!

&lt;pre&gt;
`NOPE
ink rgb(0,255,0),1
Print &quot;OMG FINALLY COLOR!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are! I'm a Canadian but I still spell color as color instead 
of colour. What's the RGB for? It stands for Red, Green, Blue, look 
at your monitor with a lens you'll see lots of those pixels in those 
colors. The rgb must be separated by brackets and then a comma for the transparentcy value. The transparentcy ranges from 0 to 255. RGB values 
range from 0 to 255 also.

Here's Some Colors to Remember

&lt;pre&gt;
255,0,0 - red
0,255,0 - green
255,255,0 - yellow
0,0,255 - blue
0,255,255 - cyan
255,255,255 - white
0,0,0 - black
255,0,255 - pink
192,192,192 - light grey
&lt;/pre&gt;

To see more have a look in paint, view the rgbs values and fool 
around that's the way I found out, so you should find out too. Using 
these above values you should be able to make nice colors. The lower the 
value the darker, the higher the lighter.

Now after that you want a better way to Print right?

&lt;pre&gt;
text x,y,string$
&lt;/pre&gt;

When using text, you need to use + instead of a semi-colon to 
separate variables. All values must be a string, remember to convert a
value to a string use the str$ command as seen in Lesson 6.

The Right Way

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
text 1,100,&quot;This is no syntax error &quot;+str$(a)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Wrong Way

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
text 1,100,&quot;This is a syntax error you won't see this text until you fix &quot;+a
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can change the font easily 

&lt;pre&gt;
set text font fontnameasstring$
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can make our text opaque easily too or allow us to write over
other text values

&lt;pre&gt;
set text opaque
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's style changes

&lt;pre&gt;
set text bold
set text italic
set text bolditalic
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's how to change the size

&lt;pre&gt;
set text size integernumber
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay here's all those in a program

&lt;pre&gt;
set text font &quot;Times New Roman&quot;
set text size 30
set text bold
text 1,100,&quot;Hey&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You assignment is to fool around with text values and 
colors, come back tomorrow

===&lt;center&gt;Day 16&lt;/center&gt;===

Okay, now we've learned lots about changing text values it's 
time to write your own text adventure. We'll call it 
&quot;Dungeons of Doom&quot;, it'll have the player to escape the 
dank dungeons of a castle using numerous data commands 
and whatnot.

First let's do an outline:

[[Image:outline6ql.th.jpg]]

Now we have an outline let's write a simple story:

Evil Elves have captured you in their prison, now you must escape 
the Dungeon of Doom. Beware some turns lead to doom, others lead 
to a way out. 

There is only two ways to die in our game, since it's more like 
a maze anyways. 

Now Let's Do Some Data For It:

Now then your assignment to show you know what's going on is to go 
back and add in comments describing what's happening in each. The final 
part in your assignment is to edit all the code and data statements to 
make a sequel, add rooms, and more. No this game is not a text role 
playing game, we'll make a text role playing game in the next lesson. I 
think tomorrow your gonna have a break-out of game programming.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 17&lt;/center&gt;===

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! We're going to make a Pong game today, a BreakOut 
game today, and your going to learn about images, sprites and more! Okay, 
so how can we load multimedia in DarkBASIC? Remember in the file manager 
program we had some confusing formats of files in there. One thing I 
didn't add was animations unfortunately. 

Multimedia Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
`Image
`Supports bmps and jpgs only
id = 1
string$ = &quot;myimage.bmp&quot;
load image string$,id
x = 1
y = 1
paste image id,x,y

`Music
`Sound works the same way, only instead the word music is replaced with the word `sound
`Supports are: wav, mp3, and midi
musid = 1
musstring$ = &quot;mymusic.mid&quot;
load music musstring$,musid
play music musid
stop music musid
loop music musid

`Animation
`Supports gif, avi, may support other formats
animid = 1
animstring$ = &quot;myanimation.gif&quot;
load animation animstring$,animid
play animation animid

`Bitmap
`Works same as image only supports bitmaps, you can load only 32
bmpid = 1
bmp$ = &quot;mybmp.bmp&quot;
load bitmap bmp$
`This pastes the bitmap, but the id can be used to create bitmaps at certain `locations 
`see bmps under the command reference for those details

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Go look at some more examples of multimedia in DarkBASIC, some more 
are 3dsound, and you can play music off your cd too. We'll be using 
some more examples of multimedia in DarkBASIC in later chapters for 
now we'll be focusing on the said above in the example.

Your main question may be what is a sprite? A sprite is a 
2d character that is used in games. Basically a sprite is a 
image that does more, in DarkBASIC sprites are the lifeblood 
of the system.

Sprite Works Like

&lt;pre&gt;
sprite spriteid,x,y,imageid
&lt;/pre&gt;

You cannot use load bitmap and use that as an image for your sprite, 
you can only use images loaded by the load image command.


Before you did not manipulate the x,y cords of a image in DarkBASIC 
well that's about to change. Before we start, if we leave the computer 
to take care of our game's framerate then our game will run slow and 
differently on different paced computers. Use sync on, to turn the 
framerate over too you and away from the computer. Every time the 
sync command is used the screen is updated constantly. Use 
the sync rate command, to set the rate the frame refreshes, 
mostly 30 is good for 3d games in DarkBASIC, and 40 for 2d games 
is also good too, but use 30 to make sure. There are a 
few commands in darkbasic that draws crude graphics, the commands 
we'll use are: line(line startingx,toendingx,startingy,toendingy), 
circle(x,y,radius), and dot(dot x,y). They draw these graphics in 
the default ink, if the ink is not set it'll use cyan as a default. 
There are more commands that draw different basic 2d shapes, but 
we won't be using them. If your curious go check them out 
under BASIC2d under the DarkBASIC command reference.


Here's an example of you being able to move a circle
&lt;pre&gt;
`Moving Circle
`By Dbtutor

`Hide the mouse
hide mouse

`Setup sync rate
sync on
sync rate 30

`Make the screen grey
cls rgb(192,192,192) 

`Select an ink color for us, make it all transparent
ink rgb(0,155,0),0

`Draw the circle at cordinates provided
xpos = 100
ypos = 200
circle xpos,ypos,10

`Start the main loop
do
   `Clean up mess left over, and re-draw circle
   cls rgb(192,192,192)
   circle xpos,ypos,10

   `User control
   if upkey() = 1 then ypos = ypos - 7
   if downkey() = 1 then ypos = ypos + 7
   if rightkey() = 1 then xpos = xpos + 7
   if leftkey() = 1 then xpos = xpos - 7
   `Allow no leaving the screen
   if xpos &gt; 600 then xpos = xpos - 7
   if xpos &lt; 1 then xpos = xpos + 7
   if ypos &gt; 400 then ypos = ypos - 7
   if ypos &lt; 1 then ypos = ypos + 7
   `Refresh the screen
   sync
loop
   
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wow that worked out great eh? Let's get some sleep for now.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 18&lt;/center&gt;===

Before we start I'd just like to thank everybody for visiting 
this wikibook, taking time to read it and for knowing when I google 
&quot;DarkBASIC Programming&quot; I see my book on the first page. That's a great 
feeling! I hope you learn something, I'll try and get this book done very 
soon but I've been very busy with learning new things and my schoolwork. 
I've been learning Assembly, C++, Pascal, &amp; Visual Basic I'm also 
considering buying a console building kit &quot;The XGameStation&quot; by 
Mr Lamothe or as you may know him Andre' Lamothe or Lord Necron. 
He's one my biggest inspirations for programming besides 
Lee Bamber(the visionary behind DarkBASIC). Okay let's start with the 
pong game, I must say it's been a challenge writing this pong game, 
I've had lots of bugs with it. You must use your own images, 
only the source code is included.

'''Understanding the Material'''
Before I go ahead with the Pong game there is some things that I 
must, nay, need to explain to you. First, of all you need to 
understand what a &quot;sprite&quot; is, yes I know I mentioned it but not has 
in depth as I need to now, again that was just a basic example. Basically, 
put a sprite is nothing but an active image that allows more manipulation
then standard bitmaps. In our terms, speaking a sprite is in most cases 
nothing but a 2d character. We can do more with sprites in DarkBASIC 
then we can simply using just plain images.

You already know how to setup a sprite. But you do not know how to 
delete sprites, how to detect collision with sprites, and have not used 
them very much yet. The syntax of deleting a sprite is simple: delete 
sprite spriteid. The sprite obviously must exist if not you'll get a 
runtime error stating that the &quot;bob&quot; or sprite does not exist. The same 
works for collisions with sprites: the precise and best way is by using 
this command sprite collision(spriteid1,spriteid2). Again they must exist 
has I stated, and you must have two, again I'm stating the obvious but 
there are pretty dumb people out there. 

The other way works the same thing except it's not has precise and 
goes like this: sprite hit(spriteid1,spriteid2). Easy! What may not be 
so easy after reading the code below is what the random numbers are for. 
These random numbers simply put are so that the computer generates a 
number from 0 to 1 in which direction the ball should go. They are for 
both X axis and Y axis and you should know what those are already.

Okay, so we've made Pong the next step is to make a Break-Out game. Just giving you,
the source code of the game would prove you didn't code the pong game by yourself.
So what I'm going to do is let you program your own break-out game, and I will give some
guided examples. After this quick break-out game exercise I will be discussing multimedia!

Collisions

''if sprite collision(paddle,ball) = 1 then bouncball = 1''

Possible Solutions to Make the Ball Bounce :S

-Setup a variable called ballmovex, set it's value to random 1 or 0.
-if the ball strikes 0 make it move left, and in the case of 1 right
-do the same thing with a variable called ballmovey, except in this
-case moving up or down.

Possible Solutions of Setting Up Blocks

-Setup an array which holds the x positions of your bricks, and the 
y positions of your bricks. Then one for if the brick has been struck,
so if the brick has been struck it will equal 1 or true and then have
conditional statements(if and thens) for the action to break the brick.

''if if sprite collision(paddle,brickhit(bricknum)) = 1 then destroybrick = 1''



if destroybrick = 1

  brickx(bricknum) = -1
  bricky(bricknum) = -1

endif



Something to Remember:
   Remember you need a do loop to accept advanced input such as inkey$(), returnkey(), etc.



I've given lots of suggestions as to how to complete the Break-Out game, hopefully this 
will go down nice and easy without heartburn. If you have a case of &quot;what thes&quot; then 
I suggest you visit the codebase on the official DarkBASIC home page: http://www.thegamecreators.com, it has everything a DarkBASIC coder shall need.

 '''Multimedia In DarkBASIC - Audio'''
Not many people can say that they hate music, in fact most people love hearing ambient
music in games, I know I do! Above, I used some strange commands, play sound, play music,
load music, play music. Well, DarkBASIC has three audio supports, MP3, Wave, and Midi.
Loading music is very simple, and sound works the same way. So I'm going to give you a
code example, you bring the sounds, I'll bring the code!




'''Code Example for Audio:'''
 Rem Audio Example
 `Load audio
 load sound &quot;mysound.wav&quot;,1
 load music &quot;mymusic.mid&quot;,1
 `Play audio once
 play sound 1
 `Loop music
 loop music 1
 `wait key
 wait key
 stop music 1
 loop sound 1


So what are the numbers at the end? Remember in images, well this number is a numeric ID 
given. Remember the location of your audio, and extension!

 '''Multimedia in DarkBASIC - Animations'''
This will probably be the last multimedia entry, unless someone does one on dlls, 
I won't be, since I have an older version of DarkBASIC.

Animations at this point in time do not include those such as mario walking, however
they do include those such as animated GIFs(Graphic Interchange Format), and
AVIs(Audio Video Interleave). So far I believe there are two formats for
animation .gif, and .avi please tell me so if otherwise. Animations can
be useful for game over screens and maybe even some Mortal Kombat style
finishers!!







'''Code Sample'''
 load animation &quot;animation1.avi&quot;,1
 play animation 1
 wait key
 stop animation 1
 load animation &quot;animation2.gif&quot;,2
 play animation 2
 loop animation 2

This is about 2D Games.  This Wiki helped me become the programmer I am today.  No, I am not DBTutor, but I will contribute.  I am IRON 
PROGRAMMER!!  Talk to me on the DarkBASIC Forums if you have a question.

I challenge YOU to create a 2D Melee Game.  These are simple.  Here is an example:
&lt;pre&gt;
''cls rgb(150,150,150)

&lt;/pre&gt;
That is a simple format for a multiplayer melee game in 2D.  Notice
I have cleverly not supplied the media!  Hahahahahaaaa!  Now get programming!

==&lt;center&gt;Foreword&lt;/center&gt;==
First of all, thanks for checking out this book on DarkBASIC. It's the first WikiBook on the subject of DarkBASIC Programming. Not everyone can program, 
but in the information age I believe that it's necessary for everyone to 
gain the skills to use different types of technology. Especially, 
computers and programming. Today and for the next 30 days you'll learn 
a lot about DarkBASIC Programming and a lot about what you can accomplish 
using a computer. DarkBASIC is all about making DirectX do your 
evil bidding and your domination of the world of computer game programming. 
I hope you read and contribute to this book, as well as rant 
because then I can fix stuff others will insult. I hope you enjoy!

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 1 - Introduction to Programming&lt;/center&gt;==
                         
In this tutorial I'm going to assume you have no prior programming experience, 
or else you wouldn't be reading this book. You would pick up the manual, 
compare it to C++, and program in DarkBASIC easily. First of all not to 
scare you but game programming is not easy and secondly you are not going to 
make a &lt;insert copycat blockbuster game here&gt; killer or clone or whatever 
in DarkBASIC for a long time. I'm also going to assume you have v1.0 of the &quot;classic&quot; or non-pro edition of DarkBASIC or else with another version you'll have 
some problems running this code unfortunately. Programming is not a 
new concept, and there are many hundreds of languages 
such as DarkBASIC out there, one such programming language comparable 
to DarkBASIC is BlitzBASIC, and you may have heard of Visual Basic.

== So what is programming?  ==

This isn't a stupid question. Programming is not just making applications for Windows, or talking a language your computer understands. Programming is input, process, and output. If you take computer sciences, chances are you'll be doing program outlines, but right now you're a hobbyist programmer so let's keep it simple. Not all of us know VC++ or Pascal. DarkBASIC is game oriented. You can make applications in it, but it's harder.  There are no message boxes in the version we'll be using. But DarkBASIC is easy and fun, especially for beginner's and junior programmers. Instead of having to write 1000+ lines of code to put a 2d character on screen you'll write one, instead of writing a massive program to make a cube spin you'll write a simple and human readable one in 20 or less lines. If you have no patience, take it slow and easy and don't move on until you understand it all or else you'll be bald by the time you finish this wikibook. I will say this: this book is a work in progress. I'll be finished as soon as possible so, bare with me please. Programming is simply entering lines of code that once compiled, or is run, tells the computer to follow out a task until it's done. What's involved is input, or you programming; processing or computing; and finally output, what you get to see. 
[[Image:Input-process-output.JPG]]


'''Figure 1.1'''(This is the Model of Input, Process and Output.)
'''So you know:''' A coder is another word for a programmer.



All programs follow the above method, since every program is (1) certainly programmed, (2) is certainly compiled, and (3) certainly displays results. Now, just what is code then? Code is the recipe for your program. Computers won't do a task wrong. You'll do the task 
wrong. To keep your program from doing things that could harm computers, the compiler(or program that checks to see if the program works) runs the program and generates syntax errors (if there's something wrong). These syntax errors, tell you that you made a mistake and you must fix it before you can see your program(in most cases). So, computers don't make mistakes.

There are many sorts of errors also! The most common is called ''' a syntax error '''. A syntax error are mistakes in your program's code. A programming language like a written language is incorrect if it contains things that are gibberish. Like in English, asdfjdj is not a word, it's gibberish. Just like in DarkBASIC, print is a command, where as printf is not. Another kind of error is called a run-time error, this is when your program compiles but you don't get the results you want. Such as if your writing is sloppy, the word &quot;hello&quot; may look like jello and the person will get the wrong information from it. Run-time errors are things that aren't suppose to happen, like when in your favorite video game, when a character can sometimes walk through a wall, or the program crashing when this happens.


The process of fixing your mistakes is called debugging. You'll get familiar with this; half your time or more will be spent doing debugging. So as much as possible, save, compile, debug, and run. It'll save you lots of anger, and stress. Finally remember this: with computers, the language goes through assembly or getting put into binary, and sent back to your programming language. If the binary pattern is correct, then you have no syntax errors. Remember, 0s are off or false, and 1s are on or true. Remember when I said assembly above? 


Well, here's how it works. First off, you compile or check syntax, then the code you entered passes through what's called machine language or assembly (its name changes depending on what its doing when it's compiling its assembler). Then it becomes pure binary (which is not human readable but meant for computers; they cannot understand anything other than 0s and 1s). Then it is sent back to the compiler where if the binary matches what's correct, it gets executed. If it doesn't, you get a syntax error and must debug. Now, don't quote me on that but that's basically what happens. So now you're ready to begin programming in DarkBASIC and will know what I talk about.

One more thing: DarkBASIC is not case sensitive.  If you don't know what this means, it means that DarkBASIC does not distinguish between upper-case letters and lower-case ones.

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 2 - The Hello World Tradition&lt;/center&gt;==
                         


Alrighty, you came back. Good, let's hope you have played around with the DarkBASIC editor. Before you find out what the hello world tradition is (older programmers don't spoil it for them!), I think I should tell you something. The DarkBASIC editor is not very windows friendly, so make sure you download an IDE you like and then link it to the DarkBASIC. 

'''So you know:''' an IDE is an integrated development environment. It allows programming to be easier for professionals and beginners alike. For now, don't worry what an IDE is too much, you're only beginning after all.

Okay, now then time to get to the tradition.


''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;This is Dbtutor's wikibook on DarkBASIC Programming!!&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code''

Copy and paste this source code into the IDE or editor (whichever) and run it. What you get is the easiest program you'll ever write in DarkBASIC. The hello world example is proud tradition of beginning programmers, so let's carry it on. Hello World Program puts the text hello world on the screen. But what are the quotation marks for? The quotation marks are used to show what you want to put on the screen. Otherwise, it would look like one big command. 

'''Your Assignment:'''

Replace Hello World with any text you want&lt;br&gt;



First of all, I hope you completed the assignment above.  In case you haven't, or had problems with this program I'll show you how. Okay, let's say you want to print a couple of things and you need it spaced for readability. Remember I said that print, prints the things inside the quotes? Well they're called strings, now strings are characters that you can change and manipulate. With no string to technically print, you'll just get a blank space. Now for all on one line you use a semi-colon(;). Experiment with these two methods above until you understand them. In DarkBASIC, your program already ends on its own doesn't it? 



But, it's good practice if you use the command &quot;end&quot; where your program needs to quit. So after the print commands in hello world, insert the command &quot;end&quot;. Now, go to file and build EXE, save the EXE in whatever folder you want and run it. Technically it should just be a flash so quick you cannot see it. That's where you need some sort of waiting system, or input just to let you see the results. So delete the exe and open up DarkBASIC again, in our hello world before the end command insert a wait key. What a wait key does is allow the famous press of any key for the program to end, so rebuild the exe of this program and now run it. The program isn't very windows friendly is it? At the top of the program put in these commands:

''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Set window on
Set window layout 1,1,1
Set Window title &quot;Hello World - A Friendly Greeting From DarkBASIC&quot;
Set window position 100,200
Set window size 640,480

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code ''

Now run the hello world program, see what happens? We now have a nice little window friendly environment. But hey, if you're on a different computer with different settings you'll miss some of the text, and what on earth are all those numbers for anyways? Okay the numbers are the X coordinates and the Y coordinates in case you didn't do math in school X is horizontal and Y is vertical. In case, you don't know what those words are X runs left and right or across, and Y runs up and down. So X &amp; Y are 2 axes so we have 2 dimensions, when we get to 3d expect to get dimensional for a paragraph or two. Now then for our last part of the day, let's find out how to change the position of where our text goes.

''Code''

&lt;pre&gt;

Set cursor 1,50

&lt;/pre&gt;

''End of Code''

----


Insert this piece of code above, right above the first Print statement. Our program is long now and we may also forget what some of the things above do. Welcome to comments, the Rem command lets you make notes, anything after Rem is ignored. You should always comment your code, so that others can understand it, and so you can know what you where thinking when you coded it and why you coded it the way you did. Remember, comment heavily!!

'''So you know:''' Rem is short for Remark, and if I haven't told you yet BASIC stands for Beginner's All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.  

Here's what your program should look like in the end, roughly:


'''Hello World Program Results'''

&lt;pre&gt;

Rem Setup the window
Set window on 
Set window layout 1,1,1
Set window title &quot;Hello World Program&quot;
Set window position 100,200
Set window size 640,480

Rem put the first line of text 50 pixels down
Set cursor 1,50
Print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;A friendly greeting from DarkBASIC!&quot;

Rem wait for the press of any key
Wait key
Rem then end

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 3 - Fundamentals of DarkBASIC&lt;/center&gt;==
                         


Well, we're almost at the end of your first week  
experiencing DarkBASIC programming or at least this book! Okay, 
the fundamentals are all about logic, developing programs, design, 
setting outlooks and the building blocks. This is not application 
oriented, it's more game oriented as DarkBASIC is for game programming. 
You'll find out about conditions, variables, logic and more. Remember, 
awhile ago when I brought up 0s and 1s, well a better way of looking at 
them is TRUE and FALSE. DarkBASIC is simple, so there are no boolean operators 
or are there? Let's say you declare a variable called, oh, let's say A. For 
now A = 0 until we say A = 1, there's another value called B and it's equal 
to 1. If we had C = 1 when A or B is true or if C = 1 when A and B equal true, 
but what if neither of these values are true? Then we'd have to use 
another value and our program quickly looks like this:



:if A or B = 1
:C = 1
:else
:D = 1
:endif




That's logic, that's conditions, that's the if/endif command. Now I 
didn't indent above which I should have so anytime you use if/endif I 
want you to indent for the statements used okay? If you copied / pasted 
the above snippet in DarkBASIC and compiled it, you'd get no errors but 
if you'd ran this program you'd just get nothing. Why? They're just values 
and there is really no output to the screen involved, so let's change 
this program a bit.


'''Simple Conditional Statements Program''' 

&lt;pre&gt;

Rem we can also use a ` to comment quickly I will do that
Rem from now on!

`Declare some variables
a = 1
b = 0

`The conditional statement
if a or b = 1
   c = 1
else
   d = 1
endif

if c = 1 then Print &quot;Condition C is Met&quot;
if d = 1 then Print &quot;Condition D is Met&quot;
wait key
end

&lt;/pre&gt;

As you saw I used variables above, in case you didn't know variables 
are a way of storing data which can change. As you saw above if I changed 
the OR operator to a AND b = 1 then we'd have a whole new ball game on our 
hands. But let's sidetrack a little, if you wanted to remove the text on the 
screen you have to use this command &quot;cls&quot; which means clear screen. You can also change the
transparency value of cls by simply putting a value ranging from 
0 to 255 after the cls command. And I'll show you in a few lessons on how you can change the 
screen color to whatever you wish! You may be wondering about variables 
in DarkBASIC there are roughly three data types

&lt;pre&gt;
Rem Clear the Screen
cls
Rem String Data
&quot;Wikibooks rock!&quot;
&quot;My name is John Smith&quot;
&quot;Look I'm a string!&quot;
Rem the number below is a real number or a floating point decimal
35.5555
Rem the number below that is an integer number
12345
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are! For, good practice at the start of all your programs 
put cls, in other languages until you clear the screen you have text on 
the screen. For example, in pascal unless you clear the screen you get the
same text leftover from your last modification. Indenting is also important 
but we'll get to that later. So why comment or indent? In team efforts or 
open source projects it makes your program more human readable, also it's 
easier to read and locate, plus you'll need to remember what's happening 
when you come back to your project later on and you might forget. Back to variables, 
you can name variables whatever you want but make sure they're not 
to long and they briefly describe what it does or used for. 

Here are some variable examples

&lt;pre&gt;
string$ = &quot;Hey I'm a string and I love it!&quot;
float# = 333.445
integer = -11111
&lt;/pre&gt;

So why are there symbols in front of the variables? This shows what 
kind of variable we're dealing with, a $ is a string? A real or float 
is a #, in some languages there is no symbol in front of the values which 
can be a bit confusing. So again this makes it more human readable. So when designing software make sure it's source code is human readable! Get into good habits in programming like indenting - it'll save you and others time. 
For now, clear your mind and come back again tomorrow.



Alright it's time for some input other than press any key. Wouldn't you like 
to make your own game like Mad Libs? I'm trying to make one now in Visual C++, well in DarkBASIC you have to use the Input command. The input command needs a prompt(optional) and then a variable to store the input taken in. 
So what would this look like?

&lt;pre&gt;

Remstart
Input Example
By Dbtutor
Yes you can have groups of comments
Remend

Input &quot;Insert Name Here &quot;,name$
Print name$;&quot; is your name&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember semi-colons? Well they can also separate your string 
from a variable(even if it is another string strange eh?). You can also 
have input as just a variable input so it would look like this.

&lt;pre&gt;
Input a$
&lt;/pre&gt;

Oh yes you can use floats and integers also using input! Above where 
I use a comma you can also use a semi-colon if you prefer. Remstart means everything after it is a comment so beware, it will make everything 
a comment until you use the Remend command. What if you're database 
programming in DarkBasic(not a good practice use Visual Basic instead I advise!) and you have a hundred clients that need to be stored in variables? 
You can use the Dim command!

&lt;pre&gt;
Dim arrayname(arrayvalue,arrayvalue2(optional),arrayvalue3(optional)
arrayname(arrayvalue) = value
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let me show a more indepth example, and you can still use 
strings, integers and floats as long as you follow the 
rules(remember which symbol if any goes in front!).

A good dim statement

&lt;pre&gt;
dim list$(10)
list$(0) = &quot;Milk&quot;
list$(1) = &quot;Bread&quot;
list$(2) = &quot;Whatever&quot;
Etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

A bad dim statement

&lt;pre&gt;
dim list$(10)
list$(1) = &quot;Whatever&quot;
list$(11) = &quot;This is a no no - you can't exceed the array declared value!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hopefully you've been using these methods now, if not go 
review everything and put them into practice. 

'''Your Assignment'''

Correct answer for 6 is N/A , or D  






Okay, nice job if you didn't cheat and got a good mark or else try 
again until you do so. Let's take some time now to learn about game design 
a tad. Okay, let's take Donkey Kong Country it's a great graphical game and 
it's very fun. But some say that it has bad game design, in a sense it does 
you collect things that have no real value, does nothing special for the player. Let's look at Super Mario Bros.


You collect coins to give the player an extra life and a higher score, 
you collect green mushrooms to also get a quick extra life, your main attack 
is jumping and you must avoid falling off the platforms, there is lots for 
the player to discover on their own, you finally collect big mushrooms to be stronger and if your lucky a flower to get a sort of hippy firepower. 
That's a good outlook when designing a platform game, it's alright to 
loosely base design on other successful games but don't outright 
copycat it.


Now let's look at some Apogee games, Biomenace for example is like 
mario only more matured you have a gun but the basis for a good platformer 
is there. The game is based around the new advantage for the player as your 
gun is your survival. In space invaders, you do not collect things but 
it's a classic survival game, the arcade basis is survive as long as 
possible, get the highest score, with limited resources and powerups 
to temporarily allow prolonged survival through the hard parts. Let's look 
at an RPG, for example Final Fantasy is about your character 
growing and learning, it also has focus on the story. 


There are no real levels as you build your character until he's the ultimate 
in the universe and then defeat the main baddy, so really it's you the man. 
Focus on the main area of your game and build around it, I have done this for awhile and generally my games are liked. Do not make the game too hard, and if you find it fun after millions of test phases it's good. If you the 
designer feel any lukewarmness around any part of the game, change it until 
you feel happy. try to imagine what a total stranger will feel! Design is as important 
as making it work, without design how will you create a game? You have nothing 
to go on except making it up as you go. Remember, before all else is gameplay, then multimedia, then story and finally test your game and put it all together. Play games to see what makes them fun!


Now, let's look at some operators. These are things that help us use math and logic in
Dark Basic, they should be straightforward.

'''Operators'''

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; is Greater Than
&lt; is Less Than
&gt;= is Greater than or equal to
&lt;= is Less than or equal to
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now let's apply the above to condition statements.

&lt;pre&gt;
`10 = 9 is not 1 it's 0 
`So no text will be printed
if 10 = 9 then print &quot;That'll never happen&quot;
`But 10 is greater then or equal to itself
if 10 &gt;= 10 then Print &quot;This will always happen&quot;
`10 is greater then 8 
if 10 &gt; 8 then Print &quot;10 is bigger then 8 no doubt&quot;  
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In number crunching we'll see square roots and all the math commands in DarkBASIC but for now we'll just deal with the rnd command.

Here's the Syntax:

&lt;pre&gt;
variable = rnd(value)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Unfortunately rnd runs from 0 to the set range value, I do not know 
how to change it I'm afraid but if you need help consider asking a 
question on the DarkBASIC forums: [http://www.thegamecreators.com 
The Game Creators]. This link takes you to the homepage of DarkBASIC I 
have no username on the forum but did before, but since everyone was too 
eager to cut each other's throats I stopped visiting. Follow the rules to 
a tee or they'll bury you, and make sure you know what you're posting 
and expect the worst. Sorry, for scaring you but sometimes it's the truth 
I've had lots of feelings hurt and been angered at the sheer cruelness of 
the users before. Now then let's make a guessing game!!




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from a reader: You can get around this problem by simply using &quot;value&quot;
as one less than the highest number you want to get to, and then adding 1,
for example, if I want to generate a random number from 1 to 6 (like a
standard 6-sided dice):

variable = rnd(5) + 1

We use the value of 5 because that is one less than 6 (the number that we want).
This will generate a number from 0 to 5, and then add one, creating a number
from 1 to 6. Hope this helps, and I would have asked before adding this, but I
didn't see your contact info anywhere.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------




&lt;pre&gt;
`Guessing Game Example
`By Dbtutor

cls

`Ask the users for their name
Input &quot;Enter your name before you play! &quot;;name$
wait key
cls

`Create a random number let's change the range a bit
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1
if value = 1 then value = 2
if value = 2 then value = 3
if value = 3 then value = 4
if value = 4 then value = 5
if value = 5 then value = 6
if value = 6 then value = 7
if value = 7 then value = 8
if value = 8 then value = 9
if value = 9 then value = 10

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:
Input &quot;Take a guess &quot;;name$;&quot;! &quot;;guess
gosub checkguess

`Check the guess
checkguess:
if guess &gt; value
  wrong = wrong+1
  Print &quot;Sorry too high!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess &lt; value
  wrong=wrong+1
  Print &quot;Too low!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wowzers! You started off programming hello world and now you've made 
a guessing game! Keep up the good work, if you're brave enough to show off 
your program at the newcomer's corner at the DarkBASIC forums. Now what 
does gosub do? Gosub stands for Go Subroutine, it's just a shorter geekier 
way of saying it. You need to have a label to jump too, and the label must be declared like so.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from another reader: I have noticed that if you write the following line
&lt;pre&gt;
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1
if value = 1 then value = 2
if value = 2 then value = 3
if value = 3 then value = 4
if value = 4 then value = 5
if value = 5 then value = 6
if value = 6 then value = 7
if value = 7 then value = 8
if value = 8 then value = 9
if value = 9 then value = 10
&lt;/pre&gt;
The game will choose a number, and then increase it until it reaches 10. All you have to do is to press 10 when you're asked for the number and you won. To correct the problem, write the program as this:
&lt;pre&gt;
`Guessing Game Example
`By Dbtutor
`modified by Huruba Dumitru Alin

cls

`Ask the users for their name
Input &quot;Enter your name before you play! &quot;;name$
wait key
cls

`Create a random number let's change the range a bit
value = rnd(9)
if value = 0 then value = 1

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:
Input &quot;Take a guess &quot;;name$;&quot;! &quot;;guess
gosub checkguess

`Check the guess
checkguess:
if guess &gt; value
  wrong = wrong+1
  Print &quot;Sorry too high!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess &lt; value
  wrong=wrong+1
  Print &quot;Too low!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now the game will only choose a number from 1 to 9, all you have to do next is to quess it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from another reader: I found that there is an easier way to do the correction above.
Dbtutor wanted a number one through ten and your correction only brought the number through 1 to 9.
Also because of the way you wrote this, the probability of getting a 1 is higher 
now than getting any other number. An easier way to fix this is like this...
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
`Guessing Game Example
`By Dbtutor
`modified by Huruba Dumitru Alin


cls

`Ask the users for their name
Input &quot;Enter your name before you play! &quot;;name$
wait key
cls

`To solve the 0 being a value problem just add 1 instead 
value = rnd(9)+1
`the value down here is now no longer needed making the program less sloppier
`executes the command better now.

gosub guess

`Take a guess!
guess:
Input &quot;Take a guess &quot;;name$;&quot;! &quot;;guess
gosub checkguess

`Check the guess
checkguess:
if guess &gt; value
  wrong = wrong+1
  Print &quot;Sorry too high!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess &lt; value
  wrong=wrong+1
  Print &quot;Too low!&quot;
  wait key
  cls
  gosub guess
endif

if guess = value then gosub win

`You won!
win:
cls
Print &quot;You rock you've won the game!&quot;
Print &quot;You were wrong &quot;;wrong;&quot; times&quot;
Print &quot;Your guess was &quot;;guess
Print &quot;Press Any Key&quot;
wait key
cls
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is a much easier way to take 0 out of the options of random numbers
while not affecting your probability at all. In the future, if you need a 
random number then use

&lt;pre&gt;
value = rnd(x)+1 
'with x being one less than you want to go to, I hope that helped.
&lt;/pre&gt;






&lt;pre&gt;
gosub mylabel

mylabel:
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are, experiment a bit with labels to see what they can do. 
You can return to the last label you leaped to by using the return 
command.

'''Assignment'''

Show off your work at the forums(optional)!

Make the hints more precise.

Give a limited number of lives.

Okay that's a day, go take a nap or something lol! :D



I think I said the lesson would end with Day 7, I was wrong. Now let's 
learn about functions. Functions are used to make your own commands that 
are absent from DarkBASIC. They are also used to perform functions isn't 
it obvious. DarkBASIC has no object oriented programming or OOP so you can 
use functions to substitute if you are a very decent programmer. 
So how do you use a function?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from reader: DarkBASIC Professional supports OOP with user defined
types and with pointers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a Simple Function:

&lt;pre&gt;
hello_world(1)
wait key
end

function hello_world(1)
  Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

First of all the brackets denote the parameter list, functions go at 
the end of your program and if your program runs into a function 
declaration beware! You can use exitfunction to exit a function easily. 
The best way to use functions is by creating a library with your own commands/procedures.
The above function, as the line number as a parameter. You can make your own, output
command using functions too.

function output(x,y,msg$)
   set cursor x,y
   print msg$
endfunction

Using this you can in a sense use Object Oriented Programming, if your a more advanced user.

Example of a Library in DarkBASIC

&lt;pre&gt;
`Basic Function Example

#include &quot;myfunctionlib.dba&quot;
x = 100
y = 10
hello_world(x,y)

`Now we have our own command!

Rem #####################################################################################

`Note the example below was not included in the above program it was in a different file named my
`functionlib.dba
`A little function library

function hello_world(x,y)
set cursor x,y
Print &quot;Hello World&quot;
endfunction
&lt;/pre&gt;

The #include command in VC++ works like so: 

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
using namespace std;
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In DarkBASIC a library works similarly but not exactly like the 
C++ example. Now you've learned what a function is and does!

Assignment:

Use functions and libraries to make a Mad Libs game.
Make your own command, like one for adding and so on.



This will probably be the last day in the life of lesson 3. We have 
been doing most of the time application and software programming. But 
soon enough we will write a game per day starting with Pong going to 
BreakOut and more. Unfortunately we won't write a Role Playing Game, for 
development of a role playing game takes months and roughly 5,000 or so
lines of code including tools we need to create. 


The Design Process of Software Is Like So

&lt;pre&gt;
The Software I want to Develop Is
It's Main Purpose Is
Problems That Need to be Solved
Etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;


In fact there's a method that envolves a series of pictures 
that I cannot recall and another method similar to the one above. 
I hope you learned something about DarkBASIC programming during the 
course of Lesson 3. Day 9 will continue in the next lesson...

                              == End of Lesson ==

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 4 - Number Crunching&lt;/center&gt;==
                         
===&lt;center&gt;Day 9 Cont'd&lt;/center&gt;===
 
This lesson is all but one day long. When it's done, we'll move on 
to 2d don't expect mario or pong yet first thing we'll be doing is 
learning string manipulation, in about a day or so then we'll move on 
to images and whatnot. Who likes math? Not me, that's why we'll be 
getting DarkBASIC to do math for us. It'll be easier then using 
a calculator you won't even have to think about it.

Typical Math Operators

&lt;pre&gt;
+ is Increment of a value
= is equal to
- is decrement of a value
÷ is the division symbol. (ALT + 246 to create the ASCII symbol for division)

X multipying
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay, first of all by increment I mean increasing a value by 
whatever and vice versia with decrement as you decrease values. 

Typical Programming Operators

&lt;pre&gt;
+ still addition
= is equal to
- is subtraction
/ is division
* is Multiplication
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember the above like you remember Christmas or you'll have 
problems doing math in programming! I can go on with more operators 
but it's not needed in a simple language like DarkBASIC as most of 
the math is taken care of by easier commands like wrapvalue.

This example may be easy but here it is

&lt;pre&gt;
`Math Example
`By Dbtutor

a = 1+2
b = 3-7
c = 9/3
d = 10*2

Print a
Print b
Print c
Print d
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Most people have already known what was going to happen 
and what was going on. 

Here's some easy stuff!

&lt;pre&gt;
`Few math examples

a = 67

hexofa$ = hex$(a) ` hex$ returns value of 'a' as a hexdecimal string.
binaryofa$ = bin$(a) ` bin$ returns value of 'a' as a binary string.

b = 3

c = sqr(b)

inc d
dec e

Print a
Print hexofa$
Print binaryofa$
Print b
Print c
Print d
Print e
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Why you'd need these above commands is beyond me, you only 
need them in rare situations, for more examples of math in 
DarkBASIC consult the DarkBASIC editor's command reference under math.
For now it's over with...

                             ==End of Lesson==

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 5 - Loops&lt;/center&gt;==
                         
===&lt;center&gt;Day 10&lt;/center&gt;===

Trust me loops are useful, they do tedious tasks and they're easy to work with.

Take for example a lottery program

&lt;pre&gt;
Dim lottery(100)
lottery(1) = 1
lottery(2) = 2
lottery(3) = 3
lottery(4) = 4
etc...
Print Lottery(1)
Print lottery(2)
Print Lottery(3)
etc...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The above way is for squares, and people without loop knowledge.

Done with a loop
&lt;pre&gt;
`Let's image the dim command above is down here
for a = 1 to 100
     Print lottery(a)
next a

Note from reader: You can't print &quot;lottery(a)&quot; as it does not exist, instead write this:

Using loops remember to indent it makes the program more 
human readable for others. With loops we can finally have more 
advanced input, input without variables, well some variables. Let's 
look at some loops then.

Repeat/Until

&lt;pre&gt;
Repeat
   `what the loop does here
until conditionmet
&lt;/pre&gt;

While/Endwhile

&lt;pre&gt;
While conditionmet
   `What the loop does
endwhile
&lt;/pre&gt;

Do/Loop

&lt;pre&gt;
do
    `task here
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember the only way to exit a loop is by quitting which is a no|no, 
the exit command which is the best way, or a gosub command. In some loops, 
the loop ends once a condition is met, and in others after a task is done 
it exits. If you paid attention you should know what I'm talking about. 
Day's over go eat, sleep, take a walk, whatever come back tomorrow!

===&lt;center&gt;Day 11&lt;/center&gt;===

This is the advanced input section, if we want a system key we 
can easily use commands like spacekey(), etc. Go have a look at them, 
they are the easiest to understand, find out how to disable them from being 
able to be pressed in DarkBASIC also while you are there. For other keys 
there's two ways basically scancode(value) which is different per country's keyboard, a Spanish keyboard is different then a British one, and you have to find a value! Or you can use ASCII values, which has a humorous pronunciation(it's pronounced ass key :P). Find out what ASCII stands for at Wikipedia, just type it in the search box and there you go. You can find Wikipedia at[http://www.wikipedia.org CLICK HERE TO GO TO WIKIPEDIA] in case your just curious because I forget I believe it's American Standard Character 
Something Something. We will be using the ASCII because it's the same for every computer 
and no need to use numeric values.

Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
`Loops are needed for input BTW
do
   if inkey$() = &quot;charhere&quot; then exit
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's a key example

&lt;pre&gt;
do
  if inkey$() = &quot;a&quot; then print &quot;Lowercase A&quot;
  if inkey$() = &quot;A&quot; then Print &quot;Uppercase A&quot;
loop
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember A is different from a when using inkey$(). Now the lesson's 
over with, for an assignment find out what ASCII stands for and experiment
with the inkey$(). 

                              == End of Lesson ==

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 6 - File Control &amp; Data&lt;/center&gt;==
                         
===&lt;center&gt;Day 12&lt;/center&gt;===

Day 12 already, you're progressing towards a great career in programming 
DarkBASIC and programming in general! Lots of people have trouble writing 
files in DarkBASIC, and some have problems with Data types and more. This 
lesson will take a lot of time to cover, I'm going to say 5 days for you and 
about 2 weeks for me to write them. Hopefully, I'll get them done before but 
if not well you just have to wait for me or another to contribute. Today, 
we'll learn how to save a file.

Take for example this scenario

&lt;pre&gt;
text$ = &quot;Hey guess what open me up in notepad and see what happens!&quot;
set dir &quot;C:/&quot;
if file exist(&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;) = 1  
   delete file &quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
endif
open to write 1,&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
write string 1,text$
close file 1
open to read 1,&quot;openmeupfast.txt&quot;
read string 1,newtext$
Print newtext$
close file 1
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

What a mouth full! In machine language it takes several thousand lines 
to do this same exact thing crazy or what! As you found out, the code 
above creates a string variable, moves the directory we'll be working in 
to c drive, if the file exist deletes it(or else we cannot overwrite it as 
it already exists), writes the file, closes it, opens it to read the contents, uses a new string to contain the line of text, then Prints it and finally you have to press any key before it ends. Now that's great! But remember 
the extension? You can change it to create your own files. You can also write 
various things such as: bytes, characters, and so on. To see more of what 
you can write view the command reference under the DarkBASIC help file. We'll just be using string for now and later byte.

This example will generate a syntax error and I'll tell you why now

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
delete file &quot;wrong.txt&quot;
open to write 1,&quot;wrong.txt&quot;
write string 1,a
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember numbers are not strings, to make a number a string we can do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
a$ = str$(a)
b = val(a$)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The command str$ changes a number into a value, and the command val 
changes a string into a value. There are many other odd things you can 
do with strings as well which you can see under the DarkBASIC help file 
command reference of strings. See some examples and change them around a bit. 

Here's a useless kinda piece of software for strings

&lt;pre&gt;
`Crazy Strings
`By Dbtutor

cls
message$ = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Print &quot;ASC() returns the ASCII number of the first letter in the str&quot;
Print asc(message$)
Print &quot;Len counts how many characters in a string&quot;
Print len(message$)
Print &quot;Mid gets the middle write characters of a string&quot;
midval = 3
Print mid$(message$,midval)
Print &quot;Here's the binary of the number 678&quot;
Print bin$(678)
Print &quot;Here's the hex of that number&quot;
Print hex$(678)
Print &quot;There are many more ways of destroying strings&quot;
Print &quot;Much are useless, but take a gander at them&quot;
wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you saw above manuiplating strings is easy but pretty much useless. 
In some situations they are useful like a file manager tool which 
we'll be making very soon along with some other file stuff. In the 2d 
tutorial's final part we'll use files to make a very simple tool 
very much like ZZT or MegaZeux. There's lots to cover so bear with me! 
On day 13 we'll be learning more ways of writing files, remember byte? 
Well you can use it to write a value to a file. I used txt has my 
extension, try using .dat, .ini, etc. You can even make one up! Using write, 
you can also write word or an integer value, a long or long integer value, 
and even a float. Why I don't know. 

Good Example of Writing A File:

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
b$ = str$(a)
if file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 then delete file &quot;a&quot;
open to write &quot;a&quot;,1
write string 1,b$
close file 1
if file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 then readit = 1
if readit = 1
   open to read 1,&quot;a&quot;
   read string 1,c$
   d = val(c$)
   Print d
   Print &quot;Same thing! Use val and str! Their better!&quot;
   wait key
   end
endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Note: from Cody Oebel'''

the above code fails to work properly, and will not compile and run.

I found the If file exist(&quot;a&quot;) = 1 ...  the = 1 is ambiguous, and is not needed.

below is my version of this code snippet

&lt;pre&gt;
`Edit by Cody C Oebel:
 
 g = 11
 set dir &quot;c:/&quot;
 b$ = str$(g)
 if file exist(&quot;a.txt&quot;) then delete file &quot;a.txt&quot;
 open to write 1, &quot;a.txt&quot;
 write string 1, b$
 close file 1
 if file exist (&quot;a.txt&quot;)
 open to read 1, &quot;a.txt&quot;
 read string 1, z$
 d = val(z$)
 print d
 print &quot;This should work now, and is smaller amount of code&quot;
 wait key
 endif
 end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, see what I mean? Later we'll be using current directories and 
file branching statements to make a simple file browser. Very simple! 
Write byte is sometimes used for example in tilemappers and so on but the 
standard is write string because it's simple. Remember keep it 
simple stupid!

Let's write an array
&lt;pre&gt;
dim a$(10)
a$(1) = &quot;jsdakjlakljldsaf&quot;
a$(2) = &quot;ashjajasjhsjks&quot;

save array a$(10),&quot;array.ini&quot;

load array a$(10),&quot;array.ini&quot;

for a = 1 to 10
  Print a$(a)
next a

wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''NOTE: Again this code above did not work: By Cody Oebel'''

Here is my working version for other readers to see the minor mistakes.

Also note at the bottom of the compiler it shows you the format

for save array, and load array e.g. Filename, array.

I also added the variable stringname filename$ to contain &quot;array.ini&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;
dim a$(10)
filename$ = &quot;array.ini&quot;
a$(1) = &quot;jsdakjlakljldsaf&quot;
a$(2) = &quot;ashjajasjhsjks&quot;
set dir &quot;c:/&quot;
save array filename$, a$(10)

load array filename$, a$(10)

for a = 1 to 10
  Print a$(a)
next a

wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we can save big ole arrays, database programming anyone? 
Remember our guessing game? Go back and fix it up a bit so that you 
can include this newly learned code in it. You've learned a lot about 
files so far. Perpare for directories on Day 13!

===&lt;center&gt;Day 13&lt;/center&gt;===

Day 13 arrived and we're only two days away from the half way point. 
That's great news, as soon as you can be a master programmer in 
DarkBASIC the better! Well, really DarkBASIC takes awhile to master, not 
to scare you but I'm not a master programmer either. If you know somebody with 
a good game it's usually not that they're the best programmer but 
just a great game maker. Some DarkBASIC users have gone on to make 
commercial games such as: Dumbo &amp; Cool, Star Wraith, etc. DarkBASIC 
is great for games and team efforts. Not so for applications as you'll 
find out today.

Here's a simple file manager

&lt;pre&gt;
Input &quot;Set directory to: &quot;;direct$
set dir direct$
&lt;/pre&gt;

You don't get to see files do you? We can easily view files and 
whatever using some simple commands. Remember some are tedious, but 
when in use with loops! Now this is a file manager, you change dirs, 
view files, and whatnot, it's not a professional tool, it's showing you 
the ropes. But before we do it's time to have a look at a better 
file manager.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Simple File Manager
`By Dbtutor

`Get the directory to use
setdirect$ = get dir$()

`Set the directory to the current directory
set dir setdirect$

`Current amount of items
items = 10

find first
Print get file name$(1)

for a = 2 to items
  find next
  Print get file name$(a)
next a

Wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt; 

Wow, that's cool and all but there's no user input and no file 
manipulation dus this program is file system viewer. Just like 
windows explorer! Really nowadays writing a file manager is pretty 
much useless especially if it's ugly. But file managers in your program 
in DarkBASIC allows better productivity then in typing in the file 
name or directory and whatnot. We're not going back to the DOS days 
God forbid type in a command and hope it works! Remember I said tedious? 
Well there is a much better way to write the following program above. Don't 
worry we'll be writing a file manager later! Before I show you a more 
productive way.

Follow these instructions:

&lt;pre&gt;
Go to http://www.computechtenerife.com/
Register as a user.
Click on Dark Basic Support and then Downloads
Scroll down and find the function libraries
Click on the Db file selector
Download and extract the files for usage later
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay now that's done we can see a better way of doing things in 
the file system viewer world. We're only a few blocks away from 
the file manager.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Simple File Viewer
`By Dbtutor

set dir &quot;C:\&quot;

Perform checklist for files
for a = 1 to checklist quantity()
  Print checklist string$(a)
next a

Wait key
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

See how many lines less we have? There is other perform checklist for 
things such as directories and devices. Go have a look and change 
perform checklist for files command with a few of them.


Now remember that file manager library you downloaded, if you 
haven't guessed we'll be modding some of the code inside the include 
file(not the function library) to make our own modded file manager. Remember 
the library is copyright to a DarkBASIC user known as TDK_MAN one of the 
best DarkBASIC programmers out there besides you(just flattering) I'm sure 
you could beat him at his game after 30 years. Just kidding if your reading 
this TDK no offense. He's made lots of DarkBASIC programs including MatEdit 
which we'll be using later on in the 3d chapters along with a 3d moddler and whatnot. 

Here's the Source Code

&lt;pre&gt;

There you are a easy file manager thanks to other peoples function 
libraries! You can find lots on TDK's site(http://www.matedit.com/db.htm). 
Along with tutorials for functions and more. That's all for Day 13, there 
was no quiz for awhile so expect a lot of quizzes later on. I couldn't 
find anything worth quizzing you on. There will be lotsa data going on 
in Day 14.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 14&lt;/center&gt;===

We already know what variables are, but you haven't used data 
statements yet. Data statements work very easily, you just put 
data, space and then put all the types of data.

Examples of Data

&lt;pre&gt;
data &quot;strings&quot;,12,5.6,&quot;and integers and floats tooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!&quot;
data 12
data &quot;string me&quot;
data 5.50
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can have lots of data types in one statement as long as you 
separate them with commas. That's useful but how can we read the data? 
Well we can use read.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Read Example
data 4
read var1
Print var1
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use restore to reset the data pointer you'll see what I'm 
talking about later. It's good practice to use different labels to 
store different data.

&lt;pre&gt;
`Big Data Example
gosub datastored

datastored:
data 1234
data 12
data 1
data 4
data 56 
gosub readdata

readdata:
read var1
read var2
read var3
read var4
read var5

print var1
Print var2
Print var3
print var4
Print var5
&lt;/pre&gt;

First it stores data then reads it, you can do this backwards 
if you want. Whichever way you read and store data it works. Now we're
into games, no explaining(well some) just pure games programming. 
We'll program a game a day woohoo let's go now!

                      ==End of Lesson==

----

==&lt;center&gt;Lesson 7 - 2D Game Programming Pt 1&lt;/center&gt;==
===&lt;center&gt;Day 15&lt;/center&gt;===

The half way point, finally after all that coding and reading and days. 
This chapter we'll be making a text adventure using more text commands 
you'll now learn. Plus you'll learn how to clear the screen in various 
colors, and oh boy you're gonna enjoy this lesson. 

You probably thought, my God does the text always have to be white!

&lt;pre&gt;
`NOPE
ink rgb(0,255,0),1
Print &quot;OMG FINALLY COLOR!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There you are! I'm a Canadian but I still spell color as color instead 
of colour. What's the RGB for? It stands for Red, Green, Blue, look 
at your monitor with a lens you'll see lots of those pixels in those 
colors. The rgb must be separated by brackets and then a comma for the transparentcy value. The transparentcy ranges from 0 to 255. RGB values 
range from 0 to 255 also.

Here's Some Colors to Remember

&lt;pre&gt;
255,0,0 - red
0,255,0 - green
255,255,0 - yellow
0,0,255 - blue
0,255,255 - cyan
255,255,255 - white
0,0,0 - black
255,0,255 - pink
192,192,192 - light grey
&lt;/pre&gt;

To see more have a look in paint, view the rgbs values and fool 
around that's the way I found out, so you should find out too. Using 
these above values you should be able to make nice colors. The lower the 
value the darker, the higher the lighter.

Now after that you want a better way to Print right?

&lt;pre&gt;
text x,y,string$
&lt;/pre&gt;

When using text, you need to use + instead of a semi-colon to 
separate variables. All values must be a string, remember to convert a
value to a string use the str$ command as seen in Lesson 6.

The Right Way

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
text 1,100,&quot;This is no syntax error &quot;+str$(a)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Wrong Way

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 1
text 1,100,&quot;This is a syntax error you won't see this text until you fix &quot;+a
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can change the font easily 

&lt;pre&gt;
set text font fontnameasstring$
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can make our text opaque easily too or allow us to write over
other text values

&lt;pre&gt;
set text opaque
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's style changes

&lt;pre&gt;
set text bold
set text italic
set text bolditalic
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's how to change the size

&lt;pre&gt;
set text size integernumber
&lt;/pre&gt;

Okay here's all those in a program

&lt;pre&gt;
set text font &quot;Times New Roman&quot;
set text size 30
set text bold
text 1,100,&quot;Hey&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You assignment is to fool around with text values and 
colors, come back tomorrow

===&lt;center&gt;Day 16&lt;/center&gt;===

Okay, now we've learned lots about changing text values it's 
time to write your own text adventure. We'll call it 
&quot;Dungeons of Doom&quot;, it'll have the player to escape the 
dank dungeons of a castle using numerous data commands 
and whatnot.

First let's do an outline:

[[Image:outline6ql.th.jpg]]

Now we have an outline let's write a simple story:

Evil Elves have captured you in their prison, now you must escape 
the Dungeon of Doom. Beware some turns lead to doom, others lead 
to a way out. 

There is only two ways to die in our game, since it's more like 
a maze anyways. 

Now Let's Do Some Data For It:

Now then your assignment to show you know what's going on is to go 
back and add in comments describing what's happening in each. The final 
part in your assignment is to edit all the code and data statements to 
make a sequel, add rooms, and more. No this game is not a text role 
playing game, we'll make a text role playing game in the next lesson. I 
think tomorrow your gonna have a break-out of game programming.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 17&lt;/center&gt;===

Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! We're going to make a Pong game today, a BreakOut 
game today, and your going to learn about images, sprites and more! Okay, 
so how can we load multimedia in DarkBASIC? Remember in the file manager 
program we had some confusing formats of files in there. One thing I 
didn't add was animations unfortunately. 

Multimedia Example:

&lt;pre&gt;
`Image
`Supports bmps and jpgs only
id = 1
string$ = &quot;myimage.bmp&quot;
load image string$,id
x = 1
y = 1
paste image id,x,y

`Music
`Sound works the same way, only instead the word music is replaced with the word `sound
`Supports are: wav, mp3, and midi
musid = 1
musstring$ = &quot;mymusic.mid&quot;
load music musstring$,musid
play music musid
stop music musid
loop music musid

`Animation
`Supports gif, avi, may support other formats
animid = 1
animstring$ = &quot;myanimation.gif&quot;
load animation animstring$,animid
play animation animid

`Bitmap
`Works same as image only supports bitmaps, you can load only 32
bmpid = 1
bmp$ = &quot;mybmp.bmp&quot;
load bitmap bmp$
`This pastes the bitmap, but the id can be used to create bitmaps at certain `locations 
`see bmps under the command reference for those details

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Go look at some more examples of multimedia in DarkBASIC, some more 
are 3dsound, and you can play music off your cd too. We'll be using 
some more examples of multimedia in DarkBASIC in later chapters for 
now we'll be focusing on the said above in the example.

Your main question may be what is a sprite? A sprite is a 
2d character that is used in games. Basically a sprite is a 
image that does more, in DarkBASIC sprites are the lifeblood 
of the system.

Sprite Works Like

&lt;pre&gt;
sprite spriteid,x,y,imageid
&lt;/pre&gt;

You cannot use load bitmap and use that as an image for your sprite, 
you can only use images loaded by the load image command.


Before you did not manipulate the x,y cords of a image in DarkBASIC 
well that's about to change. Before we start, if we leave the computer 
to take care of our game's framerate then our game will run slow and 
differently on different paced computers. Use sync on, to turn the 
framerate over too you and away from the computer. Every time the 
sync command is used the screen is updated constantly. Use 
the sync rate command, to set the rate the frame refreshes, 
mostly 30 is good for 3d games in DarkBASIC, and 40 for 2d games 
is also good too, but use 30 to make sure. There are a 
few commands in darkbasic that draws crude graphics, the commands 
we'll use are: line(line startingx,toendingx,startingy,toendingy), 
circle(x,y,radius), and dot(dot x,y). They draw these graphics in 
the default ink, if the ink is not set it'll use cyan as a default. 
There are more commands that draw different basic 2d shapes, but 
we won't be using them. If your curious go check them out 
under BASIC2d under the DarkBASIC command reference.


Here's an example of you being able to move a circle
&lt;pre&gt;
`Moving Circle
`By Dbtutor

`Hide the mouse
hide mouse

`Setup sync rate
sync on
sync rate 30

`Make the screen grey
cls rgb(192,192,192) 

`Select an ink color for us, make it all transparent
ink rgb(0,155,0),0

`Draw the circle at cordinates provided
xpos = 100
ypos = 200
circle xpos,ypos,10

`Start the main loop
do
   `Clean up mess left over, and re-draw circle
   cls rgb(192,192,192)
   circle xpos,ypos,10

   `User control
   if upkey() = 1 then ypos = ypos - 7
   if downkey() = 1 then ypos = ypos + 7
   if rightkey() = 1 then xpos = xpos + 7
   if leftkey() = 1 then xpos = xpos - 7
   `Allow no leaving the screen
   if xpos &gt; 600 then xpos = xpos - 7
   if xpos &lt; 1 then xpos = xpos + 7
   if ypos &gt; 400 then ypos = ypos - 7
   if ypos &lt; 1 then ypos = ypos + 7
   `Refresh the screen
   sync
loop
   
&lt;/pre&gt;

Wow that worked out great eh? Let's get some sleep for now.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 18&lt;/center&gt;===

Before we start I'd just like to thank everybody for visiting 
this wikibook, taking time to read it and for knowing when I google 
&quot;DarkBASIC Programming&quot; I see my book on the first page. That's a great 
feeling! I hope you learn something, I'll try and get this book done very 
soon but I've been very busy with learning new things and my schoolwork. 
I've been learning Assembly, C++, Pascal, &amp; Visual Basic I'm also 
considering buying a console building kit &quot;The XGameStation&quot; by 
Mr Lamothe or as you may know him Andre' Lamothe or Lord Necron. 
He's one my biggest inspirations for programming besides 
Lee Bamber(the visionary behind DarkBASIC). Okay let's start with the 
pong game, I must say it's been a challenge writing this pong game, 
I've had lots of bugs with it. You must use your own images, 
only the source code is included.

'''Understanding the Material'''
Before I go ahead with the Pong game there is some things that I 
must, nay, need to explain to you. First, of all you need to 
understand what a &quot;sprite&quot; is, yes I know I mentioned it but not has 
in depth as I need to now, again that was just a basic example. Basically, 
put a sprite is nothing but an active image that allows more manipulation
then standard bitmaps. In our terms, speaking a sprite is in most cases 
nothing but a 2d character. We can do more with sprites in DarkBASIC 
then we can simply using just plain images.

You already know how to setup a sprite. But you do not know how to 
delete sprites, how to detect collision with sprites, and have not used 
them very much yet. The syntax of deleting a sprite is simple: delete 
sprite spriteid. The sprite obviously must exist if not you'll get a 
runtime error stating that the &quot;bob&quot; or sprite does not exist. The same 
works for collisions with sprites: the precise and best way is by using 
this command sprite collision(spriteid1,spriteid2). Again they must exist 
has I stated, and you must have two, again I'm stating the obvious but 
there are pretty dumb people out there. 

The other way works the same thing except it's not has precise and 
goes like this: sprite hit(spriteid1,spriteid2). Easy! What may not be 
so easy after reading the code below is what the random numbers are for. 
These random numbers simply put are so that the computer generates a 
number from 0 to 1 in which direction the ball should go. They are for 
both X axis and Y axis and you should know what those are already.

===&lt;center&gt;Day 19&lt;/center&gt;===

 Okay, so we've made Pong the next step is to make a Break-Out game. Just giving you,
the source code of the game would prove you didn't code the pong game by yourself.
So what I'm going to do is let you program your own break-out game, and I will give some
guided examples. After this quick break-out game exercise I will be discussing multimedia!

Collisions

''if sprite collision(paddle,ball) = 1 then bouncball = 1''

Possible Solutions to Make the Ball Bounce :S

-Setup a variable called ballmovex, set it's value to random 1 or 0.
-if the ball strikes 0 make it move left, and in the case of 1 right
-do the same thing with a variable called ballmovey, except in this
-case moving up or down.

Possible Solutions of Setting Up Blocks

-Setup an array which holds the x positions of your bricks, and the 
y positions of your bricks. Then one for if the brick has been struck,
so if the brick has been struck it will equal 1 or true and then have
conditional statements(if and thens) for the action to break the brick.

''if if sprite collision(paddle,brickhit(bricknum)) = 1 then destroybrick = 1''



if destroybrick = 1

  brickx(bricknum) = -1
  bricky(bricknum) = -1

endif





Something to Remember:
   Remember you need a do loop to accept advanced input such as inkey$(), returnkey(), etc.



I've given lots of suggestions as to how to complete the Break-Out game, hopefully this 
will go down nice and easy without heartburn. If you have a case of &quot;what thes&quot; then 
I suggest you visit the codebase on the official DarkBASIC home page: http://www.thegamecreators.com, it has everything a DarkBASIC coder shall need.

 '''Multimedia In DarkBASIC - Audio'''
Not many people can say that they hate music, in fact most people love hearing ambient
music in games, I know I do! Above, I used some strange commands, play sound, play music,
load music, play music. Well, DarkBASIC has three audio supports, MP3, Wave, and Midi.
Loading music is very simple, and sound works the same way. So I'm going to give you a
code example, you bring the sounds, I'll bring the code!




'''Code Example for Audio:'''
 Rem Audio Example
 `Load audio
 load sound &quot;mysound.wav&quot;,1
 load music &quot;mymusic.mid&quot;,1
 `Play audio once
 play sound 1
 `Loop music
 loop music 1
 `wait key
 wait key
 stop music 1
 loop sound 1


So what are the numbers at the end? Remember in images, well this number is a numeric ID 
given. Remember the location of your audio, and extension!

 '''Multimedia in DarkBASIC - Animations'''
This will probably be the last multimedia entry, unless someone does one on dlls, 
I won't be, since I have an older version of DarkBASIC.

Animations at this point in time do not include those such as mario walking, however
they do include those such as animated GIFs(Graphic Interchange Format), and
AVIs(Audio Video Interleave). So far I believe there are two formats for
animation .gif, and .avi please tell me so if otherwise. Animations can
be useful for game over screens and maybe even some Mortal Kombat style
finishers!!







'''Code Sample'''
 load animation &quot;animation1.avi&quot;,1
 play animation 1
 wait key
 stop animation 1
 load animation &quot;animation2.gif&quot;,2
 play animation 2
 loop animation 2

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Latin}}
==Ablative Absolute==

The ablative absolute construction is used in a sentence to provide a background for the main action in the sentence. An ablative absolute is formed with a noun and an adjective or participle in the ablative case.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;convivis ingressis&lt;/b&gt; ille cenam parat&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;With the guests having entered&lt;/b&gt;, he prepares dinner.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;viris in taberna bibentibus&lt;/b&gt; feminae diligenter laborabant&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;With the men drinking in the tavern&lt;/b&gt;, the women worked diligently.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;omnibus ieiunis&lt;/b&gt; multos panes parare debuit&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;With everyone (being) hungry&lt;/b&gt;, he had to prepare lots of bread.

==Accusative Infinitive==

The accusative infinitive construction is used to indirectly report speech or thoughts. An accusative infinitive construction is formed by taking the indirect clause and putting the subject in the accusative and the verb in the infinitive.

&lt;i&gt;ille credit &lt;b&gt;pueros stultos esse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

He believes the boys to be fools = He believes &lt;b&gt;that the boys are fools&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;magister parentibus dicit &lt;b&gt;pueros stultos esse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

The teacher says to the parents &lt;b&gt;that the boys are fools&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;colonus uxori dicit &lt;b&gt;se confectum esse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

The farmer says to his wife &lt;b&gt;that he is exhausted&lt;/b&gt;.

In this sentence, note how the reflexive &lt;i&gt;se&lt;/i&gt; refers to the main subject of the sentence.

&lt;i&gt;colonus uxori &lt;b&gt;dixit&lt;/b&gt; se confectum esse&lt;/i&gt;

The farmer said to his wife that he &lt;b&gt;was&lt;/b&gt; tired.

Note how esse, despite being a present infinitive, is translated into the past tense. This is because the infinitive uses the action of the main verb, in this case &lt;i&gt;dixit&lt;/i&gt; as a reference point instead of the present.

But what about sentences such as &quot;the farmer &lt;b&gt;says&lt;/b&gt; to his wife that he &lt;b&gt;worked&lt;/b&gt; diligently&quot;? For those, you need to use the &lt;b&gt;past infinitive&lt;/b&gt;.

The sentence &quot;The farmer says to his wife that he worked diligently&quot; would thus translate as:

&lt;i&gt;colonus uxori dicit se diligenter laboravisse&lt;/i&gt;

The following examples show how different infinitives with the main verb in the past and present would appear in English:

*colonus uxori dixit se diligenter laboravisse = The farmer said to his wife that he &lt;b&gt;had worked&lt;/b&gt; diligently.
*colonus uxori dixit se diligenter laborare = The farmer said to his wife that he &lt;b&gt;was working&lt;/b&gt; diligently.
*colonus uxori dixit se diligenter laboraturum esse = The farmer said to his wife that he &lt;b&gt;would work&lt;/b&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;was going to work&lt;/i&gt;) diligently.
*colonus uxori dicit se diligenter laboraturum esse = The farmer said to his wife that he &lt;b&gt;will work&lt;/b&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;is going to work&lt;/i&gt;) diligently.
*nuntius mihi dixit urbem deletam esse = The messenger told me that the city &lt;b&gt;had been destroyed&lt;/b&gt;
*nuntius mihi dixit urbem deleri = The messenger told me that the city &lt;b&gt;was being destroyed&lt;/b&gt;
*nuntius mihi dixit urbem deletum iri = The messenger told me that the city &lt;b&gt;would be destroyed&lt;/b&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;was going to be destroyed&lt;/i&gt;)
*nuntius mihi dicit urbem deletum iri = The messenger told me that the city &lt;b&gt;will be destroyed&lt;/b&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;is going to be destroyed&lt;/i&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{documentation subpage}}

This is the documentation for {{tl|shortcut}}.

=== Usage ===
# Insert the shortcut.  If it is to a section, put it on the line above the section title.
# Create a redirect page with the name of the page based on your shortcut name.  Include the namespace name in both the shortcut name and the redirect page name. For example, substituting your own shortcut name as the title of the page, and substituting the proper namespace, add the following as the top-line on your redirect page:
#:&lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Namespace'':''Title of page with''#''Optional very long section name'']]
# Verify operation.  Note that shortcut templates should display in all capitals.

These templates are mainly used on user pages and talk pages in reference to Wikibooks, Help, and Category namespaces. These templates inform about the shortcuts available to the page they are on. For example, [[WB:RFD]] redirects to [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] and therefore Wikibooks:Requests for deletion renders a shortcut box listing WB:RFD. 

The point of these templates is not to list every single redirect for a page (indeed, that's what &quot;[[Special:WhatLinksHere|What links here]]&quot; is for), instead they should list only one or two common and easily-remembered redirects.

The ''shortcut'' template can take up to five shortcuts as parameters.

=== Examples ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Code
! Result
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot; | {{tlx|shortcut|WB:AA}}
| {{shortcut|WB:AA}}
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;  | {{tlx|shortcut|WB:CHAT|WB:RR/G}}
| {{shortcut|WB:CHAT|WB:RR/G}}
|}

=== Anchors ===
These templates automatically add anchors. If a shortcut box with the shortcut [[WB:RFD]] is placed on the page [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] then the link [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion#WB:RFD]] will take you to the position in the page where that shortcut box is placed.

For instance, try this link: [[#WB:AA]]

Thus if you make a shortcut for a section of a page then you can use the anchor in the shortcut redirect itself. Like this:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[Pagename#WB:RFD]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== See also ===
* [[Help:Shortcuts]] – The how-to guide and guideline about how and when to create shortcuts and shortcut boxes. A must-read for anyone handling shortcuts.
* {{tl|anchor}} - a way to overcome the otherwise permanent fact that section titles are the only way to link to a section
* {{tl|template shortcut}} – Use this one to show the names of shortcuts/redirects to a template.

== String type ==

=== Usage ===

The String type is defined in the core module lang/types. String literals such as &quot;abc&quot;, are of this type.

 str := &quot;This is a string literal&quot;

On the right hand side a String object is created represented by the string literal. Its reference is assigned to the str variable.

A few operators are overloaded for strings by default. For example, ( + ) is used as a string concatenation operator. For example:

 str := &quot;I love&quot; + &quot; french cheese&quot;
 {{ooc///|is the same as}}
 str := &quot;I love french cheese&quot;

( + ) is overloaded for pretty much every type inherited from C (strings, chars, numeric types) so that you can do

 str := &quot;The answer is &quot; + 42

Also overloaded in the standard SDK is '''[ ]''', used as a slicing operator

 &quot;Sand&quot; println()
 {{ooc///|is the same as}}
 &quot;Sandwich&quot;[0..4] println()

Note: the slicing operator applies on bytes, not characters. See the UTF-8 Support section below for more informations.

Many more operators are overloaded on strings, such as '''==''' for comparison, '''*''' for repeating, '''[ ]=''' for bound-checked modification, etc.

Strings in ooc aren't immutable, but every method in the standard type '''String''' returns a copy of the given string, and never modifies the original.

The standard type '''String''' provides a nice set of methods for string manipulation. Since they all return copies, you should do things like that

  name = name trim() {{ooc///|remove whitespace at both ends}}

But never:

  name trim() {{ooc///|wrong!}}

This would create a new trimmed string and throw it away. It is good to study the String type and know its methods in order not to reinvent the wheel.

=== UTF-8 support ===

At the time of this writing, there is no built-in UTF-8 support in ooc. The '''length'''() function returns the number of bytes used to store the String, never the number of characters.

The reason for that is that there is no clearly defined boundaries between character in the Unicode standard. One can roughly determinate 'grapheme clusters', ie. associate modifiers with glyphs that correspond to characters, etc. but it's a very difficult problem, and there are edge cases with non-European/non-American languages.

Therefore, for now, there's no UTF-8 character, nor codepoint, etc. but that doesn't prevent one from using UTF-8 in ooc programs. The ICU and utf8proc libraries seem especially interesting for handling such encoding matters in an ooc codebase.

Note that the language design on this issue is not definitive, and is subject to changes in the future, as soon as other, more pressing matters are decided upon.

=== Length in bytes ===

As a consequence of the lack of UTF-8 support, the '''length'''() methods returns the number of bytes so that:

 &quot;o/&quot; length()

is 2, but

 &quot;漢字&quot; length()

is 6, because 3 bytes are used to store each of the characters that make up the Japanese word &quot;Kanji&quot;

=== Creating new strings ===

You can create a new String from a char:

 str := String new('\n')

or just allocate a fixed number of chars:

 str := String new(128)

A String literal, such as &quot;abc&quot;, is also of type String

 str := &quot;Curiosity killed the cat.&quot;

=== Iterating through a string ===

You can iterate over the bytes of a String, because it implements the '''iterator'''() method.

 {{ooc/kw|for}} (c in &quot;Hello, vertical world!&quot;) {
   c println()
 }

=== Comparing strings ===

You can use the '''==''' operator to compare two Strings, because it's overloaded in the SDK. It calls the equals() method, so that, in ooc:

  name == &quot;JFK&quot;
  {{ooc///|is the same as}}
  name equals(&quot;JFK&quot;)

This behavior greatly enhances the readability of ooc code, as opposed to, say, [[Java Programming/Strings|Java]].

You can still compare the addresses of Strings by casting them to Pointers first:

  {{ooc///|equals won't be called here}}
  name as Pointer == otherName

The '''compare''' method can be used to test parts of strings for equality, for example:

  &quot;awesome&quot; compare(&quot;we&quot;, 1, 2) {{ooc///|is true}}
  &quot;Turn right&quot; compare(&quot;Turn left&quot;, 0, 6) {{ooc///|is false}}

=== Substrings and slicing ===

The '''[ ]''' operator can be used with a range to obtain the same effect as calling substring

  {{ooc///|both these statements are true}}
  &quot;happiness&quot;[3..6] == &quot;pin&quot;
  &quot;happiness&quot; substring(3, 6) equals(&quot;pin&quot;)

=== Searching in a string ===

The '''indexOf'''() and '''lastIndexOf'''() methods allow to search for the first and last occurence, respectively, of a byte or a string in another string.

  str := &quot;Proud of you, son.&quot;
  {{ooc///|returns 6}}
  str indexOf(&quot;of&quot;) toString() println()
  {{ooc///|returns 15}}
  str lastIndexOf('o') toString() println()

=== Repeating a string ===

A String can be repeated multiple time using the overloaded ( * ) operator, or with the times() method:

  {{ooc///|these lines print the same thing}}
  println(&quot;The cake is a lie!&quot; * 5)
  &quot;The cake is a lie!&quot; times(5) println()

Note that because of precedence, we can't write:

  {{ooc///|wrong!}}
  &quot;The cake is a lie!&quot; * 5 println()

Because the compiler would read that as:

  &quot;The cake is a lie&quot; * (5 println())

Which is definitely not what we intended.

=== Reversing a string ===

A String can be reversed using the '''reverse''' method.

  {{ooc///|prints 'lebon nob el'}}
  &quot;le bon nobel&quot; reverse() println()

Be aware that '''reverse'''() works on bytes, not characters. See the UTF-8 Support section for more information.

=== Appending strings ===

You can use either the '''( + )''' operator or the '''append'''() and '''prepend'''() methods:

  {{ooc///|results in the string &quot;indirect&quot;}}
  &quot;in&quot; + &quot;direct&quot;
  &quot;in&quot; append(&quot;direct&quot;)
  &quot;direct&quot; prepend(&quot;in&quot;)

As with all other string methods, a copy is returned, the original string is not modified.

However, if you are building a string from many smaller parts, it is better to use a Buffer instead, as detailed below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to be able to generate large XForms using a REST service for doing performance tests for large forms.  The primary item being tested is how long does the form take to become &quot;ready&quot; after the form is loaded.

== Method ==
We will use an XQuery to create XForms files.  This XQuery will take a single URL parameter that has a count of the number of elements it will generate.  The XForms will have one input field and two select1 fields for each count.  Each input control will have its own instance in the model.

== Sample of Instance in the model. ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;root&gt;
   &lt;input1&gt;input 1&lt;/input1&gt;
   &lt;input2&gt;input 2&lt;/input2&gt;
   &lt;country-code1&gt;country-code 1&lt;/country-code1&gt;
   &lt;country-code2&gt;country-code 2&lt;/country-code2&gt;
   &lt;state-code1&gt;state-code 1&lt;/state-code1&gt;
   &lt;state-code2&gt;state-code 2&lt;/state-code2&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Instance Generator ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $count := xs:positiveInteger(request:get-parameter('count', '20'))

return
&lt;root&gt;
    {for $counter in (1 to $count)
    return
       element {concat('input', $counter)} {concat('input ', $counter)}
    }

    {for $counter in (1 to $count)
    return
       element {concat('country-code', $counter)} {concat('country-code ', $counter)}
    }

   {for $counter in (1 to $count)
    return
       element {concat('state-code', $counter)} {concat('state-code ', $counter)}
    }

&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Autogeneration of Input Fields ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
for $counter in (1 to $input-count)
   return
      (&lt;xf:input ref=&quot;input{$counter}&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xf:label&gt;Input {$counter}:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
          &lt;/xf:input&gt;,
      &lt;br/&gt;)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Autogeneration of Select1 Fields ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
for $counter in (1 to $select1-count)
  return
     (&lt;xf:select1 ref=&quot;country-code{$counter}&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xf:label&gt;Country {$counter}:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;xf:itemset nodeset=&quot;instance('code-tables')/code-table[name='country-code']/items/item&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label ref=&quot;label&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;xf:value ref=&quot;value&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/xf:itemset&gt;
         &lt;/xf:select1&gt;,
         &lt;br/&gt;
     )
&lt;/source&gt;

The code tables are stored in a static XML file called &quot;code-tables.xml&quot;.  The format is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;code-tables&gt;

=== Items ===

*We have laid out the shop floor so that processes and machines are in close proximity to each other.
*We have organized our plant floor by means of manufacturing cells.
*Our machines are grouped according to the product family to which they are dedicated.
*The layout of the shop floor facilitates  low inventories and fast throughput.
*Our processes are located close together, so that material handling and part storage are minimized.

*We make an effort, in the design process, to list only the specifications that are really needed.
*There is a strong customer focus in our design process.
*The emphasis in part design is on minimizing the part count.
*Our engineers make an effort to simplify our product designs.
*The parts we produce are designed for ease in manufacturability and assembly.

Extent to which we have simplified and reduced parts counts in main product over the last five years.

*We use attitude/desire to work in a team as a criterion in employee selection.
*We use problem-solving aptitude as a criterion in selection of employees.
*We use work values and behavioral attitudes as a criterion in employee selection.
*We select employees who can provide ideas to improve the manufacturing process.
*We select employees who are able to work well in small groups.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used to identify what kind of page it or its subject page is.

=== Usage ===
&lt;pre&gt;{{pagetype | classification | page= }}&lt;/pre&gt;

===Parameters===
;''classification''
This ''unnamed'' parameter is optional and is used to distinguish between different non-book pages in mainspace (e.g. disambiguation pages and redirects). See below for details.

;''page''
The name of a page. The default is the current page.

;''subjectspace''
If set to ''yes'' then subjectspace pages will be treated the same as talkspace pages.

===Output===

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Data Editor window of SPSS has two tabs that provide slightly different information.  This chapter explores the Data View tab. 

The tabs are shown in the bottom left corner of the Data Editor window, as illustrated in this screenshot:
[[File:04dataview01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The Data View tab shows the raw data in your data set.  The rows represent individual cases.  If your level of analysis is individuals, each row will represent a single person.
[[File:04dataview02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The columns represent variables.  Each column contains an individual case's data on that particular variable.
[[File:04dataview03.png|center|thumb|400px]]

A cell, at the intersection of a row and a column represents an observation.

Depending on the size of your data set, you may need to scroll up or down to see more cases or left or right to see more variables.  

The Data View tab in SPSS also allows you to modify your raw data.  You can do so by simply clicking on any cell in the Data View tab:
[[File:04dataview04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Once you click on the cell, if you begin typing, you will replace all of the information in the cell.  If you double-click on a cell, you can then modify the contents without replacing them:
[[File:04dataview05.png|center|thumb|400px]]

While a nice feature of SPSS, the ability to modify your raw data is also a little bit scary as it makes it very easy to change your raw data, which is always something that should be done with caution as that will change your analyses.  Recent versions of SPSS include an &quot;undo&quot; feature, but not all changes in SPSS can be undone.  Thus, whenever you are in the Data View tab of the Data Editor window, you should be very careful that you do not unintentionally modify the raw data.  It is good practice to work on copies of original data and to keep back-ups so that you can restore your data to good condition in the case of serious mishaps.

There are several additional things you can do in this tab.  By selecting a column or row header, then clicking on the selected column or row header, you can move columns and rows to rearrange them:
[[File:04dataview06.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Moving through the data can be accoomplished using the arrow keys, the page up and down keys, the home and end keys as you expect from using other Windows programs.  One useful habit is to use the ''tab'' key to move through data.  The tab key wraps around the data when it encounters an empty, undefined column, moving on to the next case.

Additionally, you can sort by variable values, which is illustrated in a separate chapter on sorting data.

This tab does not show raw data but rather shows information about the variables included in the data set.  In fact, after examining the Data View, it may seem a little counter-intuitive to look at the Variable View window because the rows now show variables, not cases.  
[[File:05variableview02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The columns provide information about the various characteristics of variables.
[[File:05variableview03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

There are 10 columns total.  Each column and its significance for variables is discussed in the table below:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Column !! What it Means
|-
| Name || This column provides the name of the variable.  Older versions of SPSS were limited to 8 character names, which is why you often find rather intriguing names for variables in data sets.  New versions of SPSS are not limited to 8 characters, but lengthy descriptions should not be included in the Name.  They go in the Label column.
|-
| Type || This column indicates the type of variable that is reflected in this particular row.  There are 8 options to choose from: Numeric, Comma, Dot, Scientific notation, Date, Dollar, Custom currency, and String.  Most variables beginning users will encounter are either Numeric or String variables.  Numeric variables are numbers that either represent a value (e.g., 1=Catholic) or are the value of interest (height=73 inches).  String numbers are text and can only be treated as such.  As a result, very few manipulations can be performed on them in SPSS.
|-
| Width || This column indicates the number of spaces available for the variable values.
|-
| Decimals || This column allows you to control the number of characters after the decimal place.
|-
| Label || This column allows you to provide a more extensive description of the variable.
|-
| Values || This column allows you to provide a key for what the numbers of a numeric variable may represent (e.g., 1=Catholic, 2=Protestant).
|-
| Missing || This column allows you to indicate whether there are any missing values in a variable.  Values marked as missing are excluded from analyses in SPSS.
|-
| Columns || This column indicates the total number of columns a variable's values may have.
|-
| Align || This column indicates the alignment of the variable in the Data View.
|-
| Measure || This last column indicates the level of measurement of the variable.  There are three from which you can choose: Nominal, Ordinal, and Scale.
|}

Every variable in your data set should have all of the columns filled out such that it is clear exactly what the variable's characteristics are.  However, not every column may be relevant for a variable. For instance, if you have a variable &quot;ID&quot; that simply provides a random indicator of a case in your data set, there is no reason to create &quot;Values&quot; for that variable as each case value should be unique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Frequencies, in statistics, refers to counts of categories or responses. It's a basic statistical tool that provides a sense of how often specific response options occur in a population.

Using the sample data set, let's say we want to know the geographic distribution of genetic counselors.  In the sample data set there is a variable that codes for geographic region, &quot;region.&quot;  Using the frequencies function in SPSS, we can get a sense of the geographic distribution of genetic counselors.  

To do so, begin by selecting &quot;Analyze&quot; -&gt; &quot;Descriptive Statistics&quot; -&gt; &quot;Frequencies&quot;:
[[File:14frequencies01.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The &quot;Frequencies&quot; window will appear:
[[File:14frequencies02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Scroll through the variables until you find the variable you want.  In our example, we're using &quot;region.&quot;  Use the arrow to move it into the &quot;Variable(s):&quot; box:
[[File:14frequencies03.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Once you've done that, you don't actually need to do anything else except make sure that the &quot;Display frequency tables&quot; box is checked.  Then hit &quot;OK&quot;.  In the Output Window you should see something like the following:
[[File:14frequencies04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

There are two tables in this output.  The first gives a summary of the cases included.  The &quot;Valid&quot; N tells you how many of your cases had a response to this variable that is not marked as missing.  The &quot;Missing&quot; N indicates the number that are missing.

The second table is called a frequency table of frequency distribution.  It includes four columns.  The first, labeled &quot;Frequency,&quot; simply reports the total number of cases that fall into each category of the variable of interest, &quot;region.&quot;  For instance, 100 genetic counselors live in the &quot;pacific&quot; region.  The second column, labeled &quot;Percent,&quot; provides a percentage of the total cases that fall into each region.  The percentage of genetic counselors that work in the &quot;pacific&quot; region is 15.3%.  The third column, labeled &quot;Valid Percent,&quot; is a variation of the &quot;Percent&quot; column; it recalculates the percent without including the missing cases.  The fourth column, labeled &quot;Cumulative Percent,&quot; adds the percentages of each region from the top of the table to the bottom, culminating in 100%.  This last column is more useful when you have ranked or ordinal variables you are analyzing as it makes it easy to get a sense of what percentage of cases fall below a specific rank.

The above example should help illustrate the utility of calculating frequencies in SPSS.

This {{tlx|WPBannerMeta}} subtemplate decides whether the banner instance is on the main templatepage, that is, whether the banner should display in its 'demo' version with all options demonstrated. It performs two checks

{| class=wikitable style=&quot;float:right; width:0; text-align:center;&quot;
| colspan=2 rowspan=3 | 
! colspan=4 style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot; | Is the page the&lt;br /&gt;BANNER_NAME or subpage?
|-
! No
!style=&quot;border-right-width:2px;&quot;| Yes !! No !! Yes
|-
! colspan=2 style=&quot;border-right-width:2px;&quot; | and
! colspan=2 | and not
|-
! rowspan=2 | Is category=no set?
! No 
| 
|style=&quot;border-right-width:2px;&quot;| yes
| yes
|
|-
! Yes
| 
|style=&quot;border-right-width:2px;&quot;| 
| 
|
|}

#Is the pagename the {{para|BANNER_NAME}}, or is the page a subpage of that page?
#Is the {{para|category|no}} parameter set?

And then combines them together either with &quot;'''and'''&quot; (default) or another logical operator, eg &quot;'''or'''&quot;; this can be specified in the first unnamed parameter.

This template normalizes an input to be a yes/no output.

=== Usage ===

The template has five possible outputs depending on the default parameter (input if you will).

In its simplest usage these will all be either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;&quot; (blank - nothing no characters). 

# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  result &quot;yes&quot;  (also applies to &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;YeS&quot;, etc, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;1&quot;)   
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|no}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;&quot; (also applies to &quot;No&quot;, &quot;NO&quot;, &quot;nO&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;0&quot;) 
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;&quot; 
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|¬}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;&quot;
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|purplemonkeydishwasher}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;yes&quot; (also applies to any other value not given above).


Each of these can be over-ridden.

# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|yes|yes=bacon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  result &quot;bacon&quot;  (also applies to &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;YeS&quot;, etc, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;1&quot;)   
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|no|no=ham}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;ham&quot; (also applies to &quot;No&quot;, &quot;NO&quot;, &quot;nO&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;0&quot;) 
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|blank= eggs}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;eggs&quot; 
## but &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|no=ham}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;ham&quot; 
## and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|blank= eggs|no=ham}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;eggs&quot; 
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|¬|¬=sausage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;sausage&quot;
# &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|purplemonkeydishwasher|def=cup-of-tea}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;cup-of-tea&quot; (also applies to any other value not given above).
## but &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|purplemonkeydishwasher|yes=bacon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;bacon&quot; 
## but &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|purplemonkeydishwasher|def=cup-of-tea|yes=bacon}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; result &quot;cup-of-tea&quot; 

This may be used (apparently perversely) thus:

* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|yes|yes=no|no=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  result &quot;no&quot;
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{yesno|no|yes=no|no=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  result &quot;yes&quot;

This creates a logical inversion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[w:Z-test|single sample means test]] is a statistical test that can determine whether or not a population estimate (i.e., sample statistic) is significantly different from a known value.  

A hypothetical example may help illustrate this.  Let's say a national survey of the adult population asks how religious people are on a 10-point scale, ranging from 1 being &quot;not at all religious&quot; and 10 being &quot;very religious.&quot;  And let's say that the mean on this scale in the U.S. is 6.01.  With our sample of genetic counselors, we can ask whether or not genetic counselors are similar to the general population in their religiosity.  To do this, we use a single sample means test, which takes into consideration sampling error.  Similar tests are possible for proportions (i.e., with nominal/ordinal variables), but SPSS cannot do those.  How to do a single sample means test in SPSS is illustrated below.

To begin with, go to &quot;Analyze&quot; -&gt; &quot;Compare Means&quot; -&gt; &quot;One-Sample T Test&quot;:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The &quot;One-Sample T Test&quot; window will open:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Select the variable you want to compare to a target value, then move it into the &quot;Test Variable(s):&quot; box:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The next part is absolutely essential and easy to overlook the first time you run this.  In the &quot;Test Value&quot; box below the &quot;Test Variable(s):&quot; box you need to put the target value.  In our case, we'll put 6.01:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

(Note: It's not uncommon for beginners to leave the &quot;Test Value&quot; box blank.  And, for some reason, SPSS puts a default value in the box of zero, which means the test will run if you don't put your target value in the box as SPSS will assume your target value is zero.  Just make sure you put the correct target value in the &quot;Test Value&quot; box.)

The results will open in the Output Window:
[[File:17singlesamplemeans05.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

There are two tables.  The first simply describes the sample and variable included in the analysis.  The N, Mean, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error of the Mean are all included.  Of particular interest for the example, the mean religiosity score of genetic counselors is 4.65, which is lower than our hypothetical religiosity of the U.S. population generally.  However, the question is whether or not this is due to random error or an actual affect of genetic counselors.  

The second table tells us whether or not the difference between the two is likely due to chance.  The first column is the t-statistic.  Using a t-table, one could use this value to determine whether or not the two means are significantly different.  SPSS does the calculations for you.  The next column, &quot;df,&quot; provides your degrees of freedom, which is n-1 for single sample means tests.  The third column, Sig. (2-tailed), provides the p-value for this particular test, which is the probability of finding the difference between the genetic counselors' mean and the general U.S. adult population mean we found (again, this is hypothetical) simply due to random error (assuming they are actually the same).  In our example, the p-value is .000, which is smaller than the standard p-value used in statistics of .05, indicating the odds of us finding this difference if the population means are the same simply due to chance is less than 1 in 1000.  In this case, we would reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference and accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference between genetic counselors and the general population in their average religiosity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[w:Student's_t-test#Dependent_t-test_for_paired_samples|paired samples t-test]] is a test that is useful when you have two interval/ratio variables from the same people in a sample that are measured exactly the same way.  You can use a paired samples t-test to compare the scores on the two variables.  The most common use of this test is for pre- and post-test scores for a sample when they are exposed to some intervention in between the pre- and post-tests.  The reason a paired samples t-test is used instead of an independent samples t-test is because the scores are for the same people, which suggests there is an underlying relationship between the scores.  

Another time paired samples t-tests are useful is when you have two variables with the same units of measure from the same subjects from the same time and you want to see if the subjects score differently on one test compared to the other.  This is the example we will use in this chapter to illustrate the test.  In the sample data set of genetic counselors, there are two interval variables that have the same unit of measure - a 10 point scale.  However, one variable asked genetic counselors how religious they were and the other asked them how spiritual they were.  Since it is the same subjects being asked different questions that use the same metric, we can compare their scores on these two variables using a paired samples t-test.

Here's how this is done in SPSS.  To begin with, select &quot;Analyze&quot; -&gt; &quot;Compare Means&quot; -&gt; &quot;Paired-Samples T Test&quot;:
[[File:19pairedsamples01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The &quot;Paired-Samples T Test&quot; window will open:
[[File:19pairedsamples02.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

To select the variables to compare, you have to actually select two variables at the same time.  To do this, select the first variable, then hold down &quot;Control&quot; and select the second, then move them over to the &quot;Paired Variables&quot; box with the blue arrow:
[[File:19pairedsamples03.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Then hit &quot;OK.&quot;  You'll get the following tables in the Output Window:
[[File:19pairedsamples04.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

The first table provides basic sample and variable statistics for the two variables, including the Mean, the sample size, the Standard Deviation, and the Standard Error of the Mean.  Of interest in our comparison are the two means.  On the spirituality scale, genetic counselors report a mean of 6.17.  On the religiosity scale, genetic counselors report a mean of 4.64.  Those appear to be quite different scores, but the question of interest is whether those scores are different due to chance or due to an actual affect in the population.  The paired-samples t test allows us to determine that.

The second table, a correlation table, is discussed in the chapter on correlation, so it will not be discussed here.

The third table is the &quot;Paired Samples Test&quot; table.  The first column is labeled the &quot;Mean&quot; and it is the average difference between the two variable means.  The &quot;Std. Deviation&quot; and &quot;Std. Error of the Mean&quot; are calculated on the average mean in the first column.  Columns four and five are lower and upper confidence intervals for the difference.  For more information on confidence intervals, see the chapter on confidence intervals.  The sixth column, &quot;t&quot;, is the t-score.  The seventh is the degrees of freedom.  The eight column provides the p-value for the difference of means.  In our example, the p-value is .000, which is less than a standard alpha of .05, indicating that the odds of these two scores being different due to random chance assuming they are actually the same is less than 1 in 1000.  In this case, we would reject the null hypothesis that they are the same and accept the alternative.  There is a significant difference between the religiosity and spirituality of genetic counselors; genetic counselors are significantly more spiritual than they are religious.

&lt;!---PLEASE ADD METADATA TO THE &lt;includeonly&gt; SECTION AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE.---&gt;
This template is used to produce a link in a box to a [[Subject:Books by subject|subject]].

===Parameters===
: &lt;code&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Subject box|&lt;var&gt;Name&lt;/var&gt;|image=&lt;var&gt;Image&lt;/var&gt;|size=&lt;var&gt;Size&lt;/var&gt;|left=yes|margin=&lt;var&gt;Margin&lt;/var&gt;}}'''&lt;/code&gt;

; &lt;code&gt;&lt;var&gt;Name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt; : The name of the subject. &lt;!-- This defaults to the current page's name - true but let's not encourage this.  If pages or sections are moved or copied stuff breaks. --&gt;

The following additional parameters are available. They are all optional; the default values are chosen to give a good look and feel across the project.

; {{Para|image|&lt;var&gt;Image&lt;/var&gt;}} : The image to use for the subject's icon. This defaults to an image that is specified in Template:Subject box/Images/SubjectName for the subject or a generic image. There is a [[Template:Subject box/Images|list of all such images]].

; {{Para|size|&lt;var&gt;Size&lt;/var&gt;}} : The width of the icon, as an integer. This is in units of pixels. The default is 32. The icon is also constrained to be at most 28 pixels high.

; {{Para|left|yes}} : Float the box to the left instead of to the right.

; {{Para|margin|&lt;var&gt;Margin&lt;/var&gt;}} : The margin around the box. By default, the box is surrounded by a margin of width 0.5em, but this can be customized using {{para|margin|&lt;var&gt;top right bottom left&lt;/var&gt;}} (''e.g.'', {{para|margin|0.25em 0 0.25em 0.25em}}) or removed using {{para|margin|0}} (zero).

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Haskell Basics|noexercises=1}}
So far, we have shrewdly avoided number types in our examples. In one exercise, we even went as far as asking you to &quot;pretend&quot; the arguments to &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; had to be of type &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;. So, from what are we hiding?

In this chapter, we will show how numerical types are handled in Haskell. While doing so, we will introduce some important features of the type system. Before diving into the text, though, pause for a moment and consider the following question: what should be the type of the function &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt;?&lt;ref&gt;If you followed our recommendations in &quot;Type basics&quot;, chances are you have already seen the rather exotic answer by testing with &lt;tt&gt;:t&lt;/tt&gt;... if that is the case, consider the following analysis as a path to understanding the meaning of that signature.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; class ==

As far as everyday mathematics is concerned, there are very few restrictions on which kind of numbers we can add together. &lt;math&gt;2 + 3&lt;/math&gt; (two natural numbers), &lt;math&gt;(-7) + 5.12&lt;/math&gt; (a negative integer and a rational number), &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{7} + \pi&lt;/math&gt; (a rational and an irrational)... all of these are valid – indeed, any two real numbers can be added together. In order to capture such generality in the simplest way possible we would like to have a very general &lt;tt&gt;Number&lt;/tt&gt; type in Haskell, so that the signature of &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; would be simply

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(+) :: Number -&gt; Number -&gt; Number
&lt;/source&gt;

That design, however, does not fit well with the way computers perform arithmetic. While integer numbers in programs can be quite straightforwardly handled as sequences of binary digits in memory, that approach does not work for non-integer real numbers,&lt;ref&gt;One of the reasons being that between any two real numbers there are infinitely many real numbers – and that can't be directly mapped into a representation in memory no matter what we do.&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it necessary for a more involved encoding to support them: [[w:Floating point|floating point numbers]]. While floating point provides a reasonable way to deal with real numbers in general, it has some inconveniences (most notably, loss of precision) which make using the simpler encoding worthwhile for integer values. We are thus left with at least two different ways of storing numbers, one for integers and another one for general real numbers, which should correspond to different Haskell types. Furthermore, computers are only able to perform operations like &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; on a pair of numbers if they are in the same format. That should put an end to our hopes of using a universal &lt;tt&gt;Number&lt;/tt&gt; type – or even having &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; working with both integers and floating-point numbers...

It is easy, however, to see reality is not that bad. We ''can'' use &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; with both integers and floating point numbers:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt;3 + 4
7
Prelude&gt;4.34 + 3.12
7.46
}}

When discussing lists and tuples, we saw that functions can accept arguments of different types if they are made ''polymorphic''. In that spirit, one possible type signature for &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; that would account for the facts above would be:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(+) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; would then take two arguments of the same type &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; (which could be integers or floating-point numbers) and evaluate to a result of type &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;. There is a problem with that solution, however. As we saw before, the type variable &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; can stand for ''any'' type at all. If &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; really had that type signature we would be able to add up two &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;, or two &lt;tt&gt;Char&lt;/tt&gt;, which would make no sense – and is indeed impossible. Rather, the actual type signature of &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; takes advantage of a language feature that allows us to express the semantic restriction that &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; can be any type ''as long as it is a number type'':

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(+) :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; is a '''typeclass''' - a group of types which includes all types which are regarded as numbers&lt;ref&gt;That is a very loose definition, but will suffice until we are ready to discuss typeclasses in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;(Num a) =&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; part of the signature restricts &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; to number types – or, more accurately, ''instances'' of &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Numeric types ==

But what are the ''actual'' number types – the instances of &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; that &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; stands for in the signature? The most important numeric types are
&lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;:

* &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; corresponds to the vanilla integer type found in most languages. It has fixed precision, and thus maximum and minimum values (in 32-bit machines the range goes from -2147483648 to 2147483647).

* &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; also is used for integer numbers, but unlike &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; it supports arbitrarily large values – at the cost of some efficiency.

* &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt; is the double-precision floating point type, and what you will want to use for real numbers in the overwhelming majority of cases (there is also &lt;tt&gt;Float&lt;/tt&gt;, the single-precision counterpart of &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;, which in general is not an attractive option due to more loss of precision).

These types are available by default in Haskell and are the ones you will generally deal with in everyday tasks.

=== Polymorphic guesswork ===

There is one thing we haven't explained yet. If you tried the examples of addition we mentioned at the beginning you know that something like this is perfectly valid:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; (-7) + 5.12
-1.88
}}

Here, it seems we are adding two numbers of different types – an integer and a non-integer. Shouldn't the type of &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; make that impossible?

To answer that question we have to see what the types of the numbers we entered actually are:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; :t (-7)
(-7) :: (Num a) =&gt; a
}}

And, lo and behold, &lt;tt&gt;(-7)&lt;/tt&gt; is neither &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; nor &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;! Rather, it is a ''polymorphic constant'', which can &quot;morph&quot; into any number type if need be. The reason for that becomes clearer when we look at the other number...

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; :t 5.12
5.12 :: (Fractional t) =&gt; t
}}

&lt;tt&gt;5.12&lt;/tt&gt; is also a polymorphic constant, but one of the &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; class, which is more restrictive than &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; – every &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; is a &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt;, but not every &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; is a &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; (for instance, &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;s and &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;s are not &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt;).

When a Haskell program evaluates &lt;tt&gt;(-7) + 5.12&lt;/tt&gt;, it must settle for an actual type for the numbers. It does so by performing type inference while accounting for the class specifications. &lt;tt&gt;(-7)&lt;/tt&gt; can be any &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt;, but there are extra restrictions for &lt;tt&gt;5.12&lt;/tt&gt;, so its type will define what &lt;tt&gt;(-7)&lt;/tt&gt; will become. Since there is no other clues to what the types should be, &lt;tt&gt;5.12&lt;/tt&gt; will assume the default &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; type, which is &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;; and, consequently, &lt;tt&gt;(-7)&lt;/tt&gt; will become a &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt; as well, allowing the addition to proceed normally and return a &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''For seasoned programmers:'' This appears to have the same effect of what programs in C (and many other languages) would manage with an ''implicit cast'' – in which case the integer literal would be silently converted to a double. The difference is that in C the conversion is done behind your back, while in Haskell it only occurs if the variable/literal is explicitly made a polymorphic constant. The difference will become clearer shortly, when we show a counter-example.&lt;/ref&gt;.

There is a nice quick test you can do to get a better feel of that process. In a source file, define

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x = 2
&lt;/source&gt;

then load the file in GHCi and check the type of &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;. Then, change the file to add a &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; variable,

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x = 2
y = x + 3
&lt;/source&gt;

reload it and check the types of &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt;. Finally, modify &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; to

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
x = 2
y = x + 3.1
&lt;/source&gt;

and see what happens with the types of both variables.

=== Monomorphic trouble ===

The sophistication of the numerical types and classes occasionally leads to some complications. Consider, for instance, the common division operator &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;. It has the following type signature:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(/) :: (Fractional a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

Restricting &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; to fractional types is a must because the division of two integer numbers in general will not result in an integer. Nevertheless, we can still write something like

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 4 / 3
1.3333333333333333
}}

because the literals &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; are polymorphic constants and therefore assume the type &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt; at the behest of &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;. Suppose, however, we want to divide a number by the length of a list&lt;ref&gt;A reasonable scenario – think of computing an average of the values in a list.&lt;/ref&gt;. The obvious thing to do would be using the &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt; function:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 4 / length [1,2,3]
}}

Unfortunately, that blows up:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    No instance for (Fractional Int)
      arising from a use of `/' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-17
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Fractional Int)
    In the expression: 4 / length [1, 2, 3]
    In the definition of `it': it = 4 / length [1, 2, 3]
}}

As usual, the problem can be understood by looking at the type signature of &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
length :: [a] -&gt; Int
&lt;/source&gt;

The result of &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt; is not a polymorphic constant, but an &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt;; and since an &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; is not a &lt;tt&gt;Fractional&lt;/tt&gt; it can't fit the signature of &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;.

There is a handy function which provides a way of escaping from this problem. Before following on with the text, try to guess what it does only from the name and signature:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fromIntegral :: (Integral a, Num b) =&gt; a -&gt; b
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;fromIntegral&lt;/tt&gt; takes an argument of some &lt;tt&gt;Integral&lt;/tt&gt; type (like &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;) and makes it a polymorphic constant. By combining it with &lt;tt&gt;length&lt;/tt&gt; we can make the length of the list fit into the signature of &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; 4 / fromIntegral (length [1,2,3])
1.3333333333333333
}}

While this complication may look spurious at first, this approach makes it easier to be rigorous when manipulating numbers. If you define a function that takes an &lt;tt&gt;Int&lt;/tt&gt; argument you can be entirely sure that it will never be converted to an &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; or a &lt;tt&gt;Double&lt;/tt&gt; unless you explicitly tell the program to do so (for instance, by using &lt;tt&gt;fromIntegral&lt;/tt&gt;). As a direct consequence of the refinement of the type system, there is a surprising diversity of classes and functions for dealing with numbers in Haskell&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;A more descriptive overview of the main ones will be made in a module which is currently under development.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;.

== Classes beyond numbers ==

There are many other use cases for typeclasses beyond arithmetic. For example, the type signature of &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt; is:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
&lt;/source&gt;

Like &lt;tt&gt;(+)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;(/)&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;(==)&lt;/tt&gt; is a polymorphic function. It compares two values of the same type, which must belong to the class &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt; and returns a &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt; is simply the class of types of values which can be compared for equality, and includes all of the basic non-functional types.&lt;ref&gt;Comparing two functions for equality is considered to be intractable&lt;/ref&gt;

Typeclasses are a very general language feature which adds a lot to the power of the type system. Later in the book we will return to this topic to see how to use them in custom ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Initial comment ==

In this form, this page could well be called &quot;Numerical types&quot;. But at least for now it seems a good idea to have a generic name, so that we are free to add other non-numerical things and keep the focus on the type system features illustrated by numbers. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 05:12, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

== Type error on &quot;x + 3.1&quot; example ==

Actually, writing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

let x = 3&lt;br /&gt;

let y = x + 3.1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

produces type error (&quot;no instance for Fractional... arising from 3.1&quot;)

:That is why that test must be loaded from a source file. I changed the passage to make that a little more obvious. Roughly, it doesn't work the same in the way you tried because GHC(i) will &quot;de-generalize&quot; the types of values defined in a let. You can override that by adding the type signature in the let, as in
: &lt;code&gt;let x :: (Num a) =&gt; a; x = 3&lt;/code&gt;
: [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 20:34, 17 August 2013 (UTC)

== Why wasn't / defined with type (Num a, Fractional b) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; b ? ==

Is it merely the taste of the language designers or is there a deeper reason?  For example, is there perhaps some other natural-looking expression that would become illegal?

I would appreciate a brief note (here or in the text.)

:I suppose it has to do with simplicity and a dislike of implicit casts. Also, note that your proposed signature is a little too general, as there are no guarantees that a &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt; can be converted into a &lt;code&gt;Fractional&lt;/code&gt;. The closest thing in Prelude is &lt;code&gt;[http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/4.6.0.1/doc/html/Prelude.html#v:realToFrac realToFrac]&lt;/code&gt;, which converts values of the &lt;code&gt;Real&lt;/code&gt; class. Thus your version of &lt;code&gt;(/)&lt;/code&gt; might be written as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(/!) :: (Real a, Fractional b) -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; b
x /! y = realToFrac x / realToFrac y
&lt;/source&gt;

:But if the actual &lt;code&gt;(/)&lt;/code&gt; operator was like that you'd have to remember the implied &lt;code&gt;realToFrac&lt;/code&gt; usage and account for what it would do with your values every time you divide something. Under the ''status quo'' at least it is obvious that something else other than mere division is going on, as there are either explicit conversion functions calls or custom operators being used.

:There is interesting commentary on this issue at the Haskell Wiki in the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generic_number_type Generic number type] page. For an example of &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt; with no obvious conversion to &lt;code&gt;Fractional&lt;/code&gt;, consider matrix types like [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/cairo/0.12.4/doc/html/Graphics-Rendering-Cairo.html#t:Matrix this] or [http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hmatrix/0.15.0.1/doc/html/Data-Packed-Matrix.html#t:Matrix this].

CMD_HIDDINIT private function from keyboard.device and gameport.device has been removed and now these devices use a new keyboard and mouse HIDDs as an underlying level. Actual driver HIDDs may be plugged in or removed at any time using AddHardwareDriver() and RemHardwareDriver(). 

The API can be further expanded if one day we want to implement OS4 amigainput.library or something like that. 

There can be multiple input drivers (feeders) and now there can also be multiple input listeners. 

So, lowlevel.library can also work on top of the new API and receive events on its own, independently of keyboard.device and gameport.device. 



==Reference==

To debug: dump mouse events when they are fed to supplied handler. You may also write hidd.mouse client which reads and prints mouse events. This way you'll be able to monitor how events are passed through top-level mouse.hidd.
Also introduced top-level &quot;hubs&quot; for mouse and keyboard events. 
* May be ps2mouse.hidd sends malformed events.</text>

I've  thrown  away  private  CMD_HIDDINIT from keyboard.device and gameport.device, now these devices use new keyboard and mouse HIDDs as underlying level. Actual driver HIDDs may be plugged in or removed at any time using AddHardwareDriver() and RemHardwareDriver().

The  API  can be further expanded if one day we want to implement OS4 amigainput.library or something like that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Purchase intention (alpha = 0.80) ==
=== Items ===

A three-item, seven-point scale was used to measure purchase intention:

*how positive or negative is your judgment of the product?
*how interesting do you find the product?
*how likely is it that you will buy the product within half a year from now?

[[Image:ECOSYImage.jpg||thumb|280px|right|E COSY experiment: A and B are the two parts of the detected signal.]]

'''Exclusive correlation spectroscopy''' (ECOSY) is an [[NMR]] [[Correlation spectroscopy|correlation]] experiment introduced by O. W. Sørensen, Christian Griesinger, [[Richard R. Ernst]] and coworkers for the accurate measurement of small [[J-coupling]]s.

The idea behind the experiment is to measure an unresolved coupling with the help of a larger coupling which is resolved in a dimension orthogonal to the small coupling. Three active nuclei are needed (SXI spin system) and the pulse sequence must be able to transfer magnetization from I to S without changing the spin state of X, otherwise the ECOSY pattern will vanish.

A '''Faraday cup''' is a [[metal]] (conductive) cup designed to catch [[charged particle]]s in [[vacuum]]. The resulting current can be measured and used to determine the number of [[ion]]s or [[electron]]s hitting the cup.&lt;ref name='1.1715674'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Faraday-Cup Monitors for High-Energy Electron Beams |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |date=September 1956 |first=K. L. |last=Brown |coauthors=G. W. Tautfest |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=696–702 |doi=10.1063/1.1715674 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=RSINAK000027000009000696000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;prog=normal |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faraday cup is named after [[Michael Faraday]] who first theorized ions around 1830.

==How it works==

When a beam or packet of [[Ion]]s hits the metal it gains a small net charge while the ions are neutralized. The metal can then be discharged to measure a small current equivalent to the number of impinging ions. Essentially the faraday cup is part of a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] where ions are the charge carriers in vacuum and the faraday cup is the interface to the solid metal where electrons act as the [[charge carrier]]s (as in most circuits). By measuring the [[current (electricity)|electrical current]] (the number of electrons flowing through the circuit per second) in the metal part of the circuit the number of charges being carried by the ions in the vacuum part of the circuit can be determined. For a continuous ion beam of ions (each with a single charge)

[[Image:faraday cup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Faraday cup with an electron-suppressor plate in front]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {N}{t} = \frac {I}{e}&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the number of ions observed in a time t (in seconds), I is the measured current (in [[amperes]]) and e is the [[elementary charge]] (about 1.60 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; [[coulomb|C]]). Thus, a measured current of one nanoamp (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; A) corresponds to about 6 billion ions striking the faraday cup each second.

Similarly, a Faraday cup can act as a collector for electrons in a vacuum (for instance from an [[electron beam]]). In this case electrons simply hit the metal plate/cup and a current is produced. Faraday cups are not as sensitive as [[electron multiplier]] detectors, but are highly regarded for accuracy because of the direct relation between the measured current and number of ions.

==Error sources==
The counting of charges collected per unit time is impacted by two error sources: 1) the emission of low-energy [[secondary electrons]] from the surface struck by the incident charge and 2) [[backscattering]] (~180 degree scattering) of the incident particle, which causes it to leave the collecting surface, at least temporarily. Especially with electrons, it is fundamentally impossible to distinguish between a fresh new incident electron and one that has been backscattered or even a fast secondary electron.

A '''Fermi resonance''' is the shifting of the energies and intensities of absorption bands in an [[infrared spectrum|infrared]] or [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectrum]].  It is a consequence of quantum mechanical mixing.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Nakamoto “Infrared and Raman Spectra of Inorganic and Coordination Compounds: Theory and Applications in Inorganic Chemistry (Volume A)” John Wiley, 1997. ISBN 0-471-16394-5&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was explained by the Italian-American physicist [[Enrico Fermi]].

==Selection rules and occurrence==
Two conditions must be satisfied for the occurrence of Fermi Resonance:
*the two [[molecular vibration|vibrational state]]s of a molecule transform according to the same irreducible [[Group representation|representation]]  of the molecular [[point group]].
*The energies of the transitions (accidentally) have almost the same energy.

Since the normal modes of a molecule are generally of disparate energies, they do not mix. Thus, Fermi resonance most often occurs between normal and overtone modes, which are often nearly coincidental in energy.

Fermi resonance leads to two effects. First, the high energy mode shifts to higher energy and the low energy mode shifts to still lower energy.  Second, the weaker mode gains intensity (becomes more allowed) and the more intense band decreases in intensity.  The two transitions are describable as a linear combination of the parent modes.  Fermi resonance does not really lead to additional bands in the spectrum.
[[Image:FermiResScheme.png|thumb|360px|right|Ideallized appearance of a normal mode and an overtone before and after Fermi resonance. Beneath the idealized spectra are idealized energy level schemes.]]

==Examples==
===Ketones===
High resolution IR spectra of most [[ketone]]s reveal that the &quot;carbonyl band&quot; is split into a doublet.  The peak separation is usually only a few wavenumbers.  This splitting arises from the mixing of ν&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; and the overtone of HCH bending modes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Silverstein, Francis X. Webster, David Kiemle “Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds”Edition: 7th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. ISBN 0471393622.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
In CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the bending vibration ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (667&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) has symmetry Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;. The first excited state of ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is denoted 01&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;0 (no excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, one quantum of excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with angular momentum about the molecular axis equal to ±1, no excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and clearly transforms according to the irreducible representation Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;. Putting two quanta into ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a state with components of symmetry (Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; × Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ &lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. These are called 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 and 02&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;0, respectively. 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 has the same symmetry (Σ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) as, and a very similar energy to, state 100 (a single excitation in the ν&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetric stretch (calculated unperturbed frequency 1337&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), no excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, no excitation in ν&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The similarity in energy may be thought of as an accidental near-degeneracy. The states 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 and 100 can therefore mix together, producing a splitting and also a significant increase in the intensity of the 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 transition, so that both the 02&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;0 and 100 transitions have similar intensities.

'''Ferromagnetic resonance''', or FMR, is a [[spectroscopic]] technique to probe the [[magnetization]] of [[ferromagnetic]] materials.  It is a standard tool for probing [[spin wave]]s and spin dynamics.  It was unknowingly discovered by V. K. Arkad'yev when he observed the [[Absorption (optics)|absorption]] of [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] radiation by ferromagnetic materials in 1911.  A qualitative explanation of FMR along with an explanation of the results from Arkad'yev was offered up by Ya. G. Dorfman in 1923 when he suggested that the [[optical]] transitions due to [[Zeeman]] splitting could provide a way to study ferromagnetic structure.
FMR is very broadly similar to EPR, and also somewhat similar to [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] except that FMR probes the sample magnetization resulting from the [[magnetic moment]]s of dipolar-coupled but unpaired [[electron]]s whereas NMR probes the magnetic moment of [[Nucleus (atomic structure)|atomic nuclei]] screened by the atomic or molecular orbitals surrounding such nuclei of non-zero nuclear spin.

FMR arises from the precessional motion of the (usually quite large) magnetization &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; of a ferromagnetic material in an external magnetic field H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The magnetic field exerts a [[torque]] on the sample magnetization which causes the magnetic moments in the sample to [[precess]].  The precession frequency of the magnetization depends on the orientation of the material, the strength of the magnetic field, as well as the macroscopic magnetization of the sample; the effective precession frequency of the ferromagnet is much lower in value from the precession frequency observed for free electrons in ESR or EPR. Moreover, linewidths of absorption peaks can be greatly affected both by dipolar-narrowing and exchange-broadening (quantum) effects. Furthermore, not all absorption peaks observed in FMR are caused by the precession of the magnetic moments of electrons in the ferromagnet. Thus, the theoretical analysis of FMR spectra is far more complex than that of ESR or NMR spectra.

The basic setup for an FMR experiment is a microwave [[resonant cavity]] with an [[electromagnet]].  The resonant cavity is fixed at a frequency in the [[super high frequency]] band.  A detector is placed at the end of the cavity to detect the microwaves. The magnetic sample is placed between the poles of the electromagnet and the [[magnetic field]] is swept while the resonant absorption intensity of the microwaves is detected.  When the magnetization precession frequency and the resonant cavity frequency are the same, absorption increases sharply which is indicated by a decrease in the intensity at the detector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''GF method''', sometimes referred to as '''FG method''', is a classical mechanical method introduced by E. Bright Wilson to obtain certain ''internal coordinates'' for
a vibrating semi-rigid molecule, the so-called ''normal coordinates'' ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. Normal coordinates decouple the classical vibrational motions of the molecule and thus give an easy route to obtaining vibrational amplitudes of the atoms as a function of time. In Wilson's GF method it is assumed that the molecular kinetic energy consists only of harmonic vibrations of the atoms, ''i.e.,''  overall rotational and translational energy is ignored. Normal coordinates appear also in a quantum mechanical description of the  vibrational motions of the molecule and the Coriolis coupling between rotations and vibrations.

It follows from application of the Eckart conditions that the matrix '''G'''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; gives the kinetic energy in terms of arbitrary linear internal coordinates, while '''F''' represents the (harmonic) potential energy in terms of these coordinates. The GF method gives the linear transformation from general internal coordinates to the special set of normal coordinates.

== The GF method ==
A non-linear molecule consisting of ''N'' atoms has 3''N''-6  internal degrees of freedom, because 
positioning a molecule in three-dimensional space requires three degrees of freedom  and the description of its orientation in space requires another three degree of freedom. These degrees of freedom must be subtracted from the 3''N'' degrees of freedom of a system of ''N'' particles. 

The atoms in a molecule are bound by a potential energy surface (PES) (or a force field (chemistry)|force field) which is a function of 3''N''-6 coordinates.
The internal degrees of freedom ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  ''q''&lt;sub&gt;3''N''-6&lt;/sub&gt; describing the PES in an optimum way are often non-linear; they are for instance ''valence coordinates'', such as bending and  torsion angles and bond stretches. It is possible to write the quantum mechanical kinetic energy operator for such curvilinear coordinates, but it is hard to formulate a general theory applicable to any molecule. This is why Wilson&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Wilson, Jr.
''Some Mathematical Methods for the Study of Molecular Vibrations'', J. Chem. Phys. vol. '''9''', pp. 76-84 (1941)&lt;/ref&gt; linearized the internal coordinates by assuming small displacements. The linearized version of  the internal coordinate ''q''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is denoted by ''S''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;. 

The PES ''V'' can be Taylor expanded around its minimum in terms of the ''S''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;.  The third term (the Hessian matrix|Hessian of ''V'') evaluated in the minimum is a force derivative matrix '''F'''. In the harmonic approximation the Taylor series is ended after this term. The second term, containing first derivatives, is zero because it is evaluated in the miminum of ''V''. The first term can be included in the zero of energy.
Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; 2V \approx \sum_{s,t=1}^{3N-6} F_{st} S_s\, S_t &lt;/math&gt;.

The classical vibrational kinetic energy has the form:
:&lt;math&gt; 2T = \sum_{s,t=1}^{3N-6} g_{st}(\mathbf{q})  \dot{S}_s\dot{S}_t ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''st''&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of the metric tensor of the internal (curvilinear) coordinates. The dots indicate time derivatives. Mixed terms &lt;math&gt;S_s\, \dot{S}_t&lt;/math&gt; generally present in curvilinear coordinates are not present here, because only linear coordinate transformations are used. Evaluation of the metric tensor '''g''' in the minimum '''q'''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; of ''V'' gives 
the positive definite and symmetric matrix '''G''' = '''g'''('''q'''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)'''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. 
One can solve the following two matrix problems simultaneously
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{F} \mathbf{L} =\boldsymbol{\Phi}
\quad \mathrm{and}\quad \mathbf{L}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{G}^{-1} \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{E},
&lt;/math&gt;
since they are equivalent to the generalized eigenvalue problem
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{G} \mathbf{F} \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{L} \boldsymbol{\Phi},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Phi}=\operatorname{diag}(f_1,\ldots, f_{3N-6}) &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the unit matrix. The matrix '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;  contains the ''normal coordinates''  ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; in its rows:
:&lt;math&gt; Q_k = \sum_{t=1}^{3N-6} (\mathbf{L}^{-1})_{kt} S_t , \quad k=1,\ldots, 3N-6. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Because of the form of the generalized eigenvalue problem, the method is called the GF method,
often with the name of its originator attached to it: '''Wilson's GF method'''. By matrix transposition in both sides of the equation and using the fact
that both '''G''' and '''F''' are symmetric matrices, as are diagonal matrices, one can recast this equation into a very similar one  for '''FG''' . This is why the method
is also referred to as '''Wilson's FG method'''.

We  introduce  the vectors
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = \operatorname{col}(S_1,\ldots, S_{3N-6})
\quad\mathrm{and}\quad
\mathbf{Q} = \operatorname{col}(Q_1,\ldots, Q_{3N-6}),
&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfy the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{L} \mathbf{Q}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Upon  use of the results of the generalized eigenvalue equation
the  energy ''E'' = ''T '' + ''V'' (in the harmonic approximation) of the molecule becomes, 
:&lt;math&gt;  
2E = \dot{\mathbf{s}}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{G}^{-1}\dot{\mathbf{s}}+
\mathbf{s}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{s}
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
= \dot{\mathbf{Q}}^\mathrm{T}  \; \left( \mathbf{L}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{G}^{-1} \mathbf{L}\right) \;  \dot{\mathbf{Q}}+
\mathbf{Q}^\mathrm{T} \left(  \mathbf{L}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{L}\right)\;  \mathbf{Q} 
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
= \dot{\mathbf{Q}}^\mathrm{T}\dot{\mathbf{Q}} + \mathbf{Q}^\mathrm{T}\boldsymbol{\Phi}\mathbf{Q}
 = \sum_{t=1}^{3N-6} \big( \dot{Q}_t^2 +  f_t Q_t^2 \big).
&lt;/math&gt;
The Lagrangian ''L'' = ''T'' - ''V'' is
:&lt;math&gt; 
L = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{t=1}^{3N-6} \big( \dot{Q}_t^2 - f_t Q_t^2 \big).
&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding Lagrange equations are identical to the Newton equations 
:&lt;math&gt;
\ddot{Q}_t + f_t \,Q_t = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
for a set of uncoupled
harmonic oscillators. These ordinary  second-order differential equations are easily solved yielding ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; as function of time, see the article on  harmonic oscillators.

==Normal coordinates in terms of Cartesian displacement coordinates ==
Often the normal coordinates are expressed as linear combinations of Cartesian displacement coordinates.
Let '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; be the position vector of nucleus A and '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;
the corresponding equilibrium position. Then
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{d}_A \equiv \mathbf{R}_A -\mathbf{R}_A^0 &lt;/math&gt; is by definition the ''Cartesian displacement coordinate'' of nucleus A.
Wilson's  linearizing of the internal curvilinear coordinates ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; expresses the coordinate ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms  of the displacement coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;
S_t =\sum_{A=1}^N \sum_{i=1}^3 s^t_{Ai} \, d_{Ai}= \sum_{A=1}^N \mathbf{s}^t_{A} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{A}, \quad \mathrm{for}\quad t = 1,\ldots,3N-6, 
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''s'''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is known as a ''Wilson s-vector''.
If we put the &lt;math&gt;s^t_{Ai}&lt;/math&gt; into a  3''N''-6 x 3''N'' matrix '''B''', this equation becomes in matrix language
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{d}. &lt;/math&gt;
The actual form of the matrix elements  of '''B''' can be fairly complicated.
Especially for a torsion angle, which involves 4 atoms,  it requires tedious vector algebra to derive the corresponding values of the &lt;math&gt;s^t_{Ai}&lt;/math&gt;. See for  more details on this method, known as
the ''Wilson s-vector method'', the book by Wilson ''et al.'', or molecular vibration.  Now, 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{L}^{-1} \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{L}^{-1} \mathbf{B} \mathbf{d} \equiv
\mathbf{D} \mathbf{d}. 
&lt;/math&gt;
In summation language:
:&lt;math&gt;
Q_k = \sum_{A=1}^N \sum_{i=1}^3 D^k_{Ai}\, d_{Ai} \quad \mathrm{for}\quad k=1,\ldots, 3N-6.
&lt;/math&gt;
Here '''D''' is a  3''N''-6 x 3''N'' matrix which is given by (i) the linearization of the internal coordinates '''q''' (an algebraic process)  and (ii) solution of  Wilson's GF equations (a numeric process).

==Relation with Eckart conditions ==
From the invariance of the internal coordinates ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; under overall rotation and translation
of the molecule, follows the same for the linearized coordinates '''s'''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.
It can be shown that this implies that the following 6 conditions are satisfied by the internal
coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{A=1}^N \mathbf{s}^t_{A}  = 0\quad\mathrm{and}\quad 
\sum_{A=1}^N \mathbf{R}^0_A\times \mathbf{s}^t_A= 0,  \quad t=1,\ldots,3N-6.
&lt;/math&gt;
These conditions follow from the  Eckart conditions that hold for the displacement vectors, 
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{A=1}^N M_A\; \mathbf{d}_{A} = 0 \quad\mathrm{and}\quad
\sum_{A=1}^N M_A\;  \mathbf{R}^0_{A} \times \mathbf{d}_{A} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
See Eckart conditions|this article for more details.

The '''FLuorescence EXplorer''' (FLEX) is a mission submitted to the [[European Space Agency]] in response to the ''Call for Ideas for Earth Explorer Core Missions''. Recently it has been chosen to pass to pre-phase A.

==Summary==
The FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission proposes to launch a satellite for the global monitoring of steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence in terrestrial vegetation.  After more than 70 years of basic and applied research in chlorophyll fluorescence, it is now clear that fluorescence is a sensitive probe of photosynthetic function in both healthy and physiologically perturbed vegetation.  Fluorescence is a powerful non-invasive tool to track the status, resilience, and recovery of photochemical processes and moreover provides important information on overall photosynthetic performance with implications for related carbon sequestration.  The early responsiveness of fluorescence to atmospheric, soil and plant water balance, as well as to atmospheric chemistry and human intervention in land usage makes it an obvious biological indicator in improving our understanding of Earth system dynamics.  The amenability of fluorescence to remote, even space-based observation qualifies it to join the emerging suite of space-based technologies for Earth observation.  FLEX would encompass a three-instrument array for measurement of the interrelated features of fluorescence, hyperspectral reflectance, and canopy temperature. The program would involve a space and ground-truthing program of 3-years duration and would provide data formats for research and applied science.

'''Flowing afterglow mass spectrometry''', FA-MS, is a sensitive and quantitative [[mass spectrometry]] analytical approach that offers a route to on-line, real-time [[deuterium]] abundance measurements in water vapour in breath and above aqueous liquids, including urine and serum.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method involves the production and flow of thermalised hydrated hydronium cluster [[ions]] in inert helium or argon carrier gas along a flow tube following the introduction of a humid air sample. These ions react in multiple collisions with water molecules, their isotopic compositions reach equilibrium and the relative magnitudes of their isotopomers are measured by a [[quadrupole]] mass spectrometer located downstream. 

==Trace gas analysis==

One of the first papers reporting the use of the flowing afterglow was reported in Planet Space Sci in 1966 by Norton, Ferguson, Fehsenfeld, and Schmeltekopf.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They studied ion-molecule reactions pertinent to the Martian atmosphere.  This flowing afterglow technique replaced the then standard stationary afterglow.  Flowing afterglow has many attractive aspects: well-understood laminar behavior, viscous gas flow,  a large density of carrier gas which allows the study of thermalized reactions, and the capability to make new reactant ions in situ.  The ambipolar plasma is sampled using a nosecone and detected using conventional quadrupole or tandem mass spectrometry, depending on the application.  One of the drawbacks of the flowing afterglow technique is the possibility of generating multiple reactant ions.  This problem is circumvented by implementing the [[Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry|selected ion flow tube]] (SIFT).&lt;ref&gt;

All ions have drawbacks and advantages.  Strategies that have been employed to unequivacally identify the VOCs include using [[gas chromatography]] coupled with flowing afterglow and   using a complement of reagent ions.  Detection limits are typically in the parts per billion range if there is limited sample or parts per trillion if there is an unlimited sample size.

'''Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy''' ('''FCS''') is a common technique used by physicists, chemists, and biologists to experimentally characterize the dynamics of fluorescent species (e.g. single fluorescent dye molecules in nanostructured materials, autofluorescent proteins in living cells, etc.). Although the name indicates a specific link to fluorescence, the method is used today also for exploring other forms of luminescence (like reflections, luminescence from gold-beads or [[Quantum_dot|quantum dots]] or phosphorescent species). The word &quot;spectroscopy&quot; in the name differs from common usage, in which  a spectrum is generally understood to be a frequency spectrum. The autocorrelation is a genuine form of spectrum, however: It is the time-spectrum generated from the power spectrum (via inverse Fourier transform).

Commonly, FCS is employed in the context of optical microscopy, in particular confocal or two-photon microscopy. In these techniques light is focused on a sample and the measured  [[fluorescence]] intensity fluctuations (due to [[diffusion]], physical or chemical reactions, aggregation, etc.) are analyzed using the temporal autocorrelation. Because the measured property is essentially related to the magnitude and/or the amount of fluctuations, there is an optimum measurement regime at the level when individual species enter or exit the observation volume (or turn on and off in the volume). When too many entities are measured at the same time the overall fluctuations are small in comparison to the total signal and may not be resolvable – in the other direction, if the individual fluctuation-events are too sparse in time, one measurement may take prohibitively too long. FCS is in a way the fluorescent counterpart to [[dynamic light scattering]], which uses coherent light scattering, instead of (incoherent) fluorescence.

When an appropriate model is known, FCS can be used to obtain quantitative information such as 
* diffusion coefficients
* hydrodynamic radii
* average concentrations
* kinetic chemical reaction rates
* singlet-triplet dynamics

Because fluorescent markers come in a variety of colors and can be specifically bound to a particular molecule (e.g. proteins, polymers, metal-complexes, etc.), it is possible to study the behavior of individual molecules (in rapid succession in composite solutions). With the development of sensitive detectors such as [[avalanche photodiode]]s the detection of the fluorescence signal coming from individual molecules in highly dilute samples has become practical. With this emerged the possibility to conduct FCS experiments in a wide variety of specimens, ranging from materials science to biology. The advent of engineered cells with genetically tagged proteins (like [[green fluorescent protein]]) has made FCS a common tool for studying molecular dynamics in living cells. 

==History==
Signal-correlation techniques were first experimentally applied to fluorescence in 1972 by Magde, Elson, and Webb&lt;ref&gt;Magde, D., Elson, E. L., Webb, W. W. Thermodynamic fluctuations in a reacting system: Measurement by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy,(1972) ''Phys Rev Lett'', '''29''', 705–708.&lt;/ref&gt;, who are therefore commonly credited as the &quot;inventors&quot; of FCS. The technique was further developed in a group of papers by these and other authors soon after, establishing the theoretical foundations and types of applications.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, M., Rigler, R. Rotational brownian motion and fluorescence intensity fluctuations,(1974) ''Chem Phys'', '''4''', 390–401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elson, E. L., Magde, D. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy I. Conceptual basis and theory,(1974) ''Biopolymers'', '''13''', 1–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magde, D., Elson, E. L., Webb, W. W. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy II. An experimental realization,(1974) ''Biopolymers'', '''13''', 29–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  See Thompson (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson N L 1991 Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy Techniques vol 1, ed J R Lakowicz (New York: Plenum) pp 337–78&lt;/ref&gt; for a review of that period.

Beginning in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Rigler, R, Ü. Mets1, J. Widengren and P. Kask. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with high count rate and low background: analysis of translational diffusion. European  Biophysics Journal (1993) 22(3), 159.&lt;/ref&gt;, a number of improvements in the measurement techniques&amp;mdash;notably using confocal microscopy, and then two-photon microscopy&amp;mdash;to better define the measurement volume and reject background&amp;mdash;greatly improved the signal-to-noise ratio and allowed single molecule sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Eigen, M., Rigler, M.

Fluorescence correlations, single molecule detection and large number screening. Applications in biotechnology,(1995) ''J. Biotechnol.'', '''41''',177–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been a renewed interest in FCS, and as of August 2007 there have been over 3,000 papers using FCS found in Web of Science.  See Krichevsky and Bonnet&lt;ref&gt;O. Krichevsky, G. Bonnet, &quot;Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy: the technique and its applications,&quot; Rep. Prog. Phys. 65, 251–297 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; for a recent review.  In addition, there has been a flurry of activity extending FCS in various ways, for instance to laser scanning and spinning-disk confocal microscopy (from a stationary, single point measurement), in using cross-correlation (FCCS) between two fluorescent channels instead of autocorrelation, and in using [[Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer | Förster Resonance Energy Transfer]] (FRET) instead of fluorescence.

==Typical FCS setup==

The typical FCS setup consists of a laser line (wavelengths ranging typically from 405–633 nm (cw), and from 690–1100 nm (pulsed)), which is reflected into a microscope objective by a dichroic mirror. The laser beam is focused in the sample, which contains fluorescent particles (molecules) in such high dilution, that only a few are within the focal spot (usually 1–100 molecules in one fL). When the particles cross the focal volume, they fluoresce. This light is collected by the same objective and, because it is red-shifted with respect to the excitation light it passes the dichroic mirror reaching a detector, typically a [[photomultiplier]] tube or [[avalanche photodiode]] detector.  The resulting electronic signal can be stored either directly as an intensity versus time trace to be analyzed at a later point, or computed to generate the autocorrelation directly (which requires special acquisition cards). The FCS curve by itself only represents a time-spectrum. Conclusions on physical phenomena have to be extracted from there with appropriate models. The parameters of interest are found after fitting the autocorrelation curve to modeled functional forms. &lt;ref&gt;Medina, M. A., Schwille, P. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy for the detection and study of single molecules in biology, (2002)''BioEssays'', '''24''', 758–764.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The measurement volume==
The measurement volume is a convolution of illumination (excitation) and detection geometries, which result from the optical elements involved. The resulting volume is described mathematically by the [[point spread function]] (or PSF), it is essentially the image of a point source. The PSF is often described as an ellipsoid (with unsharp boundaries) of few hundred nanometers in focus diameter, and almost one micrometre along the optical axis. The shape varies significantly (and has a large impact on the resulting FCS curves) depending on the quality of the optical elements (it is crucial to avoid astigmatism and to check the real shape of the PSF on the instrument). In the case of confocal microscopy, and for small pinholes (around one Airy unit), the PSF is well approximated by Gaussians:  

:&lt;math&gt; PSF(r,z)= I_0 e^{- 2 r^2/\omega_{xy}^2} e^{-2 z^2/\omega_{z}^2} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; is the peak intensity, r and z are radial and axial position, and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{z}&lt;/math&gt; are the radial and axial radii, and &lt;math&gt; \omega_{z} &gt; \omega_{xy}&lt;/math&gt;.  This Gaussian form is assumed in deriving the functional form of the autocorrelation. 

Typically &lt;math&gt;\omega_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; is 200–300 nm, and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{z}&lt;/math&gt; is '''2–6''' times larger.&lt;ref&gt;Mayboroda, O. A., van Remoortere, A., Tanke H. J., Hokke, C. H., Deelder, A. M.,  A new approach for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) based immunoassays, (2003), ''J. Biotechnol.'', '''107''', 185–192.&lt;/ref&gt;   One common way of calibrating the measurement volume parameters is to perform FCS on a species with known diffusion coefficient and concentration (see below).  Diffusion coefficients for common fluorophores in water are given in a later section. 

The Gaussian approximation works to varying degrees depending on the optical details, and corrections can sometimes be applied to offset the errors in approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, S.T., and W.W. Webb. 2002. Focal volume optics and experimental artifacts in confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Biophys. J. 83:2300–2317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autocorrelation function==
The (temporal) autocorrelation function is the correlation of a time series with itself shifted by time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;G(\tau)=\frac{\langle\delta I(t)\delta I(t+\tau)\rangle}{\langle I(t) \rangle^2}=\frac{\langle I(t)I(t+\tau) \rangle}{\langle I(t)\rangle^2}-1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta I(t)=I(t)-\langle I(t)\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the deviation from the mean intensity.  The normalization (denominator) here is the most commonly used for FCS, because then the correlation at &lt;math&gt;\tau=0&lt;/math&gt;, ''G''(0), is related to the average number of particles in the measurement volume.

==Interpreting the autocorrelation function==
To extract quantities of interest, the autocorrelation data can be fitted, typically using a [[Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm | nonlinear least squares algorithm]].  The fit's functional form depends on the type of dynamics (and the optical geometry in question).  

===Normal diffusion===
The fluorescent particles used in FCS are small and thus experience thermal motions in solution.  The simplest FCS experiment is thus normal 3D diffusion, for which the autocorrelation is:

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0)\frac{1}{(1+(\tau/\tau_D ))(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_D ))^{1/2}} +G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; a=\omega_z/\omega_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of axial to radial &lt;math&gt;e^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; radii of the measurement volume, and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic residence time.  This form was derived assuming a Gaussian measurement volume.  Typically, the fit would have three free parameters--G(0), &lt;math&gt;G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;--from which the diffusion coefficient and fluorophore concentration can be obtained.  

With the normalization used in the previous section, ''G''(0) gives the mean number of diffusers in the volume &lt;N&gt;, or equivalently&amp;mdash;with knowledge of the observation volume size&amp;mdash;the mean concentration:

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(0)=\frac{1}{\langle N\rangle}=\frac{1}{V_\text{eff}\langle C\rangle},&lt;/math&gt;

where the effective volume is found from integrating the Gaussian form of the measurement volume and is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;\ V_\text{eff}=\pi^{3/2}\omega_{xy}^2\omega_z .\, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt; gives the diffusion coefficient:
: &lt;math&gt;\ D=\omega_{xy}^2/{4\tau_D}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Anomalous diffusion===
If the diffusing particles are hindered by obstacles or pushed by a force (molecular motors, flow, etc.) the dynamics is often not sufficiently well-described by the normal diffusion model, where the mean squared displacement (MSD) grows linearly with time.  Instead the diffusion may be better described as [[anomalous diffusion]], where the temporal dependenc of the MSD is non-linear as in the power-law:

: &lt;math&gt;\ MSD= 6 D_a t^\alpha \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D_a&lt;/math&gt; is an anomalous diffusion coefficient.  &quot;Anomalous diffusion&quot; commonly refers only to this very generic model, and not the many other possibilities that might be described as anomalous.  Also, a power law is, in a strict sense, the expected form only for a narrow range of rigorously defined systems, for instance when the distribution of obstacles is [[fractal]].  Nonetheless a power law can be a useful approximation for a wider range of systems.  

The FCS autocorrelation function for anomalous diffusion is:

: &lt;math&gt; G(\tau)=G(0)\frac{1}{(1+(\tau/\tau_D)^\alpha)(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_D)^\alpha)^{1/2}} +G(\infty),&lt;/math&gt;

where the anomalous exponent &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the same as above, and becomes a free parameter in the fitting.  

Using FCS, the anomalous exponent has been shown to be an indication of the degree of molecular crowding (it is less than one and smaller for greater degrees of crowding)&lt;ref&gt;Banks, D. S., and C. Fradin. 2005. Anomalous diffusion of proteins due to molecular crowding. Biophys. J. 89:2960–2971.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Polydisperse diffusion===
If there are diffusing particles with different sizes (diffusion coefficients), it is common to fit to a function that is the sum of single component forms: 

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0)\sum_i \frac{\alpha_i}{(1+(\tau/\tau_{D,i}))(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_{D,i}))^{1/2}} +G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is over the number different sizes of particle, indexed by i, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; gives the weighting, which is related to the quantum yield and concentration of each type. This introduces new parameters, which makes the fitting more difficult as a higher dimensional space must be searched.  Nonlinear least square fitting typically becomes unstable with even a small number of &lt;math&gt;\tau_{D,i}&lt;/math&gt;s.  A more robust fitting scheme, especially useful for polydisperse samples, is the Maximum Entropy Method&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta, P., K. Garai, J. Balaji, N. Periasamy, and S. Maiti. 2003. Measuring Size Distribution in Highly Heterogeneous Systems with Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. Biophys. J. 84(3):1977–1984.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Diffusion with flow===
With diffusion together with a uniform flow with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in the lateral direction, the autocorrelation is&lt;ref&gt; Kohler, R.H., P. Schwille, W.W. Webb, and M.R. Hanson. 2000. Active protein transport through plastid tubules: velocity quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. J Cell Sci 113(22):3921–3930&lt;/ref&gt;:
 
: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0)\frac{1}{(1+(\tau/\tau_{D}))(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_{D}))^{1/2}} \times \exp[-(\tau/\tau_v)^2 \times \frac{1}{1+\tau/\tau_D}] +G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_v=\omega_{xy}/v&lt;/math&gt; is the average residence time if there is only a flow (no diffusion).

===Chemical relaxation===
A wide range of possible FCS experiments involve chemical reactions that continually fluctuate from equilibrium because of thermal motions (and then &quot;relax&quot;).  In contrast to diffusion, which is also a relaxation process, the fluctuations cause changes between states of different energies.  One very simple system showing chemical relaxation would be a stationary binding site in the measurement volume, where particles only produce signal when bound (e.g. by FRET, or if the diffusion time is much faster than the sampling interval).  In this case the autocorrelation is:

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0) \exp(-\tau/\tau_B) +G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where 

: &lt;math&gt;\ \tau_B=(k_\text{on}+k_\text{off} )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; 

is the relaxation time and depends on the reaction kinetics (on and off rates), and: 

: &lt;math&gt; G(0) = \frac{1}{\langle N\rangle} \frac{k_{on}}{k_{off}} = \frac{1}{\langle N\rangle} K&lt;/math&gt; 

is related to the equilibrium constant ''K''.

Most systems with chemical relaxation also show measureable diffusion as well, and the autocorrelation function will depend on the details of the system.  If the diffusion and chemical reaction are decoupled, the combined autocorrelation is the product of the chemical and diffusive autocorrelations.

===Triplet state correction===
The autocorrelations above assume that the fluctuations are not due to changes in the fluorescent properties of the particles.  However, for the majority of (bio)organic fluorophores--e.g. [[green fluorescent protein]], rhodamine, [[Cy3]] and [[Alexa Fluor]] dyes--some fraction of illuminated particles are excited to a [[triplet state]] (or other non-radiative decaying states) and then do not emit [[photons]] for a characteristic relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau_F&lt;/math&gt;.  Typically &lt;math&gt;\tau_F&lt;/math&gt; is on the order of microseconds, which is usually smaller than the dynamics of interest (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;) but large enough to be measured.  A multiplicative term is added to the autocorrelation account for the triplet state.  For normal diffusion: 

: &lt;math&gt;\ G(\tau)=G(0)\frac{1-F+Fe^{-\tau/\tau_F}}{1-F}\frac{1}{(1+(\tau/\tau_{D,i}))(1+a^{-2}(\tau/\tau_{D,i}))^{1/2}}+G(\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ F&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of particles that have entered the triplet state and &lt;math&gt;\ \tau_F&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding triplet state relaxation time.  If the dynamics of interest are much slower than the triplet state relaxation, the short time component of the autocorrelation can simply be truncated and the triplet term is unnecessary.

==Common fluorescent probes==
The fluorescent species used in FCS is typically a biomolecule of interest that has been tagged with a fluorophore (using [[immunohistochemistry]] for instance), or is a naked fluorophore that is used to probe some environment of interest (e.g. the cytoskeleton of a cell).  The following table gives diffusion coefficients of some common fluorophores in water at room temperature, and their excitation wavelengths.

==Variations of FCS==
FCS almost always refers to the single point, single channel, temporal autocorrelation measurement, although the term &quot;fluorescence correlation spectroscopy&quot; out of its historical scientific context implies no such restriction.  FCS has been extended in a number of variations by different researchers, with each extension generating another name (usually an acronym).     

===Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS)===
FCS is sometimes used to study molecular interactions using differences in diffusion times (e.g. the product of an association reaction will be larger and thus have larger diffusion times than the reactants individually); however, FCS is relatively insensitive to molecular mass as can be seen from the following equation relating molecular mass to the diffusion time of globular particles (e.g. proteins):

: &lt;math&gt;\ \tau_D=\frac{3\pi\omega_{xy}^2\eta}{2kT}(M)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \eta&lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity of the sample and &lt;math&gt;\ M&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular mass of the fluorescent species. In practice, the diffusion times need to be sufficiently different--a factor of at least '''1.6'''--which means the molecular masses must differ by a factor of '''4'''.&lt;ref&gt;Meseth, U., Wohland, T., Rigler, R., Vogel, H. Resolution of fluorescence correlation measurements. (1999) ''Biophys. J.'', '''76''', 1619–1631.&lt;/ref&gt; Dual color [[fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy]] (FCCS) measures interactions by cross-correlating two or more fluorescent channels (one channel for each reactant), which distinguishes interactions more sensitively than FCS, particularly when the mass change in the reaction is small.

===Brightness analysis methods (N&amp;B,&lt;ref&gt;Digman, M. A., R. Dalal, A. F. Horwitz, and E. Gratton.  Mapping the number of molecules and brightness in the laser scanning microscope. (2008) ''Biophys. J.'' '''94''', 2320–2332.
&lt;/ref&gt; PCH,&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Y., J. D. Müller, P. T. C. So, and E. Gratton. The photon counting histogram in fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy. (1999) ''Biophys. J.'' '''77''', 553–567.&lt;/ref&gt; FIDA,&lt;ref&gt;Kask, P., K. Palo, D. Ullmann, and K. Gall. Fluorescence-intensity distribution analysis and its application in biomolecular detection technology. (1999) ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.'' '''96''', 13756–13761.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumulant Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Müller, J. D. Cumulant analysis in fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy. (2004) ''Biophys. J.'' '''86''', 3981–3992.&lt;/ref&gt;)===
Fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy overcomes the weak dependence of diffusion rate on molecular mass by looking at multicolor coincidence.  What about homo-interactions?  The solution lies in brightness analysis.  These methods use the heterogeneity in the intensity distribution of fluorescence to measure the molecular brightness of different species in a sample.  Since dimers will contain twice the number of fluorescent labels as monomers, their molecular brightness will be approximately double that of monomers.  As a result, the relative brightness is sensitive a measure of oligomerization.  The average molecular brightness (&lt;math&gt;\langle \epsilon\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) is related to the variance (&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;) and the average intensity (&lt;math&gt;\langle I\rangle &lt;/math&gt;) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Qian, H., Elson, E.L. On the analysis of high order moments of fluorescence fluctuations. (1990) ''Biophys. J.'', '''57''', 375–380.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\ \langle \varepsilon\rangle =\frac{\sigma^2 - \langle I\rangle}{\langle I\rangle} = \sum_i f_i \varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; are the fractional intensity and molecular brigthness, respectively, of species &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

==Two- and three- photon FCS excitation==
Several advantages in both spatial resolution and minimizing photodamage/photobleaching in organic and/or biological samples are obtained by two-photon or three-photon excitation FCS&lt;ref&gt;Diaspro, A., and Robello, M. (1999). Multi-photon Excitation Microscopy to Study Biosystems. European Microscopy and Analysis., 5:5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bagatolli, L.A., and Gratton, E. (2000). Two-photon fluorescence microscopy of coexisting lipid domains in giant unilamellar vesicles of binary phospholipid mixtures. Biophys J., 78:290–305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwille, P., Haupts, U., Maiti, S., and Webb. W.(1999). Molecular dynamics in living cells observed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with one- and two- photon excitation. ''Biophysical Journal'', '''77'''(10):2251–2265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Near Infrared Microspectroscopy, Fluorescence Microspectroscopy,Infrared Chemical Imaging and High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analysis of Soybean  Seeds, Somatic Embryos and Single Cells., Baianu, I.C. et al. 2004., In ''Oil Extraction and Analysis.'', D. Luthria, Editor pp.241–273, AOCS Press., Champaign, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Single Cancer Cell Detection by Near Infrared Microspectroscopy, Infrared Chemical Imaging and Fluorescence Microspectroscopy.2004.I. C. Baianu, D. Costescu, N. E. Hofmann and S. S. Korban, [http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0407006 q-bio/0407006 (July 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===FRET-FCS===
Another FCS based approach to studying molecular interactions uses [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]] (FRET) instead of fluorescence, and is called FRET-FCS.&lt;ref&gt;K. Remaut, B. Lucas, K. Braeckmans, N.N. Sanders, S.C. De Smedt and J. Demeester, FRET-FCS as a tool to evaluate the stability of oligonucleotide drugs after intracellular delivery, J Control Rel 103 (2005) (1), pp. 259–271.&lt;/ref&gt;  With FRET, there are two types of probes, as with FCCS; however, there is only one channel and light is only detected when the two probes are very close&amp;mdash;close enough to ensure an interaction.  The FRET signal is weaker than with fluorescence, but has the advantage that there is only signal during a reaction (aside from [[autofluorescence]]).

===Image correlation spectroscopy (ICS)===
When the motion is slow (in biology, for example, diffusion in a membrane), getting adequate statistics from a single-point FCS experiment may take a prohibitively long time.  More data can be obtained by performing the experiment in multiple spatial points in parallel, using a laser scanning confocal microscope.  This approach has been called Image Correlation Spectroscopy (ICS)&lt;ref name=&quot;ICS-ICCS&quot;&gt;Wiseman, P. W., J. A. Squier, M. H. Ellisman, and K. R. Wilson. 2000. Two-photon video rate image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) and image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS). J. Microsc. 200:14–25.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The measurements can then be averaged together.  

Another variation of ICS performs a spatial autocorrelation on images, which gives information about the concentration of particles&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, N. O., P. L. Ho¨ddelius, P. W. Wiseman, O. Seger, and K. E. Magnusson. 1993. Quantitation of membrane receptor distributions by
image correlation spectroscopy: concept and application. Biophys. J.
65:1135–1146.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The correlation is then averaged in time. 

A natural extension of the temporal and spatial correlation versions is spatio-temporal ICS (STICS) &lt;ref name=&quot;stics&quot;&gt;Hebert, B., S. Constantino, and P. W. Wiseman. 2005. Spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS): theory, verification and application to protein velocity mapping in living CHO cells. Biophys.
J. 88:3601–3614.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In STICS there is no explicit averaging in space or time (only the averaging inherent in correlation).  In systems with non-isotropic motion (e.g. directed flow, asymmetric diffusion), STICS can extract the directional information.  A variation that is closely related to STICS (by the Fourier transform) is ''k''-space Image Correlation Spectroscopy (kICS).&lt;ref&gt;Kolin, D.L., D. Ronis, and P.W. Wiseman. 2006. ''k''-Space Image Correlation Spectroscopy: A Method for Accurate Transport Measurements Independent of Fluorophore Photophysics. Biophys. J. 91(8):3061–3075.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are cross-correlation versions of ICS as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICS-ICCS&quot;/&gt;

===Scanning FCS variations===
Some variations of FCS are only applicable to serial scanning laser microscopes.  Image Correlation Spectroscopy and its variations all were implemented on a scanning confocal or scanning two photon microscope, but transfer to other microscopes, like a spinning disk confocal microscope.

===Spinning disk FCS, and spatial mapping===
Any of the image correlation spectroscopy methods can also be performed on a spinning disk confocal microscope, which in practice can obtain faster imaging speeds compared to a laser scanning confocal microscope.  This approach has recently been applied to diffusion in a spatially varying complex environment, producing a pixel resolution map of a diffusion coefficient.&lt;ref&gt;Sisan, D.R., R. Arevalo, C. Graves, R. McAllister, and J.S. Urbach. 2006. Spatially resolved fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using a spinning disk confocal microscope. Biophysical Journal 91(11):4241–4252.&lt;/ref&gt;. The spatial mapping of diffusion with FCS has subsequently been extended to the TIRF system.&lt;ref&gt;Kannan, B., L. Guo, T. Sudhaharan, S. Ahmed, I. Maruyama, and T. Wohland. 2007. Spatially resolved total internal reflection fluorescence correlation microscopy using an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera. Analytical Chemistry 79(12):4463–4470&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial mapping of dynamics using correlation techniques had been applied before, but only at sparse points&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmuth, M., W. Waldeck, and J. Langowski. 2000. Anomalous diffusion of fluorescent probes inside living cell nuclei investigated by spatially-resolved fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. J. Mol. Biol. 298(4):677–689.
&lt;/ref&gt; or at coarse resolution&lt;ref name=&quot;stics&quot; /&gt;.

===Total internal reflection FCS===
[[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope | Total internal reflection fluorescence]] (TIRF) is a microscopy approach that is only sensitive to a thin layer near the surface of a coverslip, which greatly minimizes background fluorscence.  FCS has been extended to that type of microscope, and is called TIR-FCS&lt;ref&gt;Lieto, A.M., and N.L. Thompson. 2004. Total Internal Reflection with Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy: Nonfluorescent Competitors. Biophys. J. 87(2):1268–1278.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Because the fluorescence intensity in TIRF falls off exponentially with distance from the coverslip (instead of as a Gaussian with a confocal), the autocorrelation function is different.

==Other fluorescent dynamical approaches==
There are two main non-correlation alternatives to FCS that are widely used to study the dynamics of fluorescent species.

===Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)===
In [[fluorescence recovery after photobleaching | FRAP]], a region is briefly exposed to intense light, irrecoverably photobleaching fluorophores, and the fluorescence recovery due to diffusion of nearby (non-bleached) fluorophores is imaged.  A primary advantage of FRAP over FCS is the ease of interpreting qualitative experiments common in cell biology.  Differences between cell lines, or regions of a cell, or before and after application of drug, can often be characterized by simple inspection of movies. FCS experiments require a level of processing and are more sensitive to potentially confounding influences like: rotational diffusion, vibrations, photobleaching, dependence on illumination and fluorescence color, inadequate statistics, etc.  It is much easier to change the measurement volume in FRAP, which allows greater control. In practice, the volumes are typically larger than in FCS.  While FRAP experiments are typically more qualitative, some researchers are studying FRAP quantitatively and including binding dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, B.L., and J.G. McNally. 2005. FRAP analysis of binding: proper and fitting. Trends in Cell Biology 15(2):84–91.&lt;/ref&gt;  A disadvantage of FRAP in cell biology is the free radical perturbation of the cell caused by the photobleaching.  It is also less versatile, as it cannot measure concentration or rotational diffusion, or co-localization.  FRAP requires a significantly higher concentration of fluorophores than FCS.  

===Particle tracking===
In particle tracking, the trajectories of a set of particles are measured, typically by applying particle tracking algorithms to movies.[http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/idl/]  Particle tracking has the advantage that all the dynamical information is maintained in the measurement, unlike FCS where correlation averages the dynamics to a single smooth curve.  The advantage is apparent in systems showing complex diffusion, where directly computing the mean squared displacement allows straightforward comparison to normal or power law diffusion.  To apply particle tracking, the particles have to be distinguishable and thus at lower concentration than required of FCS.  Also, particle tracking is more sensitive to noise, which can sometimes affect the results unpredictably.

'''Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching''', or '''FLIP''', is a technique in [[fluorescence microscopy]] which can be used to examine the movement or diffusion of molecules inside [[cell (biology) | cell]]s or [[cell membrane | membrane]]s.  Typically a cell membrane is labelled with a fluorescent [[fluorophore | dye]], and a specific area of the labeled membrane is [[photobleaching | bleached]] using the beam from a [[confocal laser scanning microscope]].  The fluorescence intensity from that region of the membrane is measured over time.  Motion of fluorescent molecules into and along the membrane slowly restores the fluorescence in the bleached region, while depleting the fluorescence in other regions (by exchange of bleached for unbleached fluorophores).  

Measurement of the rate of this recovery provides an estimate of the lateral membrane fluidity.  Changes in the size and shape of the bleached region can also indicate directional flow along the cell membrane.

FLIP is also useful in verifying the continuity of membranous organelles (e.g., the [[Golgi apparatus]]).  A small circumscribed region of the organelle  is continuously bleached.  As fluorophores diffuse along the membrane into the illuminated spot, they are bleached; eventually, the fluorescence of the entire organelle is depleted.

It is closely related to another technique, [[Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching]] (FRAP).  The difference between FLIP and FRAP is that FLIP follows the path of the bleached fluorophores, while FRAP follows the recovery of the bleached region.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy''' (FCCS) was introduced by Eigen and Rigler in 1994 and experimentally realized by Schwille in 1997. It extends the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) procedure by introducing high sensitivity for distinguishing fluorescent particles which have a similar diffusion coefficient. 
FCCS uses two species which are independently labelled with two spectrally separated fluorescent probes. These fluorescent probes are excited and detected by two different laser light sources and detectors commonly known as green and red respectively. Both laser light beams are focused into the sample and tuned so that they overlap to form a superimposed confocal observation volume. 

The normalized cross-correlation function is defined for two fluorescent species &lt;math&gt;\ G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ R&lt;/math&gt; which are independent green, G and red, R channels as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\ G_{GR}(\tau)=1+\frac{&lt;\delta I_G(t)\delta I_R(t+\tau)&gt;}{&lt;I_G(t)&gt;&lt;I_R(t)&gt;}=\frac{&lt;I_G(t)I_R(t+\tau)&gt;}{&lt;I_G(t)&gt;&lt;I_R(t)&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;

where differential fluorescent signals &lt;math&gt;\ \delta I_G&lt;/math&gt; at a specific time, &lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ \delta I_R&lt;/math&gt; at a delay time, &lt;math&gt;\ \tau&lt;/math&gt; later is correlated with each other.

==Modeling==
Cross-correlation curves are modeled according to a slightly more complicated mathematical function than applied in FCS. First of all, the effective superimposed observation volume in which the G and R channels form a single observation volume, &lt;math&gt;\ V_{eff, RG}&lt;/math&gt; in the solution:

&lt;math&gt;\ V_{eff, RG}=\pi^{3/2}(\omega_{xy,G}^2+\omega_{xy,R}^2)(\omega_{z,G}^2+\omega_{z,R}^2)^{1/2}/2^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \omega_{xy,G}^2&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;\ \omega_{xy,R}^2&lt;/math&gt; are radial parameters and &lt;math&gt;\ \omega_{z,G}&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;\ \omega_{z,R}&lt;/math&gt; are the axial parameters for the G and R channels respectively.

The diffusion time, &lt;math&gt;\ \tau_{D,GR}&lt;/math&gt; for a doubly (G and R) fluorescent species is therefore described as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\ \tau_{D,GR}=\frac{\omega_{xy,G}^2+\omega_{xy,R}^2}{8D_{GR}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ D_{GR}&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion coefficient of the doubly fluorescent particle.

The cross-correlation curve generated from diffusing doubly labelled fluorescent particles can be modelled in separate channels as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\ G_G(\tau)=1+\frac{(&lt;C_G&gt;Diff_k(\tau)+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;Diff_k(\tau))}{V_{eff, GR}(&lt;C_G&gt;+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ G_R(\tau)=1+\frac{(&lt;C_R&gt;Diff_k(\tau)+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;Diff_k(\tau))}{V_{eff, GR}(&lt;C_R&gt;+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In the ideal case, the cross-correlation function is proportional to the concentration of the doubly labeled fluorescent complex:

&lt;math&gt;\ G_{GR}(\tau)=1+\frac{&lt;C_{GR}&gt;Diff_{GR}(\tau)}{V_{eff}(&lt;C_G&gt;+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;)(&lt;C_R&gt;+&lt;C_{GR}&gt;)}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\ Diff_k(\tau)=\frac{1}{(1+\frac{\tau}{\tau_{D,i}})(1+a^{-2}(\frac{\tau}{\tau_{D,i}})^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Contrary to FCS, the intercept of the cross-correlation curve does not yield information about the doubly labelled fluorescent particles in solution.

[[Image:Fluorescence microscop.jpg|thumb|An upright fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61) with the fluorescent filter cube turret above the objective lenses, coupled with a digital camera.]]


A '''fluorescence microscope''' (colloquially synonymous with ''epifluorescence microscope'') is an [[optical microscope]] used to study properties of organic or inorganic substances using the phenomena of [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]] instead of, or in addition to, [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[absorption (optics)|absorption]].&lt;ref name=Spring&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microscopyu.com/articles/fluorescence/fluorescenceintro.html |author=Spring KR, Davidson MW |title=Introduction to Fluorescence Microscopy |work=Nikon MicroscopyU |accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/physics/microscopes/fluorescence/ |title=The Fluorescence Microscope |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |work=Microscopes—Help Scientists Explore Hidden Worlds |accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Inverted microscope.jpg|thumb|An inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon TE2000) with the fluorescent filter cube turret below the stage. Note the orange plate that allows the user to look at the sample while protecting his eyes from the excitation UV light.]]

==Technique==

In most cases, a component of interest in the specimen can be labeled specifically with a fluorescent molecule called a [[fluorophore]] (such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP), [[fluorescein]] or [[DyLight Fluor|DyLight 488]]).&lt;ref name=Spring/&gt; The specimen is illuminated with light of a specific [[wavelength]] (or wavelengths) which is absorbed by the fluorophores, causing them to emit light of longer wavelengths (i.e. of a different color than the absorbed light). The illumination light is separated from the much weaker emitted fluorescence through the use of a spectral emission filter. Typical components of a fluorescence microscope are the light source ([[xenon arc lamp]] or [[mercury-vapor lamp]]), the [[excitation filter]], the [[dichroic mirror]] (or dichromatic beamsplitter), and the [[emission filter]] (see figure below). The filters and the dichroic are chosen to match the spectral excitation and emission characteristics of the fluorophore used to label the specimen.&lt;ref name=Spring/&gt; In this manner, the distribution of a single fluorophore (color) is imaged at a time. Multi-color images of several types of fluorophores must be composed by combining several single-color images.&lt;ref name=Spring/&gt;

Most fluorescence microscopes in use are epifluorescence microscopes (i.e. excitation and observation of the fluorescence are from above (''epi–'') the specimen). These microscopes have become an important part in the field of biology, opening the doors for more advanced microscope designs, such as the [[confocal microscopy|confocal microscope]] and the [[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope]] (TIRF). 

Fluorophores lose their ability to fluoresce as they are illuminated in a process called [[photobleaching]]. Special care must be taken to prevent photobleaching through the use of more robust fluorophores, by minimizing illumination, or by introducing a [[Scavenger (chemistry)|scavenger]] system to reduce the rate of photobleaching.

==Epifluorescence microscopy==

[[Image:FluorescenceFilters 2008-09-28.svg|thumb|left|Schematic of a fluorescence microscope.]]
Epifluorescence microscopy is a method of fluorescence microscopy that is widely used in [[life sciences]]. The excitatory light is passed from above (or, for inverted microscopes, from below), through the [[objective (optics)|objective]] lens and then onto the specimen instead of passing it first through the specimen. The [[fluorescence]] in the specimen gives rise to emitted light which is focused to the detector by the same objective that is used for the excitation. Since most of the excitatory light is transmitted through the specimen, only reflected excitatory light reaches the objective together with the emitted light and this method therefore gives an improved signal to noise ratio. An additional filter between the objective and the detector can filter out the remaining excitation light from fluorescent light. A common use in biology is to apply fluorescent or [[fluorochrome]] stains to the specimen in order to image distributions of proteins or other molecules of interest.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

==Improvements and sub-diffraction techniques==

The nature of light limits the size of the spot to which light can be focused. According to the [[diffraction limit]] a focused light distribution cannot be made smaller than approximately half of the wavelength of the used light. Uncovered in the 19th century by [[Ernst Abbe]] this has been a barrier of the achievable resolution of fluorescence light microscopes for a long time. While resolution is denoted by the ability to discern different objects of the same kind, localizing or [[single particle tracking|tracking of single particles]] have been performed with a precision much below the diffraction limit.

Several improvements in microscopy techniques have been invented in the 20th century and have resulted in increased resolution and contrast to some extent. In 1978 first theoretical ideas have been developed to break this barrier by using a 4Pi microscope as a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope where the light is focused ideally from all sides to a common focus which is used to scan the object by 'point-by-point' excitation combined with 'point-by-point' detection &lt;ref name=&quot;clsm31-44&quot;&gt;&gt;Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field: C. Cremer and T. Cremer in M1CROSCOPICA ACTA VOL. 81 NUMBER 1 September,pp. 31—44 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, the first experimental demonstration of the 4pi microscope took place in 1994 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.W. Hell, E.H.K. Stelzer, S. Lindek, C. Cremer |title=Confocal microscopy with an increased detection aperture: type-B 4Pi confocal microscopy |journal=Optics Letters |volume=19 |year=1994 |pages=222-224 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ol-19-3-222&amp;seq=0 |doi=10.1364/OL.19.000222}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[4Pi microscopy]] is maximizing the amount of available focusing directions by using two opposing objective lenses or [[Multi-photon microscopy]] using redshifted light and multi-photon excitation.

The first technique to really achieve a sub-diffraction resolution was [[STED microscopy]], proposed in 1994. This method and all techniques following the [[RESOLFT]] concept rely on a strong non-linear interaction between light and fluorescing molecules. The molecules are driven strongly between distinguishable molecular states at each specific location, so that finally light can be emitted at only a small fraction of space, hence an increased resolution.

As well in the 1990ies another super resolution microscopy method based on wide field microscopy has been developed. Substantially improved size resolution of cellular [[nanostructure]]s stained with a fluorescent marker was achieved by development of SPDM localization microscopy and the structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI) &lt;ref&gt;M. Hausmann, B. Schneider, J. Bradl, C. Cremer (1997): High-precision distance microscopy of 3D-nanostructures by a spatially modulated excitation fluorescence microscope. In: Optical Biopsies and Microscopic Techniques II (Edts Bigio IJ, Schneckenburger H, Slavik J, Svanberg K, Viallet PM), Proc. SPIE 3197: 217-222&lt;/ref&gt;. Combining the principle of SPDM with SMI resulted in the development of the [[Vertico SMI]] microscope &lt;ref&gt;High precision structural analysis of subnuclear complexes in fixed and live cells via Spatially Modulated Illumination (SMI) microscopy: J. Reymann, D. Baddeley, P. Lemmer, W. Stadter, T. Jegou, K. Rippe, C. Cremer, U. Birk in CHROMOSOME RESEARCH, Vol.   16, pp. 367 –382 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Nano-structure analysis using Spatially Modulated Illumination microscopy: D. Baddeley, C. Batram, Y. Weiland, C. Cremer, U.J. Birk in NATURE PROTOCOLS, Vol 2, pp. 2640 – 2646 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;. Single molecule detection of normal blinking fluorescent dyes like [[GFP]] can be achieved by using a further development of SPDM the so-called SPDMphymod technology which makes it is possible to detect and count two different fluorescent molecule types at the molecular level (this technology is referred to as 2CLM, 2 Color Localization Microscopy) &lt;ref&gt;Manuel Gunkel, Fabian Erdel, Karsten Rippe, Paul Lemmer, Rainer Kaufmann, Christoph Hörmann, Roman Amberger and Christoph Cremer: ''Dual color localization microscopy of cellular nanostructures''. In: Biotechnology Journal, 2009, 4, 927-938. ISSN 1860-6768&lt;/ref&gt;  

Alternatively, the advent of [[Microscopy#PALM.2C_STORM|photoactivated localization microscopy]] could achieve similar results by relying on blinking or switching of single molecules, where the fraction of fluorescing molecules is very small at each time. This stochastic response of molecules on the applied light corresponds also to a highly nonlinear interaction, leading to subdiffraction resolution.

'''Fluorescence recovery after [[photobleaching]]''' (FRAP) denotes an optical technique capable of quantifying the two dimensional lateral diffusion of a molecularly thin film containing fluorescently labeled probes, or to examine single cells. This technique is very useful in biological studies of [[cell membrane]] diffusion and protein binding. In addition, surface deposition of a fluorescing [[phospholipid]] bilayer (or monolayer) allows the characterization of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]) surfaces in terms of surface structure and free energy.  
Similar, though less well known, techniques have been developed to investigate the 3-dimensional [[diffusion]] and [[binding]] of molecules inside the cell; they are also referred to as FRAP.  

==Experimental Setup==

The basic apparatus comprises an [[optical microscope]], a [[List of light sources|light source]] and some [[fluorescent]] probe. [[Fluorescence|Fluorescent emission]] is contingent upon absorption of a specific optical wavelength or color which restricts the choice of lamps. Most commonly, a broad [[spectrum]] [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[xenon]] source is used in conjunction with a color filter. The technique begins by saving a background image of the sample before photobleaching. Next, the light source is focused onto a small patch of the viewable area either by switching to a higher magnification microscope objective or with [[laser]] light of the appropriate wavelength. The fluorophores in this region receive high intensity illumination which causes their fluorescence lifetime to quickly elapse (limited to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; photons before extinction). Now the image in the microscope is that of a uniformly fluorescent field with a noticeable dark spot. As Brownian motion proceeds, the still-fluorescing probes will diffuse throughout the sample and replace the non-fluorescent probes in the bleached region. This diffusion proceeds in an ordered fashion, analytically determinable from the [[diffusion equation]]. Assuming a [[Gaussian beam|Gaussian]] profile for the bleaching beam, the diffusion constant ''D'' can be simply calculated from:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{w^{2}}{4t_{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is the radius of the beam and ''t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the time required for the bleach spot to recover half of its initial integrated intensity&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, B., R. Pego, et al. Analysis of Binding Reactions by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching. Biophys. J. 2004 Jun; 86(6):3473-3495&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Applications==
===Supported Lipid Bilayers===

Originally, the FRAP  technique was intended for use as a mean to characterize the mobility of individual lipid molecules within a cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod D.,Koppel D.E., Schlessinger J., Elson E. and Webb. W.W. Mobility measurement by analysis of fluorescence *photobleaching recovery kinetics. Biophysical Journal, Volume 16, Issue 9, September 1976, Pages 1055-1069.&lt;/ref&gt; While providing great utility in this role, current research leans more toward investigation of artificial lipid membranes. Supported by hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates (to produce lipid bilayers or monolayers respectively) and incorporating [[membrane proteins]], these biomimetic structures are potentially useful as analytical devices for determining the identity of unknown substances, understanding cellular transduction, and identifying ligand binding sites.

===Protein Binding===
This technique is commonly used in conjunction with [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) [[fusion protein]]s, where the studied protein is fused to a GFP.  When excited by a specific wavelength of light, the protein will fluoresce.  When the protein that is being studied is produced with the GFP, then the fluorescence can be tracked.  Photodestroying the GFP, and then watching the repopulation into the bleached area can reveal information about protein interaction partners, organelle continuity and protein trafficking.

If after some time the fluorescence doesn't reach the initial level anymore, then some part of the fluorescence is caused by an immobile fraction (that cannot be replenished by diffusion).  Similarly, if the fluorescent proteins bind to static cell receptors, the rate of recovery will be retarded by a factor related to the association and disassociation coefficients of binding.  This observation has most recently been exploited to investigate protein binding.

==Applications Outside the Membrane==
FRAP can also be used to monitor proteins outside the membrane.  After the protein of interest is made fluorescent, generally by expression as a GFP fusion protein, a [[confocal microscope]] is used to photobleach and monitor a region of the [[cytoplasm]], [[mitotic spindle]], [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or another cellular structure.&lt;ref&gt;Kaushlendra Tripathi and Veena K Parnaik. Differential dynamics of splicing factor SC35 during the cell cycle J. Biosci. 33(3)2008 345-354.&lt;/ref&gt;   The mean fluorescence in the region can then be plotted versus time since the photobleaching, and the resulting curve can yield kinetic coefficients for the protein's binding reactions and/or the protein's diffusion coefficient in the medium where it is being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;Adriaan B.Houtsmuller.Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching:Application to Nuclear Proteins.Adv Biochem Engin/Biotechnol (2005) 95: 177–199&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis is most simple when the curve is dominated by only the diffusional or only the binding components.  For a circular bleach spot and diffusion-dominated recovery, the fluorescence is described by the Soumpasis&lt;ref&gt;D M Soumpasis. Theoretical analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments. Biophys J. 1983 January; 41(1): 95–97. &lt;/ref&gt; equation and involves [[modified Bessel function]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=e^{-h}\left(I_{0}(h)+I_{1}(h)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h''=r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(2*D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;*t); ''r''=radius of bleach spot; ''t''=time; ''D&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''=diffusion coefficient; ''f(t)'' is the normalized fluorescence (goes to 1 as t goes to infinity).

For a binding-dominated reaction, in which the diffusion is much faster than the unbinding of the bleached protein and subsequent binding of unbleached protein, it is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=1-B_{eq}e^{-k_{off}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the fraction of the protein that is bound to other structures in the photobleached region at equilibrium, and ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the dissociation constant for the binding.  Sometimes there are multiple binding states in which case there are just more exponential terms of the same form.  Many FRAP recoveries are not dominated overwhelmingly by just diffusion or just binding, so their curves are more complex; FRAP recoveries are analyzed in much more detail in Sprague and Pego et al. (see References below).

'''Fluorescence spectroscopy''' aka fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of [[electromagnetic spectroscopy]] which analyzes [[fluorescence]] from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually [[ultraviolet light]], that excites the electrons in [[molecules]] of certain compounds and causes them to emit light of a lower energy, typically, but not necessarily, [[visible light]]. A complementary technique is [[absorption spectroscopy]].

Devices that measure [[fluorescence]] are called [[fluorometer]]s or fluorimeters.

==Theory==
{{main|Fluorescence in the life sciences|l1=Fluorescence}}

Molecules have various states referred to as [[energy levels]]. Fluorescence spectroscopy is primarily concerned with electronic and vibrational states. Generally, the species being examined has a [[Stationary state|ground electronic state]] (a low energy state) of interest, and an excited electronic state of higher energy. Within each of these electronic states are various vibrational states.

In fluorescence spectroscopy, the species is first excited, by absorbing a [[photon]], from its ground electronic state to one of the various vibrational states in the excited electronic state. Collisions with other molecules cause the excited molecule to lose vibrational energy until it reaches the lowest vibrational state of the excited electronic state.

The molecule then drops down to one of the various vibrational levels of the ground electronic state again, emitting a photon in the process. As molecules may drop down into any of several vibrational levels in the ground state, the emitted photons will have different energies, and thus frequencies. Therefore, by analysing the different frequencies of light emitted in fluorescent spectroscopy, along with their relative intensities, the structure of the different vibrational levels can be determined.

In a typical experiment, the different wavelengths of fluorescent light emitted by a sample are measured using a monochromator, holding the excitation light at a constant wavelength. This is called an ''emission spectrum''. An ''excitation spectrum'' is the opposite, whereby the emission light is held at a constant wavelength, and the excitation light is scanned through a many different wavelengths (via a monochromator). An ''Emission Map'' is measured by recording a number of different emission spectra created from different excitation wavelengths, and combining them all together.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Instruments Ltd, www.edinst.com&lt;/ref&gt; This is a three dimensional data set, intensity of emission as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths, and is typically depicted as a contour map.

== Instrumentation ==

[[Image:Spectrophotomer.JPG|right|thumb|260px|Schematic of a fluorometer with 90° geometry utilizing a Xe light source]]

Two general types of instruments exist:

*[[Filter fluorometer]]s use filters to isolate the [[wiktionary:incident|incident]] light and [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] light.
*[[Spectrofluorometer]]s use [[diffraction grating]] [[monochromator]]s to isolate the incident light and fluorescent light.

Both types utilize the following scheme: The light from an excitation source passes through a filter or monochromator, and strikes the sample. A proportion of the incident light is absorbed by the sample, and some of the molecules in the sample fluoresce. The fluorescent light is emitted in all directions. Some of this fluorescent light passes through a second filter or monochromator and reaches a detector, which is usually placed at 90° to the incident light beam to minimize the risk of transmitted or reflected incident light reaching the detector.

Various light sources may be used as excitation sources, including lasers, photodiodes, and lamps; [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon arcs]] and [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s in particular. A laser only emits light of high irradiance at a very narrow wavelength interval, typically under 0.01&amp;nbsp;nm, which makes an excitation monochromator or filter unnecessary. The disadvantage of this method is that the wavelength of a laser cannot be changed by much. A mercury vapor lamp is a line lamp, meaning it emits light near peak wavelengths. By contrast, a xenon arc has a continuous emission spectrum with nearly constant intensity in the range from 300-800&amp;nbsp;nm and a sufficient irradiance for measurements down to just above 200&amp;nbsp;nm.

Filters and/or monochromators may be used in fluorimeters. A monochromator transmits light of an adjustable wavelength with an adjustable tolerance. The most common type of monochromator utilizes a diffraction grating, that is, [[collimated]] light illuminates a grating and exits with a different angle depending on the wavelength. The monochromator can then be adjusted to select which wavelengths to transmit. For allowing anisotropy measurements the addition of two polarization filters are necessary: One after the excitation monochromator or filter, and one before the emission monochromator or filter.

As mentioned before, the fluorescence is most often measured at a 90° angle relative to the excitation light. This geometry is used instead of placing the sensor at the line of the excitation light at a 180° angle in order to avoid interference of the transmitted excitation light. No monochromator is perfect and it will transmit some [[stray light]], that is, light with other wavelengths than the targeted. An ideal monochromator would only transmit light in the specified range and have a high wavelength-independent transmission. When measuring at a 90 angle, only the light scattered by the sample causes stray light. This results in a better signal-to-noise ratio, and lowers the detection limit by approximately a factor 10000,&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, D. (1987). Fluorescence and Phosphorescence. Crown&lt;/ref&gt; when compared to the 180° geometry. Furthermore, the fluorescence can also be measured from the front, which is often done for turbid or opaque samples

The detector can either be single-channeled or multichanneled. The single-channeled detector can only detect the intensity of one wavelength at a time, while the multichanneled detects the intensity at all wavelengths simultaneously, making the emission monochromator or filter unnecessary. The different types of detectors have both advantages and disadvantages.

The most versatile fluorimeters with dual monochromators and a continuous excitation light source can record both an excitation spectrum and a fluorescence spectrum. When measuring fluorescence spectra, the wavelength of the excitation light is kept constant, preferably at a wavelength of high absorption, and the emission monochromator scans the spectrum. For measuring excitation spectra, the wavelength passing though the emission filter or monochromator is kept constant and the excitation monochromator is scanning. The excitation spectrum generally is identical to the absorption spectrum as the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the absorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma, A 1999&quot;&gt;Sharma, A. and Schulman, S. G. (1999). Introduction to Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Wiley interscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of data==
At low concentrations the [[fluorescence]] [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] will generally be proportional to the [[concentration]] of the [[fluorophore]].

Unlike in UV/visible spectroscopy, ‘standard’, device independent spectra are not easily attained. Several factors influence and distort the spectra, and corrections are necessary to attain ‘true’, i.e. machine-independent, spectra. The different types of distortions will here be classified as being either instrument- or sample-related. Firstly, the distortion arising from the instrument is discussed. As a start, the light source intensity and wavelength characteristics varies over time during each experiment and between each experiment. Furthermore, no lamp has a constant intensity at all wavelengths. To correct this, a beam splitter can be applied after the excitation monochromator or filter to direct a portion of the light to a reference detector.

Additionally, the transmission efficiency of monochromators and filters must be taken into account. These may also change over time. The transmission efficiency of the monochromator also varies depending on wavelength. This is the reason that an optional reference detector should be placed after the excitation monochromator or filter. The percentage of the fluorescence picked up by the detector is also dependent upon the system. Furthermore, the detector quantum efficiency, that is, the percentage of photons detected, varies between different detectors, with wavelength and with time, as the detector inevitably deteriorates.

Correction of all these instrumental factors for getting a ‘standard’ spectrum is a tedious process, which is only applied in practice when it is strictly necessary. This is the case when measuring the quantum yield or when finding the wavelength with the highest emission intensity for instance.

As mentioned earlier, distortions arise from the sample as well. Therefore some aspects of the sample must be taken into account too. Firstly, photodecomposition may decrease the intensity of fluorescence over time. Scattering of light must also be taken into account. The most significant types of scattering in this context are Rayleigh and Raman scattering. Light scattered by Rayleigh scattering has the same wavelength as the incident light, whereas in Raman scattering the scattered light changes wavelength usually to longer wavelengths. Raman scattering is the result of a virtual electronic state induced by the excitation light. From this [[Virtual State (physics)|virtual state]], the molecules may relax back to a vibrational level other than the vibrational ground state.&lt;ref&gt;Gauglitz, G. and Vo-Dinh, T. (2003). Handbook of spectroscopy.
Wiley-VCH.&lt;/ref&gt; In fluorescence spectra, it is always seen at a constant wavenumber difference relative to the excitation wavenumber e.g. the peak appears at a wavenumber 3600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1 &lt;/sup&gt; lower than the excitation light in water.

Other aspects to consider are the inner filter effects. These include reabsorption. Reabsorption happens because another molecule or part of a macromolecule absorbs at the wavelengths at which the fluorophore emits radiation. If this is the case, some or all of the photons emitted by the fluorophore may be absorbed again. Another inner filter effect occurs because of high concentrations of absorbing molecules, including the fluorophore. The result is that the intensity of the excitation light is not constant throughout the solution. Resultingly, only a small percentage of the excitation light reaches the fluorophores that are visible for the detection system. The inner filter effects change the spectrum and intensity of the emitted light and they must therefore be considered when analysing the emission spectrum of fluorescent light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma, A 1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakowicz, J. R. (1999). Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tryptophan Fluorescence==
The [[fluorescence]] of a [[folded protein]] is a mixture of the fluorescence from individual aromatic residues. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of [[tryptophan]] residues, with some emissions due to tyrosine and phenylalanine; but disulfide bonds also have appreciable absorption in this wavelength range. Typically, tryptophan has a wavelength of maximum absorption of 280&amp;nbsp;nm and an emission peak that is [[solvatochromic]], ranging from ca. 300 to 350&amp;nbsp;nm depending in the polarity of the local environment &lt;ref&gt;[http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C08/C08Links/pps99.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/projects/gmocz/fluor.htm Intrinsic Fluorescence of Proteins and Peptides]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, protein fluorescence may be used as a diagnostic of the conformational state of a protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11325713&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vivian JT, Callis PR | title = Mechanisms of tryptophan fluorescence shifts in proteins | journal = Biophys. J. | volume = 80 | issue = 5 | pages = 2093–109 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11325713 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76183-8| url = http://www.biophysj.org/cgi/content/abstract/80/5/2093 | pmc = 1301402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, tryptophan fluorescence is strongly influenced by the proximity of other residues (''i.e.'', nearby ''protonated'' groups such as Asp or Glu can cause [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] of Trp fluorescence). Also, energy transfer between tryptophan and the other fluorescent amino acids is possible, which would affect the analysis, especially in cases where the Förster acidic approach is taken.  In addition, tryptophan is a relatively rare amino acid; many proteins contain only one or a few tryptophan residues.  Therefore, tryptophan fluorescence can be a very sensitive measurement of the conformational state of individual tryptophan residues. The advantage compared to extrinsic probes is that the protein itself is not changed. The use of intrinsic fluorescence for the study of protein conformation is in practice limited to cases with few (or perhaps only one) tryptophan residues, since each experiences a different local environment, which gives rise to different emission spectra.

[[Tryptophan]] is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of microenvironment of the tryptophan. When performing experiments with denaturants, [[surfactant]]s or other [[amphiphilic]] molecules, the microenvironment of the tryptophan might change. For example, if a protein containing a single tryptophan in its 'hydrophobic' core is denatured with increasing temperature, a red-shift emission spectrum will appear. This is due to the exposure of the tryptophan to an aqueous environment as opposed to a hydrophobic protein interior. In contrast, the addition of a surfactant to a protein which contains a tryptophan which is exposed to the aqueous solvent will cause a blue shifted emission spectrum if the tryptophan is embedded in the surfactant [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] or [[micelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Caputo GA, London E. ''Cumulative effects of amino acid substitutions and hydrophobic mismatch upon the transmembrane stability and conformation of hydrophobic alpha-helices.''
Biochemistry. 2003 Mar 25;42(11):3275-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins that lack tryptophan may be coupled to a [[fluorophore]].

At 295&amp;nbsp;nm, the tryptophan emission spectrum is dominant over the weaker [[tyrosine]] and [[phenylalanine]] fluorescence.

==Applications==

Fluorescence spectrocopy is used in, among others, biochemical, medical, and chemical research fields for analyzing [[organic compound]]s. There has also been a report of its use in differentiating malignant, bashful skin tumors from benign.

Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (AFS) techniques are useful in other kinds of analysis/measurement of a compound present in air or water, or other media, such as [[CVAFS]] which is used for heavy metals detection, such as mercury.

Fluorescence can also be used to redirect photons, see [[fluorescent solar collector]].

[[Image:Fluorescent minerals hg.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Fluorescent minerals emitting visible light when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light]]

'''Fluorescence''' is the emission of electromagnetic radiation [[light]] by a substance that has absorbed radiation of a different [[wavelength]]. In most cases, absorption of light of a certain wavelength induces the emission of light with a longer wavelength (and lower energy).  However, under conditions in which intense radiation is being absorbed, it is possible for one electron to absorb two photons ([[Two-photon absorption|multiple photon absorption]]), which can lead to the emission of radiation having a smaller wavelength than the excitation source. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photons is due to thermal losses.  Dissipation of vibrational energy occurs on a much greater time scale than fluorescent emission. The most striking examples of this phenomenon occur when the absorbed photon is in the [[ultraviolet]] region of the spectrum, and is thus invisible, and the emitted light is in the visible region.  Practical applications of this effect are found in [[mineralogy]], [[gemology]], chemical sensors, [[fluorescent labelling]], [[dyes]], biological detectors etc. 

The term 'fluorescence' was coined by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] in his 1852 paper;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Change of Refrangibility of Light  |author=Stokes, G. G. |year=1852 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=142 |pages=463–562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the name was suggested &quot;to denote the general appearance of a solution of sulphate of quinine and similar media&quot;. (Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1853 143, 385-396, quote from page 387). The name itself was derived from the mineral [[fluorite]] (calcium difluoride), some examples of which contain traces of divalent europium, which serves as the fluorescent activator to provide a blue fluorescent emission.  The fluorite which provoked the observation originally, and which remains one of the most outstanding examples of the phenomenon, originated from the Weardale region, of northern England.

==Equations==
===Photochemistry===
Fluorescence occurs when an orbital [[electron]] of a molecule, atom or [[nanostructure]] relaxes to its [[ground state]] by emitting a [[photon]] of light after being excited to a higher quantum state by some type of energy:

Excitation: &lt;math&gt; S_0 + h \nu_{ex} \to S_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Fluorescence (emission): &lt;math&gt; S_1 \to S_0 + h \nu_{em} + heat &lt;/math&gt;
 
here &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; is a generic term for photon energy with h = [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; = [[frequency]] of light. (The specific frequencies of exciting and emitted light are dependent on the particular system.)

State S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is called the ground state of the [[fluorophore]] (fluorescent molecule) and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is its first (electronically) excited state.

A molecule in its excited state, S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, can relax by various competing pathways. It can undergo 'non-radiative relaxation' in which the excitation energy is dissipated as heat (vibrations) to the solvent. Excited organic molecules can also relax via conversion to a [[triplet state]] which may subsequently relax via [[phosphorescence]] or by a secondary non-radiative relaxation step.

Relaxation of an S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state can also occur through interaction with a second molecule through [[Quenching (fluorescence)|fluorescence quenching]]. Molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an extremely efficient quencher of fluorescence just because of its unusual triplet ground state.

Molecules that are excited through light absorption or via a different process (e.g. as the product of a reaction) can transfer energy to a second 'sensitized' molecule, which is converted to its excited state and can then fluoresce. This process is used in [[lightstick]]s to produce different colors.

===Quantum yield===
The fluorescence [[quantum yield]] gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.

: &lt;math&gt; \Phi = \frac {\textrm{Number\ of\ photons\ emitted}} {\textrm{Number\ of\ photons\ absorbed}} &lt;/math&gt;

The maximum fluorescence quantum yield is 1.0 (100%); every [[photon]] absorbed results in a photon emitted. Compounds with quantum yields of 0.10 are still considered quite fluorescent. Another way to define the quantum yield of fluorescence, is by the rates excited state decay:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{ { k}_{ f} }{ \sum_{i}{ k}_{i } } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{ k}_{ f}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of [[spontaneous emission]] of radiation and 

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i}{ k}_{i } &lt;/math&gt; 

is the sum of all rates of excited state decay. Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are therefore often called &quot;non-radiative rates&quot;, which can include:
dynamic collisional quenching, near-field dipole-dipole interaction (or [[resonance energy transfer]]), internal conversion and [[intersystem crossing]]. Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, this will affect both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield.

Fluorescence quantum yield are measured by comparison to a standard with known quantology; the [[quinine]] salt, quinine sulfate, in a sulfuric acid solution is a common fluorescence standard.

===Lifetime===
The fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the molecule stays in its excited state before emitting a photon. Fluorescence typically follows first-order kinetics:

:&lt;math&gt; \left[S 1 \right] = \left[S 1 \right]_0 e^{-\Gamma t} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\left[S 1 \right]&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of excited state molecules at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left[S 1 \right]_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial concentration and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the decay rate or the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime. This is an instance of [[exponential decay]]. Various radiative and non-radiative processes can de-populate the excited state. In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{tot}=\Gamma_{rad} + \Gamma_{nrad} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the total decay rate, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{rad}&lt;/math&gt; the radiative decay rate and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{nrad}&lt;/math&gt; the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates (a parallel kinetic model). If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short. For commonly used fluorescent compounds typical excited state decay times for fluorescent compounds that emit photons with energies from the [[UV]] to [[near infrared]] are within the range of 0.5 to 20 [[nanoseconds]]. The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]].

==Rules==
There are several [[rule of thumb|rules]] that deal with fluorescence. The [[Kasha's rule|Kasha–Vavilov rule]] dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation.

This is not always true and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.

The ''[[Jablonski diagram]]'' describes most of the relaxation mechanism for excited state molecules.

==Applications==
There are many natural and synthetic compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications.  Some deep-sea animals, such as the [[Greeneye]], use fluorescence.

===Lighting===
{{details|Fluorescent_light}}
[[Image:Www Beo cc.jpg|thumb|250px|Fluorescent paint and plastic lit by UV tubes. Artwork by Beo Beyond]]
The common [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tube]] relies on fluorescence. Inside the [[glass]] tube is a partial vacuum and a small amount of [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the ''[[phosphor]]'', which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent [[lighting]] is very energy-efficient compared to [[incandescent]] technology, but the uneven [[spectrum]] of traditional fluorescent lamps may cause certain colours to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent or day light.  The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254&amp;nbsp;nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436&amp;nbsp;nm (blue), 546&amp;nbsp;nm (green) and 579&amp;nbsp;nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes.  These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many [[compact fluorescent lamp]] and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.

[[Fluorescent lights]] were first available to the public at the [[1939 World's Fair]], and improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes such as [[compact fluorescent lamps]].  Some [[High-intensity_discharge_lamp#High-intensity_discharge_lamps|HID lamps]] coupled their even greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.  White [[light-emitting diode]]s became available in the mid 1990s as [[LED lamp]]s, in which blue light emitted from the [[semiconductor]] strikes phosphors deposited on the tiny chip. The combination of the blue light that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the phosphors produces a net emission of white light.

[[Lightstick|Glow sticks]] sometimes utilize fluorescent materials to absorb light from the [[chemiluminescence|chemiluminescent]] reaction and emit light of a different color.

===Analytical chemistry===
Many analytical procedures involve the use of a [[fluorometer]], usually with a single exciting wavelength and single detection wavelength.  Because of the sensitivity that the method affords, fluorescent molecule concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion can be measured.

Fluorescence in several wavelengths can be detected by an [[Chromatography detector|array detector]], to detect compounds from [[HPLC]] flow. Also, [[Thin layer chromatography|TLC]] plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. There is then a higher probability of lower energy atoms being excited and releasing photons, making analysis more efficient.

===Equipment===
{{main|Fluorescence spectroscopy}}
Usually the setup of a Fluorescence assay involves a Light source, which may emit an array different wavelengths of light.  Generally, a single wavelegth is required for proper analysis, so in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell.  After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may
emerge due to [[Stokes shift]] and various [[electron transitions]].  To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an Emission [[monochromator]], and observed selectively by a detector &lt;ref&gt;Harris, D. C. et al, Exploring Chemical Analysis 4th ed., New York, NY (c)2009 by W.H. Freeman and Company&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biochemistry and medicine===

{{main|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}
[[Image:FluorescentCells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Endothelial cells under the microscope with three separate channels marking specific cellular components]]
Fluorescence in the life sciences is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis biological molecules by means of the fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent (called intrinsic or [[autofluorescence]]). In fact, a [[protein]] or other component can be &quot;labelled&quot; with a extrinsic [[fluorophore]], a fluorescent [[dye]] which can be a small molecule, protein or quantum dot, finding a large use in many biological applications.&lt;ref&gt;Lakowicz, J.R., Principles of fluorescence spectroscopy. 3rd ed. 2006, New York: Springer. xxvi, 954 p.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/References/Molecular-Probes-The-Handbook/Introduction-to-Fluorescence-Techniques.html Invitrogen.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The quantification of a dye is done with a [[Spectrofluorometer]] and finds additional applications in:
* when scanning the fluorescent intensity across a plane one has [[fluorescence microscope|Fluorescence microscopy]] of tissues, cells or subcellular structures which is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample. Labeling multiple antibodies with different fluorophores allows visualization of multiple targets within a single image (multiple channels). DNA microarrays are a variant of this.
* Automated sequencing of [[DNA]] by the [[chain termination method]]; each of four different chain terminating bases has its own specific fluorescent tag. As the labeled DNA molecules are separated, the fluorescent label is excited by a UV source, and the identity of the base terminating the molecule is identified by the wavelength of the emitted light.
. Ethidium bromide fluoresces orange when [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalating]] [[DNA]] and when exposed to [[UV light]].
* FACS ([[fluorescent-activated cell sorting]]) 
* DNA detection: the compound [[ethidium bromide]], when free to change its conformation in solution, has very little fluorescence. Ethidium bromide's fluorescence is greatly enhanced when it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]]. Ethidium bromide may be carcinogenic - an arguably safer alternative is the dye [[SYBR Green]].
* Immunology: An antibody has a fluorescent chemical group attached, and the sites (e.g., on a microscopic specimen) where the antibody has bound can be seen, and even quantified, by the fluorescence.
Additionally [[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer]] used to study protein interactions, detect specific nucleic acid sequences and used as biosensors, while fluorescent lifetime can give an additional layer of information.

===Gemology, mineralogy, geology, and forensics===
[[Fingerprint]]s can be visualized with fluorescent compounds such as [[ninhydrin]].  Blood and other substances are sometimes detected by fluorescent reagents, particularly where their location was not previously known.

[[Gemstone]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[fiber]]s, and many other materials which may be encountered in [[Forensic science|forensics]] or with a relationship to various [[collectible]]s may have a distinctive fluorescence or may fluoresce differently under short-wave ultraviolet, long-wave ultra violet, or [[X-ray]]s.

Many types of [[calcite]] and [http://www.ambarazul.com/newsletter/april06 amber] will fluoresce under shortwave UV. [[Ruby|Rubies]], [[emerald]]s, and the [[Hope Diamond]] exhibit red fluorescence under short-wave UV light; diamonds also emit light under [[X ray]] radiation.

Fluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators.  In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission.  Furthermore, certain impurities such as iron or copper need to be absent, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent [[manganese]], in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of [[calcite]], the green fluorescence of [[willemite]], the yellow fluorescence of [[esperite]], and the orange fluorescence of [[wollastonite]] and [[clinohedrite]]. [[Hexavalent uranium]], in the form of the [[uranyl cation]], fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as [[autunite]] or [[andersonite]], and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of [[hyalite opal]].  [[Trivalent chromium]] at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of [[ruby corundum]].  Divalent [[europium]] is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral [[fluorite]]. [[Trivalent lanthanoids]] such as [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the [[yttrofluorite]] variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of [[zircon]]. [[Powellite]] ([[calcium molybdate]]) and [[scheelite]] (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively.  When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher energy [[tungsten]] to the lower energy [[molybdenum]], such that fairly low levels of [[molybdenum]] are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for [[scheelite]], instead of blue.  Low-iron [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.

Crude oil ([[petroleum]]) fluoresces in a range of colors, from dull brown for heavy oils and tars through to bright yellowish and bluish white for very light oils and condensates. This phenomenon is used in [[oil exploration]] drilling to identify very small amounts of oil in drill cuttings and core samples.

===Organic liquids===
Organic liquids such as mixtures of [[anthracene]] in [[benzene]], [[toluene]], or [[stilbene]] in the same [[solvent]]s, fluoresce with [[ultraviolet]] or [[gamma ray]] [[irradiation]]. The decay times of this fluorescence is of the order of nanoseconds since the duration of the light depends on the lifetime of the excited states of the fluorescent material, in this case anthracene or stilbene.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter aims to give you the skills to complete your A2 Computing project. Unlike the rest of the course this unit is entirely based on coursework submitted in May.  This is great because if you work hard enough then you can make sure you get some really good marks, you have access to the mark scheme after all![[Image:Waterfall_model.svg|thumb|The classic waterfall model]]
Your project involves making a '''complex programming project''' that will likely involve '''data processing''', and then writing a report about it.  You have to make a program for a '''real user''', this is very important, you can't just make them up.  It doesn't have to be incredibly complicated, but you need a degree of complexity in order to write a good report.  You can write a computer game but they can be an awful lot of work (2-3 years with a team of 40+ people for the latest console games) and it's often difficult to find a real life user and a real need.

Over the course of the project you will be creating a report.  This is really important and lots of people spend so much time coding that they forget to complete the write up.  The '''write up is worth nearly 70% of the mark''' and will take you through a [[w:Waterfall model|waterfall model]] of system development.  There are many [[w:Agile_software_development|other]] forms of system development out there and you might find yourself completing sections of the course not necessarily in the order given, the important thing is that you make it a cohesive whole and '''complete everything'''.

Please use the links below to get you started and note where all the marks are awarded, you might create a brilliant bit of code but if you don't complete your writeup your grade will suffer.

{{displaytitle|title=Practical Project: Picking a project}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

So now is time to start thinking about what sort of project you are going to make.  This is an important decision as this will drive the rest of this coursework.

Projects that I've marked in the past have included:
*Cricket Player Management System based on a database that keeps track of matches and player scores
*Database of children at a day care centre that deals with the billing for parents
*A computer room booking database that allowed teachers to book rooms for different days and see other teacher's timetables graphically
*A stock control database for a hardware shop that handles re-orders and sales
*A web-based maths revision site that allowed for random papers to be created then automatically marked
*An A-Level Maths revision maze game
*A French revision side scrolling adventure
*Physics projectile modeling tool
*A snake game where it asked you to eat the correct answers to maths questions
*A helicopter flying game that asked you economics questions to get extra fuel
*A computing revision program wrapped around a tetris clone
*A chess game that enforces all the rules of the game and recognises when it's check mate
*Phone based revision game for mathematics

You have probably noticed that there is a lot of talk about databases and data manipulation.  An easy way to tackle this project is to build a data processing system, i.e. a stock control system or a revision game, with a database in the back-end to store data.  This is a strong sort of project and a way to getting top marks. However, you don't have to do something like this.  If your code is complex enough then you don't have to store any data and the parts of the write up that talk about databases, you can skip. You might not be encouraged to make games, but if it is a game with a database or revision system behind it, or showing clever simulations of A-Level standard mathematics then you need to talk to your Computing teacher.

== What is Data Processing ==
[[Image:IBM Electronic Data Processing Machine - GPN-2000-001881.jpg|thumb|150px|Data processing will require a database or other datastore]]
Every system you make must involve data processing.  This means taking data and adding, updating, deleting, interpreting and displaying it.  This is very easy with a database, but you must get beyond the defaults of add, edit, delete, that something like Access gives you.  Think about using complex queries and fancy ways to present your results. It could also be an XML file storing seating plans or student records, editing/deleting/adding questions to a revision game and recording the scores of different users.  Whatever you do you must have data processing at the heart of it.

== How to pick a Complex problem ==
To get top marks the system has to be complex but what does that mean?  There are a few things that you need to do and a few more things you need to do to stand a chance to get top marks.  Try and plan to do as many of these as possible:
*Use classes and inheritance
*Use for loops and iteration
*Use recursion
*Use procedures and functions
*Use bubble sort / insertion sort / binary search
*Use linked lists / binary trees / stacks / other [[../../Problem Solving, Programming, Operating Systems, Databases and Networking/Programming Concepts#Abstract Data Types|Abstract Data Types]]
*Model things such as Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry or produce A-Level standard statistics
*Use a hand built database connection, DDL and complex queries.  NOT using wizards
*'''Don't produce a Database on its own, you'll need calculations to transform data'''!
{{ExerciseRobox|title=Warning!}}
Never create something in Access alone, you need to show real coding.  Even if Access would be a simpler solution this will not allow you to get marks for a complex project.  Always check with your teacher about complexity
{{Robox/Close}}

== Finding a Problem and a User ==
You probably have a few ideas running through your head already but you now need to find a user.  Users aren't necessarily going to find you so if you are a member of a local sports club, church, drama society etc. try and think how a data processing system could help them out.  For example, you could keep track of the members of a choir, which sessions they attended and whether they have paid their subscription.  If you know someone who runs a small business could you write a system to keep track of when staff were on duty, how much stock they have, how many sales they make? Is there an area in your school / college that could be improved?  Ask your teachers, maybe they still need to write reports manually, maybe they would want a revision tool for their subject, maybe they would like web based system to book out rooms, maybe they want a program writing that could simulate projectile motion to demonstrate something in class.  Once you have found your user keep hold of them, they are going to be key to you completing every part of this project.

==Workable projects?==
Do the following sound complex enough?  If not, how would you make them complex?  Remember to check with your teacher about complexity.
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| A database of shop sales that allows people to update stock and add new stock items. &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Probably not complex enough!  If this is built around an Access Created database with wizards used to make all the forms and run the update queries it definitely won't be.  You might get away with it by building it in mySQL with a web front end, but you should still be looking to include some of the more complex topics such as displaying graphs and statistical data on sales.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| An online revision site allowing students to log in and sit randomly made maths tests &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This sounds reasonably complex, if you were planning on scripting the whole thing yourself in ASPX or PHP and not using a package such as Wordpress.  You might want to throw in some nice features such as a messaging and mailing system.  You might also want to get the program to create dynamic visual displays of the random questions being asked, such as creating triangles of the dimensions being tested.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| A 2D F1 racing game &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This sounds very complex, especially if you try and think about collision detection, AI etc.  However, who is your user?  You need a real life user, could you ask you Physics teacher to come up with a scenario to simulate?
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| A Four in a Row game &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This sounds very complex with the graphical representation and AI element, but again, who is your user?  Could you make this for a primary school?
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| 3D shooter &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Too complex, unless you want to write some code around something like Blender or the Unreal Engine.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| A photo album database &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not complex enough as it is currently written.  You could certainly add features like placing it online and allowing for tagging of photos.  Make sure you check with your teacher.
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

== How will you solve the problem? ==
Once you have a user and a problem how are you going to solve it?  You aren't a multibillion pound IT firm and you probably don't have much more than a years programming experience.  You have got to be realistic about how you are going to solve this problem.  Here are a couple of questions you need to start thinking about, write down your answers

*What languages do you already know? What languages and skills do you need to learn?
*Is it going to be web, phone or desktop application based?
*Will you use a relational database or flat file data structure, or nothing at all?
*Do you know how to normalise data tables or read from text/XML files?
*Do you have enough time to do what you want to?
*Is it complex enough to get you top marks?

== Next Steps ==

Write all of this down somewhere, it's going to come in useful for your [[../Analysis/]]!

'''Fluorine-19 NMR''' (for [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]) is an analytical technique. [[Fluorine-19|&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F]] has a spin of 1/2, and a relative abundance of 100 %, making measurements very fast (comparable with [[1H NMR|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR]]). Integrals are reliable due to the lack of a [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] (fluorine forms one bond only). Fluorine-containing compounds are occasionally encountered in organic chemistry (fluorinated compounds are popular in pharmaceutical applications), and in inorganic chemistry (e.g. the [[trifluoroacetate]] anion or counter-ligand).

The reference compound for &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F is [[Trichlorofluoromethane|CFCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Hebrew University]] | author = Roy Hoffman | year = 2007 | title = &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Fluorine NMR | url = http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/nmr/techniques/1d/row2/f.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fluorogenic''' refers to a process in which fluorescence is generated.  The term is generally used in the context of analytical assays, where a chemical reaction dependent on the presence of a particular analyte produces fluorescent molecules.  By using a spectrophotometer, the amount of fluorescence (and indirectly, the amount of analyte) can be quantitated.  Fluorogenic methods are typically several orders of magnitude more sensitive than the older chromogenic methods.  Chromogenic is the term for the generation of color, rather than fluorescence.

'''Förster resonance energy transfer''' (abbreviated '''FRET'''), also known as '''fluorescence resonance energy transfer''', '''resonance energy transfer''' ('''RET''') or '''electronic energy transfer''' ('''EET'''), is a mechanism describing energy transfer between two [[chromophore]]s.

A donor chromophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore (in proximity, typically less than 10&amp;nbsp;nm) through nonradiative [[dipole]]–dipole coupling. This mechanism is termed &quot;Förster resonance energy transfer&quot; and is named after the German scientist [[Theodor Förster]].&lt;ref&gt;Förster T., Zwischenmolekulare Energiewanderung und Fluoreszenz, ''Ann. Physik'' '''1948''', ''437'', 55. {{DOI|10.1002/andp.19484370105}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both chromophores are fluorescent, the term &quot;fluorescence resonance energy transfer&quot; is often used instead, although the energy is not actually transferred by [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph R. Lakowicz, &quot;Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy&quot;, Plenum Publishing Corporation, 2nd edition (July 1, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympusfluoview.com/applications/fretintro.html FRET microscopy tutorial from Olympus]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid an erroneous interpretation of the phenomenon that (even when occurring between two fluorescent chromophores) is always a nonradiative transfer of energy, the name &quot;Förster resonance energy transfer&quot; is preferred to &quot;fluorescence resonance energy transfer&quot; – although the latter enjoys common usage in scientific literature. FRET is analogous to [[Near Field Communication|near field communication]], in that the radius of interaction is much smaller than the [[Light|wavelength]] of light emitted. In the [[near field]] region, the excited chromophore emits a virtual [[photon]] that is instantly absorbed by a receiving chromophore. These virtual photons are undetectable, since their existence violates the conservation of energy and momentum, and hence FRET is known as a ''radiationless'' mechanism. From [[quantum electrodynamics|quantum electrodynamical]] calculations, it is determined that radiationless (FRET) and [[radiative transfer|radiative energy transfer]] are the short- and long-range [[asymptote]]s of a single unified mechanism.&lt;ref&gt; D. L. Andrews, &quot;A unified theory of radiative and radiationless molecular energy transfer&quot;, ''Chem. Phys.'' '''1989''', 135, 195-201. {{DOI|10.1016/0301-0104(89)87019-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Andrews and D. S. Bradshaw, &quot;Virtual photons, dipole fields and energy transfer: A quantum electrodynamical approach&quot;, ''[[European Journal of Physics|Eur. J. Phys.]]'' '''2004''', 25, 845-858. {{DOI|10.1088/0143-0807/25/6/017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==
The FRET efficiency (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;) is the [[quantum yield]] of the energy transfer transition, ''i.e.'' the fraction of energy transfer event occurring per donor excitation event:

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{k_{ET}}{k_f+k_{ET}+\sum{k_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_{ET}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of energy transfer, &lt;math&gt;k_{f}&lt;/math&gt; the radiative decay rate and the &lt;math&gt;k_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are the rate constants of any other de-excitation pathway.

The FRET efficiency depends on many parameters that can be grouped as follows:
* The distance between the donor and the acceptor
* The spectral overlap of the donor [[emission spectrum]] and the acceptor [[absorption spectrum]].
* The relative orientation of the donor emission dipole moment and the acceptor absorption dipole moment.

&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; depends on the donor-to-acceptor separation distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with an inverse 6th power law due to the dipole-dipole coupling mechanism:
: &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{1+(r/R_0)^6}\!&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; being the Förster distance of this pair of donor and acceptor, i.e. the distance at which the energy transfer efficiency is 50%.
The Förster distance depends on the overlap [[integral]] of the donor emission spectrum with the acceptor absorption spectrum and their mutual molecular orientation as expressed by the following equation:
: &lt;math&gt; {R_0}^6 = \frac{9\,Q_0 \,(\ln 10) \kappa^2 \, J}{128 \, \pi^5 \,n^4 \, N_A} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is the fluorescence [[quantum yield]] of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; is the dipole orientation factor, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium, &lt;math&gt;N_A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Avogadro's number]], and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral overlap integral calculated as
: &lt;math&gt; J = \int f_{\rm D}(\lambda) \, \epsilon_{\rm A}(\lambda) \, \lambda^4 \, d\lambda &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized donor emission spectrum, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceptor [[molar extinction coefficient]].
''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =2/3 is often assumed. This value is obtained when both dyes are freely rotating and can be considered to be isotropically oriented during the excited state lifetime. If either dye is fixed or not free to rotate, then ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =2/3 will not be a valid assumption. In most cases, however, even modest reorientation of the dyes results in enough orientational averaging that ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2/3 does not result in a large error in the estimated energy transfer distance due to the sixth power dependence of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Even when ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is quite different from 2/3 the error can be associated with a shift in ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and thus determinations of changes in relative distance for a particular system are still valid. Fluorescent proteins do not reorient on a timescale that is faster than their fluorescence lifetime. In this case 0 ≤ ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 4.

The FRET efficiency relates to the quantum yield and the fluorescence lifetime of the donor molecule as follows:
: &lt;math&gt; E = 1 - {\tau'_{\rm D}}/{\tau_{\rm D}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau'_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; are the donor fluorescence lifetimes in the presence and absence of an acceptor, respectively, or as
: &lt;math&gt; E = 1 - {F'_{\rm D}}/{F_{\rm D}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F'_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{\rm D}&lt;/math&gt; are the donor fluorescence intensities with and without an acceptor, respectively.

==Methods==
[[File:FRET.PNG|frame|right|Example of FRET between CFP and YFP (Wavelength vs. Absorption): a [[Genetic engineering|fusion protein]] containing CFP and YFP excited at 440nm wavelength. The fluorescent emission peak of CFP overlaps the excitation peak of YFP. Because the two proteins are adjacent to each other, the energy transfer is significant–a large proportion of the energy from CFP is transferred to YFP and creates a much larger YFP emission peak. ]]
In fluorescence [[microscopy]], fluorescence [[confocal laser scanning microscopy]], as well as in [[molecular biology]], FRET is a useful tool to quantify molecular dynamics in [[biophysics]] and [[biochemistry]], such as [[protein]]-protein interactions, protein-[[DNA]] interactions, and protein conformational changes. For monitoring the complex formation between two molecules, one of them is labeled with a donor and the other with an acceptor, and these [[fluorophore]]-labeled molecules are mixed. When they are dissociated, the donor emission is detected upon the donor excitation. On the other hand, when the donor and acceptor are in proximity (1-10&amp;nbsp;nm) due to the interaction of the two molecules, the acceptor emission is predominantly observed because of the [[intermolecular]] FRET from the donor to the acceptor. For monitoring protein conformational changes, the target protein is labeled with a donor and an acceptor at two loci. When a twist or bend of the protein brings the change in the distance or relative orientation of the donor and acceptor, FRET change is observed. If a molecular interaction or a protein conformational change is dependent on [[ligand]] binding, this FRET technique is applicable to fluorescent indicators for the ligand detection.

FRET studies are scalable: the extent of energy transfer is often quantified from the milliliter scale of cuvette-based experiments to the femtoliter scale of microscopy-based experiments. This quantification can be based directly (sensitized emission method) on detecting two emission channels under two different excitation conditions (primarily donor and primarily acceptor). However, for robustness reasons, FRET quantification is most often based on measuring changes in fluorescence intensity or fluorescence lifetime upon changing the experimental conditions (e.g. a microscope image of donor emission is taken with the acceptor being present. The acceptor is then bleached, such that it is incapable of accepting energy transfer and another donor emission image is acquired. A pixel-based quantification using the second equation in the theory section above is then possible.) An alternative way of temporarily deactivating the acceptor is based on its fluorescence saturation.
Exploiting polarisation characteristics of light, a FRET quantification is also possible with only a single camera exposure.

===CFP-YFP pairs===
The most popular FRET pair for biological use is a [[cyan fluorescent protein]] ('''CFP''') - [[yellow fluorescent protein]] ('''YFP''') pair. Both are color variants of [[green fluorescent protein]] ('''GFP'''). While labeling with organic fluorescent dyes requires troublesome processes of purification, chemical modification, and intracellular injection of a host protein, GFP variants can be easily attached to a host protein by [[genetic engineering]]. By virtue of GFP variants, the use of FRET techniques for biological research is becoming more and more popular.

===BRET===
A limitation of FRET is the requirement for external illumination to initiate the fluorescence transfer, which can lead to background noise in the results from direct excitation of the acceptor or to [[photobleaching]]. To avoid this drawback, [[Bioluminescence]] Resonance Energy Transfer (or '''BRET''') has been developed. This technique uses a bioluminescent [[luciferase]] (typically the luciferase from ''[[Renilla reniformis]]'') rather than CFP to produce an initial photon emission compatible with YFP.

FRET and BRET are also the common tools in the study of [[Kinetics|biochemical reaction kinetics]] and [[molecular motors]].

===Photobleaching FRET===
FRET efficiencies can also be inferred from the [[photobleaching]] rates of the donor in the presence and absence of an acceptor. This method can be performed on most fluorescence microscopes; one simply shines the excitation light (of a frequency that will excite the donor but not the acceptor significantly) on specimens with and without the acceptor fluorophore and monitors the donor fluorescence (typically separated from acceptor fluorescence using a bandpass filter) over time. The timescale is that of photobleaching, which is seconds to minutes, with fluorescence in each curve being given by

&lt;math&gt;(\mbox{background})+(\mbox{constant})*e^{-(\mbox{time})/{\tau_{\rm pb}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\tau_{\rm pb}}&lt;/math&gt; is the photobleaching decay time constant and depends on whether the acceptor is present or not. Since photobleaching consists in the permanent inactivation of excited fluorophores, resonance energy transfer from an excited donor to an acceptor fluorophore prevents the photobleaching of that donor fluorophore, and thus high FRET efficiency leads to a longer photobleaching decay time constant:

&lt;math&gt; E = 1 - {\tau_{\rm pb}}/{\tau'_{\rm pb}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\tau'_{\rm pb}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\tau_{\rm pb}}&lt;/math&gt; are the photobleaching decay time constants of the donor in the presence and in the absence of the acceptor, respectively.
(Notice that the fraction is the reciprocal of that used for lifetime measurements).

This technique was introduced by Jovin in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Jovin, T.M. and Arndt-Jovin, D.J. FRET microscopy: Digital imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Application in cell biology. In Cell Structure and Function by Microspectrofluometry, E. Kohen, J. G. Hirschberg and J. S. Ploem. London: Academic Press, 1989. pp. 99-117.&lt;/ref&gt; Its use of an entire curve of points to extract the time constants can give it accuracy advantages over the other methods. Also, the fact that time measurements are over seconds rather than nanoseconds makes it easier than fluorescence lifetime measurements, and because photobleaching decay rates do not generally depend on donor concentration (unless acceptor saturation is an issue), the careful control of concentrations needed for intensity measurements is not needed. It is, however, important to keep the illumination the same for the with- and without-acceptor measurements, as photobleaching increases markedly with more intense incident light.

===Other methods===
A different, but related, mechanism is [[Dexter Electron Transfer]].

An alternative method to detecting protein-protein proximity is the [[bimolecular fluorescence complementation]] (BiFC) where two halves of a YFP are fused to a protein. When these two halves meet they form a fluorophore after about 60 s - 1 hr.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11983170&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hu CD, Chinenov Y, Kerppola TK |title=Visualization of interactions among bZIP and Rel family proteins in living cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation |journal=Mol. Cell |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=789–98 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11983170 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
FRET has been applied in an experimental method for the detection of [[phosgene]]. In it, phosgene or rather [[triphosgene]] as a safe substitute serves as a linker between an acceptor and a donor [[coumarine]] (forming [[urea]] groups).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17356768&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhang H, Rudkevich DM |title=A FRET approach to phosgene detection |journal=Chem.

'''Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry''', also known as '''Fourier transform mass spectrometry''', is a type of mass analyzer (or [[mass spectrometer]]) for determining the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] (m/z) of [[ions]] based on the [[ion cyclotron resonance|cyclotron frequency]] of the ions in a fixed magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=9768511 Marshall, A. G.; Hendrickson, C. L.; Jackson, G. S., Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry: a primer. ''Mass Spectrom Rev'' '''17''', 1-35.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ions are trapped in a [[Penning trap]] (a magnetic field with electric trapping plates) where they are excited to a larger cyclotron radius by an oscillating electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field. The excitation also results in the ions moving in phase (in a packet). The signal is detected as an image current on a pair of plates which the packet of ions passes close to as they cyclotron. The resulting signal is called a [[free induction decay]] (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of [[sine waves]]. The useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a [[Fourier transform]] to give a [[mass spectrum]]. 

Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is a very high resolution technique in that masses can be determined with very high accuracy. Many applications of FTICR-MS use this mass accuracy to help determine the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. This is possible due to the [[mass defect]] of the elements. FT-ICR MS is able to achieve higher levels of resolution than other forms of mass spectrometry, in part, because a superconducting magnet is much more stable than rf voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(99)00226-2 | title = Comparison and interconversion of the two most common frequency-to-mass calibration functions for Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry | year = 2000 | last1 = Shi | first1 = S | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 195-196 | pages = 591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another place that FTICR-MS is useful is in dealing with complex mixtures since the resolution (narrow peak width) allows the signals of two ions of similar mass to charge (''m/z'') to be detected as distinct ions.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15694769&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sleno L, Volmer DA, Marshall AG |title=Assigning product ions from complex MS/MS spectra: the importance of mass uncertainty and resolving power |journal=[[J.

Because the isotopic peaks are close to each other on the ''m/z'' axis, due to the multiple charges, the high resolving power of the FTICR is extremely useful.

FTICR-MS differs significantly from other [[mass spectrometry]] techniques in that the ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an [[electron multiplier]] but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the cyclotron (rotational) frequency that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with [[sector instrument]]s or at different times as with [[time-of-flight]] instruments but all ions are detected simultaneously over some given period of time.  In FT-ICR MS, resolution can be improved by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) and by increasing the magnet's bore diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(01)00588-7 | title = Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance detection: principles and experimental configurations | year = 2002 | last1 = Marshall | first1 = A | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 215 | pages = 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FT-ICR was invented by [[Alan G. Marshall]] and Melvin B. Comisarow&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.chem.ubc.ca/personnel/faculty/comisarow/ |title=UBC Chemistry Personnel: Melvin B. Comisarow |accessdate=2009-11-05 |publisher=University of British Columbia }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of British Columbia]]. The first paper appeared in [[Chemical Physics Letters]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2614(74)89137-2 M.B. Comisarow and A.G. Marshall, ''Chem. Phys. Lett.'' '''25''', 282 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration was earlier developments in conventional ICR and Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy. Marshall has continued to develop the technique at [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] and [[Florida State University]].

==Theory==
[[Image:LTQ-FTICR.jpg|thumb|250px|Linear ion trap - Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (panels around magnet are missing).]]
The physics of FTICR is similar to that of a [[cyclotron]] at least in the first approximation.

In the simplest form (idealized) the relationship between the cyclotron frequency and the mass to charge ratio is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' = cyclotron frequency, ''q'' = ion charge, ''B'' = [[magnetic field strength]] and ''m'' = ion mass.

This is more often represented in [[angular frequency]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega _c = \frac{qB}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega _c&lt;/math&gt; is the angular cyclotron frequency which is related to frequency by the definition &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the quadrupolar electrical field used to trap the ions in the axial direction this relationship is only approximate. The axial electrical trapping results in axial oscillations within the trap with the (angular) frequency:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega _t = \sqrt{{\frac{q\alpha}{m}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant similar to the spring constant of a [[harmonic oscillator]] and is dependent on voltage and the trap dimensions and geometry.

The electric field and the resulting axial harmonic motion reduces the cyclotron frequency and introduces a second radial motion called magnetron motion that occurs at the magnetron frequency. The cyclotron motion is still the frequency being used but the relationship above is not exact due to this phenomenon. The natural angular frequencies of motion are:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega _\pm = \frac{\omega _c}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left({\frac{\omega _c}{2}}\right)^2-\left({\frac{\omega _t}{2}}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- One of the superscript &quot;2&quot;s is inside the parentheses and the other is outside.  Is that right?  OK, now I've changed it. --&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega _t&lt;/math&gt; is the axial trapping frequency due the axial electrical trapping and &lt;math&gt;\omega _+&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced cyclotron (angular) frequency and &lt;math&gt;\omega _-&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetron (angular) frequency. Again &lt;math&gt;\omega _+&lt;/math&gt; is what is typically measured in FTICR. The meaning of this equation can be understood qualitatively by considering the case where  &lt;math&gt;\omega _t&lt;/math&gt; is small, which is generally true. In that case the value of the radical is just slightly less than &lt;math&gt;\omega_c/2&lt;/math&gt; and the value of &lt;math&gt;\omega _+&lt;/math&gt; is just slightly less than &lt;math&gt;\omega_c&lt;/math&gt; (the cyclotron frequency has been slightly reduced). For &lt;math&gt;\omega_-&lt;/math&gt; the value of the radical is the same (slightly less than &lt;math&gt;\omega_c/2&lt;/math&gt;) but it is being subtracted from &lt;math&gt;\omega _c/2&lt;/math&gt; resulting in a small number equal to &lt;math&gt;\omega _c -\omega _+&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the exact amount that the cyclotron frequency was reduced by).

==ICR cell types==
[[Image:ICR Cell.jpg|thumb|250px|A cylindrical ICR cell. The walls of the cell are made of copper, and ions enter the cell from the right, transmitted by the octopole ion guides.]]
A review of different cell geometries with their specific electric configurations is available in the literature &lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-1176(95)04190-V S. Guan, A. G. Marshall, Int. J. Mass Spectrom., 146/147 (1995) 261]&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, ICR cells can belong to one of the following two categories.


===Closed cells===

Several closed ICR cells with different geometries were fabricated and their performance has been characterized. Grids were used as end caps to apply an axial electric field for trapping ions axially (parallel to the magnetic field lines). Ions can be either generated inside the cell (by Electron impact ionization) or can be enjected to the cell from an external ionization source (such as Electrospray or MALDI). Nested ICR cells with double pair of grids were also fabricated to trap both positive and negative ions simultaneously.

===Open cells===
The most common geometry is a cylinder, which is axially segmented into different parts to produce different ring electrodes. The central ring electrode is generally used for applying radial excitation electric field and detection. DC electric voltage is applied on the terminal ring electrodes to trap ions along the magnetic field lines. Open cylindrical cells with ring electrodes of different diameters have also been designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.2751100 | title = Characterization of a new open cylindrical ion cyclotron resonance cell with unusual geometry | year = 2007 | last1 = Kanawati | first1 = B. | first2 = K. P. | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 78 | pages = 074102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They proved not only capable in trapping and detecting both ion polarities simultaneously, but also they succeeded to separate positive from negative ions radially. This presented a large discrimination in kinetic ion acceleration between positive and negative ions trapped simultaneously inside the new cell. Several ion axial acceleration schemes were recently written for ion-ion collision studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ijms.2007.09.007 | title = Characterization of a new open cylindrical ICR cell for ion–ion collision studies☆ | year = 2008 | last1 = Kanawati | first1 = B | first2 = K | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 269 | pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stored waveform inverse Fourier transform ==
Stored waveform inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) is a method for the creation of excitation waveforms for FTMS.&lt;ref name=Cody1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cody | first =  R. B. | year = 1987 | title = Stored waveform inverse fourier transform excitation for obtaining increased parent ion selectivity in collisionally activated dissociation: Preliminary results | journal = [[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry]] | volume = 1 | pages = 99 | doi = 10.1002/rcm.1290010607 | first2 = R. E. | first3 = S. D. | first4 = Alan G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time-domain excitation waveform is formed from  the inverse Fourier transform of the appropriate frequency-domain excitation spectrum, which is chosen to excite the resonance frequencies of selected ions. The SWIFT procedure can be used to select ions for [[tandem mass spectrometry]] experiments.

[[Image:Spectrum of blue sky.png|thumb|right|320px|Spectrum of a blue sky somewhat close to the horizon pointing east at around 3 or 4 pm on a clear day.]]

In [[physics]] and [[optics]], the '''Fraunhofer lines''' are a set of [[spectral line]]s named for the German physicist [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] (1787–1826). The lines were originally observed as dark features ([[absorption line]]s) in the [[optical spectrum]] of the [[Sun]].

The English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] was in 1802 the first person to note the appearance of a number of dark features in the solar spectrum. In 1814, Fraunhofer independently rediscovered the lines and began a systematic study and careful measurement of the [[wavelength]] of these features. In all, he mapped over 570 lines, and designated the principal features with the letters A through K, and weaker lines with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was later discovered by [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]] that each [[chemical element]] was associated with a set of spectral lines, and deduced that the dark lines in the solar spectrum were caused by [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] by those elements in the upper layers of the Sun. Some of the observed features are also caused by absorption in [[oxygen]] molecules in the [[Earth's atmosphere]].

The major Fraunhofer lines, and the elements they are associated with, are shown in the following table:

The Fraunhofer C, F, G', and h lines correspond to the alpha, beta, gamma and delta lines of the [[Balmer series]] of [[emission line]]s of the hydrogen atom. The D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lines form the well-known &quot;sodium doublet&quot;, the centre wavelength of which (589.29&amp;nbsp;nm) is given the designation letter &quot;D&quot;. This historical designation for this line has stuck and is given to the all the transitions between the ground state and the first excited state of the other alkali atoms as well.  The D1 and D2 lines correspond to the fine splitting of the excited stated.  This may be confusing because the excited state for this transition is the P-state of the alkali and should not be confused with the higher D-states.

Note that there is disagreement in the literature for some line designations; e.g., the Fraunhofer d-line may refer to the [[cyan]] iron line at 466.814&amp;nbsp;nm, or alternatively to the [[yellow]] helium line (also labeled D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at 587.5618&amp;nbsp;nm. Similarly, there is ambiguity with reference to the e-line, since it can refer to the spectral lines of both iron (Fe) and mercury (Hg). In order to resolve ambiguities that arise in usage, ambiguous Fraunhofer line designations are preceded by the element with which they are associated (e.g., Mercury e-line and Helium d-line).

Because of their well defined wavelengths, Fraunhofer lines are often used to characterize the [[refractive index]] and [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of optical materials.

In [[Nuclear magnetic resonance#Fourier spectroscopy|Fourier Transform NMR]], a '''free induction decay''' (FID) is the observable NMR signal generated by non-equilibrium nuclear spin magnetisation [[Larmor precession|precessing]] about the [[magnetic field]] (conventionally along z).
This non-equilibrium magnetisation is generally created by applying a pulse of [[Resonance|resonant]] radio-frequency close to the [[Larmor equation|Larmor frequency]] of the [[nuclear spin]]s.

If the magnetisation [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] has a non-zero component in the xy plane, then the precessing magnetisation will [[Electromagnetic induction|induce]] a corresponding oscillating voltage in a detection coil surrounding the sample.  This time-domain signal is typically [[Digitized|digitised]] and then [[Fourier Transform|Fourier transformed]] in order to obtain a frequency spectrum of the NMR signal i.e. the NMR [[spectrum]].

The duration of the NMR signal is ultimately limited by [[Relaxation (NMR)|T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation]], but mutual [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of the different NMR frequencies present also causes the signal to be damped more quickly.  
When NMR frequencies are well-resolved, as is typically the case in the NMR of samples in solution, the overall decay of the FID is relaxation-limited and the FID is approximately exponential (with a time constant T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or more accurately T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;).  FID durations will then be of the order of seconds for nuclei such as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.  If NMR lineshapes are not relaxation-limited (as is commonly the case in [[solid-state NMR]]), then the NMR signal will generally decay much more quickly e.g. microseconds for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR.

Particularly if a limited number of frequency components are present, the FID may be analysed  directly for quantitative determinations of physical properties, such as hydrogen content in aviation fuel, solid and liquid ratio in dairy products ([[Time-Domain NMR]]).

[[Image:Gammaspektrum Uranerz.jpg|thumb|The gamma-ray spectrum of natural [[uranium]], showing about a dozen discrete lines superimposed on a smooth continuum, allows the identification the [[nuclide]]s &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;[[Radium|Ra]], &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;[[Lead|Pb]], and &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;[[Bismuth|Bi]] of the uranium [[decay chain]].]]
'''Gamma-ray spectroscopy''' is the quantitative study of the energy spectra of gamma-ray sources, both nuclear laboratory, geochemical, and astrophysical.  Gamma rays are the highest-energy form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], being physically exactly like all other forms (e.g., X rays, visible light, infrared, radio) except for higher [[photon]] energy and frequency, and shorter wavelength.  (Because of their high energy, gamma-ray photons are generally counted individually, whereas the lowest energy forms of EM radiation (e.g., radio to sub-millimeter) are observed as electromagnetic waves comprised of many low-energy photons.) While a [[Geiger counter]] determines only the count rate (i.e. the number of gamma rays interacting in the detector in one second), a gamma-ray spectrometer also determines the energies of the [[gamma-ray]]s photons emitted by the source.  Radioactive nuclei ([[radionuclides]]) commonly emit gamma rays in the energy range from a few keV to ~10 MeV, corresponding to the typical energy levels in nuclei with reasonably long lifetimes.  Such sources typically produce gamma-ray &quot;line spectra&quot; (i.e., many [[photon]]s emitted at discrete energies), whereas much higher energies (upwards of 1 [[TeV]]) may occur in the continuum spectra observed in astrophysics and elementary particle physics.  The boundary between gamma rays and X rays is somewhat blurred, as X rays typically refer to the high energy [[electromagnetic|EM]] emission of atoms, which may extend to over 100 keV, whereas the lowest energy emissions of nuclei are typically termed gamma rays, even though their energies may be below 20 keV.

Most radioactive sources produce gamma rays of various energies and intensities. When these emissions are collected and analyzed with a gamma-ray spectroscopy system, a gamma-ray energy spectrum can be produced. A detailed analysis of this spectrum is typically used to determine the identity and quantity of gamma emitters present in the source. The gamma spectrum is characteristic of the gamma-emitting [[nuclide]]s contained in the source, just as in [[optical spectroscopy]], the optical spectrum is characteristic of the atoms and molecules contained in the sample.

The equipment used in gamma spectroscopy includes an energy-sensitive radiation detector, a pulse sorter (i.e., multichannel analyzer), and associated amplifiers and [[data acquisition|data readout]] devices. The most common detectors include [[scintillator|sodium iodide (NaI)]] [[scintillation counter]]s and high-purity [[germanium]] detectors.

==System components==
A gamma spectroscopy system consists of a detector, electronics to collect and process the signals produced by the detector, and a computer with processing software to generate, display, and store the spectrum. Other components, such as rate meters and peak position stabilizers, may also be included.

Gamma spectroscopy detectors are passive materials that wait for a gamma interaction to occur in the detector volume. The most important interaction mechanisms are the [[photoelectric effect]], the [[Compton effect]], and [[pair creation|pair production]]. The photoelectric effect is preferred, as it absorbs all of the energy of the incident gamma ray. Full energy absorption is also possible when a series of these interaction mechanisms take place within the detector volume. When a gamma ray undergoes a Compton interaction or pair production, and a portion of the energy escapes from the detector volume without being absorbed, the background rate in the spectrum is increased by one count. This count will appear in a channel below the channel that corresponds to the full energy of the gamma ray. Larger detector volumes reduce this effect.

The voltage pulse produced by the detector (or by the [[photomultiplier]] in a scintillation detector) is shaped by a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The multichannel analyzer takes the very small voltage signal produced by the detector, reshapes it into a [[Gaussian]] or [[trapezoidal]] shape, and converts that signal into a digital signal. In some systems, the [[analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital conversion]] is performed before the peak is reshaped. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) also sorts the pulses by their height. ADCs have specific numbers of &quot;bins&quot; into which the pulses can be sorted; these bins represent the ''channels'' in the spectrum. The number of channels can be changed in most modern gamma spectroscopy systems by modifying software or hardware settings. The number of channels is typically a power of two; common values include 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384 channels. The choice of number of channels depends on the resolution of the system and the energy range being studied.

The multichannel analyzer output is sent to a computer, which stores, displays, and analyzes the data. A variety of software packages are available from several manufacturers, and generally include spectrum analysis tools such as energy calibration, peak area and net area calculation, and resolution calculation.

==Detector performance==
Gamma spectroscopy systems are selected to take advantage of several performance characteristics.  Two of the most important include detector resolution and detector efficiency.

===Detector resolution ===
Gamma rays detected in a spectroscopic system produce peaks in the spectrum. These peaks can also be called ''lines'' by analogy to optical spectroscopy. The width of the peaks is determined by the resolution of the detector, a very important characteristic of gamma spectroscopic detectors.  Resolution is analogous to [[resolving power]] in optical spectroscopy. High resolution enables the spectroscopist to separate two gamma lines that are close to each other. Gamma spectroscopy systems are designed and adjusted to produce symmetrical peaks of the best possible resolution. The peak shape is usually a [[Gaussian distribution]]. In most spectra the horizontal position of the peak is determined by the gamma ray's energy, and the area of the peak is determined by the intensity of the gamma ray and the efficiency of the detector.

The most common figure used to express detector resolution is [[full width at half maximum]] (FWHM). This is the width of the gamma ray peak at half of the highest point on the peak distribution. Resolution figures are given with reference to specified gamma ray energies. Resolution can be expressed in absolute (i.e., [[electron volts|eV]] or MeV) or relative terms.  For example, a sodium iodide (NaI) detector may have a FWHM of 9.15 keV at 122 keV, and 82.75 keV at 662 keV. These resolution values expressed in absolute terms. To express the resolution in relative terms, the FWHM in eV or MeV is divided by the energy of the gamma ray and multiplied by 100. Using the preceding example, the resolution of the detector is 7.5% at 122 keV, and 12.5% at 662 keV. A germanium detector may give resolution of 560 eV at 122 keV, yielding a relative resolution of 0.46%.

===Detector efficiency===
Not all gamma rays emitted by the source and pass through the detector will produce a count in the system. The probability that an emitted gamma ray will interact with the detector and produce a count is the ''efficiency'' of the detector. High-efficiency detectors produce spectra in less time than low-efficiency detectors. In general, larger detectors have higher efficiency than smaller detectors, although the shielding properties of the detector material are also important factors. Detector efficiency is measured by comparing a spectrum from a source of known activity to the count rates in each peak to the count rates expected from the known intensities of each gamma ray.

Efficiency, like resolution, can be expressed in absolute or relative terms. The same units are used (i.e., percentages); therefore, the spectroscopist must take care to determine which kind of efficiency is being given for the detector. Absolute efficiency values represent the probability that a gamma ray of a specified energy passing through the detector will interact and be detected. Relative efficiency values are often used for germanium detectors, and compare the efficiency of the detector at 1332 keV to that of a 3&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;in NaI detector (i.e., 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cp[[second|s]]/[[Bq]]). Relative efficiency values greater than one hundred percent can therefore be encountered when working with very large germanium detectors.

The energy of the gamma rays being detected is an important factor in the efficiency of the detector. An efficiency curve can be obtained by plotting the efficiency at various energies. This curve can then be used to determine the efficiency of the detector at energies different from those used to obtain the curve. High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors typically have higher sensitivity.

==Scintillation detectors==
[[Scintillator|Scintillation detectors]] use crystals that emit light when gamma rays interact with the atoms in the crystals. The intensity of the light produced is proportional to the energy deposited in the crystal by the gamma ray. The mechanism is similar to that of a [[thermoluminescent dosimeter]]. The detectors are joined to [[photomultiplier|photomultipliers]] that convert the light into electrons and then amplify the electrical signal provided by those electrons. Common scintillators include [[thallium]]-[[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] [[sodium iodide]] (NaI(Tl))—often simplified to ''sodium iodide (NaI)'' detectors—and [[bismuth germanate]] (BGO). Because photomultipliers are also sensitive to ambient light, scintillators are encased in light-tight coverings. 

Scintillation detectors can also be used to detect [[alpha ray|alpha]]- and [[beta ray|beta]]-radiation.

===Sodium iodide-based detectors===
[[Image:Cs137 Spectrum.PNG|300px|right|thumb|Figure 1: Sodium iodide gamma spectrum of cesium-137 (&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs)]]
[[Image:Co60 Spectrum.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Figure 2: Sodium iodide gamma spectrum of cobalt-60 (&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co)]] 

Thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) has two principal advantages:
# It can be produced in large crystals, yielding good efficiency, and 
# it produces intense bursts of light compared to other spectroscopic scintillators.
NaI(Tl) is also convenient to use, making it popular for field applications such as the identification of unknown materials for law enforcement purposes. 

An example of a NaI spectrum is the gamma spectrum of the [[cesium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs—''see Figure 1''. &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs emits a single gamma line of 662 keV. It should be noted that the 662 keV line shown is actually produced by &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;[[barium|Ba]]&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[decay product]] of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, which is in [[secular equilibrium]] with &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs.

The spectrum in Figure 1 was measured using a NaI-crystal on a photomultiplier, an amplifier, and a multichannel analyzer. The figure shows the number of counts (within the measuring period) versus channel number. The spectrum indicates the following peaks (from left to right):
# low energy x radiation (due to [[internal conversion]] of the gamma ray),
# [[backscatter]] at the low energy end of the [[Compton effect|Compton distribution]], and
# a photopeak (full energy peak) at an energy of 662 keV

The Compton distribution is a continuous distribution that is present up to channel 150 in Figure 1. The distribution arises because of primary gamma rays undergoing [[Compton scattering]] within the crystal: Depending on the scattering angle, the Compton electrons have different energies and hence produce pulses of different heights.

If many gamma rays are present in a spectrum, Compton distributions can present analysis challenges. To reduce gamma rays, an anticoincidence shield can be used—''see [[Compton suppression]]''. Gamma ray reduction techniques are especially useful for small [[lithium]]-doped germanium (Ge(Li)) detectors.

The gamma spectrum shown in Figure 2 is of the [[cobalt]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co, with two gamma rays with 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV respectively. (''See the [[decay scheme]] article for the decay scheme of cobalt-60.'') The two gamma lines can be seen well-separated; the peak to the left of channel 200 most likely indicates a strong [[background radiation]] source that has not been subtracted. A backscatter peak can be seen at channel 150, similar to the second peak in Figure 1.

Sodium iodide systems, as with all scintillator systems, are sensitive to changes in temperature. Changes in the [[operating temperature]] caused by changes in environmental temperature will shift the spectrum on the horizontal axis. Peak shifts of tens of channels or more are commonly observed. Such shifts can be prevented by using spectrum stabilizers.

Because of the poor resolution of NaI-based detectors, they are not suitable for the identification of complicated mixtures of gamma ray-producing materials. Scenarios requiring such analyses require detectors with higher resolution.

==Semiconductor-based detectors==
[[File:Am-Be-SourceSpectrum.jpg|thumb|350px|Germanium gamma spectrum of a radioactive Am-Be-source.]]

[[Semiconductor detector]]s, also called solid-state detectors, are fundamentally different from scintillation detectors. In semiconductor detectors, an electric field is applied to the detector volume. An electron in the semiconductor is fixed in its [[valence band]] in the crystal until a gamma ray interaction provides the electron enough energy to move to the [[conduction band]].  Electrons in the conduction band can respond to the electric field in the detector, and therefore move to the positive contact that is creating the electrical field. The gap created by the moving electron is called a &quot;hole,&quot; and is filled by an adjacent electron. This shuffling of holes effectively moves a positive charge to the negative contact. The arrival of the electron at the positive contact and the hole at the negative contact produces the electrical signal that is sent to the preamplifier, the MCA, and on through the system for analysis. The movement of electrons and holes in a solid-state detector is very similar to the movement of ions within the sensitive volume of gas-filled detectors such as [[ionization chamber|ionization chambers]]. 

Common semiconductor-based detectors include [[germanium]], [[cadmium telluride]], and [[cadmium zinc telluride]].

Germanium detectors provide significantly improved energy resolution in comparison to sodium iodide detectors, as explained in the preceding discussion of resolution. Germanium detectors produce the highest resolution commonly available today. [[Cryogenic]] temperatures are vital to the operation of germanium detectors.

==Calibration and background radiation==
If a gamma spectrometer is used for identifying samples of unknown composition, its energy scale must be calibrated first. Calibration is performed by using the peaks of a known source, such as cesium-137 or cobalt-60. Because the channel number is proportional to energy, the channel scale can then be converted to an energy scale. If the size of the detector crystal is known, one can also perform an intensity calibration, so that not only the energies but also the intensities of an unknown source—or the amount of a certain isotope in the source—can be determined.

Because some radioactivity is present everywhere (i.e., [[background radiation]]), the spectrum should be analyzed when no source is present. The background radiation must then be subtracted from the actual measurement. [[Lead]] absorbers can be placed around the measurement apparatus to reduce background radiation.

'''Gas phase ion chemistry''' is a field of science encompassed within both [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. It is the science that studies [[ion]]s and [[molecule]]s in the gas phase, most often enabled by some form of [[mass spectrometry]]. By far the most important applications for this science is in studying the [[thermodynamic]]s and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of reactions.&lt;ref name=Aubry2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Aubry | first =  C. | year = 2000 | title = Correlating thermochemical data for gas-phase ion chemistry | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 200 | pages = 277 | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(00)00323-7 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1998/pdf/7010x1969.pdf Pure &amp; Appl. Chem., Vol. 70, No. 10, pp. 1969-1976, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example one application is in studying the [[thermodynamics]] of the [[solvation]] of ions. Ions with small [[solvation]] spheres of 1, 2, 3... solvent molecules can be studied in the gas phase and then extrapolated to bulk solution.

==Theory==

===Transition state theory===
{{Main|Transition state theory}}
Transition state theory is the theory of the rates of elementary reactions which assumes a special type of [[chemical equilibrium]] (quasi-equilibrium) between reactants and activated complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Transition State Theory|file= T06470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RRKM theory===
{{main|RRKM theory}}
RRKM theory is used to compute simple estimates of the [[unimolecular ion decomposition]] [[reaction rates]] from a few characteristics of the [[potential energy surface]].

==Gas phase ion formation==
The process of converting an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] into an [[ion]] by adding or removing charged particles such as [[electron]]s or other ions can occur in the gas phase. These processes are an important component of gas phase ion chemistry.

===Associative ionization===
{{main|Associative ionization}}
Associative ionization is a gas phase reaction in which two [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s interact to form a single product [[ion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=associative ionization|file= A00475}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;A^* + B \to AB^{+\bullet} + e^-&lt;/math&gt;

where species A with excess internal energy (indicated by the asterisk) interacts with B to form the ion AB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

One or both of the interacting species may have excess [[internal energy]].

===Charge-exchange ionization===
{{main|Charge-exchange ionization}}
Charge-exchange ionization (also called '''charge-transfer ionization''') is a gas phase reaction between an [[ion]] and a neutral species 
:&lt;math&gt;A^+ + B \to A + B^+&lt;/math&gt;
in which the charge of the ion is transferred to the neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-exchange ionization|file= C00989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical ionization===
{{main|chemical ionization}}
In chemical ionization, ions are produced through the reaction of ions of a reagent gas with other species.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, M.S.B.; Field, F.H. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1966''', ''88'', 2621-2630. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja00964a001 Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry. I. General Introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some common reagent gases include:  [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[isobutane]].

===Chemi-ionization===
{{main|Chemi-ionization}}
Chemi-ionization can be represented by
:&lt;math&gt;G^* + M \to M^{+\bullet} + e^- + G&lt;/math&gt;
where G is the excited state species (indicated by the superscripted asterisk), and M is the species that is ionized by the loss of an [[electron]] to form the [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[cation]] (indicated by the superscripted &quot;plus-dot&quot;).

===Penning ionization===
{{main|Penning ionization}}
Penning ionization refers to the interaction between a gas-phase excited-state atom or molecule G&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and a target molecule M resulting in the formation of a radical molecular cation M&lt;sup&gt;+.&lt;/sup&gt;, an electron e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and a neutral gas molecule G:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Penning gas mixture|file= P04476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G^* + M \to M^{+\bullet} + e^- + G&lt;/math&gt;

Penning ionization occurs when the target molecule has an [[ionization potential]] lower than the internal energy of the excited-state atom or molecule. [[associative ionization|Associative]] Penning ionization can also occur:

:&lt;math&gt;G^* + M \to MG^{+\bullet} + e^-&lt;/math&gt;

==Fragmentation==
There are many important [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] reactions that take place in the gas phase.

===Collision-induced dissociation===
{{main|Collision-induced dissociation}}
CID (also called collisionally activated dissociation - CAD) is a method used to fragment molecular [[ion]]s in the gas phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16401509&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wells JM, McLuckey SA |title=Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of peptides and proteins |journal=Meth. Enzymol. |volume=402 |issue= |pages=148–85 |year=2005 |pmid=16401509 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(05)02005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15481084&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sleno L, Volmer DA |title=Ion activation methods for tandem mass spectrometry |journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1091–112 |year=2004 |pmid=15481084 |doi=10.1002/jms.703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular ions collide with neutral gas molecules such as [[helium]], [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]. In the collision some of the kinetic energy is converted into [[internal energy]] which results in fragmentation.

===Charge remote fragmentation===
{{main|Charge remote fragmentation}}
Charge remote fragmentation is a type of [[covalent bond]] breaking that occurs in a gas phase [[ion]] in which the cleaved bond is not adjacent to the location of the charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11199379&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cheng C, Gross ML |title=Applications and mechanisms of charge-remote fragmentation |journal=Mass Spectrom Rev |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=398–420 |year=2000 |pmid=11199379 |doi=10.1002/1098-2787(2000)19:6&lt;398::AID-MAS3&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gross2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gross | first =  M. | year = 2000 | title = Charge-remote fragmentation: an account of research on mechanisms and applications | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume = 200 | pages = 611 | doi = 10.1016/S1387-3806(00)00372-9 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charge transfer reactions==
There are several types of charge-transfer reactions&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-transfer reaction (in mass spectrometry)|file=C01005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as charge-permutation reactions&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-permutation reaction|file=M04002}}&lt;/ref&gt;):  partial-charge transfer

:&lt;math&gt;A^{2+} + B \to A^+ + B^+&lt;/math&gt;,

charge-stripping reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-stripping reaction|file=C01001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;A^+ + B \to A^{2+} + B + e^-&lt;/math&gt;,

and charge-inversion reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=charge-inversion mass spectrum|file=C00992}}&lt;/ref&gt; positive to negative

:&lt;math&gt;A^+ + B \to A^- + B^{2+} &lt;/math&gt;

and negative to positive

:&lt;math&gt;A^- + B \to A^+ + B + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Gaussian broadening''' refers to broadening effects in [[spectral line]]s, these can be produced by [[Doppler broadening]] and [[natural broadening]].

This effect is similar to [[Gaussian blur]] effect in [[image processing]] produced by [[convolution]] with the [[Gaussian function]].

The term is named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

{{displaytitle|title=Practical Project: Analysis}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

Before you start making your project you need to know what you are going to make.  This is where your analysis comes in useful and it's also worth 12 marks, that's 18.5% of the overall project!  We'd better get started.

== What do you need to include? ==

Hopefully by now you have some idea of your user and what they want you to do, we need to codify (write it down) it all so we can start getting some marks.  The exam board has been very kind and if you check out the mark scheme they even provide a list of things that you need to include in your Analysis.  We're going to take these and use them as our headings.

=== Research Methods ===
[[File:Accessories-text-editor.svg|thumb|right|100px|Make sure your research leads directly to your objectives]]
This should be done first. You have an idea on the sections that you need to present so you should put together some questions for your main user to get the answers you need to start putting this together.  From your research you need to know the following:
* The current system and how it runs
* The problems with the current system
* The users
* The skill levels of people using it
* What they want the new system to do
* Any preferences in terms of web based, phone based, application based.  What platform are you developing for
A structured interview might do the trick and you need to note down all the responses to each of your questions. You should try to understand the current situation and the problem and it is recommended you perform and evidence at least two of the following methods and explain why you used each:
*Interview
*Questionnaire (for multiple users)
*Observation of current system
Once you have finished presenting your research you need to summarise what it said and explain why you used each research method.

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Don't forget to:}}
[[File:Dobry Artykul-MK.svg|50px]]Make sure that all information on users, current system problems, proposed system features etc. comes directly from your research, otherwise it looks like you haven't done your research properly 
{{Robox/Close}}

===Background to/identification of the Problem===

You need to introduce your problem, a quick two paragraphs of what the problem is and how a computer might solve it.  For example mention how the current system paper based, slow and people are always losing things, the computerised system would be faster, secure and allow them to run reports and calculate things.  But don't mention any languages or databases at this point, we will decide that at the end of the analysis.

===Description of the current system===

Describe the current system, what it does and how it currently stores its data. Describe the flaws in the current system, is it slow, secure, easy to query, easy to use, can it have multiple people use it at once, is it easy to access?

===Identification of prospective user(s)?===
[[File:System-users.svg|thumb|100px|right|You might have multiple users]]
In some instances your system will involve only one user, the person you are writing it for.  In most cases it will involve more than one person. You need to '''recognise all the users''', big and small, of your system.

For example if you were making a maths revision website you have the maths teacher as your main user, but who else is going to use the system?  The students of course!  You would then need to write how each of these user groups would use the system and how some users would have more access than others.  The teacher would be able to change the tests and see the results of all their students, they should be able to add and delete student users. The students should be able to take tests and only see their results.

For example if you were making a stock control system then the system administrator should be able to add/delete/update and re-order items of stock, run reports and add/delete/update users and suppliers.  The general shop floor staff should only be able to sell items and print out receipts.  The customers will have no direct use of the system.

You should also mention for each user the '''skills they possess'''.  For example if they use a Mac all the time then an interface similar to an OS X interface would be useful.  If they use Microsoft Office 2010 then an interface similar to that software suite would be suitable.

===Identification of user needs and acceptable limitations===
Summarise your research findings, what do each of your users want you to do?  For example:

The teacher needs me to create a system that
* stores students high scores
* shows student progress
* allows them to add, edit and delete questions

The students need me to create a system that
* allows them to log in
* allows them to answer exam style questions

Limitations are slightly harder to list.  You need to write down what your system won't be doing for reasons of time, complexity, or user preference.  These might include the system not storing user log in details as these will be managed by LDAP.  The system not enforcing spin on the pool ball as this isn't needed by the teacher and I don't have time.

===Data source(s) and destination(s)===
In most cases you'll use a database, but you could also use a file-based system or xml.
By now you should have mentioned a couple things that your project will need to store and process (this should have come from your interviews).  Where are you going to get this data from?

*What is it -&gt; where is it from -&gt; where is it going

For example the current system might say:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! What is it !! Source !! Destination
|-
| Customer Details || new customers filling in forms || customers paper records
|-
| Questions for exams || past papers and teachers || photocopies for students
|}

The new system would then look like (notice that there might be some more attributes):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! What is it !! Source !! Destination
|-
| Customer Details || new customers filling in online forms || customers db table
|-
| Questions for exams || past papers and teachers || questions XML file
|-
| Admin details || Manager || users db table
|}

===Data volumes===
An important thing to think about when building any system is how much data you will need to store and how much processing is required.  This should come directly from your research and will influence how you complete your project and what sort of hardware you will need to use. For example if you only have one person sitting an online test at one time, you only need a simple computer.  If you are looking to have hundreds of people using your system at once then you will need a very fast computer and probably a web based solution.

For example:
*I will be storing several hundred customers and...
*The revision system will store up to 100 different questions and 300 student details
*Each student will have their attempt at each question recorded, making potentially 300*100 = 30000 question answer results
*The system only needs to process one sale at a time because...

===Data Dictionary===
Like a dictionary describing all the words you can use in a sentence, this will record all the pieces of data that you want to store and process in your system.  You will need to provide the following information for everything you will store data on:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Field Name
! Field Purpose
! Field Type
! Field Size
! Example Data
! Validation
|-
| First Name
| Stores the name of the player
| String
| 30
| Peter
| Not blank
|-
| Date of Birth
| Stores the date of birth of the player
| Date/Time
| DD/MM/YY (6 figures)
| 19/08/76
| Date/Time format 
|-
| Score
| Stores the top score of the player
| integer
| 4
| 7643
| bigger than 0, less than 10000 
|}

If you are storing a database make sure that you have stored data on all the fields that will be in your database, for example the data above is storing data on a student in a school.  What data will you need to store for your system to work?

If you are making a program, you will want to list all the variables that your program will store whilst it is running.  For example, if you were creating a program to tally the score someone achieved in a quiz, you should list the variable that will store this score.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Field Name
! Field Type
! Start Value
! Description
|-
| Score
| Integer
| 0
| This will keep track of the score of the player
|-
| First Name
| String
| NULL
| This will keep track of the first name of a player
|-
| Date of Birth
| Date
| 01/01/1990
| This will keep track of the date of birth of the player
|}

'''Warning''': A very common mistake is to mis-size your fields.  For example you are making a markbook system where you will store the age of students.  The ages are between 11 and 16, so why not make the age 16 in length? The answer is because length sixteen allows you to store the age: 9999999999999999, which is older than the universe.  The length should be a more sensible '''2''' as the numbers are two characters long

===Data Flow Diagrams===
There are many ways that you can draw data flow diagrams, so if your teacher tells you one way and the way you read here is completely different, don't worry.  The important thing is that you show how data moves through the current system, where it is stored, where it will be processed and how you plan it to move through the new system.  It is called a data flow diagram afterall!  For these examples we are using the '''Gane Sarson''' method.

[[Image:DFD0.png|thumb|480px|center|A typical Data Flow Diagram, you'll need a lot more detail!]]

There are four main components that you need to be aware of:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name !! Description !! Symbol
|-
| Entity || This generally shows all the people involved in the system.  It may also indicate other external systems that you are interacting with || circle
|-
| Process || This describes the processing that happens to the data as it is moved from one location to another, it has data inputted and will output to a data store, another process or an entity || square
|-
| Store || Generally this indicates the different computational stores used to hold your data, such as hard disk files, databases, CD ROMs etc.  || rectangle
|-
| Transfer || This shows how data moves from one part of the system to another.  you need to label the arrows to explain exactly what is moving about. || arrow
|}

Using the descriptions we can see the diagram above means the following: 
# A customer can enquire about store items, the system processes the enquiry and fetches the data from the item datastore, sending the results to the customer
# A customer can order an item, the system checks that the customer is real, checks the item is in stock, sends an order and finally sends the item and an invoice to the customer.

You need to produce four data flow diagrams, two showing the current situation and two showing the proposed system.  For each you must show the following diagrams:
*Level 0
*Level 1

You can make them using a word processor but it's far easier to use specialist software.  You can try to use [[w:Dia (software)|dia]] or [[w:Open ModelSphere|Open ModelSphere]], which are both free.  Alternatively you can use Microsoft [[w:Visio|Visio]].

{{CPTExtension|title=Extension: Use Cases}}
In software and systems engineering, a [[w:use case|use case]] is a list of steps, typically defining interactions between a role (known in [[w:UML|UML]] as an &quot;actor&quot;) and a system, to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or an external system. For example in a system where a user wants to invite some people to a party on a social network. Person:
# logs in
# selects to create an event
# picks a date and time from, using a date picker
# picks a date and time to, using a date picker
# selects a location, using a map
# adds a picture of the venue from their picture collection
# adds description
# selects private event
# sends invites

===Entity Relationship Diagrams (for databases)===
[[File:CPT-Databases-ExampleReceipt.svg|thumb|320px|Four related entities shown using Crow's Foot notation. This relationship shows that a receipt has one customer, one staff member and one product. And a customer can have many receipts; a staff member can process many receipts; and a category of product can be sold many times.]]
When thinking about how you are going to save data on your system you might decide to use a database, if this is the case you must include an E-R Diagram.  If you aren't using a database explain that there is no need to complete this section. You need to recognise your main tables.  There should be at least 3 tables and relationships between them.  The tables don't have to be normalised at this stage but the relationships should be described in a little detail.

* see chapter on [[../../Problem Solving, Programming, Operating Systems, Databases and Networking/Databases|Databases]]

===Object Orientation planning (for Object Orientation)===
For each class that you are using describe:
* overview of what it does
* inheritance
* overriding
* public and private variables
* public and private methods

For example, the attributes of a monster class might contain:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Access Type
! Field Name
! Field Type
! Initial Value
! Description
|-
| Private
| Health
| Integer
| 100
| This will store the health of the monster, when the health gets to 0 the monster should die
|-
| Private
| x
| Integer
| 0
| This will track the x location of the monster
|}

you also need to note the methods that the monster class would use:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Access Type
! Method Name
! Parameters
! Return Values
! Description
|-
| Public
| MoveLeft
| none
| none
| This will move the monster 3 points to the left
|-
| Public
| Hurt
| damage
| the current health of the monster
| this allows you to damage monsters
|}

* see chapter on [[../../Problem Solving, Programming, Operating Systems, Databases and Networking/Programming Concepts/Object-oriented programming (OOP)|object orientation]]

===Objectives===
[[File:Gnome-colors-alacarte.svg|thumb|right|100px|Make sure your objectives are numbered and SMART]]
This is the most important part of your Analysis, because this is how you are going to check if your end system meets all your user needs. You need to outline three sets of objectives that are all SMART and numbered:
*System Objectives
*Processing Objectives
*User Objectives
As far as possible all your objectives should be SMART. But what does SMART mean?
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Letter
! Major Term
! Description
! Example
! Not acceptable!
|-
| S
| Specific
| Make sure that it's not ambiguous and it concerns a part of your system
| The system should be able to display 5 top scores in descending order
| My system should be good
|-
| M
| Measurable
| Is there any way that you can easily prove that you have met this objective.
| Each page should load in less than 5 seconds
| My pages will be beautiful
|-
| A
| Attainable
| Make sure that within the time and resources available you will be able to complete the objective
| My system will allow the saving of user preferences
| There will be a facial recognition system to allow users to log into the system
|-
| R
| Relevant
| Is the objective going to help you meet your user needs?
| A receipt will be printed and emailed to the customer
| My cashier system will play MP3s in the background
|-
| T
| Time-bound
| You are limited in the time you have to complete this project. You must list the deadline in your Analysis somewhere and can you finish each objective in time?
| I will show the player position on the map using 2D Vector graphics
| The game will have 3D graphics as good as Call of Duty
|}
As you can probably recognise, several of the incorrect objectives above fail to meet multiple SMART criteria.  Test yourself, which of these objectives are SMART enough to get you started on a good project:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The system will allow staff to update stock and add new stock items. &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - Yes, You could evidence this by showing screen shots of this happening
* A - Yes, this should be possible
* R - Yes, this is core to running the system
* T - Yes, this should be achievable within the time given
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The sports club system will have a clock displaying the current time on each page &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - Yes, You could evidence this by showing screen shots of this happening
* A - Yes, this should be possible
* R - '''No''', why can't they use the clock on the desktop
* T - Yes, this should be achievable within the time given
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The system will use custom code to interpret and display SVG game graphics &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - You could evidence this by showing screen shots of this happening
* A - '''Maybe''', this should be possible, but why are you writing your own code, can't you use a library?
* R - Yes, the game will need graphics
* T - '''No''', SVG is a complex thing to use, will you have time to implement this? Is it that core to what you are doing?  Why not use pre-existing libraries?
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The system will calculate and display the total number of sales per customer &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - Yes, You could evidence this by showing screen shots of this happening and the code behind it
* A - Yes,
* R - Yes, as long as this is called for from the interview or other part of the analysis
* T - Yes
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| The system will process 5,000,000 transactions a second &lt;click&gt;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
* S - Yes
* M - Yes, You could evidence this by showing debug information, maybe a counter tallying transactions
* A - '''Maybe''', you would be hitting processing speed limitations and probably limitations in speed of the
* R - '''No''', this system sounds too complex as this level of speed would only be required in something like Google or Facebook
* T - '''No''', this sounds like cutting edge industry level stuff, are you sure you could achieve it in the time given?
| &amp;nbsp;

===Potential Solutions===
There are several ways that you could solve the problem at hand you need to list at least 3 different options.  For each of them you need to mention positive and negative things and then argue out your chosen solution.

For example.  If was tasked with making a stock control system I could use the following things (with a lot more detail!)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Suggested Solution
! Positives
! Negatives
|-
| Excel and VBA desktop application
| &lt;/br&gt;I know how to use excel&lt;br/&gt;the user also has experience in excel&lt;br/&gt;Excel and VBA will allow me to perform calculations and display results
| Excel is a flat file database and won't let me handle links between data.&lt;br/&gt;The solution will only be available offline
|-
| Visual Basic.NET application and Access Database backend
| I have some experience of Visual Basic from the first year&lt;br/&gt;VB.NET lets me easily build a solution that will have similar interfaces to MS Office programs&lt;br/&gt;They already own Access and use Windows&lt;br/&gt;
| I need to learn more VB.NET to complete this project&lt;br/&gt;This solution will be offline only
|-
| ASP.NET and MSSQL database website based solution
| This solution will allow the user to login online.&lt;br/&gt;Relationships will be enforacable&lt;br/&gt;I will be able to use SQL to perform searches
| I have a lot to learn in ASP.NET&lt;br/&gt;The user doesn't need to access it from multiple computers&lt;br/&gt;It requires a server and networking know-how
|}

===Chosen Solution===

From the choices that you suggested pick the best one and explain why.  This is going to be how you are going to solve this problem!

===Other evidence===

In this section you need to justify that the techniques you used to write your analysis were correct and made sure that you managed to get all the objectives of the new system.  Go back to the questionnaires, interview and observations.  Include them here and explain how this made sure that you could produce a comprehensive Analysis.

==Next steps==
Now you have completed your Analysis you need to start making your project.  You should have some idea of how you are going to make your system and you now need to start acquiring all the skills you will need to complete this project.  Get yourself a text book about the programming language you have chosen and make sure you can perform some simple tasks using it. At this point it would be a good idea to write a quick list of skills that you will need to learn.

Whilst you are getting those skills, head over to [[../Design|Design]]

'''WPBannerMeta''' incorporates a number of ''''hooks'''', where advanced or customized features can be added. These should take the form of a subtemplate passed to the relevant hook parameter. Any relevant parameters should then be passed to the hook template&amp;mdash;it may be necessary to repeat parameters that are already passed to the main template (e.g.: {{para|category|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{category|¬}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{para|quality|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{quality|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} are commonly used). If you write a hook that you think other projects could use, please copy or move it to a subpage here and add it to the list below.

===Writing a hook===
Hooks should be carefully designed to mimic the meta-functionality of the WPBannerMeta template, particularly with things like category opt-out and case-insensitive quality filtering; and for ease of maintenance, the parameters should be similarly named to WPBannerMeta's default parameters. 

===Available hook parameters===
*{{para|HOOK_ASSESS}} – between the code for quality and priority assessments.
*{{para|HOOK_BOTTOM}} – just below the comments display, adjacent to {{para|BOTTOM_TEXT}}. Please use this hook rather than the {{para|BOTTOM_TEXT}} parameter, for adding extra functionality to the bottom of the template.
*{{para|HOOK_NOTE}} – after the last note code (above the comment display).
*{{para|HOOK_COLLAPSED}} – added to the 'counter' that counts the number of notes that have been triggered on a page, to prompt the collapsible box.  Accepts either
**any valid input to the &lt;tt&gt;[[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions##expr:|#expr:]]&lt;/tt&gt; ParserFunction.
**&quot;''auto''&quot;, which automatically sets to 1 if HOOK_NOTE is non-empty and 0 otherwise. This is the default setting and is suitable if HOOK_NOTE will not normally produce more than one row of output.
*{{para|HOOK_PRIORITY}} – between the priority assessment and the autoassess notice. 
*{{para|HOOK_NESTED}} – after the task force list that is displayed when the banner is nested within a {{tl|WikiProjectBannerShell}}.
*{{para|HOOK_TF}} – after the task force code (just above the code for {{para|attention}}).

===Existing hooks===
*[[/cats]] &amp;ndash; add categories based on parameters with proper optout, case insensitivity, etc.
*[[/notecounter]] – allows notes, etc. added in HOOK_NOTE to contribute towards the counter that triggers the notes being collapsed.
*[[/notes]] &amp;ndash; provides ten additional notes.  Hooks to {{para|HOOK_NOTE}}.
*[[/taskforces]] – provides ten additional taskforces (hooks to {{para|HOOK_TF}}).
*[[/tfnested]] – nested summaries for ten additional taskforces.  Works with [[/taskforces]] above.  Hooks to {{para|HOOK_NESTED}}.
*[[/todolist]] – allows for easy adding of a project wide to-do list (hooks to {{para|HOOK_BOTTOM}}).

This hook allows notes added in other hooks ([[Template:WPBannerMeta/hooks/notes|/notes]], etc) to contribute towards the counter that triggers the notes being collapsed into a show/hide box when they become too numerous. Each parameter should be set to one of the trigger parameters for a hooked note.

'''''This hook cannot be 'stacked' in the usual way'''''.  Normally, you can 'stack' hook templates:

&lt;pre&gt;
|HOOK_NOTE              = &lt;!--
--&gt;{{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notes
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}}{{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notes
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}}{{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notes
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This does '''not''' work with this particular hook.  You need to concatenate the hook templates with an addition sign &lt;tt&gt;'''+'''&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
|HOOK_COLLAPSED         = {{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notecounter
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}} + {{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notecounter
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}} + {{WPBannerMeta/hooks/notecounter
 |category = {{{category|¬}}}
 |BANNER_NAME=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
...
}}

This hook enables a project to-do list or other similar list to be easily integrated into a project banner. It should be attached to the {{para|HOOK_BOTTOM}} hook.

There are two main parameters, {{para|TODO_LINK}} and {{para|TODO_TEXT}}. Only one should be used at any time. If the todo list is located on a different page then &lt;tt&gt;TODO_LINK&lt;/tt&gt; should be used. However, if you've just got some text to include then you can use the &lt;tt&gt;TODO_TEXT&lt;/tt&gt; option instead.

If you are using &lt;tt&gt;TODO_LINK&lt;/tt&gt; and don't want to see the edit links at the top of the textbox, set &lt;tt&gt;TODO_EDITLINKS=no&lt;/tt&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Table of Contents ==
* [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/Configuration#Introduction|Introduction]]
* [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/Configuration#Mail|Mail]]
** [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/Configuration#Google_Mail|Google Mail]]

== Introduction ==
If you have trouble finding the right settings for your mail-server, try http://www.webpan.com/Customers/Email/SMTP_Authentication_Telnet_Test.htm
with detailed instructions how to test your settings using telnet.

This link and some more can be found on https://docs.openclinica.com/Email-Configuration-and-Troubleshooting-Tips .

== Mail ==
OpenClinica can be configured to automatically send e-mail messages. For example if a user lost his or her password, the password can be reset and a mail can be sent to notify the user. 
But another use of mail is the generating of messages, defined by rules. For example, if a Serious Adverse Event happens, a mail is sent to to principal investigator.

Configuring the mail-option is done in the datainfo.properties file:
/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/OpenClinica/WEB-INF/classes/datainfo.properties

Before you edit this file, make sure you have a backup, something like datainfo.properties-20120721

=== Google Mail ===
Most people will use the mail server on their system, but sometimes it can be handy to use a GMail account.
If you want to use a google mail account try the following configuration:
&lt;pre&gt;
mailHost=smtp.gmail.com
mailPort=465
mailProtocol=smtps
mailUsername=johndoe@gmail.com
mailPassword=xxxxxxxx
mailSmtpAuth=false
mailSmtpStarttls.enable=false
mailSmtpsAuth=true
mailSmtpsStarttls.enable=false
mailSmtpConnectionTimeout=1000
mailErrorMsg=janedoe@does.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

For versions before 3.1:
&lt;pre&gt;
mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
mail.username=johndoe@gmail.com
mail.password=xxxxxxxx
mail.port=587
mail.errormsg=janedoe@does.com
mail.protocol=smtp
mail.smtp.auth=true
mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
mail.smtps.auth=false
mail.smtps.starttls.enable=false
mail.smtp.connectiontimeout=5000 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hi. Thx for code. What do you think about 2 small changes :
* move &quot;cx = ax + i * h / 800&quot; from j-loop to i-loop. 
* compute &quot;h / 800&quot; and use it's value not to compute it for every point 

It should be faster. Regards. --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 15:43, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

:I have written &quot;i * h / width&quot; (i = 0 to width - 1) in order to make the meaning more clear, in my programs I calculate h/width once for all. You are right, &quot;cx = ax + i * h / width&quot; should be put outside &quot;for j = 0 to height - 1 do&quot;, I have corrected this, and will do the same in all my programs. Thanks.

Hi. I have made a program in C that should realize your algorithm. ( It does not work = gives black file). Can you look at it ? Regards --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|talk]]) 17:52, 13 December 2010 (UTC)

..... ( old code is removed. See new code below)


: I understand that you let the domain outside of the Mandelbrot set and its boundary be of one colour, since you have not calculated the colour scale col and the real iteration number.

:Instead of &quot;if (f&gt;r)/*(n == m || log(f) * sqrt(f) &lt; PixelWidth * sqrt(fd) ) */&quot;, you should write:

:: if (n == m || log(f) * sqrt(f) &lt; thick * sqrt(fd)) /* the condition for Z belonging to the Mandelbrot set or the boundary */

:and instead of &quot;array[((iYmax-iY-1)*iXmax+iX)*3]=0;&quot;, you should write:

:: array[((iHeight-1 - iY)*iWidth + iX)*3]=0; /* iWidth = 800, iHeight = 600 */

:Besides:
:1) iYmax = 599 (not 799)
:2) CyMax = ay + 600*h/800 (not ay + h)
:3) f (first in the iteration loop) is Zx * Zx + Zy * Zy (not Zx + Zy * Zy)
:4) PixelWidth = h/iWidth, but PixelHeight is the same number (not h/iHeight, but &quot;height of section&quot;/iHeight = h/iWidth)

:Thx for answer. I have made some changes based on your tips. It works now. The image looks similar ( only black and white) but the quality is not the same. How can I improve it ? --[[User:Adam majewski|Adam majewski]] ([[User talk:Adam majewski|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Adam majewski|contribs]]) 16:39, 1 March 2011 (UTC)

: A download manager is an application that helps you to download files faster (especially big ones); it re-starts downloading after breaking connection.

== Wget ==
: Wget is a kind of console applications but you can use GUI for it called Gwget.
:1. Installation:&lt;br /&gt;
 apt-get install gwget
::a. Run it from: Menu-&gt; Network-&gt; Gwget Download Manager.
::b. Copy downloading file link from a web browser.
::c. Add it to Gwget 
[[File:Dm1.png|center|600px]]
:: and wait for finishing.
[[File:Dm2.png|center|600px]]


:2. For KDE there is KGet Download Manager as a part of the environment.


: Wget home page: http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html
: More about Wget on Wikipedia: [[w:Wget|Wget]]
: Gwget home page: http://projects.gnome.org/gwget/
: Gwget on Wikipedia: [[w:GWget|GWget]]
: KWget on KDE home page: http://www.kde.org/
: KGet on Wikipedia: [[w:KGet|KGet]]


== Quick Downloader ==
: Small but system independent applications works with Java.
:: 1. Download &quot;OSIndependent&quot; file from: http://qdown.sourceforge.net/ and extract it.
:: 2. Get in the new created &quot;OSIndependent&quot; folder in Termial as an user and run it: 
 java -jar QuickDownloader.jar
[[File:Pobieranie3.png|center|500px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Pobieranie4.png|center|500px]]


== DownThemAll! ==
: Firefox web browser add-on install from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/201/
: Running the add-on first time just choose download folder
[[File:Dl1.png|center|500px]]
: and  click on &quot;Start&quot;.
[[File:Dl2.png|center|500px]]

: Home page: http://www.downthemall.net/


== FireDownload ==
: It's another Firefox add-on and it makes downloading 10 times faster as the add-on maker says,
: install from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10615/
: Home page: http://www.fireaddons.com/

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Shortly after the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], muck-raking journalist [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] publishes a scurrilous book about Dumbledore. The revelations in this book severely shake [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s faith in his erstwhile hero, and lead him to wonder whether Dumbledore had been honest with him about anything.

== Event Details ==

While packing up to leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys' home]] for the last time, Harry happens to see Dumbledore's name on a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Daily Prophet'']]. Reading, he finds a eulogy to Dumbledore by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Elphias Doge|Elphias Doge]], and, in a more recent edition, an interview with Rita Skeeter on the occasion of the publication of her book, ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore''. While Doge's obituary is something of a revelation, telling Harry of Dumbledore's father who was sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], and of Dumbledore's mother, brother, and sister, the hints of scandal that Skeeter reveals in her interview seem to go counter to everything Harry had believed about Dumbledore.

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 8|the wedding]], Harry finds Elphias Doge and attempts to discern the truth from him. Their conversation, however, is taken over by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Auntie Muriel|Auntie Muriel]], who apparently believes the scandals alluded to by Skeeter and overshadows Doge by sheer volume. Harry does learn that the Dumbledore family, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]], lived in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], just as Harry's parents had.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] visits the Trio at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 11|some time later]], he brings a copy of the ''Prophet'' with him. That edition contains an excerpt from Rita's book, in which Dumbledore's mother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] is described as proud and haughty. It also suggests that Kendra was hoping to be able to hide her daughter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], who Skeeter says was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squib]]. While there is very little here that has not already been alluded to in the earlier interview, it is still something of a shock to Harry to see it written down so completely.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 13|Later]], the Trio [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|infiltrate the Ministry]] to attempt to recover the locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]]. While searching Umbridge's office, Harry sees what he takes to be a small mirror showing Dumbledore's face. On inspection, he finds it to be a copy of ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore''. He has only time to look at one of the photographs therein, one showing two teen-aged boys, apparently friends, before he is interrupted.

Very shortly afterwards, Harry sees one of the teen-aged boys again. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] has found [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], and is torturing him for information on something he had once owned. Unwillingly viewing Voldemort's thoughts, Harry sees, in Gregorovitch's memories, a teenager from the photo leaving through Gregorovitch's shop window, having stolen something from him.

Harry and Hermione decide to visit Godric's Hollow to speak with Bathilda Bagshot, arriving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 17|on Christmas Eve]]. In Bathilda's house, Harry notices several vacant picture frames, and surmises that the vacant frames once held the photos now found illustrating ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore''. He also finds a photo of the teenage thief, and puts it in his pocket. At the disastrous end of the visit, he loses the photo of the thief, and Voldemort finds it.

The following day, Hermione reveals that she had picked up an unopened copy of ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' from Bathilda's parlour. Harry finds the picture of the two teenagers, with a caption identifying Dumbledore, and the teen-aged thief as his best friend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]]. Reading a chapter titled, &quot;The Greater Good&quot;, they learn that Dumbledore graduated Hogwarts with many honors and accolades. He and his friend, Elphias Doge, intended to take a Grand Tour of Europe, but Kendra Dumbledore's sudden death canceled it. Although Doge had claimed that Dumbledore made a grand sacrifice to care for his family, the book implies otherwise, quoting several Godric's Hollow citizens. One Enid Smeek recounts that Albus did little to curtail his brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]]'s wild behavior and kept his sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], hidden away. Although the Dumbledores remained reclusive, Bathilda Bagshot reportedly established a friendship with the family. Skeeter claims that although Bathilda's memory may have been affected by age, she was able to extract enough facts to piece together the scandalous story of Kendra's death, which was passed off as a spell backfiring. She also debunks Ariana being sickly and claims Albus had an affinity for the Dark Arts and may have supported Muggle oppression.

The same summer that Albus returned home to care for the family, Bathilda Bagshot took in her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald, a student as brilliant as Dumbledore, who was expelled from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]. He and Albus quickly formed a close friendship. In a letter to Gellert, Dumbledore writes that he agrees Wizard dominance over Muggles is for the greater good, but they must rule responsibly and only use force when necessary. He believes that was Gellert's mistake at Durmstrang, although he says that if Gellert had not been expelled, then they would never have met. Rita states that this letter proves that Albus Dumbledore once intended to overthrow the Statute of Secrecy and establish Wizard rule over Muggles. It contradicts his later stance supporting Muggle-born witches and wizards and protecting Muggles' rights.

But barely two months after their friendship began, Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted ways and did not see each other again until their legendary duel. Bathilda Bagshot believed the rift involved Ariana's death. Gellert was in the Dumbledore house when it happened, and he came home distressed, leaving by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] the next day. Bathilda says Aberforth blamed Albus, and they came to blows at the funeral. Bathilda goes on to say that Gellert's departure was unfortunate, as he would have been a comfort to Albus. It was never understood why Aberforth blamed Albus for Ariana's death, although it is speculated that it was related to Albus' friendship with Gellert, who had been expelled from Durmstrang for near-fatal attacks on fellow students.

Grindelwald then went on to become one of the greatest Dark wizards, conquering much of Europe. It was not until five years after his reign of terror started that Dumbledore succumbed to the Wizarding world's pleas to end Grindelwald's vicious rampage. Questions lingered after Grindelwald's defeat, however. Was it his affection for Grindelwald that delayed Albus taking action? How and why did Ariana die? Was it an accident or the first attempt at implementing their &quot;Greater Good&quot; plan?

The chapter ends here, and Harry is stunned as he endures the loss of his unwavering trust in Dumbledore, who once embodied nothing but goodness and wisdom. Hermione reminds him that it was Rita Skeeter who wrote the book, but Harry points out Dumbledore's own words in his letter to Grindelwald. Hermione says that, unfortunately, Grindelwald's slogan, &quot;For the Greater Good&quot;, probably stemmed from Dumbledore's ideas and became Grindelwald's justification for his atrocities. Those words were reportedly carved over the entrance to &quot;Nurmengard&quot;, the prison Grindelwald built to jail his enemies. Hermione attempts to attribute Dumbledore's actions to his youth, but Harry reminds her that they are the same age, and they are fighting Dark Arts, not championing them. Hermione claims she is not defending what Albus did, but says he had just lost his mother and he was alone. But Harry points out he had a brother and that he kept his Squib sister locked up, although Hermione doubts she was Squib. She says that the Dumbledore they knew would never have allowed Muggle oppression, and whatever he believed when he was seventeen, he chose a different path and spent his remaining life fighting evil. Hermione surmises that Harry is really angry because Dumbledore never revealed this about himself, which Harry acknowledges may be true. But he wonders how Dumbledore could have left him in such a mess, and if he ever really cared about him.

It turns out that what Skeeter has done is interviewed those who knew Dumbledore from outside the household, most notably Bathilda Bagshot by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]]. While the events she writes about did happen, full understanding of the circumstances surrounding them is delayed until near the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. Escaping Death Eaters in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]], the Trio enter the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], where they find that the bartender is Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother. Aberforth gives more of an insider's view of the events of the time which, while still not particularly flattering to Albus, at least explains the events of the day and dispels much of the fear Harry has that Dumbledore had been on the Dark side. Dumbledore's motives, however, are not revealed until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|somewhat later]], and a full understanding is only granted [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|later still]].

== Notable Consequences ==

The principal effect of the appearance of this book is to cast Harry's belief in his hero, Dumbledore, completely into disarray. He had been carrying out Dumbledore's mission out of love and respect for the man Dumbledore was, but finds that there is an entire unexplained, and possibly scandalous past that Dumbledore has never told him about. As he is no longer sure who Dumbledore was, Harry is unsure about the worth of the mission that Dumbledore had set him, and of the value Dumbledore had placed on him personally. Was Dumbledore truly what he seemed, or was he simply conning Harry into doing his work for him?

Information in this book, and information gathered elsewhere, leads Harry along a path that Voldemort is also following: towards one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]. Without information gleaned from this book, Harry would not have understood the link connecting the experiences he received from Voldemort, and would not have been able to determine what Voldemort sought, or why.

== Analysis ==

Rita Skeeter has always been held up as an example of the very &quot;yellowest&quot; of the yellow press, writing for sensation rather than for truth. While there is often some fact behind what she writes, she has completely internalized the belief that the function of a newspaper is to sell newspapers, and thus the function of a writer is to write whatever sells. In this book, we see her at her &quot;best&quot;, taking events that are open to misinterpretation, and misinterpreting them to the maximum sensationalist effect. One could wonder why Harry so readily accepts the picture she paints, despite its differences from the Dumbledore we, and Harry, have come to know. Apart from the all-too-human readiness to believe the worst in others, there is little that would make Harry believe Skeeter's story. However, Skeeter is a very successful writer, and by now has quite obviously learned how to use a single provable fact to support a veritable tower of innuendo. Harry, young and inexperienced, is not yet able to deconstruct Skeeter's text and determine where he is being duped.

There are several passages in the series that could be considered epigrams. One of them, spoken by Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 18|late in the second book]], is &quot;It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.&quot; Though Harry is, at the time, comforted by this thought, he is not so quick to apply it to others. In this case, Harry is quick to accept the stories told by Skeeter at face value, probably because the only counter-story he has heard to date is the weak protestations from Elphias Doge. Believing these stories about Dumbledore's past is particularly harmful because Harry seems unable to believe that people can change. He has shown this before, when he learned about his father's student life; though told that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] had stopped being a bully and had become quite the upstanding wizard, Harry remains doubtful that his father had really changed, and wonders who his father really was. Skeeter's revelations similarly upset Harry's understanding of Dumbledore and his motives, and Harry seems unable to see that Dumbledore had made choices that changed him to the wizard he was, leaving behind the child he had been. Possibly this is because, while Harry has made the choices that distinguish him from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], to Harry's perceptions, the choices he made were not changes in behaviour, but simply affirmations of his beliefs. The key choices he made, in his first day at Hogwarts, were to reject [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s offer of friendship on the Hogwarts Express, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sorting Hat|Sorting Hat]]'s suggestion that he would &quot;do well in Slytherin&quot;. As both of these choices were simply affirmations of his existing beliefs, he may not be able to perceive that great changes can equally be chosen. Curiously, though, he does not recognize that Dumbledore's choice, to support Muggles rather than rule them, is equally an affirmation of his previous character, and the episode presented by Skeeter is an aberration inspired by Grindelwald, rather than a measure of his true character.

As horrible as it is, this book is actually quite an important factor in Harry's maturation. The reader can see, as Harry starts to in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', that prior to this year, Harry has been largely reacting to others rather than acting on his own. It is only in this book that he takes the initiative, choosing to pursue the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], rather than following [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] pursuit of one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Hallows]]. While it is true that in making this decision, he follows Dumbledore's wishes, he must first elect to do so, rather than following the allure of the Hallows which promise &quot;the ability to conquer Death&quot;. By forcing Harry to re-examine his assumptions about Dumbledore, ''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' sows the doubt that allows him to consider the other choice.

This last item merits examination in some depth. In the first five books, it should be obvious to the reader that Harry is purely reacting to events initiated by Voldemort and his associates, and to a lesser extent to Dumbledore and his wishes. This is pointed up for us by a comment of Ron's, that Dumbledore likely knew everything that was going on, and had allowed Harry to face Voldemort in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. Looking back at events from the end of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', the reader could be forgiven for believing that Harry's role was to be a tool for Dumbledore, rather than an individual in his own right.

In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Dumbledore expressly acts to bring Harry into his confidence to the extent that he feels able. Dumbledore teaches Harry almost all that he has been able to learn about Voldemort's early career, knowing that a key to defeating an enemy is understanding him. Despite this preparation for battle, Dumbledore gives no clue that he expects Harry to be fighting Voldemort directly. Right up to the end of the book, when Dumbledore dies, it would appear that Dumbledore will be fighting Voldemort, and Harry will be assisting him, a role that Harry seems almost worshipfully to accept. As long as Harry accepts Dumbledore's guidance without question, he cannot mature; and it takes a very large event, Dumbledore's death, to force Harry out of that comfortable area.

However, we can quickly see that is not enough. Harry clearly remains unthinkingly loyal to Dumbledore's memory after the funeral, a fact we hear him express to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Scrimgeour]], then, and again at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] during the summer. The long wander through the wintry English countryside, which causes Ron's departure, coupled with the doubts raised by Skeeter's venomous book, lead Harry to question his mission and whether Dumbledore saw him as anything other than a tool. It is this self-examination that allows Harry to decide for himself that he will follow Dumbledore's instructions, rather than following his own inclination to try and thwart Voldemort's attempt to retrieve the Elder Wand. This same awareness of self assists him in deflecting Aberforth's jeering comments about the validity of Harry's mission. But without the self-examination, Harry would be very unlikely to come to any real understanding of why he was doing what he was doing, and the story would have been significantly weaker as a result; and Skeeter's book, excerpted in various places through this particular part of the story, is key to unbalancing Harry's world to the point that he must actually think about his place in it.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

''The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore'' first appears, and is completely dealt with, in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', and as such there is very little effect that it can have on the rest of the series. However, one point is of some interest here, and we must wonder why Skeeter did not mention it in her book or articles. It is true that Dumbledore never married, and it appears from his comments [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|later]], where he speaks of being &quot;infatuated&quot; with Grindelwald, that in fact he is homosexual. In the United States, it would be impossible to have a known homosexual in charge of a school as large as Hogwarts. We wonder why Skeeter did not make more of Dumbledore's sexual proclivities than she did, despite the more forgiving attitude of the British. The only conclusion we can reach is that perhaps her editor struck those passages out as being too inflammatory for her audience, all of whom presumably passed through Hogwarts while Dumbledore was a teacher or headmaster there. Further, that thesis was likely unsupported by any facts other than chance comments in the letters between Dumbledore and Grindelwald; one thing Dumbledore was good at was discretion.&lt;!-- Note to editors: This is about as much exploration of this topic as we want. Remember, it's a kids' book. --&gt;

==Overview of EHR / EMR==


An '''electronic health record (EHR)''' (also '''electronic patient record''' or '''computerised patient record''') is an evolving concept defined as a systematic collection of electronic health information about individual patients or populations&lt;ref&gt;Gunter, T.D. and Terry, N.P. 2005 [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1550638 The Emergence of National Electronic Health Record Architectures in the United States and Australia: Models, Costs, and Questions] in ''J Med Internet Res'' 7(1)&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a record in digital format that is capable of being shared across different health care settings, by being embedded in network-connected enterprise-wide information systems. Such records may include a whole range of data in comprehensive or summary form, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, and billing information.

It is important to note that an EHR is generated and maintained within an institution, such as a hospital, integrated delivery network, clinic, or physician office.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/informatics/EHR.pdf Electronic Health Records Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Its purpose can be understood as a complete record of patient encounters that allows the automation and streamlining of the workflow in health care settings and increases safety through evidence-based decision support, quality management, and outcomes reporting.&lt;ref name=&quot;HIMSS&quot;&gt;[http://www.himss.org/ASP/topics_ehr.asp HIMSS - Electronic Health Record (EHR)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Factors in purchasing an EHR software==

Purchasing the best EHR takes time. One needs to plan accordingly and the following tips will enable the decision making process purchase much smoother and also result in a successful implementation of EHR&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emrconsultant.com/education/sevenfactors]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Research'''. Get familiarized with the industry and learn what others have to say about the various EHR options available in the market. Look for unbiased information from people like consultants, talks in the blogs and various medical forums.

'''Rational Planning'''. Set EHR goals that are reasonable to attain and design an EHR implementation plan which should include milestones,that one   wants to reach as well as what one is looking to gain from an EHR.

'''Attitude'''. Make sure that the entire personal medical practice has a positive attitude about using an EHR solution. Look out for EHR vendors[[http://www.emrandhipaa.com/administrator/2006/02/21/overwhelming-list-of-emr-companies/ |EHR / EMR vendors]] who look to build this positive attitude. Thus making sure that everyone is on the same page, critical for the success of EHR.

'''ROI'''. Determine what type of Return on Investment can be expected when implementing an EHR system. EHR software can be extremely costly depending on the type of EHR features that one is looking to implement. Therefore, it is important to have an idea of the practice's budget, as well as the cost savings expected from a proper EHR implementation.

'''Technical Competency'''. The practice's staff must be quizzed on how good they are at using computers. Making sure the staff feels comfortable using new technology will help prepare everyone for this transition to an EHR.

'''Hardware'''. Selecting the correct hardware will result in savings of thousands of dollars when purchasing an EHR solution. Not only will it save money but it will also improve the functionality within the EHR. There are several hardware companies that have partnered with EHR vendors, so be sure to ask them what hardware will work best with the EHR product. Ask the EHR vendor if they offer bundled solutions. Another alternative is to speak with an IT consulting company at the beginning to enable a smooth EHR implementation.

==Comparison of EHR solution providers==

== [[The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/Chapter P2P Implementations#Peer2Mail|p2m]] ==
: p2m (peer-to-mail) network is a little different than all of theme above.
: All files you can download straight from an e-mail box.
:1. To do that you have to log any p2m forum in and find a file &quot;hashcode&quot; that contains downloading details.
: The file lets you log automatically to an e-mail box and download files.
: But there is only one p2m client for Linux in this moment and it doesn't work with &quot;hashcode&quot; yet.
: So if you want to use the network find an e-mail box address and password for your file.
:2. Now download the network client called OpenP2M: http://openp2m.sourceforge.net/download.php?language=en
: If the link doesn't work use second one: http://www.pavroo.w8w.pl/files/openp2m-portable0.185.zip
:3. Extract file, get to the new folder using Terminal and run application:
 sh openp2m-linux-java16.sh
:4. Log in an e-mail box and download files.
[[File:P2p12.png|center|600px]]


: OpenP2M home page: http://openp2m.sourceforge.net/index.php?language=en
: The project has been finish time ago but Brazilian developers took it over.
: The last version of OpenP2M is ready to download from: http://www.p2mbrasil.com/v_vinicius_v/openp2m/index.html

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will solve the two equations for the potentials, and put them together to generate a solution for E and B. The two equations are

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi -\mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \phi} {\partial t^2} = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{A} - \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{A}}{\partial t^2}= -\mu_0 J&lt;/math&gt;

==Retarded Time==

Imagine an infinite sheet. At time 0, a current is turned on, and thus, a magnetic field should be produced. What is the field at a very far point immediately after time 0? It is still 0, because the &quot;news&quot; that the current is turned on hasn't reached there yet. Electromagnetic information travel at the speed of light. This isn't surprising since light is an electromagnetic phenomena. We have already seen that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light; it would only make sense if all electromagnetic fields propagate at that speed.

Thus, let us introduce the quantity &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}=t-r/c&lt;/math&gt; called the retarded time. Suppose we have a fixed point P, and that it is currently time t. At another point Q, electromagnetic waves are sent. The waves arriving at P are not the ones generated at that instant, but the ones generated at &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}&lt;/math&gt;. This is because light takes &lt;math&gt;PQ/c&lt;/math&gt; time to travel to P, so we must subtract it from t.

It turns out that the most general solution to the potential equations is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})}{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}||} dV&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \int \frac{\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})}{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}||} dV&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}=t-\frac{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}||}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the potentials are given at the actual time t, while the time appearing in the integral is the retarded time. Also, the integrals are over r'. Third, note that &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}&lt;/math&gt; is a function of both r and r'; keep this in mind when doing integrals and derivatives with retarded time in it.

Last of all, note that the following equation is '''not correct''':

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})}{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}||^2} dV&lt;/math&gt;

as might be expected from analogy. Thus, our formulas for potentials is not a trivial equation; they have to be checked against Maxwell's equations.

On the other hand, since we know that &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; -\nabla \phi = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;, we can &quot;easily&quot; calculate the fields from the potentials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Suppose there is a point charge q traveling with location at all times given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\gamma}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. We will use the formulas developed in the previous section to find the potentials and the fields.

The retarded time is given by &lt;math&gt;t_{ret}=t-\frac{||\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{\gamma}(t_{ret})||}{c}&lt;/math&gt; (since, when we measure go back, the particle wasn't where it is now, it is at &lt;math&gt; \gamma(t_{ret})&lt;/math&gt;) Note that at most one previous instance of the particle is generating the field at the point, since the particle is moving at subluminal speeds. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\eta}=\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{\gamma}(t_{ret})&lt;/math&gt; is a unique vector.

Thus, the scalar potential is

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})}{||\mathbf{\eta}||} dV = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 ||\mathbf{\eta}||} \int \rho(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'},t_{ret})dV&lt;/math&gt;

You might think that equals
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 ||\mathbf{\eta}||}&lt;/math&gt;

but that is '''wrong'''! The reason is very subtle: for the integral to be equal to the total charge, the charge distribution has to be taken at a specific time. However, we are obliged to evaluate the distribution at different times for each point! Thus, the charged particle is &quot;smeared&quot; out! Even though we are considering a point particle, the formula is still wrong, since the correction factor doesn't depend on geometric size!

Suppose the particle is a box of length a and is moving towards us. However, we will observe the particle to have length b, because the light that is simultaneously reaching our eyes from the front and back of the box originated from different times. In the time that light from the back of the box travels the extra distance b, the car traveled distance &lt;math&gt;b-a&lt;/math&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{c}=\frac{b-a}{v}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b=\frac{a}{1-v/c}&lt;/math&gt;; the box is stretched by factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-v/c}&lt;/math&gt; that has nothing to do with the size of the object. This is not an effect of length contraction; this is rather more similar to the Doppler shift.

The correct formula for the scalar potential is 
:&lt;math&gt;\phi=\left(\frac{1}{1-\mathbf{\hat{\eta}} \cdot \mathbf{w}'(t_{ret})/c} \right)\frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 ||\mathbf{\eta}||}&lt;/math&gt;

The current density is &lt;math&gt;\rho \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, and by similar arguments,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\left(\frac{1}{1-\mathbf{\hat{\eta}} \cdot \mathbf{w}'(t_{ret})/c} \right)\frac{\mu_0 q \mathbf{v}}{4 \pi ||\mathbf{\eta}||}=\frac{\mathbf{v}}{c}\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

These are the Lienard-Wiechert Potentials for a moving charge. The correction factors are for the components of velocity pointing to the point we are measuring the potentials at.

Irony is a development kit for implementing languages on the .NET platform. It uses the flexibility and power of the C# language and .NET Framework 3.5 to implement a completely new and streamlined technology of compiler construction.
 
Unlike most existing yacc/lex-style solutions, Irony does not employ any scanner or parser code generation from grammar specifications written in a specialized meta-language. In Irony, the target language grammar is coded directly in C# using operator overloading to express grammar constructs. Irony's scanner and parser modules use the grammar encoded as a C# class to control the parsing process.

The Irony project is hosted on [http://irony.codeplex.com/ CodePlex].

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template checks whether a category is 'in use', checking various combinations of whether the category exists (is not a redlink) and is populated (has pages in it).

=== Usage ===

*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cat in use|Wikipedia}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{cat in use|Wikipedia}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cat in use|Avpoaihaw}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{cat in use|Avpoaihaw}}

The second parameter can be used to say what kind of comparison is done:
*&lt;tt&gt;'''or'''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;– returns true if the category exists ''or'' has members
*&lt;tt&gt;'''and'''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;– true if the category exists ''and'' has members
*&lt;tt&gt;'''xor'''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;– true if the category exists but is empty, or if the category does not exist but has members (slightly weird, admittedly &lt;tt&gt;:D&lt;/tt&gt;)

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;
This template can be used to add a navigation bar to &quot;assessment by topic&quot; category pages that follow the naming convention &quot;Category:''quality''-quality ''topic'' pages&quot; (e.g. Category:Start-quality history pages) in order to facilitate navigation between the various assessment quality categories for that topic. By default, the template will also add the category to the parent categories &quot;''Topic'' pages by quality&quot; (e.g. History pages by quality) and &quot;''quality''-quality pages&quot; (e.g. Start-quality pages).

==Syntax==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{cat quality
 |topic=
 |quality=
 |sort=
 |parent=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===
* '''topic''' - set so that your category is, e.g. &quot;''Quality''-quality ''topic'' pages&quot;
* '''quality''' - should be one of ''FB'', ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''start'', ''stub'', ''NB'', or ''Unassessed''
* '''sort''' (optional) - the key you want to use to sort the category in its parent Category:Foo-quality pages
* '''parent''' (optional) - set so that your importance categories are subcategories of &quot;''parent'' pages by quality&quot;. If not defined, defaults to ''topic''.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

== Usage ==
This template will display, in a horizontal table, the number of pages of each priority, which belong to a particular [[Wikibooks:WikiProject|WikiProject]]. The syntax is as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Priority
 |topic=
 |project=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===
* {{para|topic}} (required) - set so that the priority categories are: &quot;Foo-priority ''topic'' pages&quot;.
* {{para|project}} (optional) - if defined, a refresh button and the following caption is displayed below the table: &quot;WikiProject ''project'' pages by priority&quot;.

== Examples ==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Priority|topic=language|project=Languages}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will result in:

{{Pages by Priority|topic=language|project=Languages}}

;Formatting template layout

By using the {{para|format}} tag, you can change the way the template is formatted using one of Wikibooks' defined styles ([[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]). 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Priority|topic=language|project=Languages|format=toc}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will result in:

{{Pages by Priority|topic=language|project=Languages|format=toc}}

You can use any of the Wikibooks-defined classes in this parameter. In this example, the switch changes the style from the default ''wikitable'' to the ''toc'' style used in the {{tl|Cat priority}} template. All formatting in the template will be changed to the defined style chosen and cannot be modified.

=== Task force example ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Pages by Priority
 |project    = Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |task_force = yes
  |tf_link   = French language task force
  |parent    = Languages
 |format     = toc
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will generate:

{{Pages by Priority
 |project    = Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |task_force = yes
  |tf_link   = French language task force
  |parent    = Languages
 |nocat      = yes
 |format     = toc
}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

== Usage ==
This template will display, in a horizontal table, the number of pages of each quality, which belong to a particular [[Wikibooks:WikiProject|WikiProject]]. The syntax is as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Quality
 |topic=
 |project=
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===
* {{para|topic}} (required) - set so that the quality categories are: &quot;Foo-quality ''topic'' pages&quot;.
* {{para|project}} (optional) - if defined, a refresh button and the following caption is displayed below the table: &quot;WikiProject ''project'' pages by quality&quot;.

== Examples ==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Quality|topic=language|project=Languages}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will result in:

{{Pages by Quality|topic=language|project=Languages}}

;Formatting template layout

By using the {{para|format}} tag, you can change the way the template is formatted using one of Wikibooks' defined styles ([[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]). 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Pages by Quality|topic=language|project=Languages|format=toc}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will result in:

{{Pages by Quality|topic=language|project=Languages|format=toc}}

You can use any of the Wikibooks-defined classes in this parameter. In this example, the switch changes the style from the default ''wikitable'' to the ''toc'' style used in the {{tl|Cat quality}} template. All formatting in the template will be changed to the defined style chosen and cannot be modified.

=== Task force example ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Pages by Quality
 |project    = Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |task_force = yes
  |tf_link   = French language task force
  |parent    = Languages
 |format     = toc
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will generate:

{{Pages by Quality
 |project    = Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |task_force = yes
  |tf_link   = French language task force
  |parent    = Languages
 |nocat      =yes

      <comment>/* Preface */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preface ==
The purpose of this book is to provide practical advice on writing a compiler, together with some practical examples of both compilers and interpreters, in order to break away from the concept that building compilers and interpreters are impossible tasks.

For basic information on the subject, look up the [[Compiler Construction/References|References]] or [[Compiler Construction/External Links|External Links]] Sections of the book and the [[Compiler Construction/Glossary|Glossary]] for the relevant Wikipedia articles.

Some theory is unavoidable, but has been kept to a minimum. If you search the Web for &quot;compiler construction&quot; you will find lots of information and many different approaches. All this book can do is demonstrate a few of the many possible ways of constructing a compiler. After going through this book you should be better able to evaluate other methods.

''This is a Wiki. Readers, please contribute: fix a spelling mistake, rephrase a sentence, expand a paragraph, add a section, write a complete chapter.''

This book has been written in accordance to several goals. The book must be:
* useful and practical - there are several good compiler books available to us, in particular the [[w:Dragon Book (computer science)|Dragon Book]]. However, while technologies for scanners or syntax analyzers have been well-developed and known, we believe that there is a need for a book that covers, for example, script languages or sophisticated dynamic compilation with byte-code.
* non-trivial - this is related to the first goal.
* provides a good coverage of object-oriented languages - 
* have a lot of references - 
* updated - one advantage of an online textbook is that it can be updated to cover new languages or implementation technologies.

We wish the book helps you create a compiler or any tool employing compiler technology.

If you are not familiar with terminology or basic concepts in compilers, you should read the [[Compiler Construction/Introduction|Introduction Chapter]] since the rest of the book will assume it as background information.

== Assumptions ==
;Appropriate Background
To get the most out of this book, your background/experience/capabilities should include most of the following:
* Be familiar with the basic computer architecture, components and execution model.
* Have a few years experience in one or (preferably) more high-level programming languages.
* Be able to cope with programs containing several thousand lines of source code.
* You don't need any specific mathematical background, though some acquaintance with simple algebra might be helpful.
* Programming requires a logical mind capable of precise attention to detail.
* Be prepared to learn about various computer science concepts.  In particular, you should be able to understand EBNF as described in Section 6 of this chapter.  Other concepts will be introduced as required, e.g. stacks, recursion.
* Be prepared to learn about simple [[w:Assembly_language|assembly languages]] and about various aspects of [[w:Computer_architecture|computer architecture]] and [[w:Addressing_mode|addressing modes]].

Even if you do not have the background given above you should still be able to pick up a few ideas by reading the text.

You may be able to implement some or all of the programs supplied in this book. If you have some high-level programming experience you should also be able to play around at extending the capabilities of the interpreter.

;Implementation Software
Since this is a freely available book, it seems appropriate to use some freely available implementation language.

I have chosen to use a subset of C++ in conjunction with the GNU GCC compiler. The subset corresponds roughly to using C++ as a better C, including use of standard C++ libraries, but not getting into the object-oriented side of C++. If you use GNU/Linux then this compiler will/should already be available to you. Otherwise you will have to search the World Wide Web for a free version which will run on your system.

If you use Microsoft Windows then you might like to consider Code::Blocks, a free IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with the MinGW compiler(a port of GCC), which is available from www.codeblocks.org.

;Simplify the Source Language
To reduce the complexity of this book, we will make some simplifying assumptions about the source language which we write a compiler for:
# The source language does not allow subroutine declarations to be nested.
# All identifiers must be declared before use.
# Syntax analysis of the source language can be done in one pass.
# During syntax analysis, we need only look at the next source token to decide what to do next.
In later chapters we will give more consideration to the effects of relaxing these assumptions.

In practical terms these assumptions mean that the source language is easy to translate using simple techniques,
and that some run-time complexity has been eliminated.
: The first assumption rules out Algol 60 and Pascal.
: The second assumption allows one-pass compilation.
: The third assumption rules out Algol 68; according to Hunter, up to 4 passes may be needed for syntax analysis.
: The second and fourth assumptions rule out Fortran; the following are all valid Fortran statements, but you can't even decide what sort of statement each is until you have looked near/at the end of the statement (in Fortran, spaces are not significant, variables need not be declared, and there are no reserved keywords).

The intent of this book is to arm the reader with knowledge and skills to overcome common sleep problems. The reader may be frustrated by sleeping too much or too little, and by the stress and unsatisfactoriness he/she may feel as a result thereof.

=== Going to Sleep ===



=== Waking Up ===

'''Sleep inertia''' is a physiological state characterized by a decline in motor dexterity and a subjective feeling of grogginess immediately following an abrupt awakening. The impaired alertness may interfere with the ability to perform mental or physical tasks. Sleep inertia can also refer to the tendency of a person to want to return to sleeping.

In other words, it's easy to fall back asleep after the alarm has gone off, often multiple times! How are we to overcome this hindrance? It takes 15-20 minutes for the body to overcome the desire to go back to bed after waking up, the last thing you should do is lie back down in bed! People have many different methods to try wake up on time, however unsuccessful they may be.

One might begin by having multiple alarms at different times, and at different places in the room. Alarms can cause you to have intense sleep inertia if your are not awoken at an arousal point (semi-awake state) during your sleep. The product [http://wakemate.com/ WakeMate] claims to wake you at these arousal points, to avoid sleep inertia. The product monitors motion during sleep, and uses actigraphy to analyze and decide to sound the alarm.

If multiple alarms don't work, it is advised to create some obstacles (chairs and the like) to the alarm clock. Moving the obstacles will take more time and will get your blood flowing a little bit. Stretching (especially around the neck and shoulders) might also help, as the body can become very sore from lying down for so long. If you don't find it easy to fall asleep in a chair, you may set one beside your alarm clock so you may sit for 15-20 min (instead of lying down) and wake up.

=== Polyphasic ===

Polyphasic sleeping refers to trading core sleep for 20-minute naps during the day. The conversion is generally one 20-minute nap for 1.5 hours of core sleep. These naps should be as evenly spaced out as possible, but may be moved according to your schedule.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Sleep Schedule !! Total Amount of Sleep (hours) !! Amount of Core Sleep (hours) !! Number of 20-min Naps
|-
| Monophasic || 8 || 8 || none
|-
| Siesta || 6.3 || 6 || 1
|-
| 2-nap Everyman || 5.2 || 3.5 || 2
|-
| 3-nap Everyman || 4 || 3 || 3
|-
| 4-nap Everyman || 2.8 || 1.5 || 4 or 5
|-
| Uberman || 2 || 0 || 6
|-
| Dymaxion || 2 || 0 || 4 30-min naps
|}

The Everyman polyphasic schedule is most common since it can easily be adapted to a normal work schedule. For example, one might sleep from midnight to 3am, taking naps at 7:30, noon, and 6pm. To account for a typical work schedule, the naps are not evenly spaced.

The Uberman is considered the most difficult of the 20-min nap variety. There is no core sleep, and the naps can't be missed by more than 30 minutes or you will feel very tired! This is in contrast to the Everyman schedule, where naps may be missed by a few hours without much consequence.

The Dymaxion is known to be more difficult than the Uberman because the body's tendency to fall into deep sleep after 20 minutes, making it very difficult to wake from a nap.

      <comment>/* Syntax Analysis */  tokens -&gt; Tokens at the start of sentence 2 in paragraph 2. Also a bit of beautifying in paragraph 2.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Syntax Analysis ==
This is alternatively known as parsing. It is roughly the equivalent of checking that some ordinary text written in a natural language (e.g. English) is grammatically correct (without worrying about meaning).

The purpose of syntax analysis or parsing is to check that we have a valid sequence of tokens. Tokens are valid sequence of symbols, keywords, identifiers etc. Note that this sequence need not be meaningful; as far as syntax goes, a phrase such as &quot;'''true''' + 3&quot; is valid but it doesn't make any sense in most programming languages.

The parser takes the tokens produced during the lexical analysis stage, and attempts to build some kind of in-memory structure to represent that input. Frequently, that structure is an 'abstract syntax tree' (AST). 

The parser needs to be able to handle the infinite number of possible valid programs that may be presented to it. The usual way to define the language is to specify a ''grammar''. A grammar is a set of rules (or ''productions'') that specifies the syntax of the language (i.e. what is a valid sentence in the language).

There can be more than one grammar for a given language. Furthermore, it is easier to build parsers for some grammars than for others.

Fortunately, there exists a class of programs (often called `compiler-compilers', even though this is a silly name) that can take a grammar and generate a parser for it in some language. (Sound familiar?). Examples of such programs are:
* ANTLR (targeting Java, C++ and C#)
* SableCC (targeting Java)
* YACC (targeting C)
* YACC++ (targeting C++)
* plus many others....
These can make the compiler-writer's job considerably easier, ''if'' she can write down the grammar for her language.

=== Recursive Descent Parsing ===
A ''recursive descent parser'' is a top-down parser built from a set of mutually-recursive procedures (or a non-recursive equivalent) where each such procedure usually implements one of the production rules of the grammar. Thus the structure of the resulting program closely mirrors that of the grammar it recognizes.

A predictive parser is a recursive descent parser with no backup. Predictive parsing is possible only for the class of LL(k) grammars, which are the context-free grammars for which there exists some positive integer k that allows a recursive descent parser to decide which production to use by examining only the next k tokens of input. (The LL(k) grammars therefore exclude all ambiguous grammars, as well as all grammars that contain left recursion. Any context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent grammar that has no left recursion, but removal of left recursion does not always yield an LL(k) grammar.) A predictive parser runs in linear time.

Recursive descent with backup is a technique that determines which production to use by trying each production in turn. Recursive descent with backup is not limited to LL(k) grammars, but is not guaranteed to terminate unless the grammar is LL(k). Even when they terminate, parsers that use recursive descent with backup may require exponential time.

Although predictive parsers are widely used, programmers often prefer to create LR or LALR parsers via parser generators without transforming the grammar into LL(k) form.

Some authors define the recursive descent parsers as the predictive parsers. Other authors use the term more broadly, to include backed-up recursive descent.[citation needed]

==== Example parser ====
The following [[w:EBNF|EBNF]] grammar (for Niklaus Wirth's PL/0 programming language, from Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs) is in LL(1) form (for simplicity, ident and number are assumed to be terminals):

 program = block &quot;.&quot; .
 
 block =
     [&quot;const&quot; ident &quot;=&quot; number {&quot;,&quot; ident &quot;=&quot; number} &quot;;&quot;]
     [&quot;var&quot; ident {&quot;,&quot; ident} &quot;;&quot;]
     {&quot;procedure&quot; ident &quot;;&quot; block &quot;;&quot;} statement .
 
 statement =
     [ident &quot;:=&quot; expression
     | &quot;call&quot; ident
     | &quot;begin&quot; statement {&quot;;&quot; statement} &quot;end&quot;
     | &quot;if&quot; condition &quot;then&quot; statement
     | &quot;while&quot; condition &quot;do&quot; statement
     ] .
 
 condition =
     &quot;odd&quot; expression
     | expression (&quot;=&quot;|&quot;#&quot;|&quot;&lt;&quot;|&quot;&lt;=&quot;|&quot;&gt;&quot;|&quot;&gt;=&quot;) expression
     .
 
 expression = [&quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;] term {(&quot;+&quot;|&quot;-&quot;) term} .
 
 term = factor {(&quot;*&quot;|&quot;/&quot;) factor} .
 
 factor = ident | number | &quot;(&quot; expression &quot;)&quot; .

Terminals are expressed in quotes (except for ident and number). Each nonterminal is defined by a rule in the grammar.

Notice how closely the predictive parser below mirrors the grammar above. There is a procedure for each nonterminal in the grammar. Parsing descends in a top-down manner, until the final nonterminal has been processed. The program fragment depends on a global variable, sym, which contains the next symbol from the input, and the global function getsym, which updates sym when called.

==== Implementation in functional languages ====

Recursive descent parsers are particularly easy to implement in functional languages such as Haskell or ML.

=== Table-Driven Parsing ===

=== Operator Precedence Parsing ===
Operator precedence parsing is used in shift-reduce parsing. '''''operator grammar''''' No production has two nonterminal symbols in sequence on the right hand side. An operator grammar can be parsed using shift-reduce parsing and precedence relations between terminal symbols to find handles. This strategy is known as operator precedence.

=== Parsing via a Tool - yacc/bison ===
Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:en:GNU bison|GNU bison]] article.

=== Parsing via a Tool - JavaCC ===

Please refer to Lexical Analysis: Scanning via a Tool - JavaCC for information on generating a token manager.

==== Using the generated Token manager ====

In order to use the generated token manager, an instance of it has to be created. When doing so, the constructor expects a Reader as the source of the input data (other sources are also possible, see the JavaCC documentation).

Once created, the token manager object can be used to get tokens via the 

 Token ''ParserName''TokenManager.getNextToken() throws ParseError;

method.

Each Token object as returned by the getNextToken() method. Such a Token object provides a field ''kind'' which identifies the token (''ParserName'''''Constants.java''' defines the corresponding constants). It also contains the field ''image'', which just holds the matched input data as a String.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intermediate Representation ==
The form of the internal representation among different compilers varies widely. If the back end is called as a subroutine by the front end then the intermediate representation is likely to be some form of annotated parse tree, possibly with supplementary tables.
If the back end operates as a separate program then the intermediate representation is likely to be some low-level pseudo assembly language or some register transfer language (it could be just numbers, but debugging is easier if it is human-readable).

== Optimization ==
On modern computers, a compiler can be considered to have
satisfactory performance if it translates a moderate size source program
(say about 1000 lines) in a matter of seconds.
The way to get a compiler with satisfactory performance
is more or less the same way you would get any program performing well.
* Design using good algorithms.
* Ensure your data structures match the algorithms. 
* Structure using modules with clean simple interfaces.
* Implement using clear straightforward code.
* When there is an overall performance problem
** Measure the actual performance in reasonable detail.
** Identify the troublesome areas.
** Redesign and re-implement these problem areas.

In this book we will consider
various algorithms and data structures
and discuss their likely impact on performance.

Note that '''actual measurement is crucial''',
since the problems are often not where you guess they might be.
For your initial implementation
you may well have selected simple algorithms
which are known to perform poorly
in order to get something working quickly.
Nevertheless, you should still measure performance in detail,
since there may be some other source
of (at least some of) your problems.

: If you are very lucky, your implementation language might have some optional facility for selectively measuring CPU time. Take care to only activate such a feature for a few crucial routines; the timing overhead could easily exceed the execution time for small routines and distort the result.

: More commonly you will be unlucky and will have to explicitly add timing code to selected routines; make sure you can easily disable it and enable it as required. Typically you will have to insert calls to some CPU timing routine at the beginning and end of a routine, and then subtract the two values to get the time for that routine, which will include the time for any routines called by it.

Various measurements on the performance of actual compilers
have been reported over the years.
Specific areas which have been known to cause problems include:
* Multiple routine calls during lexical analysis for each and every source character.
* Skipping white space during lexical analysis.
* Skipping over a comment.
* Decoding a tightly packed parse table during syntax analysis.
* Looking things up in the name table during semantic analysis.
* Determining whether some name is a reserved keyword or a user-definable identifier.

An extensive list of optimizations can be found on Wikipedia in the [[wikipedia:Compiler optimization|compiler optimization article]]. Optimization is a very rich and complex topic, so this chapter will only attempt to introduce the basics.

Optimization within a compiler is concerned with improving in some way the generated object code '''while ensuring the result is identical'''. Technically, a better name for this chapter might be &quot;Improvement&quot;, since compilers only attempt to improve the operations the programmer has requested. Optimizations fall into three categories:

* '''Speed'''; improving the runtime performance of the generated object code. This is the most common optimization
* '''Space'''; reducing the size of the generated object code
* '''Safety'''; reducing the possibility of data structures becoming corrupted (for example, ensuring that an illegal array element is not written to)

Unfortunately, many &quot;speed&quot; optimizations make the code larger, and many &quot;space&quot; optimizations make the code slower -- this is known as the [[w:space-time tradeoff|space-time tradeoff]].

===Common Optimization Algorithms===
Common optimization algorithms deal with specific cases:

# Dead Code Elimination
# Common Sub-expression Elimination
# Copy Propagation
# Code Motion
# Induction Variable Elimination
# Reduction In Strength
# Function Chunking

==== Dead Code Elimination ====
Dead code elimination is a size optimization (although it also produces some speed improvement) that aims to remove logically impossible statements from the generated object code. Dead code is code which will never execute, regardless of input

Consider the following program:
 a = 5
 if (a != 5) {
   // Some complicated calculation
 }
 ...

It is obvious that the complicated calculation will never be performed; since the last value assigned to '''a''' before the '''if''' statement is a constant, we can calculate the result at compile-time. simple substitution of arguments produces &lt;code&gt;if (5 != 5)&lt;/code&gt;, which is '''false'''. Since the body of an &lt;code&gt;if(false)&lt;/code&gt; statement will never execute - it is ''dead code'' we can rewrite the code:
 a = 5
 // Some statements

The algorithm was used to identify and remove sections of dead code

==== Common Sub-expression Elimination ====
Common sub-expression elimination is a speed optimization that aims to reduce unnecessary recalculation by identifying, through code-flow, expressions (or parts of expressions) which will evaluate to the same value: ''the re-computation of an expression can be avoided if the expression has previously been computed and the values of the operands have not changed since the previous computation''.

Consider the following program:
 a = b + c
 d = e + f
 g = b + c

In the above example, the first and last statement's right hand side are identical and the value of the operands do not change between the two statements; thus this expression can be considered as having a ''common sub-expression''.

The common sub-expression can be avoided by storing its value in a temporary variable which can cache its result. After applying this Common Sub-expression Elimination technique the program becomes:
 t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = b + c
 a = t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
 d = e + f
 g = t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

Thus in the last statement the re-computation of the expression &lt;code&gt;b + c&lt;/code&gt; is avoided.

== Copy Propagation ==
Given an assignment x=y,replace later uses of x with y,provided there are no intervening assignments to x or y.
Here the code will become smaller.
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        x[i]=a;
        sum=x[i]+a;
        
        instead of this we can use:
        x[i]=a;
        sum=a+a; 
      
&lt;/source&gt;

  For x[i]=a, is copy statements.Use of 'a' for 'x[i]',
 whenever possible after copy statement.Here it may not
 appear to be code improvement,but opens up scope
 for other optimizations.


==== Code Motion ====
{{wikipedia|loop-invariant code motion}}

This optimization technique mainly deals to reduce the number of source code lines in the program. For example, consider the code below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    x = y + z;
    a[i] = 6 * i + x * x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The calculations &lt;code&gt;x = y + z&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x * x&lt;/code&gt; can be moved outside the loop since within they are loop invariant - they do not change over the iterations of the loop - so our optimized code will be something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
x = y + z;
t1 = x * x;
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    a[i] = 6 * i + t1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code can be optimized further. For example, [[#Reduction In Strength | strength reduction]] could remove the two multiplications inside the loop (&lt;code&gt;6*i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt;).

Another example of code motion:

 for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++)
 {
   a = a + c;
 }

In the above mentioned code, a = a + c can be moved out of the 'for' loop, and the new code is

 a = a + 10*c;

==== Induction Variable Elimination ====
A variable is said to be  induction variable if this gets increased and decreased by a fixed amount on every iteration of a loop.
ex: 
       for(i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
        {
         j=17*i;
        }
Here i,j are induction variables 
If two or more induction variables in loop, it may be possible to get rid of all but one. 
Eventually we can eliminate j from this loop.

==== Reduction In Strength ====
This concept refers to the compiler optimization method of substituting some machine instruction(s) by cheaper one(s) maintaining equivalence in results. Since some operators have different strength i.e use different space in the memory. This type of optimization can generate high gains especially when targeting different hardware and the compiler is aware of the subtle differences it can benefit from.

'''For ex- Strength of *(Multiply) is &quot;Higher&quot; than +(Add).&lt;br /&gt;
So,in this type of optimization Higher Strength Operators are replaced by Lower Strength Operators.'''
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example'''&lt;br /&gt;
Given that &lt;br /&gt;
Length(S1 || S2) &lt;br /&gt;
where S1 and S2 have some values.&lt;br /&gt;

So If we apply the rule then&lt;br /&gt;
Length(S1 || S2) ---(Replaced By)--&gt; [Length(S1) + Length(S2)]&lt;br /&gt;

As + operation is cheaper than the ||.&lt;br /&gt;
and it was Cleared by the above example that there will no change in Result.

==== Function Chunking ====
Function chunking is a compiler optimization for improving code locality. Profiling information is used to move rarely executed code outside of the main function body. This allows for memory pages with rarely executed code to be swapped out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Known Languages Conceptual Implementations ==
Since this book is about the compiler, the following studies do not detail much syntax or language designs but implementation techniques. If you are familiar with languages below, it may help understand compilers by understanding how those familiar concepts (like dynamic binding) are implemented.

Furthermore, we don't consider practical implication of decisions on the language design. Some tricky situations, like problems of reference dependency or the precedence of operators, may not occur most of the times, but those are often the interests of language implementors.

''&lt;span lang=&quot;la&quot; xml:lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;Mucuna pruriens&lt;/span&gt;'' commonly known as cowitch or velvet bean is sometimes used as a coffee substitute, however, cooking leaches out chemical compounds such as levodopa (L-DOPA). If consumed in large quantities as food, unprocessed they are toxic to non-ruminant mammals, including humans.

This recipe shows how to leech out dangerous toxins while still keeping the nutrient enzymes and L-DOPA that have long been used in traditional Ayurvedic Indian medicine for diseases including Parkinson's Disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

#Put 1⅛ (1.125) cups (265½ [265.5] mL) of almonds, ½ (0.5) cup (118 mL) cowitch and ½ (0.5) cup (118 mL) almonds seperatly into three (3) bowls of water. Make sure they are covered completely underneath at least one (1) inch (2&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;²⁷⁄&lt;big&gt;₅₀&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [2.54] cm) of water. This is called sprouting or steeping. Leave them in the refrigerator overnight, and then drain the water. Absolutely do not drink this water, since it has absorbed many of the toxins.
#Put the 1⅛ cups of almonds from the previous step into a blender and add 3⅜ (3.375) cups (796½ [796.5] mL) of fresh water. The mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can either strain it through a fine sieve by squeezing the milk from the moist mixture through the sieve with a wooden spoon, or simply place mesh sometimes called a sprout or nut-milk bag that is usually made of nylon on top of the pitcher in order to squeeze the mixture through the mesh by hand. You may either discard the pulp or use it for other recipes, such as mixing it into almond [[Cookbook:Agar Jelly|agar jelly]]. Wash and dry your hands, and then pour the [[Cookbook:Almond Milk|almond milk]] into ice cube trays. Place the ice cube trays into the freezer and remove when frozen.
#Now put the rest of the almonds and cowitch with three (3) cups (708 mL) of fresh water into the blender. Just like before, this mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can in the same way as you did in the previous step. Discard the pulp, and absolutely do not eat it, since it has many toxins. Do not drink or taste the liquid at this point. Wash and dry your hands, and put this liquid back in the blender. Blend in the dates, matcha and milk thistle. If you are only going to make part of the mixture now, refrigerate what you’re not going to use and save for later in the refrigerator. 
#When well blended, pulse the liquid mixture with ice made from the almond milk until you reach the consistency you desire. Serve immediately.

== Variations ==
Instead of making [[Cookbook:Almond Milk|raw almond milk]] from scratch, you could simply purchase almond milk or use cow’s milk. Just bear in mind using cow’s milk would make this recipe not be vegan, if that is important to you. There is a recipe for cooked almond milk, [[Cookbook:Sharbat bil Loz|Sharbat bil Loz]], that involves a stove, although that is not advisable, as that will destroy the food enzymes in the almond milk.

Unlike dates, artificial sweeteners usually do not have any nutrients. If you would like to substitute the dates for something else, try natural sweeteners, such or stevia or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] instead of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or syrup, if you can. Just bear in mind using honey would make this recipe not be vegan, if that is important to you.

If you do not have milk thistle, you can empty one serving of a liver/organ support/shield or milk thistle supplement, such as a 200 mg (&lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;²²⁄&lt;big&gt;₃₁₂₅&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [0.00704] oz) serving of milk thistle capsules, into the mixture by simply twisting open the capsules with your dry hands.

== Warnings ==
*Do not to use bitter almonds, since the combination of bitter almonds and water releases cyanide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bitter Almond&quot;&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Bitter Almonds
|accessdate=2009-05-14
|publisher=revolutionhealth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Do not keep for the mixture from step 3 above for more than two (2) days, since it spoils quickly. It's best to make it fresh.
*Do not exceed three (3) servings per day.

This section should be where you are going to plan out your entire system before you build it.  It doesn't always work out this way and you might find yourself coming back and changing things as you actually code your project.  It is not recommended to write the design before you have done some coding.  From your Analysis you should have an idea of what you are going to produce and have sourced some text books to get you started.  Complete a couple of simple example programs before writing your Design, this way you'll have a better idea of the capabilities of the language you are using.  And remember, don't be afraid to come back and change things!

== Sections to Include ==
To get full marks you should aim to write something about all of the following.  Some projects won't require all sections, for example you might not have a database and therefore have no need to include SQL.  It's always best to check with your teacher about what you need to include.

===Overall System Design===

To give a clear idea of how we are going to complete our project it's a good idea to use an IPSO chart.  IPSO stands for Input, Process, Storage, Output.  Every project should have information under these headings. An example is below:
* Input - these might include various types of human interaction and loading data from external sources such as databases, web feeds, scientific instruments etc.
* Process - this is the important bit.  What are you going to process, what is it going to calculate?
* Storage - this will record all the ways that you are going to store data, it might include database table names, structure names and external files such as xml and csv.
* Output - What will the end user be given, what will be output to the screen?

Let's take a look at an example:

|-
! Inputs
! Processes
! Storage
! Outputs
|-
| User Details&lt;/br&gt;New purchase
| Monthly sales&lt;/br&gt;Highest performing Salesperson&lt;/br&gt;Highest paying customer
| Database tables:&lt;/br&gt;Customer&lt;/br&gt;Stock Item&lt;/br&gt;Purchase
| Receipt&lt;/br&gt;Monthly sales chart
|}

===Modular Design===
When you design your system you need to split it into smaller components. Like this book having different chapters about different things, your project should have different parts (modules) that do different things, but when they are combined they make up a complete whole.

There are two ways to split your project into modules, one is code based and the other is form based.  Ideally your project should be using both methods. 
====Form/Navigation Based====
If your program has lots of different functionality and uses a website or an application you probably have different pages to perform different tasks.  You are also able to navigate from one page to another starting at your main menu.  You need to show the different forms/pages that you use and how you would get from one to another:
[[Image:Files11_directory_hierarchy.svg|thumb|150px]]
*Main Menu
**Adjust Products
***Add Products
***Remove Products
***Update Products
**Sell Item
**Adjust Staff
***Add Staff
***Remove Staff
***Update Staff
**Reports
***Chocolates
***Beer
***Sausages
Even better than this you could draw a nice diagram on how everything links together.

====Code Based====
If you are writing a very complicated coding project then you might be using modules of code, some modules that build off other modules.  You might also be using Classes and you need to show the class inheritance diagrams

===Definition of data requirements (Design Data Dictionary)===
Incredibly similar to your Analysis.  If you haven't made any changes since then and it is normalised, just copy the data into here.  You'll have to do a little more work in a second on the validation areas.

===Definition of record structure===
If you are saving anything to text files or XML files mention here how those files are organised.

If you are using records or structures in your code mention them here and how they work

===Validation required===
If you are getting the user to input data you will definitely need to validate the data that they insert.  For example if you are getting them to fill in a new customer record you will have fields such as Title, First Name, Date of Birth, Number of toes.  You want them to input data such as:
 Mr.
 Peter
 16/07/93
 9
And what will happen if they type in the following:
 Mrr.
 Peter8
 jelly
 -8
Well it'll probably break your system, we need to prevent them from entering '''garbage''' into our system. If we allow rubbish data our calculations won't work, our reports will be wrong and the data will be useless. Remember this rule:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Garbage In, Garbage Out&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To prevent '''garbage''' being input we are going to validate, that means check, each item of data that a person inputs into the system.  We can do this in many ways
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Validation Check !! Description !! Suitable Applicable Field !! Valid data !! Erroneous Data
|-
| Datatype || Checks that only a certain data type is inserted into a field.  Such as a date or an integer || date of birth || 18/02/97 || 13/13/13 or &quot;clot&quot;
|-
| Length || Checks that the data entered has the correct number of characters. For example a British phone number is always 11 characters, or the ID of a shopping item might always be 5 characters || Postcode || E4 7HJ || EEE668 JUY
|-
| Range || Checks that the data is within a set range, being greater than, less than, between, etc. For example the age of someone will be greater than 0, the number of days in a month would be greater or equal to 28 and less than 31. || Number of kidneys || 2 || 45
|-
| Presence || This is when you need to make inputting data compulsory, the user isn't allowed to miss a field out.  For example, they must state whether they agree or disagree with a legal statement, they must enter a postcode || Phone number || 07070707070 || (blank)
|-
| Lookup/List || This is when you only allow set values into a field.  For example a Title would only allow for &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;Miss.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot;.  Anything else would be erroneous.  You can implement this normally by using a drop down list || Gender || Female || Jackal
|}
Most of these validation checks are built into database packages, so if you create a database and then use a development suite to create the forms, the validation will be built into the forms automatically.  If you don't have this privilege, you'll have to hard code it.  That of course will come in the Technical Solution stage.  Let's take a look at our original garbage data, did we manage to use validation to stop all the nonsense getting into our database?
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Field Name !! Validation Checks !! Description !! Error message !! Data !! Caught 
|-
| Title || Lookup (&quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, &quot;Miss.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot;) || only allow correct formatted titles || Please insert a valid Title || Mrr. || Yes
|-
| First Name ||  Presence || make sure name is a sensible length and present || Please insert a name || Peter8 || No, we can't catch people being purposely malicious, you could try and code some checks but beware of the '[[w:Scunthorpe_problem | Scunthorpe problem]]'!
|-
| Date of Birth || Datatype(Date)|| Make sure they have input a correct DoB || Please insert a valid date || jelly || Yes
|-
| Number of toes || 14 &gt; Length &gt;= 0 || Make sure they have a sensible number of toes || Please insert a number between 0 and 13 || -8 || Yes
|}
For your report you need to write a table like the one above, though you can omit the last two columns.

{{CPTExtension|title=Validation notation: Regex}}
When you are trying to enforce a format to data being input, you might want to use validation notation.  For example if you want to specify that a class name must be a two digit number followed by three letters, for example 12PKP, You could write:
:&lt;number&gt;&lt;number&gt;&lt;letter&gt;&lt;letter&gt;&lt;letter&gt;
Or even more simply:
:99LLL

The regex expression equivilent could be:
:/^[0-9][0-9][a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]$/
or
:/^[0-9]{2}[a-zA-Z]{3}$/
{{Robox/Close}}

===File organisation and processing (if appropriate)===
*File sizes
*Data Volumes

===Database design including normalised relations (if appropriate)===
If you are making a database then you need to include an E-R Diagram.  You should show the diagram and explain what each of the relationships mean. For example:

* A student can have many bookings
* Each booking only has one student
* Each booking only has one book
* A book can be involved in many bookings

===Sample of planned SQL queries (if appropriate)===
If you are making a database you need to write about the SQL that you use to '''SELECT''', '''INSERT''', '''UPDATE''' and '''DELETE''' things from your tables.  In some cases you might also be writing the code behind making the individual tables, the data definition language.  In fact those headings are exactly what you need to use.

{{CPTExtension|title=Reserved words}}
When you are querying your database you might get some unexpected errors, where a query fails to run when it doesn't appear to have any problem with it.  This may be due to using a resevered word in your query.  SQL has a lot of reserved words, words that have special meanings, and if you use one of these in a query it '''won't''' treat it as a field name.  For example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
SELECT Username, Password FROM tblUsers
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This might bring up an error as &lt;code&gt;Password&lt;/code&gt; is a resevered word in SQL.  To get by this problem you might want to change your fieldnames to something a little more sensible or put the fieldname in square brackets:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
SELECT Username, [Password] FROM tblUsers
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
There are many other reserved words out there, so be careful:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
PERCENT, PLAN, PRECISION, EXISTS, PRIMARY, PRINT, PUBLIC,
BACKUP, FOREIGN, READ,FREETEXT, FROM, REFERENCES, BULK, 
FULL, RESTORE, GROUP, IDENTITY, RULE, SAVE, INDEX, SELECT, 
STATISTICS, KEY, TABLE, NATIONAL, DATABASE, UNION, DELETE, 
DISK, ON, USER, PASSWORD&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Different databases have different sets of reserved words, you can find a good list [http://drupal.org/node/141051 here]

Note: If you are not using a SQL server (for example, using MySQL with PHP) you may need to use `backticks` instead of square bracket notation.
{{Robox/Close}}

====SELECT====
This section should list all the SQL you have written that returns selections of records.  You should describe in plain English where the SQL is used and what it does and then include the SQL with any annotations that you need.  For example:

'''English Description:'''&lt;br/&gt;
This SQL statement selects the details (ID, Name, Price, Description) of a product which has been selected by the user.  So that the user can view the product detail on the preview screen before buying the product

'''SQL:'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=SQL&gt;
SELECT ID, Name, Price, Description FROM Products
WHERE ID=?
&lt;/source&gt;

====INSERT====
This section should list all the SQL you have written that inserts new records into your database.  You should describe in plain English where the SQL is used and what it does and then include the SQL with any annotations that you need.  For example:

'''English Description:'''&lt;br/&gt;
This SQL statement adds a new high score along with the date the score was achieved for a users account.

'''SQL:'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=SQL&gt;
INSERT INTO Scores (ID, DateofScore, Score)
VALUES (?,?,?)
&lt;/source&gt;

====UPDATE====
This section should list all the SQL you have written that updates an old record with new details.  You should describe in plain English where the SQL is used and what it does and then include the SQL with any annotations that you need.  For example:

'''English Description:'''&lt;br/&gt;
This SQL statement updates the date of birth of a user, after they have updated the form that launches when they first log into the program.

'''SQL:'''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=SQL&gt;
UPDATE User
SET DoB=?
WHERE ID=?
&lt;/source&gt;


====Data Definition Language====
If you have designed your database tables using a program such as [[w:Open_ModelSphere|Open ModelSphere]] you can then define the code behind making your tables which you can then feed into MySQL or MSSQL to create your database.  Get some credit for this and list your DDL. For example, the command to create a table named '''employees''' with a few sample columns would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE employees (   
    id            INTEGER   PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name    CHAR(50)  null,
    last_name     CHAR(75)  not null,
    dateofbirth   DATE      null
);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Identification of storage media===
This is quite easy if you remember the hardware section of [[../../Computer Components, The Stored Program Concept and the Internet/Hardware Devices#Secondary_Storage_Devices|Unit 2]].  You must recommend how your system will be '''distributed''' to and then '''run''' by the user.

You need to start off by calculating how much space the program will take up to distribute and how much space it will take up when it is running.

Distributing your software will require that you transmit the data to the user somehow.  This could be through a CD-ROM, USB drive, DVD-ROM or internet connection.  Why would you pick each?  Which would be most suitable?  Think about security, speed, having a backup, size of files to transmit.

Running the system will in most cases require the user to be able to write new files to your system, saving high scores, new purchases etc.  How big will the system feasibly get?  You need to recommend something that will allow the user to read and write to, something that is secure and reliable, and something that will be big enough and fast enough to handle everything. A CD-ROM would not be suitable here, why?  Hard Disks could be suitable, why?

===Identification of suitable algorithms for data transformation, pseudocode of these algorithms===
You will be asked to provide examples of designing your code. If you have lots of code then pick the 6-8 most interesting examples.  For each bit of code try to include the following:

* Title
* Plain English explanation
* Pseudo code

For example with a log in screen you could write the following:
====Plain English====
This code takes the username and password input by the user and then checks them against the login details stored in the login file.

====Pseudo Code====
var userName = Textbox.username
var password = Textbox.password

load the acceptable login names and passwords from the text file and store it into var acceptableLogins

If userName and password are in acceptableLogins Then
:Login Allowed
:Show Menu screen
Else
:Show error message
End If

===Class definitions(diagrams) and detail of object behaviours and methods (if appropriate)===
[[Image:Oop-uml-class-example.png|thumb|this is a simple diagram, you would have to explain each of the attributes and subroutines]]
If you have used Object Orientation in writing your program (highly recommended to get in the top mark band) you need to describe it here.  You must mention the following:
* Class names
* Any inheritance
* Attributes (variables) and whether they are public or private, explaining what they are for
* Function names with return values and description
* Procedures names with return values and description
* Any overriding performed

===User interface design (HCI) rationale===
In all projects you will have some form of user interface, in nearly all cases this will be a [[w:GUI | GUI]].  This section actions you to show and explain the methods that you are going to capture data (inputs), and the ways you are going to display/print out data(outputs).  Notice in each case it says sample, so you don't have to show how every form/prinout will look, 4 examples of each should suffice.  You could hand draw each, or draw them using an arts package like inkscape, alternatively you could design them in a package like Visual Studio and use the design views of the form.  DO NOT use screen shots of the final code running, we need to see your designs.

====UI sample of planned data capture and entry designs====
This section need to show the designs of your forms / interfaces.  Don't be afraid to include early screen shots of forms in design view.  Remember we are not marking this section on working code, but on the design ideas behind each form / interface.  You must mention your reasoning:
* Tick Boxes / radio buttons
* Drop down lists
* positioning of elements
* colour schemes
* ease of navigation

You can do this by annotating each screen shot.

====UI sample of planned valid output designs====
This might be one or more of several things:
* the designs of reports that your system is planned to produce
* the high score board of a game or quiz
* the game screen showing points health etc.
* a graph showing data
* anything that is calculated and shown to the user

Using the same rationale as the previous section you must complete annotated versions of these.

===Description of measures planned for security and integrity of data===
Security and integrity are slightly different things.

'''Security''' means preventing unauthorised people accessing areas of your work.   This might include students accessing each others marks for a test, customers accessing other customers' details, students accessing the marks to a test or anything that conflicts with the data protection act.  To do this you need to implement security systems such as usernames and passwords, access rights and restricted areas.  You might have certain buttons and areas that only appear for certain users.  If they are restricted users there will be parts of your system that they wont see, and for the admin user, they should be able to see everything.

'''Integrity''' is making sure that your data doesn't 'corrupt'.  This means making sure that certain bits of data always take on the correct format or don't violate certain rules.  For example, if you had a date of birth, you wouldn't want people to be inserting their name in that field.  How do you do this?  With validation rules.  Write about them here.  You might also want to make sure that your database maintains its [[w:referential integrity | referential integrity]].  This will prevent people linking to records in other tables that don't exist.  Talk about how you would do this.

===Description of measures planned for system security===
You don't want unauthorised people gaining access to your data.  This might include stalkers trying to find out personal details stored on your system, students trying to cheat etc. You might recommend that the end user keeps data in secure locations or behind operating system passwords.  Or that there is a main password to get into your system.

You should also mention how the system will be recovered in the circumstance that it becomes corrupted or lost.  Mention the method by which you will recover the system/reinstall etc.

===Overall test strategy===
There are several different ways that you could test your system.  This section asks you to consider each and mention how you are going to test your system with regard to each.  Don't just describe each, you must talk about how you will use them to test your system

====Black-box testing====
[[File:Blackbox.svg|thumb|200px|Black box testing diagram]]
In this mode you don't care about the code behind what you are testing, you just know what results should come about from particular data inputs.  This is useful for complex sub routines that have multiple possible inputs. For example testing a search algorithm.  If you do come across any problems then you will have to find and fix them for that we use...

====White-box testing====
[[File:CPT-Testing-Whitebox.svg|thumb|200px|White box testing diagram, where each coloured line is a route through the code]]
In this you are going to test as many routes 'through' your code as you can.  This means looking at your code and trying to come up with tests that will test every logical statement that you have written.  For example if you have an if statement that checks if a password is correct or not, put a test in place to see if it works when the correct password is inserted '''AND''' when an incorrect password is inserted. Things you should include:
*If statements
*While loops

====Trace tables====
This is a great way to find and fix problems.  You should try to pick two or three of your most complex pieces of code to perform a trace table upon.  By using this you prove that the code works.

== Tor (The Onion Router) ==
: Tor is a virtual computers network makes almost anonymoust internet access.
: It can be used with web browsers, instant messengers or IRC networks.
: But some internet providers can block access to Tor network.
::1. To have the lastes version of Tor add Tor project repositories:
 sux
 mousepad /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
 deb http://mirror.noreply.org/pub/tor sid main
::2. Next receive public key:
 gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 94C09C7F
 gpg --export 94C09C7F | apt-key add -
::3. And install &quot;tor&quot; and &quot;polipo&quot; packages:
 apt-get update
 apt-get install tor tor-geoipdb polipo
::4. Download &quot;polipo&quot; config file from the project page (Save link as...):
::: https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/config/polipo.conf
::5. Change the file name from &quot;polipo.conf&quot; for &quot;config&quot;.
::6. Move it out as root to folder :
 /etc/polipo/ 
::7. Re-start polipo with command as root:
 /etc/init.d/polipo restart
::8. Install &quot;Tor Button&quot; add-on for Iceweasel web browser from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2275/
::: and re-start Iceweasel.
::9. Check your IP address for example here: http://www.checkip.org/
::10. Then click on the TOR button (or an onion icon) in down right corner and check IP again ;-)

&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

Imagine that once you have delivered your project to your user they want to pay someone else to make improvements on it.  This is very common in industry where IT projects can be decades old (The IBM [[w:CICS#History|CICS]] product was first released in 1969, it's still going strong).  So that other people can take over your project you need to provide them with decent documentation so they can understand what everything does.  For this you need to make your System Maintenance.

===System Overview===
The first thing a person inheriting an old system would like to see is a brief overview of all the components, that is what we are providing here.
* Structural Overview of how different forms link together
* You are going to list all the forms / modules / classes and describe what each does.
* If applicable include an inheritance diagram
* If applicable include an E-R Diagram
* You are then going to list the different sub routines on each of the forms / modules / classes and describe what each one of them does mentioning any return values or parameters

===Detailed Algorithm Design=== 
You need to include some examples of your most complicated algorithms and how you built them.  It's recommended that you include as much evidence of your coding skill as possible but in some cases this will be very difficult as you will have produced so much code that it's impossible to fully describe all of it.  Ten complex pieces of code should suffice.

For each piece of code include 3 sections
*Plain English description of what the code does
*Pseudo Code outline of the code
*Real code well laid out with comments where necessary

For example:

&lt;u&gt;Plain English&lt;/u&gt;

This piece of code works out the average price of a selection of chocolate bars.  To do this I should first of all use SQL to find all the chocolate bars from the Products table. I will then add all the prices together and divide the total by the number of chocolate bars to get an average price.

&lt;u&gt;Pseudo Code&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Items = (SELECT Product Price FROM products WHERE ProductType = ChocolateBar)

For Each Item
  Count increases
  TotalPrice = TotalPrice + Item.Price
Next Item

Output Average = TotalPrice / Count
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Real Code&lt;/u&gt;

..
..
..

=== Procedure and variable Lists ===
For each Module and Form that you create you should have code sitting behind it. This section will give the marker an overview of the different coding components of your project, keep in mind variable datatypes and their 'bit' capacity i.e using a character instead of a string.

For example:

&lt;u&gt;Module Sweet Form&lt;/u&gt;

This Module calculates a variety of statistics and presents reports for all the sweets and chocolate stored in the database

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Procedures / Functions
|-
! Access
! Name
! Description
! Parameters
! Outputs / returned values
|-
| Public
| AverageChoc
| Calculates the average price of a chocolate bar and outputs the value
| None
| The average price is printed to the screen
|}


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Variables
|-
! Access
! Name
! Type
! Description
|-
| Private
| NumChocBars
| Integer
| This stores the number of chocolate bars currently in stock
|}

===Annotated listings of program code / macro code and tailoring===
This is where you provide the marker with all of your code.  As we mentioned earlier it should be quite easy to understand already as you used sensible names, indentation and comments.  This section is going to allow the marker to see all that hard work, with a little annotation where anything isn't 100% clear.  If you have included this in your technical solution, then please provide a link.

===Database tables in design view===

If you have used a program to make your database tables then show them in design view, making sure that people can see the data types.

If you have used DDL copy it here.

This is the real thing, where you get marked on the code that you have written.  Notice that the program without any writeup is worth only 31% of the overall unit.  However, you need this section to complete the other parts of the project and this section will almost certainly take you longer than any other section of this Unit.  Below are a couple of quick tips on getting top marks in this section plus some links to programming help guides:

=== Don't just use built in functions ===
In the good old days students could get a decent mark by making a project in Access and using wizards to do all the functionality. This is no longer the case and if you do that you will get a very low mark.  '''You must write your own code and sub routines'''.  Handing in page after page of automatically generated code will get you no marks.  Write your own algorithms and take credit for it!

===(Database) Normalise Data===
[[Image:ERD-artist-performs-song.svg|thumb|320px|Two related entities shown using Crow's Foot notation]]
Make sure that all your database tables are normalised.  If they aren't you will lose marks in the [[../Design/]] Section and your project will be very hard to get working.  A quick way to test this is to see if your E-R Diagram only has 1-Many relationships.  If you use anything else then you will be running into trouble.

===(Object Orientation) Make sure you use Encapsulation appropriately===
If you are building your own code classes make sure that you don't allow users direct access to any variables and that they use the appropriate get and set routines.  Don't make everything public!  If you can, use inheritance.  By implementing these things you'll find the exam much easier.

=== Use sensible variable datatypes ===
Make sure that the datatype you use are sensible.  You will get marked down for using the wrong datatypes in your database tables and variables.

For example:
If you are recording the total number of chocolate bars in a shop you don't need to use a Long or Float,  you can only have whole numbers of chocolate bars and it is unlikely you'll have over a few million items.  Use an Integer!

=== Use sensible variable names ===
If you are using variables to store things they must have a name that makes sense so you know what it does when you read its name in your code.  

For example:
If you are recording the total number of chocolate bars in a shop you don't want to use a name like variable1.  What does variable1 mean?  Use a sensible name such as NumChoc.

=== Use sensible Function/Procedure names ===
If you are creating subroutines to process things in your code make sure you give them a sensible name so that people know what they are doing when they see them in the code.

For example:
If you have written a piece of code to calculate the average price of a chocolate bar then don't call it FuncitonA(), what does FunctionA() mean?!  Call it ChocAverage().

===Try to stick to one naming convention===
If you are using lots of variable names and function names, stick to a single style for naming them.  If you use lots of different conventions things are going to look ugly. [[w:Identifier_naming_convention|Wikipedia guidance]]

For example:

*firstName, lastName, calculateDoB, numLegs
*FirstName, LastName, CalculateDoB, NumLegs
*First_Name, Last_Name, Calculate_DoB, Num_Legs

===Don't make your names too long===
Long variables can be very hard to read and much easier for you to make mistakes when writing them, try to shorten things where possible.

For example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Too Long
! Just Right
|-
| ThisIsYourFirstName
| FirstName
|-
| the_value_of_a_chocolate_bar 
| ChocVal
|}

===When using forms prefix toolbox type===
When you are using forms and lots of variables at the same time it can sometimes get very confusing whether you are talking about a variable price or the text box that stores the price.  Get past this using prefixes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Form Object
! prefix
! example
|-
| Text box
| txt
| txtFirstName
|-
| Button
| btn
| btnSubmit
|-
| Radio button
| rdo
| rdoOverEighteen
|-
| Check box
| chk
| chkAgree
|-
| Image Element
| img
| imgLogo
|-
| Timer
| tmr
| tmrLogOut
|-
| Label
| lbl
| lblIntroduction
|-
| Standard variable
| [none]
| ChocNumber
|}
 
=== Indent your work ===
A lot of programming environments help to indent your code automatically and you should be able to find one for the language you are using. Indenting helps people to quickly read and understand your code as it clearly shows the structure of functions, procedures, selection and iteration statements.
For example the following is very hard to read:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
...
while (x == y) {
something();
somethingelse();
if (some_error)
do_correct();
else
continue_as_usual();
}
finalthing();
...
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If you indent it, it becomes much easier to read:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ...
    while (x == y) {
        something();
        somethingelse();
        if (some_error)
            do_correct();
        else
            continue_as_usual();
    }
    finalthing();
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Use comments where necessary ===
Some of the best written code doesn't need comments because if you have structured it correctly and used all the proper naming conventions it should be pretty easy to read.  However for the code you are writing you should put some comments to explain what each section does.


&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
'this function takes an array of prices and outputs the average
function calculateAverage(num1(20) as integer)
{
    'add all the numbers together
    while ...
          ...
          ...
    end while
    
    console.writeline(average)
}
&lt;/source&gt;
===What to submit===
You need to provide all the code that you have written. For each of your forms provide:
* Title
* Screen shot
* Code

For each of your modules/classes provide:
* Title
* Code

For any database tables you have made, provide screen shots in design view of mySQL or Access

{{displaytitle|title=Practical Project: Quality of Writing}}
&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

Having written this text book, I've come to discover that Quality of Writing is something that people find very important.  If it isn't well written and presented then you are going to find it very hard to read and you probably wouldn't recommend it to your friends.  It's exactly the same with your coursework, but if you don't present your work very well then you are going to lose marks and get your teacher very cross.  Overall this section is only worth 3 marks, but these are also the 3 easiest marks in the entire Unit.  If you follow the guidelines below then you are almost guaranteed to get them.
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:252px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:240px;&quot; style=&quot;font-family: arial; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; background-color: #ffffff&quot;&gt;

It came with my Pea Sea.&lt;br /&gt;
It plane lee marks four my revue&lt;br /&gt;
Miss Steaks I can knot sea.

Eye strike the quays and type a whirred &lt;br /&gt;
And weight four it two say &lt;br /&gt;
Weather eye am write oar wrong &lt;br /&gt;
It tells me straight a weigh.

Eye ran this poem threw it,&lt;br /&gt;
Your shore real glad two no.&lt;br /&gt;

My chequer tolled me sew.

A chequer is a bless thing,&lt;br /&gt;
It freeze yew lodes of thyme.&lt;br /&gt;
It helps me right all stiles of righting,&lt;br /&gt;
And aides me when eye rime.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;
The original version of this poem was written by Jerrold H. Zar in 1992.  An unsophisticated spell checker will find little or no fault with this poem because it checks words in isolation.  A more sophisticated spell checker will make use of a [[w:language model | language model]] to consider the context in which a word occurs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


===Use a Word Processor===
This seems pretty obvious.  A lot of schools/colleges use Microsoft Office and Word, check to see if you can get a cheap copy of that.  Alternatively you can [http://download.openoffice.org/ download] [[w:OpenOffice|OpenOffice]] for free!  It does everything you will need to write a top marks report.  If you want to be really clever and write something in [[w:LaTeX|LaTeX]] then feel free, but it's probably not worth the effort right now.

===Use a footer===
You get given marks for having footers on your work. This needs to include the following:

&lt;center&gt;'''Your Name''' | '''The title of the Project''' | '''The page number'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''P Kemp''' | '''My Amazing Fruit Stall Database''' | '''12/97'''&lt;/center&gt;

*[http://wordprocessing.about.com/od/wordprocessingsoftware/l/blheadfoot.htm Footers in Word]
*[http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOoAuthors_User_Manual/Getting_Started/Creating_headers_and_footers Footers in OpenOffice]

===Check your Spelling and Grammar===
This is pretty obvious and should be easy enough to do as spelling mistakes are normally highlighted with little red squiggly lines. However, as you can see to the right there are some errors that your spell checker can't pick up.  You have to proof read it!

===Proof read===
Before every draft you hand in, and especially before your final deadline, proof read your work.  This means sitting down and reading through everything you have written.  You will be amazed at how many little mistakes you made without realising it.  Even better, get a friend or member of your family to read it.  If they can understand it then you are sure that the examiner will be able to understand it and you will get all the marks that you deserve.

DO NOT rely on your teacher to proof read your work, they have a lot to mark and might get annoyed with you.  It is far better to ask them to give you ideas on how to improve your technical work than asking them to explain the difference between 'they're', 'there' and 'their'!

===Use Headings NOT Bold and Underline===
When students are in years 7 and 8 they have great fun with word art and making their titles look very fancy.  You don't get any marks for having fancy titles, in fact using them could make you lose marks.

If you have never used Heading styles before, now is the time to learn.  By using styles such as Heading 1 and Heading 2 it will allow you to automatically create a table of contents!  Imagine that, no need to count the page numbers. 

*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BqHH-zkzEw Using Headings in Word]
*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zRDDItRO30 Using Headings in OpenOffice]
[[Image:Brethren-Vol2-1.png|thumb|150px|You need a contents page for people to find their way around your work]]
===Use a contents page===
It is essential that the marker can navigate their way through your report.  To help them with this we are going to add a table of contents at the front of the document. Doing this manually can take a long time, but if you use headings then your can automate the entire process.  Remember if you change any text you will need to update your contents page to show the new layout.  The last thing you should do before printing is to update the contents page!

Look at the videos above to see how it is done.

===Widows and Orphans===
A very common mistake when writing reports is to mess up the layout.  This can involve having headings at the bottom of the page and the text accompanying that text on the next page (Widow) or having the text slipping onto the next page (Orphan).  This makes it very hard to read.

To make sure that your text is nice and tidy you need to make sure that if you have a Widowed header, you make sure that it starts off on the next page.  You can do this by using lots of carriage returns, but an easier and tidier way is to use '''page breaks'''.  You may not have used these before, they are a great way of making sure that everything is well laid out.

First of all find the '''¶''' button.  This shows us the formatting of the page.

Next find a heading that you want to switch to the next page, put the cursor in the front of the title and press &quot;CTRL+Enter&quot;

A page break should appear and things should be a little neater.

===Make sure your screenshots are clear===
So your project works and you have a lot of screen shots to show that your testing works.  However the screenshots are so small that you can't read the data entered or the error messages.  This means you are going to lose marks as your evidence of testing doesn't show any testing!  Make sure that you crop unneeded parts of the screen out of your images.  Use the crop button.

== Ceni ==
: One of tools for wired and wirelles networks managing is an application made by sidux developers - Ceni.
: There is Ceni network configuration guide for the chapter: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sidux/System_installation#9._Ceni Sidux/Installation/Ceni]
: When you configure the network, it doesn't need any more your attention.
[[File:Instal19.png|center|600px]]


== Wicd ==
: But if you change an access point often I suggest to install any graphic network configurator.
: Wicd is a default network configurator for XFCE so install it as root:
 apt-get install wicd
:1. You will be asked for adding a new user to &quot;netdev&quot; group - mark it with &quot;space&quot; bottom as &quot;x&quot; and click OK.
[[File:Wicd1.png|center|600px]]
:2. Re-boot your computer.
:3. Open Wicd from desktop panel-&gt; Preferences tab-&gt; Network Interfaces:
::a. For Wireless type: wlan0
::b. For Wired type: eth0 and click on-&gt; OK.
[[File:Net2.png|center|400px]]
:4. Refresh network list and find yours-&gt; mark for Automatically connection to this network.
[[File:Net3.png|center|400px]]
:5. If you use wireless connection open &quot;Properties&quot; and type your network key if required.
[[File:Net4.png|center|400px]]


: Home page: http://wicd.sourceforge.net/
: Wicd on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicd


== Network Manager ==
: Network Manager is an application for GNOME environment but it works on others anyway.
: It manages mobiles networks too from 0.7 version.
 apt-get remove wicd
 apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome


: Home page: http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/ 


== KNetwork Manager ==
: For KDE environment install:
 apt-get install network-manager network-manager-kde
   or
 apt-get install kwlan


: Kwlan home page: http://www.kde.org/applications/internet/kwlan/

: If you think about your own web side, you have a few possibilities.
 

== Hosting ==
: What you have to do first is finding a hosting provider.
: It depends what do you need for, providers offer different services - it can be for free with pop-ups
: or paid for with no pop-ups. Usually your e-mail provider has free file hosting as an option.
: If not just try to find it in search engines such as Google, Yahoo! or Bing.


== Providers templates ==
: If you created an account on any hosting server just choose any available template to start making
: your first web side. Just type your text, add pictures, etc.


== Ready to use templates ==
: But if you want to make something different, find and download a template package typing in any search
: engine: &quot;html templates&quot; or &quot;free html templates&quot;.
: Next step is editing it using a WYSIWYG application (What You See Is What You Get) - an effect will be
: much better if you do it this way.


== KompoZer ==
: One of WYSIWYG application is KompoZer (previously NVU), download it from: http://www.kompozer.net/
:1. You don't need to install it, just extract it, get in the new &quot;kompozer&quot; folder and run &quot;kompozer&quot; file.
:2. Now extract a template you downloaded.
:3. And open extracted template with KompoZer clicking on &quot;Open&quot; icon.
:4. Edit the template as you wish and save it as &quot;index.html&quot; file if it'll be your main page.
:5. KompoZer has an ftp client bilt-in to send your page out to your hosting server but if you don't
:: like it you can use any different ftp client I described here: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sidux/Useable_applications/Ftp_clients Sidux/Useable applications/Ftp clients]

: VoIP telphony (Voice over Internet Protocol) lets making calls to landlines or mobiles with cheap prices.


== Requirements ==
: If you want to make VoIP calls you have to do 3 things:
:1. Create an account on any VoIP provider web side.
:2. Pre-paid your account.
:3. Install one of available VoIP application.


== VoIP providers ==
: There are two providers I tried by myself, more you can find on a web side below.
::1. Skype Out http://www.skype.com/intl/en-gb/features/allfeatures/call-phones-and-mobiles/
::2. Freeconet http://www.freeconet.pl/en/
::3. or check it here: http://www.voip-catalog.com/press_releases.html


== Kphone ==
: Kphone is very small but fully working VoIP application.
:1. Installation:
 apt-get install kphone libqt3-mt
:2. The installation script doesn't make Menu entry, so you can do it yourself:
 sux
 mousepad /usr/share/applications/kphone.desktop
:: copy and past text below in:&lt;br&gt;
 [Desktop Entry]
 Name=Kphone
 Comment=VoIP telephony
 Exec=kphone
 Icon=/usr/share/icons/oxygen/64x64/apps/internet-telephony.png
 Terminal=false
 Type=Application
 Categories=Application;Network;
:: and save the file (the icon patch can be vary).
:3. Run it from: Menu-&gt; Network-&gt; Kphone
:4. As a first step configure your account:
::a. In &quot;User part of sip URL&quot; type your user name or number you got from VoIP provider.
::b. In &quot;Host part of sip URL&quot; type VoIP provider sip address such as: sip.address.com
::c. In &quot;Authentication Username (optional)&quot; type your user name again.
[[File:Voip1.png|center|300px]]
::d. As a next step type your password marking &quot;Save password&quot;.
[[File:Voip2a.png|center|300px]]
:4. In: Preferences tab-&gt; Phone Book you may add your contacts.
[[File:Voip3aen.png|center|400px]]
5. To make a phone call type a phone number in search fild and click on phone icon.
[[File:Voip4a.png|center|400px]]


: Kphone home page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/kphone
: More about Kphone on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPhone


== Others applications ==
: There are not too many configuration differents for all VoIp applications so I suggest to try:
# Linphone: http://www.linphone.org and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linphone
# Ekiga: http://ekiga.org/ and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekiga
# X-lite: http://www.counterpath.com/x-lite.html
# Zoiper: http://www.zoiper.com/
# Twinkle: http://www.twinklephone.com/

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Question 2.1.1=
==1==
If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a real number, then the area of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==2==
If there is a line &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; not on &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, then there is exactly one line &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; that is parallel to &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

==3==
If &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt; is a triangle with sides of length &lt;math&gt;a, b,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{sin A}=\frac{b}{sin B}=\frac{C}{sin C}&lt;/math&gt;

==4==
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function on [a, b] and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an function such that &lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then...


=Question 2.2.2=
==1==
If &lt;math&gt;1|n\,&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an integer q such that &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot q = n&lt;/math&gt;. Let q = n.

==2==
If &lt;math&gt;n|n\,&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an integer q such that &lt;math&gt;n \cdot q = n&lt;/math&gt;. Let q = 1.

==3==
If &lt;math&gt;m|n\,&lt;/math&gt;, then there is an integer q such that &lt;math&gt;m\cdot q = n\,&lt;/math&gt;. This implies &lt;math&gt;-mq = -n\,&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;m\cdot -q = -n\,&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;m|-n\,&lt;/math&gt;.


=Question 2.2.3=
==1==
If n is an even integer, then for some integer k, &lt;math&gt;n = 2k&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let &lt;math&gt;j=3k&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then &lt;math&gt;3n = 3(2k) = 2(3k) = 2j&lt;/math&gt;.

==2==
If n is an odd integer, then for some integer k, &lt;math&gt;n = 2k+1&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let &lt;math&gt;j=3k+1&lt;/math&gt;. 

Then &lt;math&gt;3n = 3(2k+1) = 6k+3 = 6k+2+1 = 2(3k+1)+1 = 2j+1&lt;/math&gt;.

==3==
If n is even, then &lt;math&gt;n = 2k&lt;/math&gt;. For integers j and k, let &lt;math&gt;j = 2k^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2) = 2j&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; is even.

If n is odd, then &lt;math&gt;n = 2k+1&lt;/math&gt;. For integers j and k, let &lt;math&gt;j = 2k^2 + 2k+ 1&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1) + 1 = 2j&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; is odd.

=Question 2.2.6=

If a|b, and b|bm then a|bm, implying aj = bm for some integer j.

Also, if a|c, and c|cn then a|cn, implying ai = cn for some integer i.

We let x = (j+i).

ax = aj+ai

ax = bm+cn

Which implies a|(bm+cn).

=Question 2.2.7=

&lt;math&gt;a|b&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; ax = b&lt;/math&gt; for some integer, x.

&lt;math&gt;c|d&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; cy = d&lt;/math&gt; for some integer, y.


&lt;math&gt;ac|bd = ac|ax\cdot cy\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;acj = ax\cdot cy&lt;/math&gt; for some integer, j.

&lt;math&gt;acj = ac(xy)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;j=xy\,&lt;/math&gt;, hence &lt;math&gt;ac|bd\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=Question 2.3.3=

Suppose that &lt;math&gt; a|b &lt;/math&gt;. This means there is an integer &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; b = an &lt;/math&gt;. Then, we have:

&lt;math&gt; bc = (an)c = a(nc) &lt;/math&gt;

We may consider the integer &lt;math&gt; k = nc &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we have that &lt;math&gt; bc = ak &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; a|bc &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{rfd|This page contains nothing about Atropellado de Coco, which, in summary, are balls of sugar, sweet potatoes, and coconut.  Instead, it is a list, of ingredients only (no procedure, etc.), for Panuchos, which, in summary, are tostadas or or open-faced soft tacos, wherein small tortillas are split and a small amount of refritos placed inside (a rough analogy might be pita bread).  The ingredient list seems to suggest that there will be an explanation of how to hand-make tortillas appropriate for this purpose, which really demands a Procedure section to be of any particular value.}}

== Ingredients ==
*2 medium-size slices of crustless stale bread, soaked briefly in water
*For frying: 75 g (3 oz) plain flour, 150 ml (1/4 pint) [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
*500 g (1 lb) minced lamb or beef
*1 medium-size onion, grated thickly
*2 tablespoons fresh chopped mint, or 1 tablespoon dried mint
*1 tablespoon fresh chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1 clove of garlic, crushed
*1 egg
*Salt and black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==
#Squeeze out excess water from the soaked bread, leaving it quite dry. 
#Combine all the ingredients for the Köfte in a bowl and mix well. 
#Make walnut-shaped balls and keep them covered until they are to be eaten. Then roll them lightly in flour and fry in hot oil for 2-3 minutes until golden all over. They can be shallow -or deep- fried. 

Serve it with basmati rice or bulgur pilav.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe these suggestions require some associated justification.  In other words, there needs to be some text about &quot;why&quot; these things should be done.  For example, why should local functions use an anonymous namespace be used ''instead of'' statically declared functions? Or why should memory access occur in ascending order?  Furthermore, it'd be nice to know the relative benefit of each suggestion.  For example, what performance gain is actually likely if a constructors arguments are re-ordered to declaration order in a class of only a half dozen simple member types?  When it comes to &quot;optimizing&quot;, a lot depends on the context of the optimization, therefore there needs to be some description of why/when a particular optimization makes most sense.  I am not arguing against these being valid suggestions, but I do think they need associated rationales to convince the reader why and when they may be worthwhile. -- [[User:Autumnfields|Autumnfields]] ([[User talk:Autumnfields|talk]]) 18:49, 9 June 2010 (UTC)

----

I wrote the text and I don't think further explanation is required.

First, because the average programmer need just to know what to do and not why.

Second, because anyway enough information is explanation is provided.

Let's see your points.

You wrote &quot;why should local functions use an anonymous namespace be used ''instead of'' statically declared functions?&quot;.
And the module contains &quot;in modern C++, the use of static global variables and functions is deprecated, and should be replaced by variables and functions declared in an anonymous namespace&quot;. It is not a question of optimization. To optimize the code, you could just as well use statically declared functions and variables. But it appears that they are deprecated, and therefore you'd better use an anonymous namespace.

You wrote &quot;why should memory access occur in ascending order?&quot;.
And the module contains &quot;Data caches optimize memory access in increasing sequential order.&quot;
It appears that usually hardware behaves that way.

At last you said &quot;it'd be nice to know the relative benefit of each suggestion&quot;.
That is quite hard to do, as it depends on a lot of factors.
Actually, some advices have null or adverse advantage.
Therefore, you should always time your code before and after applying a change meant to &quot;optimize&quot;.

====Parameters====
* {{para|banner}} (required) - the name of the WikiProject's project banner template, ''without'' the &quot;Template:&quot; prefix. This parameter is found in the banner name field. (''Note'': a template shortcut can also be used).
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|BANNER_NAME=Template:''banner''&lt;/code&gt;
* {{para|topic}} (required) - set so that the quality categories are: &quot;Foo-quality ''topic'' pages&quot;. This parameter can be found in one of two places. By default, the topic field would equal the project field, or if it exists, the corresponding assessment category field.
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|PROJECT=''topic''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; or&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;|ASSESSMENT_CAT=''topic'' pages&lt;/code&gt; 
* {{para|extraparam}} (optional) - extra parameters to be passed over to the WikiProject's banner, usually the name of a task force with a ''yes''. This parameter is found in the corresponding task force field.
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|tf 1=''extraparam''=''yes''&lt;/code&gt;

===Example===
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Assessment Quality Summary
 |banner     = WikiProject Languages
 |topic      = French language
 |extraparam = french=yes
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Result''':

{{Assessment Quality Summary
 |banner=WikiProject Languages
 |topic=French language
 |extraparam=french=yes
}}

: I'll try to show you how to make connection with second computer working under Windows OS in local network.
: To do that I will use samba and one of it's GUI. 
: As a second way I'll make connection using Opera web browser.


== Samba ==
: Samba provides file and print services for Microsoft Windows clients in local network.
: I have tried a few samba GUI but only one worked for me very well.
: But it doesn't mean it'll be the same on your computer, you should try theme yourself.


: Samba home page: http://www.samba.org/
: Samba on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_%28software%29


== SMB-Browser ==
: SMB-Browser is the one application that worked on my computer well.
: It's not available in Debian repositories, I have found it pre-installed with Elive 2.0 linux distibution.
:1. Add Elive server address:
 # Elive
 deb http://europe.repository.elive-systems.com/ lenny main elive drivers tests efl ports multimedia games other  
 deb http://europe.debian.elive-systems.com/ lenny main contrib non-free  
: to repository list using a text editor as root:
 sux
 mousepad /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list
:2. Next refresh package list and recive a public key:
 apt-get update
 gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv key_ID
 gpg --export key_ID | apt-key add -
 apt-get update
:3. And install application:
 apt-get install smb-browser smb-admin
:4. After that change rights for two files responsibility for mounting and unmounting shared files:
 chmod u+s /sbin/mount.cifs
 chmod u+s /sbin/umount.cifs
:5. Run SMB-browser from: Menu-&gt; Network-&gt; Browser of Share
::a. In &quot;preferences&quot; tab make:
::: - mark &quot;mount.cifs&quot;
::: - type user name and password of second computer
[[File:Net1.png|center|500px]]
::b. Go to &quot;Main&quot; tab: 
::: - type IP address of second computer
::: - click on &quot;Search by Hostname or IP&quot;
[[File:Lokal2.png|center|500px]]
::c. If everything is all right you'll see second's computer's shared folder in left down window.
::d. Click on &quot;Mount&quot; to mount it and &quot;Browse&quot; - it'll open Thunar file manager.
[[File:Lokal3.png|center|500px]]
::e. All the files you can copy, edit, remove or send new one out from your computer.
:6. To finish connection click on &quot;Un-mount&quot;.


== Others samba GUI ==
# Smb4k: http://smb4k.berlios.de/ 
# Smb2www: http://www.scintilla.utwente.nl/users/frank/smb2www/
# Komba2: http://sourceforge.net/projects/komba/
# Samba GUI list: http://www.samba.org/samba/GUI/


== Opera Unite ==
: Second way to make connection with another computer (under any system) is using Opera Unite [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sidux/Useable_applications/Web_browsers#Opera Sidux/Opera].
: Unite lets you share your files, videos, music, etc via internet.
:1. Choose &quot;Unite&quot; icon from left panel, then &quot;File sharing&quot; and click on &quot;Start&quot;.
:2. A configurator will open a window so click on &quot;Next&quot;.

:3. In next step make registration on Opera server.

:4. Or log in if you have an account.
[[File:Unite3.png|center|600px]]
:5. Next step - choose your computer name for Unite.
[[File:Unite4.png|center|600px]]
:6. And next choose a folder you want to share.
[[File:Unite5.png|center|600px]]
:7. After that go to your Opera main page, copy the address link for your friends.
:8. Don't forget to give your password to theme.
[[File:Unite6.png|center|600px]]
:9. To finish sharing just click on &quot;Stop&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conditional Clauses==

Conditional clauses in English and Latin have the general form:

&lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; (condition clause) (result clause)

Or:

(result clause) &lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; (condition clause)

For example:

#If I see anyone, I'll tell you.
#If he was sleeping, you should not have knocked.
#I cannot hear you if I'm sleeping.
#I would have been sad if I had not won.

There are 3 types of conditional clauses in Latin:

#Simple Fact (Present or Past)
#Contrary to Fact (Present or Past)
#Future (More or Less Vivid)

===Simple Fact Conditionals===

Simple fact conditionals in Latin have the general form:

si (condition clause in the present indicative) (result clause in the present indicative)

Or:

si (condition clause in the imperfect/perfect indicative) (result clause in the imperfect/perfect indicative)

=====For example:=====

&lt;i&gt;si diligenter laboras, bonus puer es&lt;/i&gt;

If you are working diligently, you are a good boy.

&lt;i&gt;si dominum adiuvabas, bonus servus eras&lt;/i&gt;

If you were helping your master, you were a good slave.

===Contrary to Fact Conditionals===

Contrary to fact conditionals are used if the condition clause is known to be false. For example:

If you weren't playing during class, you would be a good boy (but you were playing, so you aren't a good boy).

Contrary to fact conditionals have the general form:

si (condition clause in the imperfect subjunctive) (result clause in the imperfect subjunctive)

Or:

si (condition clause in the pluperfect subjunctive) (result clause in the pluperfect subjunctive)

=====For example:=====

&lt;i&gt;si matrem adiuvaret, cena parata esset&lt;/i&gt;

If he were helping his mother, the dinner would be ready.

&lt;i&gt;si patrem adiuvisset, pater matrem adiuvare potuisset&lt;/i&gt;

If he had helped his father, his father would have been able to help his mother.

Note how English uses &lt;b&gt;would&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;would have&lt;/b&gt; for result clauses, while Latin uses the same tense as in the condition clauses.

===Future Conditionals===

Future conditionals are, of course, used to express conditions in the future. For example:

If you help me, I will be done faster.

Future conditionals take the following general form:

si (condition clause in the future or future perfect) (result clause in the future)

Or:

si (condition clause in the present subjunctive) (result clause in the present subjunctive)

=====For example:=====

&lt;i&gt;si fortiter pugnaveritis, urbs non delebitur&lt;/i&gt;

If you fight bravely, the city will not be destroyed.

Note how English uses the present tense for the condition clause, while Latin uses the future or future perfect.

&lt;i&gt;si diligenter laboretis, vobis meridie domum dimittam&lt;/i&gt;

If you were to work diligently, I would dismiss you at noon.

This type of clause, known as the future less vivid (as opposed to the future more vivid which uses the future and future perfect), is used to express more improbable conditions in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;includeonly&gt;A page's priority assessment is generated from the '''''priority''''' parameter in the {{tl|{{{banner|PROJECT_BANNER}}}}} project banner on its talk page:

; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{{banner|PROJECT_BANNER}}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|priority=???&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{#if:{{{extraparam|}}}|{{!}}{{{extraparam}}}}}&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The following values may be used for the '''''priority''''' parameter to describe the relative priority of the page within the project:
{| style=&quot;background:transparent&quot; 
|-
! width=&quot;100%&quot;|&lt;!----&gt;
! &lt;!----&gt;
|-
| '''Top''' (adds pages to [[:Category:Top-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|Top|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''High''' (adds pages to [[:Category:High-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|High|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''Mid''' (adds pages to [[:Category:Mid-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|Mid|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''Low''' (adds pages to [[:Category:Low-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|Low|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''NB''' (adds pages to [[:Category:NB-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]])
| {{priority|NB|category={{{topic|}}} pages}}
|-
| '''???''' (pages for which a valid priority rating has not yet been provided are listed in [[:Category:Unknown-priority {{{topic|}}} pages]]
| {{priority||category={{{topic|}}} pages}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template will display information about priority assessments. The template is generally used for the instructions on a WikiProject's &quot;/Assessment&quot; page.

====Full syntax====
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Assessment Priority Summary
|banner     =
|topic      =
|extraparam =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Parameters====
* {{para|banner}} (required) - the name of the WikiProject's project banner template, ''without'' the &quot;Template:&quot; prefix. This parameter is found in the banner name field. (''Note'': a template shortcut can also be used).
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|BANNER_NAME=Template:''banner''&lt;/code&gt;
* {{para|topic}} (required) - set so that the quality categories are: &quot;Foo-priority ''topic'' pages&quot;. This parameter can be found in one of two places. By default, the topic field would equal the project field, or if it exists, the corresponding assessment category field.
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|PROJECT=''topic''&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; or&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;|ASSESSMENT_CAT=''topic'' pages&lt;/code&gt; 
* {{para|extraparam}} (optional) - extra parameters to be passed over to the WikiProject's banner, usually the name of a task force with a ''yes''. This parameter is found in the corresponding task force field.
:For example: &lt;code&gt;|tf 1=''extraparam''=''yes''&lt;/code&gt;

=== Example ===
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;&gt;
{{Assessment Priority Summary
|banner     = WikiProject Languages
|topic      = French language
|extraparam = French=yes
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

will produce:

{{Assessment Priority Summary
|banner     = WikiProject Languages
|topic      = French language
|extraparam = French=yes
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">For WikiProject banners using quality or importance scales, if the parameter ''ASSESSMENT_LINK'' is defined, then the words &quot;quality scale&quot; and &quot;importance scale&quot; will be linked to that page. This allows a project to use its own custom scales if they wish and provides a convenient link to them from the banner.

If ''ASSESSMENT_LINK'' is not defined, then the banner will check to see if either of the following pages exist:
* '''PROJECT_LINK/Assessment'''
* or (if ''PROJECT_LINK'' is not defined), '''Wikibooks:WikiProject PROJECT/Assessment'''
If they do then the banner will guess that this is where the WikiProject's quality and importance scales are kept and will link to this page.

* If this is not desired (for example, the page '''PROJECT_LINK/Assessment''' does not contain anything useful, then you can set ''ASSESSMENT_LINK=no''.
* If the banner has guessed correctly, then it is advisable to set ''ASSESSMENT_LINK'' to point to this page. This will remove the warning box from the template page.

For any queries or help with this, please ask at [[Template talk:WPBannerMeta]].&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template subpages|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

'''Global warming potential''' (GWP) is a measure of how much a given mass of [[/greenhouse gas/]] is estimated to contribute to [[global warming]]. It is a relative scale which compares the [[gas]] in question to that of the same mass of [[carbon dioxide]] (whose GWP is by convention equal to 1). A GWP is calculated over a specific time interval and the value of this must be stated whenever a GWP is quoted or else the value is meaningless.

The substances subject to restrictions in the [[Kyoto protocol]] either are rapidly increasing their concentrations in [[Earth's atmosphere]] or have a large GWP.

The GWP depends on the following factors:
* the absorption of [[infrared radiation]] by a given species
* the spectral location of its absorbing wavelengths
* the [[atmospheric lifetime]] of the species
Thus, a high GWP correlates with a large infrared absorption and a long atmospheric lifetime.  The dependence of GWP on the wavelength of absorption is more complicated. Even if a gas absorbs radiation efficiently at a certain wavelength, this may not affect its GWP much if the atmosphere already absorbs most radiation at that wavelength. A gas has the most effect if it absorbs in a &quot;window&quot; of wavelengths where the atmosphere is fairly transparent. The dependence of GWP as a function of wavelength has been found empirically and published as a graph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.tamu.edu/rgroup/north/ITS%20GWP%20Data.xls Matthew Elrod, &quot;Greenhouse Warming Potential Model.&quot;]  Based on [[Journal of Chemical Education]], Vol 76, pp. 1702-1705, December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the GWP of a greenhouse gas depends directly on its infrared spectrum, the use of infrared spectroscopy to study greenhouse gases is centrally important in the effort to understand the impact of human activities on global [[climate change]].

== Calculating the global warming potential ==
Just as [[radiative forcing]] provides a simplified means of comparing the various factors that are believed to influence the climate system to one another, Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) are one type of simplified index based upon radiative properties that can be used to estimate the potential future impacts of emissions of different gases upon the climate system in a relative sense. GWP is based on a number of factors, including the radiative efficiency (infrared-absorbing ability) of each gas relative to that of carbon dioxide, as well as the decay rate of each gas (the amount removed from the atmosphere over a given number of years) relative to that of carbon dioxide [http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/gwp.html].

The '''radiative forcing capacity''' (RF) is the amount of energy per unit area, per unit time, absorbed by the greenhouse gas, that would otherwise be lost to space.  It can be expressed by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;RF = \sum_{n=1}^{100} Abs_i * F_i / (path length * density)&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript ''i'' represents an interval of 10 [[inverse centimeter]]s.  Abs&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents the integrated infrared absorbance of the sample in that interval, and F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents the RF for that interval.{{Verify source|date=September 2008}}

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) provides the generally accepted values for GWP, which changed slightly between 1996 and 2001. An exact definition of how GWP is calculated is to be found in the IPCC's [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/247.htm 2001 Third Assessment Report]. The GWP is defined as the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of 1 kg of a trace substance relative to that of 1 kg of a reference gas:

:&lt;math&gt;GWP \left(x\right) = \frac{\int_0^{TH} a_x \cdot \left[x(t)\right] dt} {\int_0^{TH} a_r \cdot \left[r(t)\right] dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where TH is the time horizon over which the calculation is considered; a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[radiative efficiency]] due to a unit increase in atmospheric abundance of the substance (i.e., Wm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and [x(t)] is the time-dependent decay in abundance of the substance following an instantaneous release of it at time t=0. The denominator contains the corresponding quantities for the reference gas (i.e. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The radiative efficiencies a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; are not necessarily constant over time. While the absorption of infrared radiation by many greenhouse gases varies linearly with their abundance, a few important ones display non-linear behaviour for current and likely future abundances (e.g., CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). For those gases, the relative radiative forcing will depend upon abundance and hence upon the future scenario adopted.

Since all GWP calculations are a comparison to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is non-linear, all GWP values are affected. Assuming otherwise as is done above will lead to lower GWPs for other gases than a more detailed approach would.

=== Use in Kyoto Protocol ===
Under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the Conference of the Parties decided (decision 2/CP.3) [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop3/07a01.pdf#page=31] that the values of GWP calculated for the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]] are to be used for converting the various greenhouse gas emissions into comparable [[Co2e|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents]] when computing overall sources and sinks.

== Importance of time horizon ==

Note that a substance's GWP depends on the timespan over which the potential is calculated. A gas which is quickly removed from the atmosphere may initially have a large effect but for longer time periods as it has been removed becomes less important. Thus methane has a potential of 25 over 100 years but 72 over 20 years; conversely [[sulfur hexafluoride]] has a GWP of 22,800 over 100 years but 16,300 over 20 years (IPCC TAR). The GWP value depends on how the gas concentration decays over time in the atmosphere. This is often not precisely known and hence the values should not be considered exact. For this reason when quoting a GWP it is important to give a reference to the calculation.

The GWP for a mixture of gases can not be determined from the GWP of the constituent gases by any form of simple linear addition.

Commonly, a time horizon of 100 years is used by regulators (e.g., the [[California Air Resources Board]]).

== Values ==

[[Carbon dioxide]] has a GWP of exactly 1 (since it is the baseline unit to which all other greenhouse gases are compared).

Although [[water vapor|water vapour]] has a significant influence with regard to absorbing infrared radiation (which is the green house effect; see [[greenhouse gas]]), its GWP is not calculated. Its concentration in the atmosphere mainly depends on air temperature. There is no possibility to directly influence atmospheric water vapour concentration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gradient enhanced NMR''' is a method for obtaining high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectra without the need for ''phase cycling''. Gradient methodology is used extensively for two purposes, either rephasing (selection) or dephasing (elimination) of a particular magnetization transfer pathway. It includes the application of magnetic field gradient pulses to select specific coherences. By using actively shielded gradients, a gradient pulse is applied during the evolution period of the selected coherence to dephase the transverse magnetization and another gradient pulse refocuses the desired coherences remaining during the acquisition period.

==Advantages==
*Significant reduction in measuring time
*Reduced T1 artifacts 
*Elimination of phase cycling and difference methods 
*Possibility for three and four-quantum editing 
*The ability to detect resonances at the same chemical shift as a strong solvent resonance

==Drawbacks==
*A need for field-frequency-lock blanking during long runs.

==Examples==
*Selection of transverse magnetization (I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; etc.):

A '''helium mass spectrometer''' is an instrument commonly used to detect and locate small leaks. It was initially developed in the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II to find extremely small leaks in the [[Gaseous diffusion|gas diffusion process]] of [[enriched uranium|uranium enrichment plants]].&lt;ref&gt;LEAK DETECTION by N. Hilleret of CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. &quot;At the origin of the helium leak detection method was the ”Manhattan Project” and the unprecedented leak-tightness requirements needed by the uranium enrichment plants. The required sensitivity needed for the leak checking led to the choice of a mass spectrometer designed by Dr. A.O.C. Nier tuned on the helium mass. Because of its industrial use, the material choice (originally glass) turned out to be unbearably fragile and after many complaints by the users, a new metallic version was developed and constructed. The sensitivity of the apparatus was in 1946 ~10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and it increased to ~10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by 1970. Nowadays the quoted sensitivity of the most sensitive detectors is ~10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, a factor 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; gain within 50 years.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It typically uses a [[vacuum chamber]] in which a sealed container filled with helium is placed. Helium leaks out of the container, and the rate of the leak is detected by a [[mass spectrometer]].

== Detection technique ==

The leak detection technique depends on the separation of helium from other gases in a [[vacuum]]. It is accomplished by [[ionization|ionizing]] a gas sample containing helium, pushing the sample through a [[magnetic field]], and collecting the helium [[ion]]s as they emerge. Since helium ions exit along a different path from all other ions, collection of helium is reasonably simple. The current produced by the helium ion flow is used to drive a [[ammeter]]. Often audio alarms, and visual display on leak detection system to give information and warnings about leak levels. [[Ionization]], separation and collection takes place within a [[spectrometer tube]], which is the heart of the system.

Helium is used as a [[tracer]] because it penetrates small leaks rapidly. Helium has also the property of being non-toxic, [[inert gas|chemically inert]], inexpensive to produce, and present in the atmosphere only in minute quantities (5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]]). Typically a helium leak detector will be used to measure leaks in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]·[[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

* A flow of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is slightly less than 1 ml per minute at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP).
* A flow of 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is slightly less than 3 ml per century at STP.

== Internal spectrometer tube operation ==
In the spectrometer tube, the heart of the helium mass spectrometer, the electrons produced by a [[hot filament]] enter an [[ionization chamber]] under vacuum, and collide with [[gas]] [[molecules]], creating within the chamber ions quantitatively proportional to the pressure in the ion chamber. These ions are repelled out of the ion chamber, under vacuum, through the exit slit, by a repeller field. The combined [[electrostatic]] effect of the repeller, exit slit, focus plates, and ground slit [[collimation|collimates]] the [[ion beam]] so that it enters the magnetic field as a straight &quot;ribbon&quot; of ions.

== Types of leaks ==
Typically there are two types of leaks in the detection of helium as a ''[[tracer]]'' for leak detection.

*'''Residual leak''': A residual leak is a real leak that may be gross, or small, according to the sensitivity setting of the leak detector.
*'''Virtual leak''': A virtual leak is the semblance of a leak in a vacuum system caused by slow release of trapped gases, as gases may adhere as pockets to the interior sides of a chamber. This can cause confusion to the operator as it may be a false indication of a present leak.

== Uses ==
Helium mass spectrometer leak detectors are used in production line industries such as [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]], automotive parts, carbonated beverage containers, food packages and [[aerosol spray|aerosol]] packaging, as well as in the manufacture of steam products, [[gas bottle]]s, [[fire extinguisher]]s, [[tire]] valves, and numerous other products including all [[vacuum]] systems.

== Test methods ==
{{Cleanup-list|date=January 2008}}
=== Global helium spray - vacuum test ===
This method requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested will be located in some kind of a tent in which the helium concentration will be raised to 100% helium. 
*If the part is small the vacuum system included in the leak testing instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation.
*If the size of the part is too large, an additional vacuum pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation.
If leakage is encountered the small and &quot;agile&quot; molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered.

=== Local helium spray - vacuum test ===
This method is a small variation from the one above.
It still requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested is sprayed with a localized stream of helium tracer gas. 
*If the part is small the vacuum system included in the instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation.
*If the size of the part is too large, an addition pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation.
If leakage is encountered the small and &quot;agile&quot; molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered. Thus correlation between maximum leakage signal and location of helium spray head will allow the operator to pinpoint the leaky area.

=== Helium charged - vacuum test ===
In this case the part is pressurized (sometime this test is combined with a burst test, i.e. at 40 bars) with helium while sitting in a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is connected to a vacuum pumping system and a leak detector. Once the vacuum has reached the mass spectrometer operating pressure, any helium leakage will be measured.
This test method applies to a lot of components that will operate under pressure: airbag canisters, evaporators, condensers, high-voltage SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; filled switchgear.

=== Bombing test (overpressure) - vacuum test ===
This method applies to objects that are supposedly sealed.

First the device under test will be exposed for an extended length of time to a high helium pressure in a &quot;bombing&quot; chamber.

If the part is leaky, helium will be able to penetrate the device.

Later the device will be placed in a vacuum chamber, connected to a vacuum pump and a mass spectrometer. The tiny amount of gas that entered the device under pressure will be released in the vacuum chamber and sent to the mass spectrometer where the leak rate will be measured.

This test method applies to implantable medical devices, crystal oscillator, saw filter devices.

This method is not able to detect a massive leak as the tracer gas will be quickly pumped out when test chamber is pumped down.

=== Helium charged - sniffer test ===
In this last case the part is pressurized with helium. The mass spectrometer is fitted with a special device, a sniffer probe, that allows it to sample air (and tracer gas when confronted with a leak) at atmospheric pressure and to bring it into the mass spectrometer.

This mode of operation is frequently used to locate a leak that has been detected by other methods, in order to allow for parts repair.

The '''Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence''' (HSQC) experiment is used frequently in [[NMR]] spectroscopy of organic molecules and is of particular significance in the field of [[protein NMR]]. It was invented by [[Geoffrey Bodenhausen]] and [[D. J. Ruben]] in 1980.  The resulting spectrum is two-dimensional with one axis for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and the other for a ''heteronucleus'' (an [[atomic nucleus]] other than a proton), most often [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] or [[nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]]. The spectrum contains a peak for each unique proton attached to the heteronucleus being considered. Thus, if the [[chemical shift]] of a specific proton is known, the chemical shift of the coupled heteronucleus can be determined, and vice versa.

== HSQC in protein NMR ==
The &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N HSQC experiment is probably the most frequently recorded experiment in protein NMR. The HSQC experiment can be performed either using the natural abundance of the &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N [[isotope]], or using isotopically labeled protein. The latter can be recorded on much lower concentrations of protein, but requires [[recombinant expression]] of the protein. 

Each [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] of the [[protein]] (except [[proline]]) has an amide proton attached to a [[nitrogen]] in the [[peptide bond]]. If the protein is folded, the peaks are usually well dispersed, and most of the individual peaks can be distinguished. Being a relatively cheap and quick experiment, the HSQC is useful to screen candidates for [[protein structure|structure]] determination by NMR. The number of peaks in the spectrum should match the number of residues in the protein (though sidechains with nitrogen-bound protons will add additional peaks).  It will probably be difficult to solve the structure of the protein if this is not the case. The labour-intensive process of structure determination is usually not undertaken until a good HSQC is obtained.

It is not possible to assign the HSQC spectrum by itself, or in other words to determine which peaks correspond to a particular residue in the protein. This process can be done in different ways as outlined in the [[protein NMR]] article. The assignment of the spectrum is usually the first step in a structure determination, and is essential for a meaningful interpretation of more advanced NMR experiments.

The HSQC experiment is also useful for detecting interactions with [[ligand]]s, such as other proteins or drugs. By comparing the HSQC of the free protein with the one bound to the ligand, it is possible to find the changes in the [[chemical shift]]s of the peaks, which is most likely to occur in the binding interface.

The '''history of mass spectrometry''' dates back more than one hundred years and has its roots in physical and chemical studies regarding the nature of matter. The study of [[gas discharge]]s in the mid 19th century led to the discovery of [[anode ray|anode]] and [[cathode ray]]s, which turned out to be positive [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s. Improved capabilities in the separation of these positive ions enabled the discovery of [[stable isotope]]s of the elements. The first such discovery was with the atom [[neon]], which was shown by [[mass spectrometry]] to have at least two stable isotopes:  neon-20 with 10 [[proton]]s and 10 [[neutron]]s and neon-22 with 10 protons and 12 neutrons. Mass spectrometers were used in the [[Manhattan Project]] for the separation of isotopes of uranium necessary to create the [[atomic bomb]]. 

==Prout's Hypothesis==
[[Prout's hypothesis]] was an early 19th century attempt to explain the properties of the [[chemical element]]s using the internal structure of the [[atom]]. In 1815, the [[England|English]] chemist [[William Prout]] observed that the [[atomic weight]]s that had been measured were [[integer]] multiples of the atomic weight of [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;William Prout (1815). On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms. ''Annals of Philosophy'', 6: 321&amp;ndash;330. [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/PROUT.HTML Online reprint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Prout (1816). Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms. ''Annals of Philosophy'', 7: 111&amp;ndash;13. [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/PROUT.HTML#prout2 Online reprint]&lt;/ref&gt; Prout's hypothesis remained influential in chemistry throughout the 1820s.  However, more careful measurements of the atomic weights, such as those compiled by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] in 1828 or [[Edward Turner]] in 1832, appeared to disprove it.  In particular the atomic weight of [[chlorine]], which is 35.45 times that of [[hydrogen]], could not at the time be explained in terms of Prout's hypothesis. It would take the better part of a century for this problem to be resolved.

==Canal rays==
In the mid-nineteenth century, [[Julius Plücker]] investigated the light emitted in [[discharge tubes]] and the influence of magnetic fields on the glow.  Later, in 1869, [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] studied discharge tubes with energy rays extending from a negative [[electrode]], the cathode. These rays produced a [[fluorescence]] when they hit a tube's glass walls, and when interrupted by a solid object they cast a shadow. 

Canal rays, also called [[Anode rays]],  were observed by [[Eugen Goldstein]], in 1886. Goldstein used a [[Gas filled tube|gas discharge tube]] which had a perforated [[cathode]].  The rays are produced in the holes (canals) in the cathode and travels in a direction opposite to the &quot;[[cathode ray]]s,&quot; which are streams of [[electron]]s. Goldstein called these positive rays &quot;Kanalstrahlen&quot; - canal rays. In [[1907]] a study of how this &quot;ray&quot; was deflected in a [[magnetic field]], revealed that the [[Particle physics|particles]] making up the ray were not all the same [[mass]]

==Discovery of isotopes==
[[Image:Discovery of neon isotopes.JPG|thumb|300px|right|In the bottom right corner of this photographic plate are markings for the two isotopes of neon: neon-20 and neon-22.]]


In 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of [[canal rays]], [[J. J. Thomson]] channeled a stream of ionized neon through a magnetic and an electric field and measured its deflection by placing a photographic plate in its path.  Thomson observed two patches of light on the photographic plate (see image on right), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection.  Thomson concluded that the neon gas was composed of atoms of two different atomic masses (neon-20 and neon-22).&lt;ref&gt;JJ Thomson (1913), [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/canal.html ''Rays of positive electricity''], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society'', A 89, 1-20 &amp;mdash; Discovery of neon isotopes&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson's student [[Francis William Aston]] continued the research at the Trinity College, building the first full functional mass spectrometer in 1919. He was able to identify isotopes of [[chlorine]] (35 and 37), [[bromine]] (79 and 81), and [[krypton]] (78, 80, 82, 83, 84 and 86), proving that these natural occurring elements are composed of a combination of isotopes. The use of electromagnetic focusing in [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrograph]] which rapidly allowed him to identify no fewer than 212 of the 287 naturally occurring isotopes. In 1921 F. W. Aston became a fellow of the famous [[Royal Society]].

His work on isotopes also led to his formulation of the [[Whole Number Rule]] which states that &quot;the mass of the oxygen isotope being defined [as 16], all the other isotopes have masses that are very nearly whole numbers,&quot; a rule that was used extensively in the development of [[nuclear energy]]. The exact mass of many isotopes was measured leading to the result that hydrogen has a 1% higher mass than expected by the average mass of the other elements. Aston speculated about the subatomic energy and the use of it in 1936.

In [[1918]], [[Arthur Jeffrey Dempster]] developed the first modern [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]], which was over 100 times more accurate than previous versions, and established the basic theory and design of mass spectrometers that is still used to this day.  Dempster's research over his career centered around the mass spectrometer and its applications, leading in [[1935]] to his discovery of the uranium isotope &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U.  This isotope's ability to cause a rapidly expanding [[Nuclear fission|fission]] [[nuclear chain reaction]] allowed the development of the [[atom bomb]] and [[nuclear power]].

In 1932, [[Kenneth Bainbridge]] developed a mass spectrometer with a resolving power of 600 and a relative precision of one part in 10,000.&lt;ref name='Audi 2006'&gt; {{cite journal|title=The history of nuclidic masses and of their evaluation|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry |date=2006-04-01|first=Georges|last=Audi|coauthors=|volume=251|issue=2-3|pages=85–94|doi= 10.1016/j.ijms.2006.01.048}}|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VND-4JKRWJX-2/2/628018a7bf50a32b4cdba32b77f181c8|format=|accessdate=2008-04-11&lt;/ref&gt; He used this instrument to verify the [[Mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]], E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title= The Equivalence of Mass and Energy|journal=Phys.

==Manhattan Project==
A [[Calutron]] is a [[sector instrument|sector mass spectrometer]] that was used for separating the [[isotopes]] of [[uranium]] developed by [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fepi2.htm |title=Lawrence and His Laborator |accessdate=2007-09-03 |year=1981 |work=LBL Newsmagazine |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Manhattan Project]] and was similar to the [[Cyclotron]] invented by Lawrence. Its name is a [[concatenation]] of Cal. U.-tron, in tribute to the [[University of California]], Lawrence's institution and the contractor of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] laboratory.&lt;ref name='OSTI ID: 20699216'&gt; {{cite journal|title=The Uranium Bomb, the Calutron, and the Space-Charge Problem|journal=Physics Today|date=2005-05-01|first=William E.|last=Parkins|coauthors=|volume=58|issue=5|pages=45–51|doi= 10.1063/1.1995747}}|url=http://masspec.scripps.edu/MSHistory/timelines/time_pdf/1947_ParkinsWE.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; They were implemented for industrial scale [[uranium enrichment]] at the [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12 plant]] established during the war and provided much of the uranium used for the &quot;[[Little Boy]]&quot; [[nuclear weapon]], which was dropped onto [[Hiroshima]] in [[1945]].

==Development of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry==
The use of a mass spectrometer as the detector in gas chromatography was developed during the 1950s by Roland Gohlke and Fred McLafferty.&lt;ref&gt;Gohlke, R. S., [http://masspec.scripps.edu/MSHistory/timelines/time_pdf/1956_Gohlke.pdf Time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas-liquid partition chromatography]. ''Anal. Chem.'' '''1959''', ''31'', 535-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gohlke, R. S.; McLafferty, F. W., [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1044-0305(93)85001-E Early gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.]'' J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom.'' '''1993''', ''4'', (5), 367-371.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of affordable and [[miniaturized]] [[computer]]s has helped in the simplification of the use of this instrument, as well as allowed great improvements in the amount of time it takes to analyse a sample.

==Fourier transform mass spectrometry==
[[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometry was developed by [[Alan G. Marshall]] and [[Melvin B. Comisarow]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2614(74)89137-2 M.B. Comisarow and A.G. Marshall, ''Chem. Phys. Lett.'' '''25''', 282 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration was earlier developments in conventional ICR and Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy. 

==Soft ionization methods==
Field desorption ionization was first reported by Beckey in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Beckey H.D. ''Field ionization mass spectrometry.'' '''Research/Development''', ''1969'', 20(11), 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In field ionization, a high-potential electric field is applied to an ''emitter'' with a sharp surface, such as a razor blade, or more commonly, a filament from which tiny &quot;whiskers&quot; have been grown.  This produces a very high electric field in which electron tunneling can result in ionization of gaseous analyte molecules.  FI produces mass spectra with little or no fragmentation, dominated by molecular radical cations M&lt;sup&gt;+.&lt;/sup&gt; and occasionally protonated molecules &lt;math&gt;[M+H]^+&lt;/math&gt;.

Chemical ionization was developed in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, M.S.B.; Field, F.H. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1966''', ''88'', 2621-2630. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja00964a001 Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry. I. General Introduction].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4569234&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fales HM, Milne GW, Pisano JJ, Brewer HB, Blum MS, MacConnell JG, Brand J, Law N |title=Biological applications of electron ionization and chemical ionization mass spectrometry |journal=Recent Prog.

The analyte is ionized by ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. The process may involve transfer of an electron, a proton or other charged species between the reactants. This is a less energetic procedure than [[electron ionization]] and the ions produced are, for example, protonated molecules:  [M + H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. These ions are often relatively stable, tending not to fragment as readily as ions produced by [[electron ionization]].

[[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI) is a soft [[ionization]] technique used in [[mass spectrometry]], allowing the analysis of [[biomolecule]]s ([[biopolymer]]s such as [[proteins]], [[peptides]] and [[sugars]]) and large [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecules]] (such as [[polymers]], [[dendrimers]] and other [[macromolecules]]), which tend to be fragile and fragment when ionized by more conventional ionization methods. It is most similar in character to [[electrospray ionization]] both in relative softness and the ions produced (although it causes much fewer multiply charged ions). The term was first used in 1985 by [[Franz Hillenkamp]], [[Michael Karas]] and their colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karas, M.; Bachmann, D.; Hillenkamp, F. |title=Influence of the Wavelength in High-Irradiance Ultraviolet Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry of Organic Molecules |journal=[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Anal. Chem.]] |volume=57 |issue= |pages=2935–9 |year=1985 |pmid= |doi=10.1021/ac00291a042}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers found that the [[amino acid]] [[alanine]] could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid [[tryptophan]] and irradiated with a pulsed 266 nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide [[melittin]] could be ionized when mixed with this kind of “matrix”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karas, M.; Bachman, D.; Bahr, U.; Hillenkamp, F. |title=Matrix-Assisted Ultraviolet Laser Desorption of Non-Volatile Compounds |journal=[[International Journal of Mass Spectrometry|Int J Mass Spectrom Ion Proc]] |volume=78 |issue= |pages=53–68 |year=1987 |pmid= |doi=10.1016/0168-1176(87)87041-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when [[Koichi Tanaka]] of Shimadzu Corp. and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30 nm [[cobalt]] particles in [[glycerol]] with a 337 nm [[nitrogen laser]] for ionization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tanaka, K.; Waki, H.; Ido, Y.; Akita, S.; Yoshida, Y.; Yoshida, T. |title=Protein and Polymer Analyses up to m/z 100 000 by Laser Ionization Time-of flight Mass Spectrometry |journal=[[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom]] |volume=2 |issue=20 |pages=151–3 |year=1988 |pmid= |doi=10.1002/rcm.1290020802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Markides | first =K | authorlink = | coauthors =Gräslund, A | title =Advanced information on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002 | work = | publisher = | date = | url =http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/2002/chemadv02.pdf | format =PDF | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266 nm laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karas M, Hillenkamp F |title=Laser desorption ionization of proteins with molecular masses exceeding 10,000 daltons |journal=Anal.

&lt;/ref&gt; Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.

Each window is focused on the nitrogen chemical shift of that amino acid. The sequential assignment is made by matching the alpha carbon chemical shifts.]]
'''HNCA''' is a 3D [[NMR]] experiment commonly used in the field of [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein NMR]]. The name derives from the experiment's magnetization transfer pathway: The magnetization of the amide proton of an [[Amino acid|amino acid residue]] is transferred to the amide nitrogen, and then to the alpha carbons of both the starting residue and the previous residue in the protein's amino acid sequence. In contrast, the complementary [[HNCOCA]] experiment
transfers magnetization only to the alpha carbon of the previous residue{{ref|hnca}}. The HNCA experiment is used, often in tandem with HNCOCA, to assign alpha carbon resonance signals to specific residues in the protein. This experiment requires a purified sample of protein prepared with [[Carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[Nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]] [[Isotopic labeling|isotopic labelling]], at a concentration greater than 0.1 [[Concentration#Molarity|mM]], and is thus generally only applied to [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant proteins]].

The spectrum produced by this experiment has 3 dimensions: A proton axis, a &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N axis and a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C axis. For residue i peaks will appear at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt; (i)} and {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)}, while for the complementary [[HNCOCA]] experiment peaks appear only at {H&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;(i), N(i), C&lt;sub&gt;alpha&lt;/sub&gt;(i-1)}. Together, these two experiments reveal the alpha carbon chemical shift for each amino acid residue in a protein, and provide information linking adjacent residues in the protein's sequence.

[[Image:LTQ-FTICR.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Hybrid linear ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer]]
A '''hybrid mass spectrometer''' is a device for [[tandem mass spectrometry]] that consists of a combination of two or more ''[[m/z]]'' separation devices of different types.

==Notation==
The different ''m/z'' separation elements of a hybrid [[mass spectrometer]] can be represented by a shorthand notation. The symbol ''Q'' represents a [[quadrupole mass analyzer]], ''q'' is a [[radio frequency]] collision quadrupole, ''TOF'' is a [[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]], ''B'' is a magnetic [[sector mass spectrometer|sector]] and ''E'' is an electric sector.
 
==Sector quadrupole==
A  [[sector instrument]] can be combined with a collision quadrupole and [[quadrupole mass analyzer]] to form a hybrid instrument. &lt;ref name=Glish1982&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Glish | first =  G. | year = 1982 | title = A new “hybrid” sector/quadrupole mass spectrometer for mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry | journal = International Journal or Mass Spectrometry and Ion Physics | volume = 41 | pages = 157 | doi = 10.1016/0020-7381(82)85032-8 | last2 = McLuckey | first2 = S | last3 = Ridley | first3 = T | last4 = Cooks | first4 = R | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BEqQ configuration with a magnetic sector (B), electric sector (E), collision quadrupole (q) and ''m/z'' selection quadrupole (Q) have been constructed&lt;ref name=Schoen1985&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Schoen | first =  A. | year = 1985 | title = A hybrid BEQQ mass spectrometer | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes | volume = 65 | pages = 125 | doi = 10.1016/0168-1176(85)85059-X | last2 = Amy | first2 = J.W. | last3 = Ciupek | first3 = J.D. | last4 = Cooks | first4 = R.G. | last5 = Dobberstein | first5 = P. | last6 = Jung | first6 = G. | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1986&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Harrison | first =  A. | year = 1986 | title = A hybrid BEQQ mass spectrometer for studies in gaseous ion chemistry | journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes | volume = 74 | pages = 13 | doi = 10.1016/0168-1176(86)85020-0 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an instrument with two electric sectors (BEEQ) has been described.&lt;ref name=Winger1992&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Winger | first =  B.

The '''hydrogen line''', '''21 centimeter line''' or '''HI line'''  refers to the [[spectral line]] created by changes in the energy state of neutral [[hydrogen]] and occurs at a frequency of 1420.40575177 [[Megahertz|MHz]], equivalent to a [[Wavelength#In_non-vacuum_media|vacuum wavelength]] of around 21.10611405413 [[centimetre|cm]]. This line falls within the [[radio]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and is used extensively in [[astronomy]], since it can penetrate [[Cosmic dust|dust clouds]] that are [[opaque]] to [[Visible light|visible wavelengths]]. The radiation comprising the hydrogen line comes from the [[Atomic transition|transition]] between the two [[hyperfine levels]] of the hydrogen [[Principle quantum number|1]][[Azimuthal quantum number|s]] [[ground state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyperphysics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/h21.html |title=The Hydrogen 21-cm Line |accessdate=2008-09-20 |work=[[Hyperphysics]] |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |date=2004-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause of the hydrogen line==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
{{-}}

Neutral hydrogen consists of a single [[proton]] orbited by a single [[electron]]. As well as their orbital motion, the proton and electron also have [[spin (physics)|spin]]. Classically, this is analogous to rotational motion (like the [[Earth]] rotating on its axis as it orbits the [[Sun]]), but as they are [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] [[particle physics|particles]] the concept has a slightly different meaning.

The spin of the electron and proton can be in either direction - in the classical analogy they are rotating clockwise or anticlockwise around a given axis. They may have their spin oriented in the same direction or in opposite directions. Because of [[magnetism|magnetic]] interactions between the particles, a hydrogen atom that has the spins of the electron and proton aligned in the same direction (parallel) has slightly more energy than one where the spins of the electron and proton are in opposite directions (anti-parallel).

The lowest orbital energy state of atomic hydrogen has [[hyperfine splitting]] arising from the spins of the proton and electron changing from  a [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to antiparallel configuration. This transition is highly [[forbidden line|forbidden]] with an extremely small probability of 2.9&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;15&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

This means that the time for a single isolated atom of neutral hydrogen to undergo this transition is around 10 million (10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) years and so is unlikely to be seen in a laboratory on Earth. However, as the total number of atoms of neutral hydrogen in the [[interstellar medium]] is very large, this emission line is easily observed by [[radio telescope]]s. Also, the lifetime can be considerably shortened by collisions with other hydrogen atoms and interaction with the [[cosmic microwave background]].

The line has an extremely small natural width because of its long lifetime, so most broadening is due to [[doppler shift]]s caused by the motion of the emitting regions relative to the observer.

==Discovery==

During the 1930s, it was noticed that there was a radio 'hiss' that varied on a daily cycle and appeared to be extraterrestrial in origin. After initial suggestions that this was due to the Sun, it was observed that the radio waves seemed to be coming from the centre of [[Milky Way|the Galaxy]]. These discoveries were published in 1940 and were seen by Professor [[Jan Hendrik Oort|J.H. Oort]] who knew that significant advances could be made in astronomy if there were [[emission line]]s in the radio part of the spectrum. He referred this to [[Hendrik van de Hulst|Dr Hendrik van de Hulst]] who, in 1944, discovered that [[electric charge|neutral]] [[hydrogen]] could produce radiation at a [[frequency]] of 1420.4058&amp;nbsp;MHz due to two closely spaced energy levels in the [[ground state]] of the [[hydrogen atom]].

The 21&amp;nbsp;cm line (1420.4&amp;nbsp;MHz) was first detected in 1951 by [[Harold Irving Ewen|Ewen]] and [[Edward Mills Purcell|Purcell]] at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ewan |first=H.I. |authorlink= |coauthors=E.M.

After 1952 the first maps of the neutral hydrogen in the Galaxy were made and revealed, for the first time, the spiral structure of the [[Milky Way]].

==Uses in radio astronomy==

Luckily, the spectral line appears within the [[radio spectrum]] (in the [[microwave window]] to be exact). Electromagnetic energy in this range can easily pass through the Earth's atmosphere and be observed from the Earth with little interference.  

Assuming that the hydrogen atoms are uniformly distributed throughout the galaxy, each line of sight through the galaxy will reveal a hydrogen line. The only difference between each of these lines is the doppler shift that each of these lines has. Hence, one can calculate the relative speed of each arm of our [[galaxy]]. The [[rotation curve]] of our [[galaxy]] has also been calculated using the 21-cm hydrogen line. It is then possible to use the plot of the [[rotation curve]] and the [[velocity]] to determine the distance to a certain point within the galaxy. 

Hydrogen line observations have also been used indirectly to calculate the mass of galaxies, to put limits on any changes over time of the universal [[gravitational constant]] and to study dynamics of individual galaxies.

== Uses in cosmology ==
The line is of great interest in [[big bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] because it is the only known way to probe the &quot;dark ages&quot; from [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] to [[reionization]]. Including the [[redshift]], this line will be observed at frequencies from 200&amp;nbsp;MHz to about 9&amp;nbsp;MHz on Earth. It potentially has two applications. First, by mapping redshifted 21 centimeter radiation  it can, in principle, provide a very precise picture of the [[matter power spectrum]] in the period after recombination. Second, it can provide a picture of how the universe was reionized, as neutral hydrogen which has been ionized by radiation from stars or quasars will appear as holes in the 21 centimeter background. 

However, 21 centimeter experiments are very difficult. Ground based experiments to observe the faint signal are plagued by interference from television transmitters and the [[ionosphere]], so they must be very secluded and careful about eliminating interference if they are to succeed. Space based experiments, even on the far side of the moon (which should not receive interference from terrestrial radio signals), have been proposed to compensate for this. Little is known about other effects, such as [[synchrotron radiation|synchrotron emission]] and free-free emission on the galaxy. Despite these problems, 21 centimeter observations, along with space-based gravity wave observations, are generally viewed as the next great frontier in observational cosmology, after the cosmic microwave background polarization.

==Uses in terrestrial remote sensing ==

The [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|Soil Moisture &amp; Ocean Salinity]] (SMOS) satellite's main scientific instrument [[Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis]] (MIRAS) uses the 1400-1427&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies (including 1420.406&amp;nbsp;MHz) to monitor the ocean surface salinity and the soil moisture of the Earth. The choice of HI band results from: 1) much better radiative signature of salinity and moisture in microwave than in higher frequencies, 2) no electromagnetic interference from anthropogenic sources, as HI is reserved for radioastronomy.

==Possible uses for SETI==
The [[Pioneer plaque]], attached to the [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] [[spacecraft]], portrays the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen and used the wavelength as a standard scale of measurement. For example the height of the woman in the image is displayed as eight times 21&amp;nbsp;cm, or 168&amp;nbsp;cm. Similarly the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip transition was used for a unit of time in a map to Earth included on the Pioneer plaques and also the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] probes.

On this map, the position of the Sun is portrayed relative to 14 [[pulsar]]s whose rotation period circa 1977 is given as a multiple of the frequency of the hydrogen spin-flip transition. It is theorized by the plaque's creators that an advanced civilization would then be able to use the locations of these pulsars to locate the [[Solar System]] at the time the spacecraft were launched.

The 21&amp;nbsp;cm Hydrogen line is considered a favorable frequency to search for signals from another civilization, as part of the [[SETI]] program. The original paper by [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] and [[Philip Morrison]] proposed just such a search in their paper, ''Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence''.[http://www.lifeinuniverse.org/noflash/SETI-07.html]

[[:ru:Маковецкий, Пётр Васильевич|Pyotr Makovetsky]] proposed to use for SETI a frequency which is equal to [[pi]] times 1420.4&amp;nbsp;MHz (pi times 1420.40575177 megahertz = 4.46233627 gigahertz; (2 * pi) times 1420.40575177 megahertz = 8.92467255 gigahertz). Since pi is a [[Transcendental number]], such frequency couldn't possibly be produced in a natural way as a [[harmonic]], and would clearly signify its artificial origin. Such signal would not be jammed by HI line itself,  or any of its harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;Makovetsky P. [http://n-t.ru/ri/mk/sk109-4.htm Smotri v koren'] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use==
The Turk's head knot is a decorative knot primarily used by [[Scouts]] as [[wikt:woggle|woggle]]s to attach their neckerchiefs. Like most decorative knots, it is hard to tie for the first time. 
==How to tie==
# Have in your hand about {{units|a metre|3 feet}} of rope.
# In the end, make a loop with end 2, then another that goes over it. (Figure 1, bottom of page)  
# Bring end 1 under end 2, then put it over, then under, then over, then under the rope each time that you cross it. You will then get something like figure 2. 
# Slide your thumb or a stick (of a diameter of about {{units|2cm|0.8 inches}}) into the square that has formed in the centre of the knot. In doing so, you will be able to keep this space open and use it to shape your knot.
# Still using end 1, follow end 2, as in figure 3. 
# Do as many cycles as you like. Usually, people make three turns, but nothing is stopping you from defying that tendency! The only thing to be aware of is how much rope you have left.
# The hardest part is over. You only have left to tighten your knot. To do that, start with one of the ends of the rope, then tighten the knot (not too hard) around your thumb or the stick that you placed in the middle. It's a long process, but you will see your knot taking shape.
# Cut the excess rope, and secure the two extremities in the ring (using a small reef knot or stitches, or you could also dip the whole thing in melted wax to solidify it). In doing so, you won't see the ends, which will make your knot even more attractive.
# Place your knot on an object of your choice and proudly show your creation to others!

[[File:Hydrogen spectrum.svg|frame|right|The spectral series of hydrogen, on a [[logarithm]]ic scale.]]

The [[emission spectrum]] of atomic [[hydrogen]] is divided into a number of '''spectral series''', with wavelengths given by the [[Rydberg formula]]. These observed spectral lines are due to electrons moving between energy levels in the atom. The spectral series are important in astronomy for detecting the presence of hydrogen and calculating [[red shift]]s. Further series were discovered as spectroscopy techniques developed.

==Physics==
In [[physics]], the spectral lines of hydrogen correspond to particular jumps of the [[electron]] between [[energy level]]s. The simplest model of the hydrogen atom is given by the [[Bohr model]]. When an electron jumps from a higher energy to a lower, a [[photon]] of a specific wavelength is emitted.
[[File:Hydrogen transitions.svg|thumb|left|400px|Electron transitions and their resulting wavelengths for Hydrogen. Energy levels are not to scale.]]
The spectral lines are grouped into series according to ''n'''. Lines are named sequentially starting from the longest wavelength/lowest frequency of the series, using Greek letters within each series. For example, the {{nowrap|2 &amp;rarr; 1}} line is called &quot;Lyman-alpha&quot; (Ly-α), while the {{nowrap|7 &amp;rarr; 3}} line is called &quot;Paschen-delta&quot; (Pa-δ). Some hydrogen spectral lines fall outside these series, such as the [[Hydrogen line|21 cm line]]; these correspond to much rarer atomic events such as [[hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/h21.html |title=The Hydrogen 21-cm Line |accessdate=2009-03-18 |work=[[Hyperphysics]] |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |date=2004-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fine structure]] also results in single spectral lines appearing as two or more closely grouped thinner lines, due to relativistic corrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liboff |first=Richard L. |author-link=Richard Liboff |title=Introductory Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2002 |isbn=0-8053-8714-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically one can only observe these series from pure hydrogen samples in a lab. Many of the lines are very faint and additional lines can be caused by other elements (such as [[helium]] if using sunlight, or [[nitrogen]] in the air). Lines outside of the visible spectrum typically cannot be seen in observations of sunlight, as the atmosphere absorbs most infra-red and ultraviolet wavelengths.

==Rydberg formula==
The energy differences between levels in the Bohr model, and hence the wavelengths of emitted/absorbed photons, is given by the Rydberg formula&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bohr |first=Niels |author-link=Niels Bohr |chapter=Rydberg's discovery of the spectral laws |editor-last=Kalckar |editor-first=J. |title=N. Bohr: Collected Works |publisher=North-Holland Publ. |publication-place=Amsterdam |publication-date=1985 |volume=10 |pages=373–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; {1 \over \lambda} = R \left( {1 \over (n^\prime)^2} - {1 \over n^2} \right) \qquad \left( R = 1.097373 \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{m}^{-1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' is the initial energy level, ''n&amp;prime;'' is the final energy level, and ''R'' is the [[Rydberg constant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CODATA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/codata.pdf |title=CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants: 2006 |work=Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) |publisher=[[NIST]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaningful values are returned only when ''n'' is greater than ''n&amp;prime;'' and the limit of one over infinity is taken to be zero.

==Series==
All wavelengths are given to 3 [[significant figures]].

Parts of the Balmer series can be seen in the [[Fraunhofer lines|solar spectrum]]. H-alpha is an important line used in astronomy to detect the presence of hydrogen.

===Further (n&amp;prime; &gt; 6)===
Further series are unnamed, but follow exactly the same pattern as dictated by the Rydberg equation. Series are increasingly spread out and occur in increasing wavelengths. The lines are also increasingly faint, corresponding to increasingly rare atomic events.

== Extension to other systems ==
The concepts of the Rydberg formula can be applied to any system with a single particle orbiting a nucleus, for example a [[Helium|He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ion or a [[muonium]] particle. The equation must be modified based on the system's [[Bohr radius]]; emissions will be of a similar character but at a different range of energies.

All other atoms possess at least two electrons in their [[ionization|unionized]] form and the interactions between these electrons makes analysis of the spectrum by such simple methods as described here impractical.  The deduction of the Rydberg formula was a major step in physics, but it was long before an extension to the spectra of other elements could be accomplished.

'''Hydrogen deuterium exchange''' (also called H-D or H/D exchange) is a [[chemical reaction]] in which a covalently bonded [[hydrogen]] atom is replaced by a [[deuterium]] atom, or vice versa. Usually the examined protons are the [[amide]]s in the backbone of a [[protein]]. The method gives information about the [[solvent]] accessibility of various parts of the molecule, and thus the [[protein structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein. Hydrogen exchange was first shown and explored by [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang]].

==The exchange reaction==
In solution, [[Amide]] [[hydrogen]]s in the [[peptide bond]]s of proteins exchange protons with the [[solvent]]. By changing the solvent from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, deuterons will be incorporated in the amide positions and the exchange reaction can be followed. Most often, deuterium is added to a protein in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O by diluting the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solution with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (e.g. tenfold). Usually exchange is performed at physiological pH (7.0-8.0) where proteins are in their most native ensemble of conformational states.  See also {{ref|englander}}.

Because the exchange reaction can be either [[acid]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]] catalyzed, it is strongly [[pH]] dependent. For the backbone amide hydrogens, the minimum exchange rate occurs at approximately pH 2.6, on average.  By performing the exchange at neutral pH and then rapidly changing the pH, the exchange rates of the backbone amide hydrogens can be dramatically slowed, or [[quenching|quenched]].  The pH at which the reaction is quenched depends on the analysis method.  For detection by NMR, the pH may be moved to around 4.0-4.5.  For detection by mass spectrometry, the pH is dropped to the minimum of the exchange curve, pH 2.6. In the most basic experiment, the reaction is allowed to take place for a set time before it is quenched.

The deuteration pattern of a quenched protein can be stably maintained in non-aqueous environments.  However, analysis of the deuteration is usually performed in an aqueous solution, which means that exchange will continue at a slow rate even after the reaction is quenched.  Reversion of deuterated positions after the quench step is referred to as ''back-exchange'' and various methods have been devised to correct for this.

==Detection of H/D exchange==
H-D exchange was measured originally by the father of hydrogen exchange [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang]] using density gradient tubes.  In modern times, H/D exchange has primarily been monitored by the methods: [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] and [[mass spectrometry]]. Each of these methods have their advantages and drawbacks.

===NMR spectroscopy===
[[Hydrogen]] and [[deuterium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are grossly different in their magnetic properties.  Thus it is possible to distinguish between them by [[NMR spectroscopy]]. Typically [[HSQC]] spectra are recorded at a series of timepoints while the hydrogen is exchanging with the deuterium. Since the HSQC experiment is specific for hydrogen, the signal will decay exponentially as the hydrogen exchanges. It is then possible to fit an exponential function to the data, and obtain the exchange constant. This method gives [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]-specific information for all the residues in the protein simultaneously. The major drawback is that it requires a prior assignment of the spectrum for the protein in question. This can be very labor intensive, and usually limits the method to proteins smaller than 25 [[Atomic mass unit|kDa]]. Because it takes minutes to hours to record the spectra, it is difficult to obtain information about amides, that exchange in shorter time frames.

===Mass spectrometry===
Mass spectrometry has several advantages over NMR with respect to analysis of H/D exchange reactions: Much less material is needed, the concentration of protein can be very low (as low as 0.1 uM), the size limit is much greater, and data can usually be collected and interpreted much more quickly{{ref|review}}.

The deuterium nucleus is twice as heavy as the hydrogen nucleus because it contains a [[neutron]] as well as a proton.  Thus a protein that contains some deuterium will be heavier than one that contains all hydrogen. As a protein is increasingly deuterated, the [[molecular mass]] increases correspondingly.  Detecting the change in the mass of a protein upon deuteration was made possible by modern protein mass spectrometry, first reported in 1991 by Katta and Chait {{ref|katta}}.

The location and relative amount of deuterium exchange along the peptide backbone can be determined roughly by subjecting the protein to proteolysis after the exchange reaction has been quenched.  Individual peptides are then analyzed for overall deuteration of each peptide fragment.  Using this technique the resolution of deuterium exchange is determined by the size of the peptides produced during digestion {{ref|zhang}}.  [[Pepsin]], an acid [[protease]], is commonly used for proteolysis, as the quench pH must be maintained during the proteolytic reaction.  To minimize the back-exchange, proteolysis and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis must be done as quickly as possible.  [[HPLC]] separation of the peptic digest is often carried out at low temperature just prior to [[electrospray mass spectrometry]] to minimize back-exchange. More recently, [[UPLC]] has been used due to its superior separation capabilities {{ref|uplc}}.

It was proposed in 1999 that it might be possible to achieve single-residue resolution by using [[collision-induced dissociation]] fragmentation of deuterated peptides in conjunction with [[tandem mass spectrometry]]. It was soon discovered that CID causes &quot;scrambling&quot; of the deuterium position within the peptides {{ref|scrambling1}}{{ref|scrambling2}}. However, collisions produced by [[electron transfer dissociation]] seem to proceed with little or no scrambling under the correct experimental conditions {{ref|scrambling3}}.  This suggests that eventually it may be possible to obtain single-residue resolution of H/D exchange reactions on a routine basis.

==Applications to protein structure==
It is not possible to determine the structure of a protein with H/D exchange nor is it possible to define secondary structural elements.  The reasons for this are related to the way in which [[protein structure]] structure slows exchange.  Exchange rates are a function of two parameters: solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding.  Thus an amide which is part of a intramolecular [[hydrogen bond]] will exchange slowly if at all, while an amide on the surface of protein hydrogen bonded to water will exchange rapidly. Amides buried from the solvent but not hydrogen bonded may also have very slow exchange rates.  Because both solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding contribute to the rate of exchange, it becomes difficult to attribute a given exchange rate to a structural element without [[x-ray crystallography]] or NMR structural data.

H/D exchange has been used to characterize the [[protein folding|folding]] pathway of proteins, by refolding the protein under exchange conditions. The parts of the structure that form rapidly, will be protected quickly, and thus not exchanged, whereas areas that fold late in the pathway will be exposed to the exchange for longer periods of time. Thus H/D exchange can be used to determine the sequence of various folding events. The critical factor determining the time resolution of this approach is the time required for quenching.

H/D exchange has been used to characterize protein-protein interactions{{ref|komives}}. The exchange reaction needs to be carried out with the isolated proteins and with the complex. The exchanging regions are then compared. If a region is buried by the binding, the amides in this region may be protected in the complex and exchange slowly. However, one must bear in mind that H-D exchange cannot be used to locate binding interfaces for all protein-protein interactions.  Some protein-protein interactions are driven by electrostatic forces of side chains and are unlikely to change the exchange rate of backbone amide hydrogens, particularly if the amide hydrogens are located in stable structural elements such as alpha helicies.

Lastly, H/D exchange can be used to monitor conformational changes in proteins as they relate to protein function.  If conformation is altered as result of [[post-translational modification]], enzyme activation, drug binding or other functional events, there will likely be a change to H/D exchange that can be detected.

==Uses==
MRS allows doctors and researchers to obtain biochemical information about the tissues of the human body in a non-invasive way (without the need for a biopsy), whereas MRI only gives them information about the structure of the body (the distribution of water and fat).

For example, whereas MRI can tell doctors where a tumour (cancer) is located within a patient's body, MRS can, in theory, tell them how aggressive (malignant) the tumour is.

MRS equipment can be tuned (just like a radio receiver) to pick up signals from different chemical nuclei within the body. The most common nuclei to be studied are protons (hydrogen), phosphorus, carbon, sodium and fluorine.

The types of biochemicals (metabolites) which can be studied include choline-containing compounds (which are used to make cell membranes), creatine (a chemical involved in energy metabolism), inositol and glucose (both sugars), N-acetyl aspartate (a chemical associated with the myelin sheaths of nerve cell fibres), and alanine and lactate which are elevated in some tumors.

At present MRS is mainly used as a tool by scientists (e.g., medical physicists and biochemists) for medical research projects, but it is becoming clear that it also has the ability to give doctors useful clinical information which can be helpful in diagnosis and treatment of disease.

MRS is currently used to investigate a number of diseases in the human body, most notably cancer (in brain, breast and prostate), epilepsy, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's Chorea.

==Example==

Shown below is an MRI brain scan (in the axial plane, that is slicing from front-to-back and side-to-side through the head) showing a brain tumour (meningioma) at the bottom right. The red box shows the volume of interest from which chemical information was obtained by MRS (a cube with 2&amp;nbsp;cm sides which produces a square when intersecting the 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick slice of the MRI scan).

The proton MRS spectrum from this tumour is also shown (as acquired with a 1.5 tesla whole-body MRI scanner). The horizontal axis is NMR frequency (or chemical shift in parts per million, p.p.m., relative to a reference chemical at 0 p.p.m. rather than in the absolute units of hertz) and the vertical axis is signal strength (in arbitrary units).

Each biochemical, or metabolite, has a different peak in the spectrum which appears at a known frequency.  The peaks corresponding to the amino acid alanine, are highlighted in red (at 1.4 p.p.m). This is an example of the kind of biochemical information which can help doctors to make their diagnosis. Other metabolites of note are choline (3.2 p.p.m.) and creatine (3.0 p.p.m.).

'''Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy''' (ICP-AES), also referred to as inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), is an analytical technique used for the detection of trace metals. It is a type of [[emission spectroscopy]] that uses the [[inductively coupled plasma]] to produce excited atoms and ions that emit [[electromagnetic radiation]] at wavelengths characteristic of a particular [[Chemical element|element]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17386476&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stefánsson A, Gunnarsson I, Giroud N | title = New methods for the direct determination of dissolved inorganic, organic and total carbon in natural waters by Reagent-Free Ion Chromatography and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry | journal = Anal.

==Mechanism==
[[Image:ICP-AES_Plasma_Torch_-_001.jpg|thumb|300px|right|ICP Plasma &quot;torch&quot;.]]
The ICP-AES is composed of two parts: the ICP and the optical [[spectrometer]]. The ICP torch consists of 3 concentric [[quartz]] glass tubes.  The output or &quot;work&quot; coil of the [[radio frequency]] (RF) generator surrounds part of this quartz torch. [[Argon]] gas is typically used to create the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

When the torch is turned on, an intense [[electromagnetic field]] is created within the coil by the high power [[radio frequency]] signal flowing in the coil.  This RF signal is created by the RF generator which is, effectively, a high power radio transmitter driving the &quot;work coil&quot; the same way a typical radio transmitter drives a transmitting antenna.  The argon gas flowing through the torch is ignited with a [[Tesla]] unit that creates a brief discharge arc through the argon flow to initiate the ionization process.  Once the plasma is &quot;ignited&quot;, the Tesla unit is turned off.

The argon gas is ionized in the intense electromagnetic field and flows in a particular rotationally symmetrical pattern towards the magnetic field of the RF coil. A stable, high temperature plasma of about 7000 K is then generated as the result of the inelastic collisions created between the neutral argon atoms and the charged particles.

A [[peristaltic pump]] delivers an aqueous or organic sample into a [[nebulizer]] where it is atomized and introduced directly inside the plasma flame. The sample immediately collides with the electrons and other charged ions in the plasma and is broken down into charged [[ions]]. The various molecules break up into their respective atoms which then lose [[electron]]s and recombine repeatedly in the plasma, giving off radiation at the characteristic [[wavelength]]s of the elements involved.

In some designs, a shear gas, typically [[nitrogen]] or dry compressed air is used to 'cut' the plasma flame at a specific spot. One or two transfer lenses are then used to focus the emitted light on a [[diffraction grating]] where it is separated into its component wavelengths in the optical spectrometer.  In other designs, the plasma impinges directly upon an optical interface which consists of an orifice from which a constant flow of argon emerges, deflecting the plasma and providing cooling while allowing the emitted light from the plasma to enter the optical chamber.  Still other designs use optical fibers to convey some of the light to separate optical chambers.

Within the optical chamber(s), after the light is separated into its different wavelengths (colors), the light intensity is measured with a [[photomultiplier]] tube or tubes physically positioned to &quot;view&quot; the specific wavelength(s) for each element line involved, or, in more modern units, the separated colors fall upon an array of semiconductor photodetectors such as CCDs [[charge coupled devices]].  In units using these detector arrays, the intensities of all wavelengths (within the system's range) can be measured simultaneously, allowing the instrument to analyze for every element to which the unit is sensitive all at once.  Thus, samples can be analyzed very quickly.

The intensity of each line is then compared to previously measured intensities of known [[concentration]]s of the elements, and their concentrations are then computed by extrapolation along the calibration lines.

In addition, special software generally corrects for interferences caused by the presence of different elements within a given sample matrix.

==Applications==
Examples of the application of ICP-AES include the determination of metals in wine,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11820494&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aceto M, Abollino O, Bruzzoniti MC, Mentasti E, Sarzanini C, Malandrino M | title = Determination of metals in wine with atomic spectroscopy (flame-AAS, GF-AAS and ICP-AES); a review | journal = Food additives and contaminants | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–33 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11820494 | doi =10.1080/02652030110071336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; arsenic in food,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10497786&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Benramdane L, Bressolle F, Vallon JJ | title = Arsenic speciation in humans and food products: a review | journal = Journal of chromatographic science | volume = 37 | issue = 9 | pages = 330–44 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10497786 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and trace elements bound to proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15300764&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ma R, McLeod CW, Tomlinson K, Poole RK | title = Speciation of protein-bound trace elements by gel electrophoresis and atomic spectrometry | journal = Electrophoresis | volume = 25 | issue = 15 | pages = 2469–77 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15300764 | doi = 10.1002/elps.200405999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICP-OES is widely used in [[Mineral processing|minerals processing]] to provide the data on grades of various streams, for the construction of mass balances.

ICP-AES is often used for analysis of trace elements in soil, and it is for that reason it is often used in forensics to ascertain the origin of soil samples found at crime scenes or on victims etc. Taking one sample from a control and determining the metal composition and taking the sample obtained from evidence and determine that metal composition allows a comparison to be made. While soil evidence may not stand alone in court it certainly strengthens other evidence.

'''Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry''' ('''ICP-MS''') is a type of [[mass spectrometry]] that is highly sensitive and capable of the determination of a range of [[metals]] and several [[non-metals]] at concentrations below one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (part per trillion). It is based on coupling together an [[inductively coupled plasma]] as a method of producing [[ions]] ([[ionization]]) with a [[mass spectrometer]] as a method of separating and detecting the ions.  ICP-MS is also capable of monitoring isotopic speciation for the ions of choice.


==Components==

===Inductively coupled plasma===
An [[inductively coupled plasma]] is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that contains a sufficient concentration of ions and electrons to make the gas electrically conductive. The plasmas used in spectrochemical  analysis are essentially electrically neutral, with each positive charge on an ion balanced by a free electron. In these plasmas the positive ions are almost all singly-charged and there are few negative ions, so there are nearly equal amounts of ions and electrons in each unit volume of plasma 

An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) for spectrometry is sustained in a torch that consists of three concentric tubes, usually made of quartz. The end of this torch is placed inside an induction coil supplied with a radio-frequency electric current. A flow of argon gas (usually 14 to 18 liters per  minute) is introduced between the two outermost tubes of the torch and an electrical spark is applied for a short time to introduce free electrons into the gas stream. These electrons interact with the radio-frequency magnetic field of the induction coil and are accelerated first in one direction, then the other, as the field changes at high frequency (usually 27.12 million cycles per second). The accelerated electrons collide with argon atoms, and sometimes a collision causes an argon atom to part with one of its electrons. The released electron is in turn accelerated by the rapidly-changing magnetic field. The process continues until the rate of release of new electrons in collisions is balanced by the rate of recombination of electrons with argon ions (atoms that have lost an electron). This produces a ‘fireball’ that consists mostly of argon atoms with a rather small fraction of free electrons and argon ions. The temperature of the plasma is very high, of the order of 10,000 K.

The ICP can be retained in the quartz torch because the flow of gas between the two outermost tubes keeps the plasma away from the walls of the torch. A second flow of argon (around 1 liter per minute) is usually introduced between the central tube and the intermediate tube to keep the plasma away from the end of the central tube. A third flow (again usually around 1 liter per minute) of gas is introduced into the central tube of the torch. This gas flow passes through the centre of the plasma, where it forms a channel that is cooler than the surrounding plasma but still much hotter than a chemical flame. Samples to be analyzed are introduced into this central channel, usually as a mist of liquid formed by passing the liquid sample into a nebulizer. 

As a droplet of nebulized sample enters the central channel of the ICP, it evaporates and any solids that were dissolved in the liquid vaporize and then break down into atoms. At the temperatures prevailing in the plasma a significant proportion of the atoms of many chemical elements are ionized, each atom losing its most loosely-bound electron to form a singly charged ion.

===Mass spectrometry===
For coupling to [[mass spectrometry]], the ions from the plasma are extracted through a series of cones into a mass spectrometer, usually a [[Quadrupole mass analyzer|quadrupole]]. The ions are separated on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio and a detector receives an ion signal [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the concentration.

The concentration of a sample can be determined through calibration with [[certified reference material]] such as single or multi-element reference standards. ICP-MS also lends itself to quantitative determinations through [[Isotope Dilution]], a single point method based on an isotopically enriched standard.

Other mass analyzers coupled to ICP systems include double focusing magnetic-electrostatic sector systems with both single and multiple collector, as well as time of flight systems (both [[axial]] and [[orthogonal]] accelerators have been used).

Other types of spectrometers using ICP are [[ICP-AES]] (atomic emission spectrometer) and MC-ICP-MS (multi-collector).

==Routine Maintenance==
As with any piece of instrumentation or equipment, there are many aspects of maintenance that need to be encompassed by daily, weekly and annual procedures.  The frequency of maintenance is typically determined by the sample volume and cumulative run time that the instrument is subjected to.  

One of the first things that should be carried out before the calibration of the ICP-MS is a sensitivity check and optimization.  This ensures that the operator is aware of any possible issues with the instrument and if so, may address them before beginning a calibration.  Typical indicators of sensitivity are Rhodium levels, Cerium/Oxide ratios and DI water blanks.  

One of the most frequent forms of routine maintenance is changing out sample and waste tubing on the peristaltic pump, as these tubes can get worn fairly quickly resulting in holes and clogs in the sample line, resulting in skewed results.  Other parts that will need regular cleaning and/or replacing are sample tips, nebulizer tips, sample cones, skimmer cones, injector tubes, torches and lenses.  It may also be necessary to change the oil in the interface roughing pump as well as the vacuum backing pump, depending on the workload put on the instrument.

==Metal speciation==
A growing trend in the world of elemental analysis has revolved around the speciation of certain metals such as chromium and arsenic.  One of the primary techniques to achieve this is to use an ICP-MS in combination with an [[HPLC]].  There are many advantages, from a clinical standpoint, in knowing the specific species present within a patient's body.  For example, one species of [[chromium]], known as Chromium III or Trivalent Chromium, is needed by the body and causes no ill effects; however, Chromium VI or Hexavalent Chromium, is very toxic to the body.  Chromium VI can cause mutations that may lead to cancer if not repaired by the body.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

It is also beneficial for a clinician to utilize speciation analysis from a preventative standpoint.  Many patients, who suffer from elevated levels of certain metals, do not know when or where the exposure incident(s) are occurring.  By identifying the exact species, a physician can better narrow the search for possible exposure sites, therefore helping the patient to avoid certain areas in the future.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Quantification of proteins and biomolecules by ICP-MS==
There is an increasing trend of using ICP-MS as a tool in Speciation Analysis, which normally involves a front end chromatograph separation and an [[elemental selective detector]], such as AAS and ICP-MS. For example, ICP-MS may be combined with size exclusion chromatograph] and quantitative preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ([[QPNC-PAGE]]) for identifying and quantifying native metal cofactor containing proteins in biofluids. Also the phosphorylation status of proteins can be analyzed.

Recently{{when?}} a new type of protein tagging reagents called metal coded affinity tags (MeCAT) were introduced to label proteins quantitatively with metals, especially lanthanides.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17627934&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ahrends R, Pieper S, Kühn A, ''et al.'' |title=A metal-coded affinity tag approach to quantitative proteomics |journal= Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics|volume= 6|issue=  11| pages = 1907|year=2007 |pmid=17627934 |doi=10.1074/mcp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MeCAT labelling allows relative and absolute quantification of all kind of proteins or other biomolecules like peptides. MeCAT comprises a site-specific biomolecule tagging group with at least a strong chelate group which binds metals. The MeCAT labelled proteins can be accurately quantified by ICP-MS down to low attomol amount of analyte which is at least 2-3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than other mass spectrometry based quantification methods. By introducing several MeCAT labels to a biomolecule and further optimization of LC-ICP-MS detection limits in the zeptomol range are within the realms of possibility. By using different lanthanides MeCAT multiplexing can be used for pharmacokinetics of proteins and peptides or the analysis of the differential expression of proteins (proteomics) e.g. in biological fluids. Breakable PAGE SDS-PAGE (DPAGE, dissolvable PAGE), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or chromatography is used for separation of MeCAT labelled proteins. Flow-injection ICP-MS analysis of protein bands or spots from DPAGE SDS-PAGE gels can be easily performed by dissolving the DPAGE gel after electrophoresis and staining of the gel. MeCAT labelled proteins are identified and relatively quantified  on peptide level by MALDI-MS or ESI-MS.

==Sample introduction==
The first step in analysis is the introduction of the sample. This has been achieved in ICP-MS through a variety of means.

The most common method is the use of a [[nebulizer]]. This is a device which converts liquids into an aerosol, and that aerosol can then be swept into the plasma to create the ions. Nebulizers work best with simple liquid samples (i.e. solutions). However, there have been instances of their use with more complex materials like a [[slurry]]. Many varieties of nebulizers have been coupled to ICP-MS, including pneumatic, cross-flow, Babington, ultrasonic, and desolvating types. The aerosol generated is often treated to limit it to only smallest droplets, commonly by means of a double pass or cyclonic spray chamber. Use of autosamplers makes this easier and faster.

Less commonly, the [[laser ablation]] has been used as a means of sample introduction. In this method, a laser is focused on the sample and creates a plume of ablated material which can be swept into the plasma. This is particularly useful for solid samples, though can be difficult to create standards for leading the challenges in quantitative analysis.

Other methods of sample introduction are also utilized. Electrothermal vaporization (ETV) and in torch vaporization (ITV) use hot surfaces (graphite or metal, generally) to vaporize samples for introduction. These can use very small amounts of liquids, solids, or slurries. Other methods like vapor generation are also known.

==Transfer of ions into vacuum==
The carrier gas (usually [[argon]] or occasionally [[helium]]) is sent through the central channel and into the very hot plasma. The sample is then exposed to [[radio frequency]] which converts the gas into a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The high temperature of the plasma is sufficient to cause a very large portion of the sample to form ions. This fraction of ionization can approach 100% for some elements (e.g. sodium), but this is dependent on the ionization potential. A fraction of the formed ions passes through a ~1mm hole (sampler cone) and then a ~0.4mm hole (skimmer cone). The purpose of which is to allow a [[vacuum]] that is required by the [[mass spectrometer]].

The vacuum is created and maintained by a series of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a roughing pump, most commonly a standard rotary vane pump. This removes most of the gas and typically reaches a pressure of around 133 Pa. Later stages have their vacuum generated by more powerful vacuum systems, most often turbomolecular pumps. Older instruments may have used oil diffusion pumps for high vacuum regions.

==Sample Preparation==
For most clinical methods using ICP-MS, there is a relatively simple and quick sample prep process.  The main component to the sample is an internal standard, which also serves as the diluent.  This internal standard consists primarily of [[deionized water]], with nitric or hydrochloric acid, and Indium and/or Gallium.  Depending on the sample type, usually 5 ml of the internal standard is added to a test tube along with 10-500 microliters of sample. This mixture is then vortexed for several seconds or until mixed well and then loaded onto the autosampler tray.
For other applications that may involve very viscous samples or samples that have particulate matter, a process known as [[sample digestion]] may have to be carried out, before it can be pipetted and analyzed.  This adds an extra first step to the above process, and therefore makes the sample prep more lengthy.

==Ion optics==

Before mass separation, a beam of positive ions has to be extracted from the plasma and focused into the mass-analyzer. It is important to separate the ions from UV photons, energetic neutrals and from any solid particles that may have been carried into the instrument from the ICP. Traditionally, ICP-MS instruments have used transmitting ion lens arrangements for this purpose. Examples include the Einzel lens, the Barrel lens, Agilent's Omega Lens &lt;ref&gt;Kenichi Sakata et al., Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and method, US patent 6265717 B1.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Perkin-Elmer's Shadow Stop &lt;ref&gt; ''Scott D. Tanner et al.'', Device and method preventing ion source gases from entering reaction cell, US patent 6639665 B2.&lt;/ref&gt;. Another approach is to use ion guides (quadrupoles, hexapoles, or octopoles) to guide the ions into mass analyzer along a path away from the trajectory of photons or neutral particles. Yet another approach is [[Varian]] patented used by [[Bruker]]  &lt;ref&gt; ''Iouri Kalinitchenko'' Ion Optical System for a Mass Spectrometer, United States Patent Number 6,614,021 B1 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; 90 degrees reflecting &quot;Ion Mirror&quot; optics, which are claimed to provide more efficient ion transport into the mass-analyzer, resulting in better sensitivity and reduced background &lt;ref&gt; ''Shane Elliott, Michael Knowles, and Iouri Kalinitchenko'', A Change in Direction in ICP-MS, published on Mar, 2004 in American Laboratory,

These ions are removed by injecting a collisional gas (He), or a reactive gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or a mixture of the two, directly into the plasma as it flows through the skimmer cone and/or the sampler cone. Supplying the reactive/collisional gas into the tip of the skimmer cone and/or into the tip of the sampler cone induces extra collisions and reactions that destroy polyatomic ions in the passing plasma.

==Plasma==
The plasma used in an ICP-MS is made by ionizing argon gas (Ar → Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).  The energy required for this reaction is obtained by pulsing an electrical current in wires that surround the argon gas.  A complete description of plasma generation is given in the following section.

After injecting the sample, the plasma's extreme temperature causes the sample to separate into individual atoms ([[atomization]]).  Next, the plasma ionizes these atoms (M → M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) so that they can be detected by the mass spectrometer.

===Plasma Generation===
An inductively coupled plasma (ICP) for spectrometry is sustained in a torch that consists of three concentric tubes, usually made of quartz. The end of this torch is placed inside an induction coil supplied with a radio-frequency electric current. A flow of argon gas (usually 14 to 18 liters per minute) is introduced between the two outermost tubes of the torch and an electrical spark is applied for a short time to introduce free electrons into the gas stream. These electrons interact with the radio-frequency magnetic field of the induction coil and are accelerated first in one direction, then the other, as the field changes at high frequency (usually 27.12 million cycles per second). The accelerated electrons collide with argon atoms, and sometimes a collision causes an argon atom to part with one of its electrons. The released electron is in turn accelerated by the rapidly-changing magnetic field. The process continues until the rate of release of new electrons in collisions is balanced by the rate of recombination of electrons with argon ions (atoms that have lost an electron). This produces a ‘fireball’ that consists mostly of argon atoms with a rather small fraction of free electrons and argon ions.

===Advantage of Argon===
Making the plasma from argon, instead of other gases, has several advantages.  First, argon is abundant (in the atmosphere, as a result of the radioactive decay of potassium) and therefore cheaper than other noble gases. Argon also has a higher first ionization potential than all other elements except He, F, and Ne.  Because of this high ionization energy, the reaction  (Ar&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Ar) is more energetically favorable than the reaction (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → M).  This ensures that the sample remains ionized (as M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) so that the mass spectrometer can detect it.

Argon can be purchased for use with the ICP-MS in either a refrigerated liquid or a gas form.  However it is important to note that whichever form of argon purchased, it should have a guaranteed purity of 99.9% Argon at a minimum.  It is important to determine which type of argon will be best suited for the specific situation.  Liquid argon is typically cheaper and can be stored in a greater quantity as opposed to the gas form, which is more expensive and takes up more tank space.  If the instrument is in an environment where it gets infrequent use, then buying argon in the gas state will be most appropriate as it will be more than enough to suit smaller run times and gas in the cylinder will remain stable for longer periods of time, whereas liquid argon will suffer loss to the environment due to venting of the tank when stored over extended time frames.  However if the ICP-MS is to be used routinely and is on and running for eight or more hours each day for several days a week, then going with liquid argon will be the most suitable.  If there are to be multiple ICP-MS instruments running for long periods of time, then it will most likely be beneficial for the laboratory to install a bulk or micro bulk argon tank which will be maintained by a gas supply company, thus eliminating the need to change out tanks frequently as well as minimizing loss of argon that is left over in each used tank as well as down time for tank changeover.

==Elemental analysis==
The ICP-MS allows determination of [[chemical element|elements]] with atomic mass ranges 7 to 250. This encompasses [[Lithium|Li]] to [[U]]. Some masses are prohibited such as 40 due to the abundance of argon in the sample. Other blocked regions may include mass 80 (due to the argon dimer), and mass 56 (due to ArO), the latter of which greatly hinders [[Fe]] analysis unless the instrumentation is fitted with a reaction chamber.

A typical ICP-MS will be able to detect in the region of nanograms per litre to 10 or 100 milligrams per litre or around 8 orders of magnitude of concentration units.

Unlike [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], which can only measure a single element at a time ICP-MS has the capability to scan for all elements simultaneously. This allows rapid sample processing. A simultaneous ICP-MS that can record the entire analytical spectrum from lithium to uranium in every analysis won the Silver Award at the 2010 [[Pittcon Editors' Awards]].

==Usage==
One of the largest volume uses for ICP-MS is in the medical and forensic field, specifically, toxicology.  A physician may order a metal assay for a number of reasons, such as suspicion of heavy metal poisoning, metabolic concerns, and even hepatological issues.  Depending on the specific parameters unique to each patient's diagnostic plan, samples collected for analysis can range from whole blood, urine, plasma, serum, to even packed red blood cells.  Another primary use for this instrument lies in the environmental field.  Such applications include water testing for municipalities or private individuals all the way to soil, water and other material analysis for industrial purposes.  

In recent years, industrial and biological monitoring has presented another major need for metal analysis via ICP-MS.  Individuals working in plants where exposure to metals is likely and unavoidable, such as a battery factory, are required by their employer, to have their blood or urine analyzed for metal toxicity on a regular basis.  This monitoring has become a mandatory practice implemented by OSHA, in an effort to protect workers from their work environment and ensure proper rotation of work duties (i.e. rotating employees from a high exposure position to a low exposure position).

Regardless of the sample type, blood, water, etc., it is important that it be free of clots or other particulate matter, as even the smallest clot can disrupt sample flow and block or clog the sample tips within the spray chamber.  Very high concentrations of salts, e.g. sodium chloride in sea water, can eventually lead to blockages as some of the ions reunite after leaving the torch and build up around the orifice of the skimmer cone.  This can be avoided by diluting samples whenever high salt concentrations are suspected, though at a cost to detection limits.

ICP is used for [[motor oil]] analysis. Analyzing used motor oil reveals a great deal about how the engine is operating. Parts that wear in the engine will deposit traces in the oil which can be detected with ICP. ICP analysis can help to determine whether parts are failing. In addition, ICP can determine what amount of the original oil additives remain, and tell how much service life the oil has remaining. Oil analysis is often used by fleet manager or automotive enthusiasts who have an interest in finding out as much about their engine's operation as possible.

This technique is also widely used the field of radiometric dating, in which it is used to analyze relative abundance of different isotopes. ICP-MS is more suitable for this application than the previously used Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry, as species with high ionization energy such as Osmium (Os) and Tungsten (Hf-W) can be easily ionized.

In physical chemistry|physical and analytical chemistry, infrared spectroscopy (&quot;IR spectroscopy&quot;) is a technique used to identify chemical compounds based on how infrared|infrared radiation is absorbed by the compounds' chemical bonds. This article is an '''IR spectroscopy correlation table''' that lists some general absorption peaks for common types of atomic bonds and functional groups. Note that this information is unreferenced, and may not be accurate.

The absorptions in this range do not apply only to bonds in organic molecules. IR spectroscopy is useful when it comes to analysis of inorganic compounds (such as metal complexes  or fluoromanganates) as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Infrared spectroscopy''' (IR spectroscopy) is the subset of spectroscopy that deals with the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It covers a range of techniques, the most common being a form of absorption spectroscopy. As with spectroscopy|all spectroscopic techniques, it can be used to identify compounds or investigate sample composition. Infrared spectroscopy correlation tables are tabulated in the literature.

== Background and Theory ==
The infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is divided into three regions; the near-, mid- and far- infrared, named for their relation to the visible spectrum. The far-infrared, approximately  400-10&amp;nbsp;wavenumber|cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1000–30&amp;nbsp;μm), lying adjacent to the microwave region, has low energy and may be used for rotational spectroscopy. The mid-infrared, approximately 4000–400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (30–1.4&amp;nbsp;μm) may be used to study the fundamental vibrations and associated Rovibronic excitation|rotational-vibrational structure. The higher energy near-IR, approximately 14000–4000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (1.4–0.8&amp;nbsp;μm) can excite overtones|overtone or Harmonic (mathematics)|harmonic vibrations. The names and classifications of these subregions are merely conventions. They are neither strict divisions nor based on exact molecular or electromagnetic properties.

Infrared spectroscopy exploits the fact that molecules have specific frequencies at which they rotate or vibrate corresponding to discrete energy levels (vibrational modes). These resonant frequency|resonant frequencies are determined by the shape of the molecular potential energy surfaces, the masses of the atoms and, by the associated vibronic coupling.  In order for a vibrational mode in a molecule to be IR active, it must be associated with changes in the permanent dipole.  In particular, in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation|Born-Oppenheimer and harmonic approximations, i.e. when the molecular Hamiltonian corresponding to the electronic ground state can be approximated by a quantum harmonic oscillator|harmonic oscillator in the neighborhood of the equilibrium molecular geometry, the resonant frequencies are determined by the normal modes corresponding to the molecular electronic ground state potential energy surface. Nevertheless, the resonant frequencies can be in a first approach related to the strength of the bond, and the atomic mass|mass of the atoms at either end of it. Thus, the frequency of the vibrations can be associated with a particular bond type. 

Simple diatomic molecules have only one bond, which may stretch. More complex molecules have many bonds, and  vibrations can be conjugated, leading to infrared absorptions at characteristic frequencies that may be related to chemical groups. For example, the atoms in a CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group, commonly found in organic compounds can vibrate in six different ways: '''symmetrical and antisymmetrical stretching''', '''scissoring''', '''rocking''', '''wagging''' and '''twisting''':

The infrared spectrum of a sample is collected by passing a beam of infrared light through the sample.  Examination of the transmitted light reveals how much energy was absorbed at each wavelength. This can be done with a monochromatic beam, which changes in wavelength over time, or by using a Fourier transform instrument to measure all wavelengths at once. From this, a transmittance or absorbance spectrum can be produced, showing at which IR wavelengths the sample absorbs.  Analysis of these absorption characteristics reveals details about the molecular structure of the sample.

This technique works almost exclusively on samples with covalent bonds. Simple spectra are obtained from samples with few IR active bonds and high levels of purity. More complex molecular structures lead to more absorption bands and more complex spectra. The technique has been used for the characterization of very complex mixtures.

== Sample preparation ==
Gaseous samples require little preparation beyond purification, but a sample cell with a long pathlength (typically 5–10&amp;nbsp;cm) is normally needed, as gases show relatively weak absorbances.

Liquid samples can be sandwiched between two plates of a high purity salt (commonly sodium chloride, or table salt, although a number of other salts such as potassium bromide or calcium fluoride are also used). The plates are transparent to the infrared light and will not introduce any lines onto the spectra. Some salt plates are highly soluble in water, so the sample and washing reagents must be anhydrous (without water).

Solid samples can be prepared in four major ways. The first is to crush the sample with a mulling agent (usually nujol) in a marble or agate mortar, with a pestle. A thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured.

The second method is to grind a quantity of the sample with a specially purified salt (usually potassium bromide) finely (to remove scattering effects from large crystals). This powder mixture is then crushed in a mechanical die press to form a translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass.

The third technique is the Cast Film technique, which is used mainly for polymeric materials. The sample is first dissolved in a suitable, non hygroscopic solvent. A drop of this solution is deposited on surface of KBr or NaCl cell. The solution is then evaporated to dryness and the film formed on the cell is analysed directly. Care is important to ensure that the film is not too thick otherwise light cannot pass through. This technique is suitable for qualitative analysis.

The final method is to use microtomy to cut a thin (20-100 micrometre) film from a solid sample. This is one of the most important ways of analysing failed plastic products for example because the integrity of the solid is preserved. 

It is important to note that spectra obtained from different sample preparation methods will look slightly different from each other due to differences in the samples' physical states.

== Typical method ==
[[Image:IR spectroscopy apparatus.jpeg|thumbnail|right|400px|Typical apparatus]]
A beam of infrared light is produced and split into two separate beams. One is passed through the sample, the other passed through a reference which is often the substance the sample is dissolved in. The beams are both reflected back towards a detector, however first they pass through a splitter which quickly alternates which of the two beams enters the detector. The two signals are then compared and a printout is obtained. 

A reference is used for two reasons:
*This prevents fluctuations in the output of the source affecting the data

*This allows the effects of the solvent to be cancelled out (the reference is usually a pure form of the solvent the sample is in)

== Uses and applications ==

Infrared spectroscopy is widely used in both research and industry as a simple and reliable technique for measurement, quality control and dynamic measurement. It is of especial use in forensic analysis in both criminal and civil cases, enabling identification of polymer degradation for example. It is perhaps the most widely used method of applied spectroscopy.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

The instruments are now small, and can be transported, even for use in field trials. With increasing technology in computer filtering and manipulation of the results, samples in solution can now be measured accurately (water produces a broad absorbance across the range of interest, and thus renders the spectra unreadable without this computer treatment). Some instruments will also automatically tell you what substance is being measured from a store of thousands of reference spectra held in storage.

By measuring at a specific frequency over time, changes in the character or quantity of a particular bond can be measured. This is especially useful in measuring the degree of polymerization in polymer manufacture. Modern research instruments can take infrared measurements across the whole range of interest as frequently as 32 times a second. This can be done whilst simultaneous measurements are made using other techniques. This makes the observations of chemical reactions and processes quicker and more accurate.

Techniques have been developed to assess the quality of tea-leaves using infrared spectroscopy. This will mean that highly trained experts (also called 'noses') can be used more sparingly, at a significant cost saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Luypaert|first1=J.|last2=Zhang|first2=M.H.|last3=Massart|first3=D.L.

Infrared spectroscopy has been highly successful for applications in both organic and inorganic chemistry. Infrared spectroscopy has also been successfully utilized in the field of semiconductor microelectronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lau|first= W.S. |coauthors=  |title= Infrared characterization for microelectronics |publisher= World Scientific |year= 1999 |month= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;: for example, infrared spectroscopy can be applied to semiconductors like silicon, gallium arsenide, gallium nitride, zinc selenide, amorphous silicon, silicon nitride, etc.

==Isotope effects==
The different isotopes in a particular species may give fine detail in infrared spectroscopy. For example, the O-O stretching frequency of oxyhemocyanin is experimentally determined to be 832 and 788&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for ν(&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O-&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) and ν(&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) respectively.

By considering the O-O as a spring, the wavelength of absorbance, ν can be calculated:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the spring constant for the bond, and ''μ'' is the reduced mass of the A-B system:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{m_A m_B}{m_A + m_B}&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of atom &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;).

The reduced masses for &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O-&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O can be approximated as 8 and 9 respectively. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\nu_{^{16}O}}{\nu_{^{18}O}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{8}} \approx \frac{832}{788}&lt;/math&gt;

== Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ==
'''Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy''' is a measurement technique for collecting infrared spectra.  Instead of recording the amount of energy absorbed when the frequency of the infra-red light is varied (monochromator), the IR light is guided through an interferometer. After passing the sample the measured signal is the interferogram. Performing a mathematical Fourier transform on this signal results in a spectrum identical to that from conventional (dispersive) infrared spectroscopy.  

FTIR spectrometers are cheaper than conventional spectrometers because building of interferometers is easier than the fabrication of a monochromator. In addition, measurement of a single spectrum is faster for the FTIR technique because the information at all frequencies is collected simultaneously. This allows multiple samples to be collected and averaged together resulting in an improvement in sensitivity. Because of its various advantages, virtually all modern infrared spectrometers are FTIR instruments.

== Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy ==
'''Two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy analysis''' is the application of 2D correlation analysis on infrared spectra. By extending the spectral information of a perturbed sample, spectral analysis is simplified and resolution is enhanced. The 2D synchronous and 2D asynchronous spectra represent a graphical overview of the spectral changes due to a perturbation (such as a changing concentration or changing temperature) as well as the relationship between the spectral changes at two different wavenumbers.

[[Image:2dir pulse sequence newversion.png|thumb|300px|right|Pulse Sequence used to obtain a two-dimensional Fourier transform infrared spectrum.]] The time period &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; is usually referred to as the coherence time and the second time period &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; is known as the waiting time. The excitation frequency is obtained by Fourier transforming along the &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; axis.

'''Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P. Hamm, M. H. Lim, R. M. Hochstrasser | title = Structure of the amide I band of peptides measured by femtosecond nonlinear-infrared spectroscopy

Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy is a technique that has become available with the development of femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment first a set of pump pulses are applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time, where the system is allowed to relax. The waiting time typically lasts from zero to several picoseconds and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_3&lt;/math&gt; excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes. Because of its extremely high time resolution it can be used to monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.

Like in two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2DNMR) spectroscopy this technique spreads the spectrum in two dimensions and allow for the observation of cross peaks that contain information on the coupling between different modes. In contrast to 2DNMR nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy also involve the excitation to overtones. These excitations result in excited state absorption peaks located below the diagonal and cross peaks. In 2DNMR two distinct techniques, Correlation spectroscopy#COSY|COSY and Correlation spectroscopy#NOESY|NOESY, are frequently used. The cross peaks in the first are related to the scalar coupling, while in the later they are related to the spin transfer between different nuclei. In nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy analogs have been drawn to these 2DNMR techniques. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy with zero waiting time corresponds to COSY and nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy with finite waiting time allowing vibrational population transfer corresponds to NOESY. The COSY variant of nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy has been used for determination of the secondary structure content proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = N. Demirdöven, C.

The '''in-gel digestion''' is part of the [[sample preparation (mass spectrometry)|sample preparation]] for the [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] identification of [[protein]]s in course of [[Proteomics|proteomic analysis]]. The method was introduced 1992 by Rosenfeld.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenfeld, J et al., 1992&quot;&gt;Rosenfeld, J et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 1992, 203 (1), 173-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite innumerable modifications and improvements the basic elements of the procedure remain largely unchanged. &lt;ref name=&quot;Jeno, P et al., 1995&quot;&gt;Jeno, P et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 1995, 224 (1), 75-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A et al., 1996&quot;&gt;Shevchenko, A et al., ''Anal Chem'', 1996, 68 (5), 850-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Borchers, C et al., 2000&quot;&gt;Borchers, C et al., ''Anal Chem'', 2000, 72 (6), 1163-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A et al., 2006&quot;&gt;Shevchenko, A et al., ''Nat Protoc'', 2006, 1 (6), 2856-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/search/allsearch?WISsearch2=granvogl+gruber+2007&amp;WISindexid2=WISall&amp;mode=quicksearch&amp;products=journal&amp;contextLink=%3Ca+href%3D%22%2Findex.html%22+target%3D%22_top%22%3EHome%3C%2Fa%3E+%2F+%3Ca+href%3D%22%2Fbrowse%2F%3Fsubject%3DLIFE%22+target%3D%22_top%22%3ELife+Sciences%3C%2Fa%3E+%2F+%3Ca+href%3D%22%2Fbrowse%2F%3Fsubject%3DLS30%26titles%3Dtrue%22+target%3D%22_top%22%3EMolecular+Cell+Biology%3C%2Fa%3E&amp;contentOID=76510741&amp;contentTitle=PROTEOMICS&amp;WISindexid1=issn&amp;WISsearch1=1615-9861&amp;articleGo.x=21&amp;articleGo.y=13 Granvogl, B et al., ''Proteomics'', 2007, 7 (5), 642-54.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-gel digestion primarily comprises the four steps destaining, [[redox|reduction]] and [[alkylation]] (R&amp;A) of the [[cysteine]]s in the protein, proteolytic cleavage of the protein and [[extraction]] of the generated [[peptide]]s.

==Destaining==
Proteins which were separated by 1D or 2D [[PAGE]] are usually visualised by staining with  [[dye]]s like [[Coomassie]] Brilliant Blue (CBB) or [[silver staining|silver]]. Although the sensitivity of the method is significantly lower, the use of Coomassie is more common for samples destined to mass spectrometry since the silver staining impairs the analysis. After excision of the protein band of interest from the gel most protocols require a destaining of the [[protein]]s before proceeding.

The destaining solution for CBB contains usually the [[buffer solution|buffer]] [[salt]] [[ammonium bicarbonate]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and a fraction of 30%-50% [[organic compound|organic]] [[solvent]] (mostly [[acetonitrile]]). The hydrophobic interactions between protein and CBB are reduced by the organic fraction of the solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jin, Y and Manabe, T, 2005&quot;&gt;Jin, Y and Manabe, T, ''Electrophoresis'', 2005, 26 (6), 1019-28.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time diminishes the ionic part of the solution the [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] bonds between the [[dye]] and the positively [[electric charge|charged]] [[amino acid]]s of the protein. In contrast to a mixture of [[water]] with organic solvent the effectivity of destaining is increased. An increase of [[temperature]] promotes the destaining process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd, MD, 1996&quot;&gt;Lloyd, MD, ''Anal Biochem'', 1996, 241 (1), 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; To a certain degree (&lt; 10%) the destaining procedure is accompanied with a loss of protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;&gt;Speicher, KD et al., ''Journal of Biomolecular Techniques'', 2000, 11 (2), 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, the removal of CBB does not affect the yield of [[peptide]]s in the mass spectrometric measurement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Terry, DE et al., 2004&quot;&gt;Terry, DE et al., ''J Am Soc Mass Spectrom'', 2004, 15 (6), 784-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of silver stained protein bands the destaining is accomplished by [[oxidation]] of the [[metall]]ic [[silver]] attached to the protein by [[potassium ferricyanide]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gharahdaghi, F et al., 1999&quot;&gt;Gharahdaghi, F et al., ''Electrophoresis'', 1999, 20 (3), 601-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumner, LW et al., 2002&quot;&gt;Sumner, LW et al., ''Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom'', 2002, 16 (3), 160-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The released silver [[ion]]s are [[Coordination complex|complexed]] subsequently by [[sodium thiosulfate]].

==[[Redox|Reduction]] and [[alkylation]] (r&amp;a)==
The staining and destaining is often followed by the reduction and alkylation (r&amp;a) of the [[cystine]]s or [[cysteine]]s potentially embodied in the protein. Hereby the [[disulfide bond]]s of the proteins are irreversibly broken up and the optimal unfolding of the [[tertiary structure]] is obtained. The reduction to the [[thiol]] is accomplished by the reaction with chemicals containing [[sulfhydryl]] or [[phosphine]] groups such as [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT) or [[tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine hydrochloride]] (TCEP). In course of the subsequent irreversible alkylation of the SH groups with  [[iodoacetamide]] the cysteines are transformed to the stable S-carboxyamidomethylcysteine (CAM; adduct: -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The specific mass of the aminoacid cysteine is thereby increased from 103.01 [[Atomic mass unit|Da]] to 160.03 Da.

This chemical modification allows for proteins with a high number of disulfide bonds the successful identification as well as the highest peptide yield and sequence coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hale, JE et al., 2004&quot;&gt;Hale, JE et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 2004, 333 (1), 174-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Katayama, H et al., 2004&quot;&gt;Katayama, H et al., ''Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom'', 2004, 18 (20), 2388-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the rareness of the aminoacid cysteine for most of the proteins the step of r&amp;a does not effect any improvement of the mass spectrometric analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borchers, C et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Havlis, J et al., 2003&quot;&gt;Havlis, J et al., ''Anal Chem'', 2003, 75 (6), 1300-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A and Shevchenko, A, 2001&quot;&gt;Shevchenko, A and Shevchenko, A, ''Anal Biochem'', 2001, 296 (2), 279-83.&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and homogeneous alkylation of cysteines the point of time for the modification is crucial. With denaturing [[electrophoresis]] it is strongly recommended to perform the reaction before the execution of the electrophoresis, since there are free [[acrylamide]] [[monomer]]s in the gel able to modify cysteines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamdan, M et al., 2001&quot;&gt;Hamdan, M et al., ''Electrophoresis'', 2001, 22 (9), 1633-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mineki, R et al., 2002&quot;&gt;Mineki, R et al., ''Proteomics'', 2002, 2 (12), 1672-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sechi, S and Chait, BT, 1998&quot;&gt;Sechi, S and Chait, BT, ''Anal Chem'', 1998, 70 (24), 5150-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert, B et al., 2001&quot;&gt;Herbert, B et al., ''Electrophoresis'', 2001, 22 (10), 2046-57.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting acrylamide adducts are bound irreversible to the cysteines and can not be removed by subsequent r&amp;a. The specific mass of the adduct is 174.05 [[Atomic mass unit|Da]].

==In-gel digestion==
Afterwards the eponymous step of the method is performed, the in-gel digestion of the proteins. By this procedure, the protein is cut [[enzyme|enzymatically]] into a limited number of shorter fragments. These fragments are called [[peptide]]s and allow for the identification of the protein with their characteristic mass and pattern. The [[serine protease]] [[trypsin]] is the most common enzyme used in protein analytics. Trypsin cuts the [[peptide bond]] specifically at the carboxyl end of the basic aminoacids [[arginine]] and [[lysine]]. If there is an acidic amino acid like [[aspartic acid]] or [[glutamic acid]] in direct neighborhood to the cutting site, the rate of hydrolysis is diminished,  a [[proline]] [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] to the cutting site inhibits the [[hydrolysis]] completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thiede, B et al., 2000&quot;&gt;Thiede, B et al., ''Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom'', 2000, 14 (6), 496-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

An undesirable side effect of the use of proteolytic enzymes is the self digestion of the protease. To avoid this, in the past [[Calcium|Ca]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ions were added to the digestion buffer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vajda, T and Garai, A, 1981&quot;&gt;Vajda, T and Garai, A, ''J Inorg Biochem'', 1981, 15 (4), 307-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sipos, T and Merkel, JR, 1970&quot;&gt;Sipos, T and Merkel, JR, ''Biochemistry'', 1970, 9 (14), 2766-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays most suppliers offer modified trypsin where selective [[methylation]] of the lysines limits the autolytic activity to the arginine cutting sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice, RH et al., 1977&quot;&gt;Rice, RH et al., ''Biochimica et Biophysica Acta'', 1977, 492 (2), 316-321.&lt;/ref&gt; Unmodified trypsin has its highest activity between 35°C and 45°C. After the modification, the optimal temperature is changed to the range of 50°C to 55°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Havlis, J et al., 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Finehout, EJ et al., 2005&quot;&gt;Finehout, EJ et al., ''Proteomics'', 2005, 5 (9), 2319-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Other enzymes used for in-gel digestion are the endo[[protease]]s [[Lys-C]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Michalski, WP and Shiell, BJ, 1999&quot;&gt;Michalski, WP and Shiell, BJ, ''Analytica Chimica Acta '', 1999, 383 (1-2), 27-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jekel, PA et al., 1983&quot;&gt;Jekel, PA et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 1983, 134 (2), 347-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Patterson, SD, 1995&quot;&gt;Patterson, SD, ''Electrophoresis'', 1995, 16 (7), 1104-14.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Glu-C]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Scheler, C et al., 1998&quot;&gt;Scheler, C et al., ''Electrophoresis'', 1998, 19 (6), 918-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Houmard, J and Drapeau, GR, 1972&quot;&gt;Houmard, J and Drapeau, GR, ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A'', 1972, 69 (12), 3506-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farah, MA et al., 2005&quot;&gt;Farah, MA et al., ''Biochim Biophys Acta'', 2005, 1725 (3), 269-82.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Asp-N]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wang, L et al., 2005&quot;&gt;Wang, L et al., ''Pharm Res'', 2005, 22 (8), 1338-49.&lt;/ref&gt;. These proteases cut specifically at only one amino acid e.g. Asp-N cuts n-terminal of aspartic acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michalski, WP and Shiell, BJ, 1999&quot;/&gt; Therefore a lower number of longer peptides is obtained.

The analysis of the complete primary [[sequence]] of a protein using only one protease is usually not possible. In those cases the digestion of the target protein in several approaches with different enzymes is recommended. The resulting overlapping peptides permit the assembly of the complete sequence of the protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheler, C et al., 1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Choudhary, G et al., 2003&quot;&gt;Choudhary, G et al., ''J Proteome Res'', 2003, 2 (1), 59-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wa, C et al., 2006&quot;&gt;Wa, C et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 2006, 349 (2), 229-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the digestion the proteins fixed in the matrix of the gel have to be made accessible for the protease. The permeation of the enzyme to the gel is believed to be facilitated by the [[dehydration]] of the gel pieces by treatment with [[acetonitrile]] and subsequent swelling in the digestion buffer containing the protease. This procedure relies on the presumption that the protease permeates to the gel by the process of swelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hellman, U et al., 1995&quot;&gt;Hellman, U et al., ''Anal Biochem'', 1995, 224 (1), 451-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Different studies about the penetration of the enzymes to the gel showed the process to be almost completely driven by diffusion. The drying of the gel does not seam to support the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Havlis, J et al., 2003&quot;/&gt; Therefore, the improvement of the in-gel digestion has to be achieved by the reduction of the way of the enzyme to its substrate e.g. by cutting the gel to pieces as small as possible.

Usually, the in-gel digestion is run as an overnight process. For the use of trypsin as protease and a temperature of 37°C the time of incubation found in most protocols is 12-15 h. However, experiments about the duration of the digestion process showed that after 3 h there is enough material for successful mass spectrometric analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finehout, EJ and Lee, KH, 2003&quot;&gt;Finehout, EJ and Lee, KH, ''Electrophoresis'', 2003, 24 (19-20), 3508-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the optimisation of the conditions for the protease in temperature and [[pH]] allows for the completion of the digestion of a sample in 30 min.&lt;ref name=&quot;Havlis, J et al., 2003&quot;/&gt;

[[Surfactant]] (detergents) can aid in the solubilization and denaturing of proteins in the gel and thereby shorten digestion times and increase protein cleavage and the number and amount of extracted peptides, especially for [[lipophilic]] proteins such as [[membrane protein]]s. [[Cleavable detergent]]s are detergents that are cleaved after digestion, often under acidic conditions. This makes the addition of detergents compatible with mass spectrometry.

==Extraction==
After finishing the digestion the peptides generated in this process have to be extracted from the gel matrix. This is accomplished by one or several [[extraction]] steps. The gel particles are incubated with an extraction solution and the supernatant is collected. In the first extraction, almost all of the peptide is recovered, the repetition of the extraction step can increase the yield of the whole process by only 5-10%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;/&gt; To meet the requirements of peptides with different physical and chemical properties an iterative extraction with basic or acidic solutions is performed. For the extraction of acidic peptides a solution similar to the concentration and composition of the digestion buffer is used; basic peptides are extracted in dependence to the intended mass spectrometric method with a low concentrated acidic solution of [[formic acid]] for [[Electrospray ionization|ESI]] and [[trifluoroacetic acid]] for [[MALDI]] respectively. Studies on model proteins showed a recovery of approximately 70–80% of the expected peptide yield by extraction from the gel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;
Many protocols contain an additional fraction of acetonitrile to the extraction solution which, in concentrations above 30% (v/v), is effective in reducing the [[adsorption]] of peptides to the surface of [[reaction tube]]s and [[pipette]] tips.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erdjument-Bromage, H et al., 1998&quot;&gt;Erdjument-Bromage, H et al., ''J Chromatogr A'', 1998, 826 (2), 167-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The liquid of the pooled extracts is evaporated in a [[centrifugal evaporator]]. If the [[volatile]] salt [[ammonium bicarbonate]] was used for the basic extraction, it is partially removed in the drying process. The dried peptides can be stored at -20°C for at least six months.

==Critical considerations and actual trends==
Some major drawbacks of the common protocols for the in-gel digestion are the extended time need and the multiple processing steps making the method error-prone in respect to [[contamination]]s (especially [[keratin]]). These disadvantages were largely removed by the development of optimised protocols and specialised reaction tubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;/&gt; 

More severe than the difficulties with handling are losses of material while processing the samples. The mass spectrometric protein analysis is often performed at the limit of detection, so even small losses can decide about success or failure of the whole analysis. These losses are due to washout during different processing steps, [[adsorption]] to the surface of [[reaction tube]]s and [[pipette]] tips, uncomplete extraction of peptides from the gel and/or bad [[ionisation]] of single peptides in the [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Speicher, KD et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart, II et al., 2001&quot;&gt;Stewart, II et al., ''Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom'', 2001, 15 (24), 2456-65.&lt;/ref&gt; In dependence of the different physicochemical properties of the peptides the losses can vary between 15 and 50%. Due to this heterogeneity of the peptides up to now a universally valid solution for this major drawback of the method has not been found.

==Commercial implementations==
The commercial implementations of in-gel digestion have to be divided into products for high and for low throughput laboratories.

===High-throughput===
Due to the highly time consuming and work intensive standard procedure the method of in-gel digestion was limited to a relatively small number of protein spots to be processed at a time. Therefore it has been found to be the ideal object for [[automation]] ambitions to overcome these limitations for industrial and service laboratories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houthaeve, T et al., 1997&quot;&gt;Houthaeve, T et al., ''Journal of Protein Chemistry'', 1997, 16 (5), 343-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in laboratories where in-gel digestion is performed with a high-throughput the procedure is usually automated. The degree of automation varies from simple pipetting [[robot]]s to highly sophisticated all-in-one solutions, offering an automated workflow from gel to mass spectrometry. The systems usually consist of a spot picker, a digestion robot, and a spotter. 

The spot picker is programmed with a picking list generated by an [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|gel image analysis software]] and excises the desired protein spots from a [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2D gel]]. The gel plugs are transferred to a [[microplate]] where the digestion robot performs the necessary steps for the in-gel digestion. Afterwards the spotter deposits the peptide solution on [[MALDI]] target plates or on microplates for automated [[Electrospray ionization|ESI]]-MS measurement.
Manufacturers of automated in-gel digestion systems are [[GE Healthcare]] (Ettan Series), [[Bruker Daltonics]] (PROTEINEER), [[Applied Biosystems|Perkin Elmer]] (MultiPROBE II), and [[Shimadzu]] (Xcise).
The advantages of the automation other than the larger number of spots to be processed at a time are the reduced manual work and the improved [[standardisation]]. Due to the many handling steps of the method, the results of the manual process could vary depending on the dexterity of the user and the risk of contamination is high. Therefore, the quality of the results is described to be one main advantage of the automated process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canelle, L et al., 2004&quot;&gt;Canelle, L et al., ''Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry'', 2004, 18 (23), 2785&amp;ndash;2794.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Drawbacks of automated solutions are the costs for robots, maintenance and consumables as well as the complicated setup of the process. Since the automated picking needs digitised information of the spot location, the analysis of the gel image for relevant spots has to be done by software requiring standardised imaging methods and special scanners. This lengthy procedure prevents the researcher from spontaneous identifications of a few interesting spots from a single gel as well as the need to operate the systems at full capacity. The resulting amount of data from the subsequent automated MS analysis is another problem of high throughput systems as their quality is often questionable and the evaluation of these data takes significantly longer than the collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stead, DA et al., 2008&quot;&gt;Stead, DA et al., ''Brief Bioinform'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hu, J et al., 2005&quot;&gt;Hu, J et al., ''Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic'', 2005, 3 (4), 322-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low-throughput===
The mentioned drawbacks limit the reasonable use of automated in-gel digestion systems to the routine laboratory whereas the research laboratory with a demand to make a flexible use of the instruments of protein identification more often stays with the manual, low-throughput methods for in-gel digestion and MS analysis. This group of customers is targeted by the industry with several kit systems for in-gel digestion.

Most of the kit systems are mere collections of the chemicals and enzymes needed for the in-gel digestion whereas the underlying protocol remains unchanged from the manual standard procedure described above. The advantage of these products for the unexperienced customer lies in the guaranteed functioning of the diverse solutions in combination with a ready-made protocol for the process. 

A few companies have tried to improve the handling process of in-gel digestion to allow even with manual sample preparation an easier and more standardised workflow. The Montage&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; In-Gel Digest Kit from [[Millipore Corporation|Millipore]] is based on the standard protocol, but enables processing of a large number of parallel samples by transferring the handling of the gel pieces to a modified 96 well microplate. The solutions for the diverse steps of in-gel digestion are pipetted into the wells of this plate whereas the removal of liquids is performed through the bottom of the wells by a [[vacuum pump]]. This system simplifies the handling of the multiple pipetting steps by the use of multichannel [[pipette]]s and even pipetting robots. Actually, some manufacturers of high-throughput systems have adopted the system to work with their robots. This illustrates the orientation of this kit solution to laboratories with a larger number of samples.

A completely different approach is made by the German company [http://www.omx-online.com OMX GmbH]. Their product line OMX-S is designed for the small scale use of up to 24 samples at a time by using a shortened protocol and specialised reaction tubes. The product is based on a critical evaluation of the conventional method of in-gel digestion where 30 steps and about 16 hours are needed for the processing from gel spot to peptide solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeno, P et al., 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A et al., 1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Borchers, C et al., 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko, A et al., 2006&quot;/&gt; The resulting protocol is reduced to four steps and about 2 hours process time by omitting steps not resulting in significant improvement of peptide yield and shortening the incubation time for digestion by increasing the temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Granvogl, B et al., 2007&quot;/&gt; The reaction tubes provided with this system enable the user to perform all steps from picking the spot to elution of peptides in one device. The gel spot is [[centrifuge]]d to the reaction chamber through a small opening, a process by which the gel is torn to small pieces. The gel stays for the whole procedure in this reaction chamber, only the different buffers are added by manual pipetting and centrifugation and removed by centrifugation. The handling of in-gel digestion is significantly simplified and acclerated with this system, as well as the risks of contamination and loss of material are reduced. However, the processing of a larger number of samples is due to the manual processing of every single spot still work intensive and not comparable to automated systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Insensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transfer''' (INEPT) is a signal enhancement method used in NMR spectroscopy which involves the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from spins with large Boltzmann population differences to nuclear spins of interest with low Boltzmann population differences.  INEPT uses [J-coupling for the polarization transfer in contrast to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) which arises from dipolar cross-relaxation. 

The signal enhancement has two sources:
* The spin population effect increases the signal by a factor of ''K'' = ratio of magnetogyric ratios of the nuclei.
* Nuclei with higher magnetogyric ratio generally relax more quickly.  Since the rate at which the INEPT transfer can be repeated is limited by the relaxation of these spins (rather than the low sensitivity spins), then the experiment can be repeated more frequently, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.

As a result, INEPT can enhance the NMR signal by a factor larger than ''K'', while the NOE can increase the signal by a factor of at most 1+''K''/2{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.  Note that a negative value of ''K'' may result in a ''reduction'' in signal intensity; historically INEPT was proposed a method to enhance the signal from the limited number of nuclei with negative magnetogyric ratio e.g. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N or &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si.

'''Ion-attachment mass spectrometry''' ('''IAMS''') is a form of [[mass spectrometry]] that uses a &quot;soft&quot; form of ionization similar to [[chemical ionization]] in which a cation is attached to the analyte molecule in a reactive collision:
:&lt;math&gt;M + X^+ + A \to MX^+ + A&lt;/math&gt; 

Where M is the analyte molecule, X&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the cation and A is a non-reacting collision partner.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Lithium ion attachment mass spectrometry: Instrumentation and features|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|date=|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
This technique is applicable to gases or any materials that can be vaporized. It uses a non-fragmenting non-conventional ionisation mode, by attachment of a lithium (or alkaline) ion to the gas to be analysed with a more traditional mass filter. This instrument is more dedicated to analysis of moderately-sized molecules such as organic or aromatic compounds.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Aromatic ion attachment mass spectrometry: an ion-molecule reaction for organosulfur analysis|journal=Organic Mass Spectrometry|date=|first=|last=|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Currently, it is used industrially to verify, with a high throughput, the concentrations of [[brominated flame retardant]]s (BFR) in plastics in compliance with [[European Union|European]] [[RoHS]] (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) regulation in place since 2006. The banned molecules include [[PBB]] and [[PBDE]], whose concentration should not exceed 0.1% w/w. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The guide of environmental quality assurance for a supplier of JVC |date=July 2006 | publisher = [[JVC]] | url = http://www.jvc-victor.co.jp/company/environ/wr/gprocure/eqaguide_e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittcon 2006; Poster by Y.

'''Ion mobility spectrometry''' ('''IMS''') is an analytical technique used to separate and identify ionized molecules in the gas phase based on their ion mobility in a carrier buffer gas.  Though heavily employed for military or security purposes, such as detecting drugs and explosives, the technique also has many laboratory analytical applications, recently being coupled with [[mass spectrometry]] and [[high performance liquid chromatography]]. IMS devices come in a wide range of sizes (often tailored for a specific application) and are capable of operating under a broad range of conditions.  Systems operated at higher pressure (i.e. atmospheric conditions, 1 atm or 1013 mbar) are also accompanied by elevated temperature (above 100°C), while lower pressure systems (1-20 mbar) do not require heating.  

==History==
IMS was first developed primarily by [[Earl W. McDaniel]] of [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in the 1950s and 1960s when he used drift cells with low applied electric fields to study gas phase ion mobilities and reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18200615&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kanu AB, Dwivedi P, Tam M, Matz L, Hill HH |title=Ion mobility-mass spectrometry |journal=[[J Mass Spectrom]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18200615 |doi=10.1002/jms.1383 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following decades, he coupled his new technique with a magnetic-sector mass spectrometer, with others also utilizing his techniques in new ways.  IMS cells have since been attached to many other mass spectrometers and high-performance liquid chromatography setups.  Currently IMS is a widely-used technique implemented by many, and improvements and other uses are continually being developed.

Outside of laboratory purposes, IMS has found great usage as a detection tool.  More than 10,000 IMS devices are in use worldwide in airports, and the US Army has more than 50,000 IMS devices.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotov, Yu. A. (2006). “Ion Mobility Spectrometry.” ''Journal of Analytical Chemistry'', '''61''' (6): 519.&lt;/ref&gt;  In industrial settings, uses of IMS include checking equipment cleanliness and detecting emission contents, such as determining the amount of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid in a stack gas from a process.&lt;ref&gt;Particle Measuring Systems, Inc. “Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) Theory and Applications”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ion Mobility==
{{main|Electrical mobility}}

In the traditional method of drift-time IMS, commonly referred to as just IMS, produced ions travel through a drift tube which has an applied electric field and a carrier buffer gas that opposes the ion motion.  At the end of the tube is a detector.  Based on an ion’s mass, charge, size and shape (the ion mobility), the migration time through the tube is characteristic of different ions, leading to the ability to distinguish different analyte species.  The area of an ion that gas molecules strike is an ion’s collision cross-section, related to the ion size and shape.  The greater this collision cross-section is, meaning the larger the ion size, the more area available for buffer gas to collide and impede the ion’s drift – the ion then requires a longer time to migrate through the drift tube.

The [[physical quantity]] ''' ion mobility''' ''K'' is defined as the proportionality factor of an ion's drift velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' in a gas and an electric field of strength ''E'',

::: &lt;math&gt;v_d=KE&lt;/math&gt;
 
Ion mobilities are commonly reported as a ''reduced mobilities'', correcting to standard gas density ''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', which can be expressed in standard temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 273 K and standard pressure ''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1013 mbar:

::: &lt;math&gt;K_0 = K \frac{n}{n_0} = K \ \frac{T_0}{T} \ \frac{p}{p_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The ion mobility ''K'' can be experimentally determined by measuring the the drift time ''t&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' of an ion traversing within a homogeneous electric field the potential difference ''U'' in the drift length ''L'': 

::: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{L^2}{t_D U}&lt;/math&gt;

The ion mobility ''K'' can also be calculated by the Mason equation:

::: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{3}{16} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\mu kT}} \frac{Q}{n\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is the ion [[charge (physics)|charge]], ''n'' is the drift gas [[number density]], ''μ'' is the [[reduced mass]] of the ion and the drift gas molecules, ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the drift gas [[temperature]], and ''σ'' is the ion’s [[cross section (physics)|collision cross section]] with the drift gas.  This relation holds approximately  at a low electric field limit, where the ratio of E/n is small, at ≤ 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-17&lt;/sup&gt; C•cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

A drift tube’s resolving power ''R'' can be calculated as

::: &lt;math&gt;R= \frac{t}{\Delta t}= \sqrt{\frac{LEQ}{16kT\ln2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where L is the tube length, E is the electric field strength, Q is the ion charge, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the drift gas temperature.

With a low electric field applied, the thermal energy of the ions is greater than the energy gained from the electric field between collisions.  With these ions having similar energies as the buffer gas molecules, diffusion forces dominate ion motion.

== Instrumentation ==
=== Ionization ===
The molecules of the sample need to be [[ionization|ionized]], usually by [[corona discharge]], atmospheric pressure [[photoionization]] (APPI), [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI), or a [[radioactive]] source, e.g. a small piece of &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;[[Nickel|Ni]] or &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;[[Americium|Am]], similar to the one used in ionization [[smoke detector]]s. ESI and MALDI techniques are commonly used when IMS is paired with mass spec.  

Doping materials are sometimes added to the drift gas for ionization selectivity.  For example, acetone can be added for chemical warfare agent detection, chlorinated solvents added for explosives, and nicotinamide added for drugs detection.&lt;ref&gt;Creaser, Colin; Thomas, Paul; et al. (2004). “Ion mobility spectrometry: a review. Part 1. Structural analysis by mobility measurement.” ''The Analyst'', '''129''': 984-994. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Analyzer ===
==== TOFIMS====
In its simplest form an IMS system measures how fast a given ion moves in a uniform [[electric field]] through a given atmosphere. 
[[image:Ion mobility spectrometry diagram.svg|thumb|500px|An ion mobility spectrometer separates ions by shape and charge.]]
In specified intervals, a sample of the ions is let into the drift chamber; the gating mechanism is based on a charged electrode working in a similar way as the [[control grid]] in [[triode]]s works for electrons. For precise control of the ion pulse width admitted to the drift tube, more complex gating systems such as a [[Bradbury-Nielsen shutter|Bradbury-Nielsen]] design are employed.  Once in the drift tube, ions are subjected to a homogeneous electric field ranging from a few volts per centimeter up to many hundreds of volts per centimeter.  This electric field then drives the ions through the drift tube where they interact with the neutral drift molecules contained within the system.

In the drift tube, chemical species separate based on the [[ion mobility]], arriving at the detector for measurement.  Ions are recorded at the detector in order from the fastest to the slowest, generating a response signal characteristic for the chemical composition of the measured sample. 

For drift-time IMS, two main methods are used – either reduced pressure or ambient pressure.  A reduced pressure is where the applied pressure gas is at a few torr, commonly used to measure ion collision cross-sections.  Ambient pressure is what is used for stand-alone detector devices, as well as detection for gas, liquid, and supercriticial fluid chromatographies.  The higher pressures of ambient pressure methods allow for higher resolving power and greater separation selectivity due to a higher rate of ion-molecule interactions.  Reduced pressure IMS allows for ion-focusing and an easier interface with mass spec.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18200615&quot; /&gt;
Though drift electric fields are normally uniform, non-uniform drift fields are also used.  These non-uniform field IMS results are often calibrated to uniform field instrumentation.  Non-uniform field usage is still in a relatively early developing stage.&lt;ref&gt;Clemmer, David E. et al. (2008).  “Biomolecule Analysis by Ion Mobility Spectrometry.” ''Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry'', '''1''': 293-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DMS ====
DMS ([[differential mobility spectrometer]]) make use of the dependence of ion mobility ''K'' on electric field strength ''E'' at high electric fields. Ions are subjected to different field strengths for different amounts of time. Thereby only ions with certain mobility dependence survive. These types of IMS work as a scanable filter. They are also called [[High-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry|FAIMS]]

==== DMA ====
DMA [[differential mobility analyzer]] make use of a fast gas stream perpendicular to the electric field. Thereby ions of different mobilities undergo different trajectories. This type of IMS corresponds to the [[sector instruments]] in [[mass spectrometry]]. They also work as a scanable filter.

=== Drift Gas ===
The drift gas pressure is an important parameter for the IMS instrument design and resolution. Most drift gases have a greater potential to break down at pressures higher than a few mbar, with the potential to break down increasing as the pressure increases.  As an example, high drift voltages of about 10-30 kV can be used with tubes of 1 m length and high gas pressures of 100-1000 mbar to obtain high resolutions.  At higher pressures than 10 mbar, ions become more difficult to store.  At lower pressures, ions can be stored more easily to obtain an accumulated continuous signal, with the trade-off of lower electric fields (around 10-30 V/cm).
Elevated gas temperature assists in removing ion clusters that may distort experimental measurements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Methods in Modern Biophysics&quot;&gt;Bengt Nolting, ''Methods in Modern Biophysics'', Springer Verlag, 2005, ISBN 3-540-27703-X &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ion Mobility Spectrometry&quot;&gt;Gary Eiceman &amp; Zeev Karpas, ''Ion Mobility Spectrometry'', CRC Press, 2005, ISBN 0-8493-2247-2 &lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Detector ===
Often the detector is a simple [[Faraday plate]], however, more advanced ion mobility instruments are [[Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry|coupled]] with [[mass spectrometer]]s where both size and mass information may be obtained simultaneously.

===Ion traps ===
Ion trap mobility spectrometry is an instrumental analytical method for detection and analysis of chemical substances, able to detect very low concentrations of chemicals based upon the differential migration of [[ion]]s through homogeneous [[electric field]]. It is a version of [[ion mobility spectrometry]]. ITMS provides a substantial performance improvement over IMS, as the shutter grid is eliminated together with the associated loss of sensitivity.



== Hyphenated IMS ==
IMS can be combined with other separation techniques. 

===GC-IMS : Gas Chromatography - Ion Mobility Spectrometry===
When IMS is coupled with gas chromatography, common sample introduction is with the GC capillary column directly connected to the IMS setup, with molecules ionized as they elute from GC.&lt;ref&gt;Creaser, Colin; Thomas, Paul; et al. (2004). “Ion mobility spectrometry: a review. Part 1. Structural analysis by mobility measurement.” ''The Analyst'', '''129''': 984-994. &lt;/ref&gt;  A similar technique is commonly used for HPLC.

===IMS-MS : Ion Mobility Spectrometry - Mass Spectrometry===
{{main|Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry}}
When IMS is used with mass spectrometry, ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry offers many advantages, including better signal to noise, isomer separation, and charge state identification.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18200615&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18320175&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fenn LS, McLean JA |title=Biomolecular structural separations by ion mobility-mass spectrometry |journal=[[Anal Bioanal Chem]] |volume=391 |issue=3 |pages=905–9 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18320175 |doi=10.1007/s00216-008-1951-x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IMS has commonly been attached to several mass spec analyzers, including quadropole, time-of-flight, and Fourier transform cyclotron resonance.

===LC-IMS : Liquid Chromatography - Ion Mobility Spectrometry===

===LC-IMS-MS : Liquid Chromatography - Ion Mobility Spectrometry - Mass spectrometry===
Coupled with LC and MS, IMS has become widely-used to analyze biomolecules, a practice heavily developed by David E. Clemmer, now at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)]]. &lt;ref&gt;Clemmer, David E. et al. (2008).  “Biomolecule Analysis by Ion Mobility Spectrometry.” ''Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry'', '''1''': 293-397.&lt;/ref&gt;


==Applications==
Perhaps ion mobility spectrometry's greatest strength is the speed at which separations occur—typically on the order of tens of milliseconds.  This feature combined with its ease of use, relatively high sensitivity, and highly compact design have allowed IMS as a commercial product to be used as a routine tool for the field detection of [[explosive]]s, [[illegal drug trade|drugs]], and [[chemical weapons]]. A major manufacturer of IMS screening devices used in airports is [[Smiths Group|Smiths Detection]].

In the pharmaceutical industry IMS is used in [[cleaning validation]]s, demonstrating that reaction vessels are sufficiently clean to proceed with the next batch of pharmaceutical product. IMS is much faster and more accurate than HPLC and total organic carbon methods previously used.  IMS is also used for analyzing the composition of drugs produced, thereby finding a place in quality assurance and control.&lt;ref&gt;O’Donnell, Ryan M.; Sun, Xiaobo; de B. Harrington, Peter. (2008). “Pharmaceutical applications of ion mobility spectrometry.” '' Trends in Analytical Chemistry'', '''27''' (1): 44-53.&lt;/ref&gt;   As a research tool ion mobility is becoming more widely-used in the analysis of biological materials, specifically, [[proteomics]] and [[metabolomics]].  For example, IMS-MS using MALDI as the ionization method has helped make advances in proteomics, providing faster high-resolution separations of protein pieces in analysis.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, J.A. . et al. (2005). “Ion mobility–mass spectrometry: a new paradigm for proteomics.” ''International Journal of Mass Spectrometry'', '''240''': 301-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry''' ('''IMS-MS''') is a method that combines [[ion mobility spectrometry]] and [[mass spectrometry]] to identify different substances within a test sample.

==History==
On the one hand, [[ion mobility spectrometry]] was developed in the 60s and typically separates charged particles on a millisecond scale. On the other hand, [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry]] was developed in the 50s and typically separates charged particles on a microsecond scale.
The combination of both instruments was pioneered in 1963 at the [[Bell Labs]] 

*	In 1963 McAfee and Edelson published an IMS-TOF combination. From their Letter to the Editor &lt;ref&gt;K.B. McAfee and D. Edelson ''J. Chem. Phys.'' '''1963''', 382.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not conclusive whether they used an orthogonal extraction TOF. Most likely it was, because they seem to have used the TOF of the company Bendix, which was an orthogonal TOF.  
*	In 1967 McKnight, McAfee and Sipler published an IMS-TOF combination. Their instrument clearly included an orthogonal TOF.&lt;ref&gt;L.G. McKnight, K.B. McAfee and D.P. Sipler  ''Phys. Rev.'' '''1967''', ''164''(1), 62&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*	In 1969 Cohen et al. filed a patent &lt;ref&gt;Patent US 3621240&lt;/ref&gt; on an IMS-QMS system. The QMS at that time was an improvement compared to the TOFMS, because the TOFMS lacked under the slowlyness of the electronic data acquisition systems at that time. 
*	In 1970, Young, Edelson and Falconer published an IMS-TOF with orthogonal extraction &lt;ref&gt;C.E. Young, D. Edelson, W.E. Falconer ''J. Chem. Phys.'' '''1970''', ''53''(11), 4295.&lt;/ref&gt;. They seem to have used the same system as McKnight et al. in 1967, incorporating slight modifications. Their work was later reproduced in the landmark book of Mason/McDaniel &lt;ref&gt;E.A. Mason, E.W. McDaniel; Transport Properties of Ions in Gases; John Wiley and Sons: New York, 1988; p 560&lt;/ref&gt;, which is regarded as the “bible of IMS” by those skilled in the art. 
*	In 1996 Guevremont et al. presented a poster at the ASMS conference &lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of 44th ASMS conference, p.1090&lt;/ref&gt; about IMS-TOF. 
*	In 1997 Tanner patented a quadrupole with axial fields which can be used as a drift cell for IMS separation. He also mentions the combination of these quadrupoles with an orthogonal TOFMS &lt;ref&gt;Patent WO9707530 (A1)&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*	In 1998 Clemmer reinvented the IMS-TOF combination, using a co-axial IMS-TOF setup &lt;ref&gt;Henderson S C, Valentine S J, Counterman A E, Clemmer D E, ''Anal. Chem.'' '''1999''', ''71'', (2), 291-301&lt;/ref&gt;.
*	In 1999 Clemmer reinvented the IMS-TOF with an orthogonal TOF system &lt;ref&gt;Hoaglund C S, Valentine S J, Sporleder C R, Reilly J P, Clemmer D E, ''Anal. Chem.'' '''1998''', ''70'', (11), 2236-2242.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Instrumentation==
{{Main|ion mobility spectrometer|mass spectrometer}}
The IMS-MS is a combination of an [[ion mobility spectrometer]] and a [[mass spectrometer]]. 
First the ion mobility spectrometer separates ions according to their mobilities. In a second step the mass spectrometer separates ions according to their [[mass-to-charge ratio]]. Such a combination is often referred to as a ''[[hyphenated separation]]'' or ''[[multi-dimensional separation]]''. 

There are different types of ion mobility spectrometers and there are different types of mass spectrometers. In principle it is possible to combine every type of the former with any type of the later.

=== Types of IMS ===
* TOFIMS (time-of-flight IMS) or the traditional [[ion mobility spectrometry|ion mobility spectrometer]]
* DMS [[differential mobility spectrometer]]: a scanable filter, also called [[High-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry|FAIMS]]
* DMA [[differential mobility analyzer]]: a scanable filter

===Types of MS ===
* TOFMS ([[time-of-flight mass spectrometer]])
* QMS ([[quadrupole mass spectrometer]])
* ITMS ([[ion trap mass spectrometer]])
* FTMS ([[Fourier transform mass spectrometry|Fourier transform mass spectrometer]])
* SFMS ([[sector instruments|sector mass spectrometer]])

==Applications==
The IMS-MS technique can be used for analyzing complex mixtures. It is used in: 
* proteomics for the analysis of peptides
* detection of chemical warfare agents
* detection of explosives
* analysis of nano particles

[[File:Ionization energies.png|right|thumb|400px|Ionization energies of neutral elements.]]
'''Ionization''' is the [[physics|physical]] process of converting an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] into an [[ion]] by adding or removing charged particles such as [[electron]]s or other ions. This is often confused with [[dissociation (chemistry)]].

The process works slightly differently depending on whether an ion with a positive or a negative [[electric charge]] is being produced. A positively-charged ion is produced when an electron bonded to an atom (or molecule) absorbs enough energy to escape from the [[electric potential]] barrier that originally confined it, thus breaking the bond and freeing it to move. The amount of energy required is called the [[ionization potential]]. A negatively-charged ion is produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently caught inside the electric potential barrier, releasing any excess energy. 

In general, ionization can be broken down into two types: '''sequential ionization''' and '''non-sequential ionization'''. In classical physics, only sequential ionization can take place; refer to the [[#Classical ionization|Classical ionization]] section for more information. Non-sequential ionization violates several laws of classical physics; refer to the [[#Quantum ionization|Quantum ionization]] section.

==Classical ionization==

Applying only [[classical physics]] and the [[Bohr model]] of the atom makes both atomic and molecular ionization entirely [[Scientific determinism|deterministic]]; that is, every problem will always have a definite and computable answer. According to classical physics, it is absolutely necessary that the energy of the electron exceeds the energy difference of the potential barrier it is trying to pass. In concept, this idea should make sense: The same way a person cannot jump over a one-meter wall without jumping at least one meter off the ground, an electron cannot get over a 13.6-[[Electronvolt|eV]] potential barrier without at least 13.6 eV of energy.

===Applying to positive ionization===

According to these two principles, the energy required to release an electron is ''strictly'' greater than or equal to the potential difference between the current bound atomic or molecular [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] and the highest possible orbital. If the energy absorbed exceeds this potential, then the electron is emitted as a free electron. Otherwise, the electron briefly enters an [[excited state]] until the energy absorbed is [[Radiation|radiated]] out and the electron re-enters the lowest available state.

===Applying to negative ionization===

Due to the shape of the potential barrier, according to these principles, a free electron must have an energy greater than or equal to that of the potential barrier in order to make it over. If a free electron has enough energy to do so, it will be bound to the lowest available energy state, and the remaining energy will be radiated away. If the electron does not have enough energy to surpass the potential barrier, then it is forced away by the electrostatic force, described by [[Coulombs Law]], associated with the electric potential barrier.

===Sequential ionization===

Sequential ionization is a description of how the ionization of an atom or molecule takes place. For example, an ion with a +2 charge can be created only from an ion with a +1 charge or a +3 charge. That is, the numerical charge of an atom or molecule must change sequentially, always moving from one number to an adjacent, or ''sequential'', number.

==Quantum ionization==

In [[quantum mechanics]], ionization can still happen classically, whereby the electron has enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but there is the additional possibility of [[tunnel ionization]].

===Tunnel ionization===

[[Tunnel ionization]] is ionization due to [[quantum tunneling]]. In classical ionization, an electron must have enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but quantum tunneling allows the electron simply to go through the potential barrier instead of going all the way over it because of the wave nature of the electron. The probability of an electron's tunneling through the barrier drops off exponentially with the width of the potential barrier. Therefore, an electron with a higher energy can make it further up the potential barrier, leaving a much thinner barrier to tunnel through and, thus, a greater chance to do so.

===Non-sequential ionization===

When the fact that the electric field of light is an alternating electric field is combined with tunnel ionization, the phenomenon of non-sequential ionization emerges. An electron that tunnels out from an atom or molecule may be sent right back in by the alternating field, at which point it can either recombine with the atom or molecule and release any excess energy or have the chance to further ionize the atom or molecule through high-energy collisions. This additional ionization is referred to as non-sequential ionization for two reasons: One, there is no order to how the second electron is removed, and, two, an atom or molecule with a +2 charge can be created straight from an atom or molecule with a neutral charge, so the integer charges are not ''sequential''.  Non-sequential ionization is often studied at lower laser-field intensities, since most ionization events are sequential when the ionization rate is high.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ISOLTRAP''' is a tandem Penning trap mass spectrometer at the On-Line Isotope Mass Separator at CERN, very similar to SMILETRAP. The facility plays a leading role in the field of high precision mass spectrometry of radioactive ions. The masses of more than 200 short-lived nuclides have been measured with a relative uncertainty of typically dm/m ~ 1x10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; and even almost up to one order of magnitude lower in some special cases. 

Recently, the performance of the Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP has been considerably enhanced. Major technical improvements were implemented to increase the range of accessible nuclei to those that are produced in minute quantities of only 100 ions/s and to nuclei with half-lives down to ~50 ms as well as to decrease the typical relative uncertainty down to ~1x10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular, a linear radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) trap and a carbon-cluster source were added to the ISOLTRAP spectrometer. Since the unified atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 of the mass of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C the calibration of the magnetic field with carbon clusters allows absolute mass measurements. 

Accurate mass measurements of short-lived nuclides are of high interest for a number of reasons: They allow direct observation of nuclear structure effects like the location of shell and sub-shell closures, pairing, or the onset of deformation. In combination with a precise study of super-allowed beta emission they provide tests of the Standard Model. Additionally, masses of unstable nuclei are the most critical nuclear physics parameters for reliable nucleosynthesis calculations in astrophysics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The isomeric shift (also called isomer shift) is the shift on atomic spectral lines and gamma spectral lines, which occurs as a consequence of replacement of one nuclear isomer by another. It is usually called '''isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines''' and '''Mössbauer isomeric shift''' respectively. If the spectra have also hyperfine structure the shift refers to the center of gravity of the spectra. The isomeric shift provides important information about the nuclear structure and the physical, chemical or biological environment of atoms.

==The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines==
The '''isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines''' is the energy or frequency shift in atomic spectra, which occurs when one replaces one nuclear isomer by another. The effect was predicted by Richard M. Weiner&lt;ref name=Weiner1956&gt;R. M. Weiner, Nuovo Cimento 4 (1956) 1587.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1956 whose calculations showed that it should be measurable by atomic (optical) spectroscopy (cf. also&lt;ref name=Weiner1959&gt;R. M. Weiner, Phys. Rev. 114, (1959) 256; Zhur. Eksptl. I Teoret. Fiz. 35 (1958) 284, translation: Soviet Phys. JETP. 35(8) (1959) 196.&lt;/ref&gt;). It was observed experimentally&lt;ref name=Meliss1959&gt;A. Melissinos and S. Davis, Phys. Rev. 115 (1959) 130.&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time in 1958. The theory of the atomic isomeric shift developed in &lt;ref name=Weiner1956/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiner1959/&gt; is also used in the interpretation of the Mössbauer isomeric shift.

==Terminology==
The notion of isomer appears also in other fields such as chemistry and meteorology. Therefore in the first papers devoted to this effect &lt;ref name=Weiner1956 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d0442487x86h7212/]/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiner1959/&gt; the name ''nuclear isomeric shift on spectral lines'' was used. Before the discovery of the Mössbauer effect, the isomeric shift referred exclusively to atomic spectra; this explains the absence of the word ''atomic'' in the initial &lt;ref name=Weiner1956/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiner1959/&gt; definition of the effect. Subsequently the isomeric shift was also observed in gamma spectroscopy through the Mössbauer effect and was called '''Mössbauer isomeric shift'''. For further details on the history of the isomeric shift and the terminology used cf. Refs.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Weiner, Analogies in Physics and Life, World Scientific 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;S. L. Ruby, in Mössbauer Isomer Shifts, editors G. K. Shenoy and F. E. Wagner, North Holland Publishing Company, 1978, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotopic versus isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines==
Atomic spectral lines are due to transitions of electrons between different atomic energy levels E, followed by emission of photons. Atomic levels are a manifestation of the electromagnetic interaction between electrons and nuclei. The energy levels of two atoms the nuclei of which are different isotopes of the same element are shifted one with respect to the other, despite the fact that the electric charges Z of the two isotopes are identical. This is so because isotopes differ by the number of neutrons and therefore the masses and volumes of two isotopes are different; these differences give rise to the isotopic shift on atomic spectral lines.

In the case of two nuclear isomers the number of protons and the number of neutrons are identical, but the quantum states and in particular the energy levels of the two nuclear isomers differ. This difference induces a difference in the electric charge distributions of two isomers and thus a difference δφ in the corresponding electrostatic nuclear potentials φ, which ultimately leads to a difference ΔE in the atomic energy levels. The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines is then given by

ΔE = -e∫ δφ │ψ │&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; dτ

where ψ is the wave function of the electron involved in the transition, e its electric charge and the integration is performed over the electron coordinates.
The isotopic and the isomeric shift are similar in the sense that both are effects in which the finite size of the nucleus manifests itself and both are due to a difference in the electromagnetic interaction energy between the electrons and the nucleus of the atom. The isotopic shift had been known decades before the isomeric shift and it provided useful but limited information about atomic nuclei. Unlike the isomeric shift, the isotopic shift was at first discovered in experiment and then interpreted theoretically (cf. also &lt;ref&gt;Fizicheskii Encyclopeditskii Slovar, Sovietskaia Encyclopaedia, Moscow 1962 (Physics Encyclopaedical Dictionary) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;). While in the case of the isotopic shift the determination of the interaction energy between electrons and nuclei is a relatively simple electromagnetic problem, for isomers the problem is more involved, since it is the strong interaction, which accounts for the isomeric excitation of the nucleus and thus for the difference of charge distributions of the two isomeric states. This circumstance explains in part why the nuclear isomeric shift was not discovered earlier: the appropriate nuclear theory and in particular the [[nuclear shell model]] were developed only in the late 1940s and early 1950s. As to the experimental observation of this shift, it also had to await the development of a new technique, that permitted spectroscopy with isomers, which are metastable nuclei. This too happened only in the 1950s.
While the isomeric shift is sensitive to the internal structure of the nucleus, the isotopic shift is (in a good approximation) not. Therefore the nuclear physics information, which can be obtained from the investigation of the isomeric shift, is superior to that which can be obtained from isotopic shift studies. The measurements through the isomeric shift of e.g. the difference of nuclear radii of the excited and ground state constitute one of the most sensitive tests of nuclear models. Moreover, combined with the Mössbauer effect, the isomeric shift constitutes at present a unique tool in many other fields, besides physics.

==The isomeric shift and the nuclear shell model==
According to the nuclear shell model there exists a class of isomers for which, in a first approximation, it is sufficient to consider one single nucleon, called the “optical” nucleon, to get an estimate of the difference between the charge distributions of the two isomer states, the rest of the nucleons being ''filtered out''. This applies in particular for isomers in odd proton-even neutron nuclei, near closed shells. In115, for which the effect was calculated in &lt;ref name=Weiner1956/&gt;, is such an example. The result of the calculation was that the isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, although rather small, turned out to be two orders of magnitude bigger than a typical natural line width, which constitutes the limit of optical measurability.

The shift measured three years later&lt;ref name=Meliss1959&gt;A. Melissinos and S. Davis, Phys. Rev. 115 (1959) 130.&lt;/ref&gt; in Hg197 was quite close to that calculated for In115, although in Hg197, unlike in In115, the optical nucleon is a neutron and not a proton and the electron-free neutron interaction is much smaller than the electron-free proton interaction. This is a consequence of the fact that the optical nucleons are not free but bound particles&lt;ref name=Weiner1956&gt;R. M. Weiner, Nuovo Cimento 4 (1956) 1587.&lt;/ref&gt; . Thus the results of &lt;ref name=Meliss1959/&gt; could be explained&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Shirley, Nuclear Applications of Isomeric Shifts, Proc. Int. Conf. on the Mössbauer Effect, Saclay 1961, editors D. H. Compton and A.H.

==The Mössbauer isomeric shift==
The '''Mössbauer isomeric shift''' is the shift seen in gamma ray spectroscopy when one compares two different nuclear isomeric states in two different physical, chemical or biological environments, and is due to the combined effect of the recoil-free Mössbauer transition between the two nuclear isomeric states and the transition between two atomic states in those two environments.

The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines depends on the electron wave function ψ and on the difference δφ of electrostatic potentials φ of the two isomeric states.

For a given nuclear isomer in two different physical or chemical environments (different physical phases or different chemical combinations) the electron wave functions are also different. Therefore on top of the isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, which is due to the difference of the two nuclear isomer states, there will be a shift between the two environments (because of the experimental arrangement, these are called source (s) and absorber (a)). This combined shift is the Mössbauer isomeric shift and it is described mathematically by the same formalism as the nuclear isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, except that instead of one electron wave function, that in the source ψ&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;, one deals with the difference between the electron wave function in the source ψ&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt; and the electron wave function in the absorber ψ&lt;sub&gt;absorber&lt;/sub&gt;:

ΔE&lt;sub&gt;Mössbauer&lt;/sub&gt;  = ΔE&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt; – ΔE&lt;sub&gt;absorber&lt;/sub&gt;  = -e∫ δφ [│ψ&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt; │&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - │ψ&lt;sub&gt;absorber&lt;/sub&gt;│&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ]dτ

The first measurement of the isomeric shift in gamma spectroscopy with the help of the Mössbauer effect was reported&lt;ref&gt;O. C. Kistner and A. W. Sunyar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 4 (1960) 412.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1980, two years after its first experimental observation in atomic spectroscopy&lt;ref name=Meliss1959/&gt;. By measuring this shift one obtains important and extremely precise information, both about the nuclear isomer states and about the physical, chemical or biological environment of the atoms, represented by the electronic wave functions.

Under its Mössbauer variant, the isomeric shift has found important applications in domains as different as Atomic Physics, Solid State Physics, Nuclear Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Metallurgy, Mineralogy, Geology, and Lunar research. For further literature cf. also Ref.&lt;ref&gt;Mössbauer Isomer Shifts, editors G. K. Shenoy and F. E. Wagner, North Holland Publishing Company, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear isomeric shift has also been observed in muonic atoms&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. J. Hüfner et al. in Muon Physics, edited by V. W. Hughes and C. S. Wu, Academic Press 1977, Vol. 1, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;, that is atoms in which a muon is captured by the excited nucleus and makes a transition from an atomic excited state to the atomic ground state in a time which is short compared to the lifetime of the excited isomeric nuclear state.

'''Isotope ratio mass spectrometry''' '''(IRMS)''' is a specialization of [[mass spectrometry]], in which mass spectrometric methods are used to measure the relative abundance of [[isotope]]s in a given sample.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17705258&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul D, Skrzypek G, Fórizs I |title=Normalization of measured stable isotopic compositions to isotope reference scales - a review |journal=Rapid Commun.

== Introduction ==
The isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) allows the precise measurement of mixtures of stable isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Townsend, A. (ed)| year=1995 | title=Encyclopaedia of Analytical Science ''Encyclopaedia of Analytical Science'' | publisher=Academic Press Limited |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has two different applications in the earth and environmental sciences. The analysis of '[[stable isotopes]]' is normally concerned with measuring isotopic variations arising from mass-dependent [[isotopic fractionation]] in natural systems. On the other hand, [[radiogenic]] isotope analysis involves measuring the abundances of decay-products of natural radioactivity, and is used in most long-lived [[radiometric dating]] methods.

Most instruments used for precise determination of isotope ratios are of the magnetic [[sector instrument|sector]] type. This type of analyzer is superior to the quadrupole type in this field of research for two reasons. Firstly, it can easily be set up for multiple-collector analysis, and secondly, it gives high-quality 'peak shapes'. Both of these considerations are important for isotope ratio analysis at very high precision and accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dickin, A.P. | year=2005 | title=Radiogenic Isotope Geology | url=http://www.onafarawayday.com/Radiogenic/ | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sector-type instrument designed by [[Alfred Nier]] was such an advance in [[mass spectrometer]] design that this type of instrument is often called the 'Nier type'. In the most general terms the instrument operates by ionizing the sample of interest, accelerating it over a potential in the kilo-volt range, and separating the resulting stream of ions according to their mass to charge ratio (m/z). The current of each ion beam is then measured using a 'Faraday' detector or multiplier detector.

Many radiogenic isotope measurements are made by ionization of a solid source, whereas stable isotope measurements of light elements (e.g. H, C, O) are usually made in an instrument with a gas source. In the latter case, dual gas inlets enable reliable repetition of measurements by supplying continuous streams of the reference and sample gases, which are sequentially switched by a changeover valve.  The IRMS's collector also features an array of Faraday cups (conductive, metal vessels which neutralise ions that hit them whilst themselves becoming charged), or &quot;multicollector&quot;, which allows the simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C. B. Bouthitt and K. Garnett|title= The Evolution of the Multicollector in Isotope Ratio Mass Spectromety|journal=Proceedings of the 18th AMZSMS Conference |pages=THO–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples must be introduced as pure gases, achieved through combustion, gas chromatographic feeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Meier-Augenstein, W. | journal =J. Chromarogr., A | year = 1999 | volume = 842 | pages= 351–371 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(98)01057-7 | title =Applied gas chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry }}&lt;/ref&gt; or chemical trapping. By comparing the detected isotopic ratios to a measured standard, an accurate determination of the isotopic make up of the sample is obtained. For example, carbon isotope ratios are measured relative to the international standard for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  (The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; standard is produced from a fossil [[belemnite]] found in the [[Pee Dee]] formation, which is a limestone formed in the Cretaceous period in [[South Carolina]], U.S.A.; its &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio is 0.0112372.)

== Gas Source ('stable isotope') mass spectrometry ==

Instruments have been developed based on several techniques for mass separation and tuned to a wide range of applications. The article below describes one of these application areas, instruments adapted specifically to measure the relative abundance of masses up to around [[atomic number|mass number]] 66.

This field is of interest because the relative variation in mass between [[isotopes]] in this range is large enough to give rise to variation in chemical, physical and biological behaviour. This leads to measurable effects on the isotopic composition of samples characteristic of their biological or physical history.

As a specific example, the [[hydrogen]] isotope [[deuterium]] (heavy hydrogen) is almost double the mass of the common hydrogen isotope. Water molecules containing the common hydrogen isotope (and the common oxygen isotope, mass 16) have a mass of 18. Water incorporating a deuterium atom has a mass of 19, over 5% heavier. The energy to vaporise the heavy water molecule is higher than that to vaporize the normal water so isotope fractionation occurs during the process of evaporation.

Thus a sample of sea water ([[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]], or VSMOW) will exhibit a quite detectable isotopic ratio difference when compared to Arctic snowfall (standard light Arctic precipitation, or SLAP).

[[File:Mass spectrometer schematics.png|right|thumb|300 px|Schematic of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer measuring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the  [[United States Geological Survey]]]]
It is critical that the sample be processed before entering the mass spectrometer so that only a single chemical species enters at a given time.  Generally, samples are combusted or pyrolyzed and the desired species (usually hydrogen gas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon dioxide, or sulfur dioxide) is purified by means of traps, filters, catalysts and/or chromatography.

The two most common types of IRMS instruments are continuous flow&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9538528&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brenna JT, Corso TN, Tobias HJ, Caimi RJ |title=High-precision continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry |journal=Mass spectrometry reviews |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=227–58 |year=1997 |pmid=9538528 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2787(1997)16:5&lt;227::AID-MAS1&gt;3.0.CO;2-J}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dual inlet. In dual inlet IRMS, purified gas obtained from a sample is alternated rapidly with a standard gas (of known isotopic composition) by means of a system of valves, so that a number of comparison measurements are made of both gases.  In continuous flow IRMS, sample preparation occurs immediately before introduction to the IRMS, and the purified gas produced from the sample is measured just once.  The standard gas may be measured before and after the sample or after a series of sample measurements.  While continuous-flow IRMS instruments can achieve higher sample throughput and are more convenient to use than dual inlet instruments, the yielded data is of approximately 10-fold lower precision.

== Static Gas ('noble gas') mass spectrometry ==

A static gas mass spectrometer is one in which a gaseous sample for analysis is fed into the source of the instrument and then left in the source without further supply or pumping throughout the analysis. This method can be used for 'stable isotope' analysis of light gases (as above), but it is particularly used in the isotopic analysis of [[noble gases]] (= rare or inert gases) for [[radiometric dating]] or [[isotope geochemistry]]. Important examples are [[argon-argon dating]] and helium isotope analysis.

== Solid Source ('radiogenic isotope') mass spectrometry ==

Several of the isotope systems involved in [[radiometric dating]] depend on IRMS using [[thermal ionization]] of a solid sample loaded into the source of the mass spectrometer (hence thermal ionization mass spectrometry, [[TIMS]]). These methods include [[rubidium-strontium dating]], [[uranium-lead dating]], [[lead-lead dating]] and [[samarium-neodymium dating]].

When these isotope ratios are measured by TIMS, mass-dependent fractionation occurs as species are emitted by the hot filament. Fractionation occurs due to the excitation of the sample and therefore must be corrected for accurate measurement of the isotope ratio.&lt;ref name=Dickin&gt;Dickin, A.P., 2005. ''Radiogenic Isotope Geology'' 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several advantages of the TIMS method. It has a simple design, is less expensive than other mass spectrometers, and produces stable ion emissions. It requires a stable power supply, and is suitable for species with a low ionization potential, such as [[Strontium]] (Sr), and [[Lead]] (Pb).

The disadvantages of this method stem from the maximum temperature achieved in thermal ionization. The hot filament reaches a temperature of less than 2500 degrees Celsius, leading to the inability to create atomic ions of species with a high ionization potential, such as [[Osmium]] (Os), and [[Tungsten]] (Hf-W).  Although the TIMS method can create molecular ions instead in this case, species with high ionization potential can be analyzed more effectively with MC-ICP-MS.

== Multiple collector - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) ==

An MC-ICP-MS instrument is a multiple collector mass spectrometer with a plasma source. MC-ICP-MS was developed to improve the precision achievable by ICP-MS during isotope ratio measurements.  Conventional [[ICP-MS]] analysis uses a quadrupole analyser, which only allows single-collector analysis. Due to the inherent instability of the plasma, this limits the precision of ICP-MS with a quadrupole analyzer to around 1%, which is insufficient for most [[radiogenic]] isotope systems.

Isotope ratio analysis for [[radiometric dating]] has normally been determined by TIMS. However, some systems (e.g. Hf-W and Lu-Hf) are difficult or impossible to analyse by TIMS, due to the high ionization potential of the elements involved. Therefore these methods can now be analysed using MC-ICP-MS.

Magnetic sector mass spectrometry requires a high acceleration potential in order to properly resolve species with different masses.  Since the ion beam is normally positive, a multi-collector ICP-MS  (unlike conventional ICP-MS) needs to have an ion source up to 8000 V positive, in order to keep the analyzer at electrical ground.  This was one of the engineering challenges of developing MC-ICP-MS. Magnetic sector mass spectrometry also requires an ion beam with a relatively small range in ion energy. This is achieved in MC-ICP-MS by using an electrostatic and/or quadrupole pre-filter, which allows the ion energy of the beam to be homogenized before entering the magnetic sector.

== Moving Wire IRMS (MW-irMS) ==
Moving wire IRMS is useful for analyzing [[Carbon-13]] ratios of compounds in a solution, such as after purification by [[liquid chromatography]].  The solution (or outflow from the chromatography) is dried onto a nickel or stainless steel wire.  After the residue is deposited on the wire, it enters a furnace where the sample is converted to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water by combustion.  The gas stream finally enters a capillary, is dried, ionized, and analyzed.&lt;ref name='brenna_1996'&gt;{{cite journal | journal = J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. | year = 1996 | author = Caimi, R. J.; Brenna, J. T. | title = Direct analysis of carbon isotope variability in albumins by liquid flow-injection isotope ratio mass spectrometry | volume = 7 | pages = 605–610 | doi = 10.1016/1044-0305(96)00010-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process allows a mixture of compounds to be purified and analyzed continuously, which can decrease the analysis time by a factor of four.&lt;ref name='brenna_1996'/&gt; Moving wire IRMS is quite sensitive, and samples containing as little as 1 nano-[[Mole (unit)|mole]] of Carbon can yield precise (within 1‰) results.&lt;ref name=Sessions2005&gt;{{cite journal

== Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) ==
For isotopes occurring at extremely low levels, [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS) can be used.  For example, the decay rate of the radioisotope &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C is widely used to date organic materials, but this approach is limited to relatively large samples no more than a few thousand years old.  AMS extended the range of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C dating to about 60,000 years BP, and is about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; times more sensitive than conventional IRMS.

== Applications ==

The variation outlined above has applications in [[hydrology]] since most samples will lie between these two extremes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17091470&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Han LF, Gröning M, Aggarwal P, Helliker BR |title=Reliable determination of oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in atmospheric water vapour adsorbed on 3A molecular sieve |journal=Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. |volume=20 |issue=23 |pages=3612–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17091470 |doi=10.1002/rcm.2772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a sample of water from an [[aquifer]], and a sufficiently sensitive tool to measure the variation in the isotopic ratio of hydrogen in the sample, it is possible to infer the source, be it ocean water seeping into the aquifer or precipitation seeping into the aquifer, and even to estimate the proportions from each source.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17540896&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weldeab S, Lea DW, Schneider RR, Andersen N |title=155,000 years of West African monsoon and ocean thermal evolution |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5829 |pages=1303–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17540896 |doi=10.1126/science.1140461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application is in paleotemperature measurement for [[Paleoclimatology]]. For example one technique is based on the variation in isotopic fractionation of oxygen by biological systems with temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10568296&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tolosa I, Lopez JF, Bentaleb I, Fontugne M, Grimalt JO |title=Carbon isotope ratio monitoring-gas chromatography mass spectrometric measurements in the marine environment: biomarker sources and paleoclimate applications |journal=Sci.

Species of [[foraminifera]] incorporate oxygen as calcium carbonate in their shells. The ratio of the oxygen isotopes oxygen 16 and oxygen 18 incorporated into the calcium carbonate varies with temperature and the oxygen isotopic composition of the water. This oxygen remains &quot;fixed&quot; in the calcium carbonate when the forminifera dies, falls to the sea bed, and its shell becomes part of the sediment. It is possible to select standard species of forminifera from sections through the sediment column, and by mapping the variation in oxygen isotopic ratio, deduce the temperature that the forminifera  encountered during life if changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of the water can be constrained.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12720329&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shen JJ, You CF |title=A 10-fold improvement in the precision of boron isotopic analysis by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry |journal=Anal.

In forensic science, research suggests that the variation in certain isotope ratios in drugs derived from plant sources (cannabis, cocaine) can be used to determine the drug's continent of origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16696708&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Casale J, Casale E, Collins M, Morello D, Cathapermal S, Panicker S |title=Stable isotope analyses of heroin seized from the merchant vessel Pong Su |journal=J.

'''Isotopic labeling''' is a technique for tracking the passage of a sample of substance through a system.  The substance is 'labeled' by including unusual [[isotope]]s in its chemical composition.  If these unusual isotopes are later detected in a certain part of the system, they must have come from the labeled substance. 

In ordinary isotopic labeling, there are two ways to detect the presence of labeling isotopes.  Since isotopes have different [[mass]]es, they can be separated using [[mass spectrometry]].  Another consequence of the difference in mass is that molecules containing isotopes have different [[vibrational mode]]s; these can be detected by [[infrared spectroscopy]].

Isotopic labeling can also be used to study [[chemical reaction]]s. In this method specific atoms are replaced by an isotope in a reactant molecule which then participates in a chemical reaction. With [[spectroscopy]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy for example, it is now possible to identify where a particular molecular fragment in the reactant ends up as a particular fragment in one of the reaction products. 

An example of the use of isotopic labeling is the study of [[phenol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) in water by replacing common [[hydrogen]] ([[hydrogen-1|protium]]) with [[deuterium]] ('''deuterium labeling''').  Upon adding phenol to [[heavy water|deuterated water]] (water containing D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in addition to the usual H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O),  the substitution of deuterium for the hydrogen is observed in phenol's [[hydroxyl group]] (resulting in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OD), indicating that phenol readily undergoes hydrogen-exchange reactions with water. Only the hydroxyl group was affected, indicating that the other 5 hydrogen atoms did not participate in these exchange reactions.

==Radioisotopic labeling==
Radioisotopic labelling is a technique for tracking the passage of a sample of substance through a system.  The substance is &quot;labelled&quot; by including [[radionuclide]]s in its chemical composition.  When these [[radioactive decay|decay]], their presence can be determined by detecting the [[particle radiation|radiation]] emitted by them.  Radioisotopic labelling is a special case of [[isotopic labeling]].

For these purposes, a particularly useful type of radioactive decay is [[positron emission]].  When a positron collides with an electron, it releases two high-energy [[photon]]s traveling in diametrically opposite directions.  If the positron is produced within a solid object, it is likely to do this before travelling more than a millimetre.  If both of these photons can be detected, the location of the decay event can be determined very precisely.

Strictly speaking, radiosotopic labelling includes only cases where radioactivity is artificially introduced by experimenters, but some natural phenomena allow similar analysis to be performed.  In particular, [[radiometric dating]] uses a closely related principle.

==Isotopic tracer==
[[Image:Benzyneconversioncolouredlabels.png|left|300px| For example, the use of a carbon-13 label was used to determine the mechanism in the above proposed 1,2- to 1,3-didehydrobenzene conversion of the [[phenyl]] substituted aryne precursor '''1''' to acenaphthylene, reference: A m-Benzyne to o-Benzyne Conversion Through a 1,2-Shift of a Phenyl Group. Blake, M. E.; Bartlett, K. L.; Jones, M. Jr. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 6485. doi:10.1021/ja0213672 ]]

An ''isotopic tracer'', (also &quot;isotopic marker&quot; or &quot;isotopic label&quot;), is used in [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] to help understand chemical [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] and interactions. In this technique, one or more of the [[atom]]s of the [[molecule]] of interest is substituted for an atom of the same [[chemical element]], but of a different (often [[radioactive]], such as in [[Radioactive tracer|radioactive tracing]]) [[isotope]]. Because the atom has the same number of protons, it will behave in almost exactly the same way chemically as other atoms in the compound, and with few exceptions will not interfere with the reaction under investigation.  The difference in the number of [[neutron]]s, however, means that it can be detected separately from the other atoms of the same element.

[[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] typically uses this type of technique to investigate the mechanisms of chemical reactions (basically trying to find out which starting atom ends up where after a reaction), because NMR detects not only isotopic differences, but also gives an indication of the position of the atom.

[[Mass spectrometer|Mass spectrometry]] can also be used with this technique, since mass spectra recorded with sufficiently high resolution can distinguish among isotopes based on the different masses resulting from the different number of neutrons.

[[Autoradiograph]]s of gels in [[gel electrophoresis]] can also take advantage of this approach.  In this technique, radioactive isotopes are used.  The radiation emitted by compounds containing the radioactive isotopes darkens a piece of [[photographic film]], recording the position of these compounds relative to one another in the gel.

Isotopic (isotope) tracers are some of the most important tools in [[geology]], because they can be used to understand complex mixing process in earth systems. Isotope tracers are almost always used in the form of isotope ratios. By studying the ratio between two isotopes of the same element, we avoid effects involving the overall abundance of the element, which would usually swamp the much smaller variations in isotopic abundances. Further discussion of the application of isotopic tracers in geology is covered under the heading of [[isotope geochemistry]].

Isotopic tracers are usually subdivided into two categories: [[radiogenic]] isotope tracers and [[stable isotope]] tracers. A radiogenic isotope tracer &lt;ref&gt;Dickin, A. P., 2005. ''Radiogenic Isotope Geology'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; involves an isotope produced by [[radioactive decay]], which is usually ratioed against a non-radiogenic isotope (whose abundance in the earth does not vary due to radioactive decay).

A stable isotope tracer involves only non-radiogenic isotopes. In this case, relative variations in abundance between the two isotopes is most often caused by mass-dependent fractionation. In theory, any element with two stable isotopes can be used as an isotopic tracer. However, the most commonly used stable isotope tracers involve relatively light isotopes which readily undergo fractionation in natural systems. See also [[isotopic signature]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''isotopic shift''' (also called isotope shift) is the shift in atomic spectra which occurs when one nuclear isotope is replaced by another. If the spectra have also hyperfine structure the shift refers to the center of gravity of the spectra. There are two effects which contribute to this shift:

*The mass difference. This difference induces a change in the reduced electronic mass. This purely kinematical effect, studied theoretically by Hughes and Eckart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. J. Hughes, C. Eckart|journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=36|year=1930|page=694|title=The Effect of the Motion of the Nucleus on the Spectra of Li I and Li II|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.36.694}}&lt;/ref&gt; is important for light elements.

*The volume difference. This difference induces a change in the electric charge distribution of the nucleus. This effect is important in heavy elements and its first theory was formulated by Pauli and Peierls.&lt;ref&gt;W. Pauli, R. E. Peierls, Phys. Z. 32 (1931) 670&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Brix, H.

'''iTRAQ''' ([[isobaric labeling|isobaric tag]] for relative and absolute quantitation) is a non-gel based technique used to identify and quantify [[protein]]s from different sources in one single experiment. It uses [[isotope]] coded covalent tags. iTRAQ is used in [[proteomics]] to study quantitative changes in the proteome.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15385600&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ross PL, Huang YN, Marchese JN, Williamson B, Parker K, Hattan S, Khainovski N, Pillai S, Dey S, Daniels S, Purkayastha S, Juhasz P, Martin S, Bartlet-Jones M, He F, Jacobson A, Pappin DJ |title=Multiplexed protein quantitation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using amine-reactive isobaric tagging reagents |journal= Mol.

== Procedure ==

The method is based on the covalent labeling of the [[N-terminus]] and [[sidechain]] [[amine]]s of [[peptide]]s from protein digestions with tags of varying mass.  There are currently two mainly used reagents: 4-plex and 8-plex, which can be used to label all peptides from different samples/treatments.  These samples are then pooled and usually [[fractionation|fractionated]] by nano [[liquid chromatography]] and analyzed by tandem [[mass spectrometry]] (MS/MS). A database search is then performed using the [[Fragmentation (mass spectrometry)|fragmentation]] data to identify the labeled peptides and hence the corresponding proteins. The fragmentation of the attached tag generates a low molecular mass reporter ion that can be used to relatively quantify the peptides and the proteins from which they originated, using software such as the freely available i-Tracker&lt;ref name=&quot;i-Tracker&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shadforth IP, Dunnley PJ, Lilley KS, Bessant C |title=i-Tracker: For quantitative proteomics using iTRAQ |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=6 |pages=145 |year=2005 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-6-145 |pmid=16242023 |pmc=1276793}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

See Cornille.&lt;ref name=Cornille/&gt;]]
In the theory of many-particle systems, '''Jacobi coordinates''' often are used to simplify the mathematical formulation.  These coordinates are particularly common in treating polyatomic molecules and chemical reactions,&lt;ref name= Zhang&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and in celestial mechanics.&lt;ref name=Belbruno&gt;

For example, see {{cite book |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics |author= Edward Belbruno |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dK-fl0KrOEIC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=0691094802 |year=2004 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}

&lt;/ref&gt; An algorithm for generating the Jacobi coordinates for ''N'' bodies may be based upon binary trees.&lt;ref name=Cabral&gt;

{{cite book |title=Classical and celestial mechanics |author= Hildeberto Cabral, Florin Diacu |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q1emz4C4lYQC&amp;pg=PA230 |page=230 |chapter=Appendix A: Canonical transformations to Jacobi coordinates |isbn=0691050228 |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2002}}

&lt;/ref&gt; In words, the algorithm is described as follows:&lt;ref name=Cabral/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the masses of two bodies that are replaced by a new body of virtual mass ''M'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The position coordinates '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are replaced by their relative position  '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and by the vector to their center of mass '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; = (''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). The node in the binary tree corresponding to the virtual body has ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; as its right child and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; as its left child. The order of children indicates the relative coordinate points from '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Repeat the above step for ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 bodies, that is, the ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 original bodies plus the new virtual body. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the four-body problem the result is:&lt;ref name=Cornille&gt;{{cite book |title=Advanced electromagnetism and vacuum physics |author=Patrick Cornille |page=102 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y8sSFTDkQ20C&amp;pg=PA102 |chapter=Partition of forces using Jacobi coordinates  |isbn=9812383670 |year=2003 |publisher=World Scientific}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_1 = x_1 - x_2} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_j }= \frac{1}{m_{0j}} \sum_{k=1}^j m_k\boldsymbol {x_k} \ - \ \boldsymbol{x_{j+1}}\ , &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;m_{0j} = \sum_{k=1}^j \ m_k \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The vector '''R''' is the center of mass of all the bodies:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol R = \frac{1}{m_0} \sum_{k=1}^N\ m_k \boldsymbol{x_k} \ ; &lt;/math&gt; &amp;ensp; &lt;math&gt;m_0 = \sum_{k=1}^N\ m_k \ . &lt;/math&gt;
