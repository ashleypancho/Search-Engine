The state is Vatican City, not The Holy See. The Holy See normally refers to all of the pope's jurisdictions, religious and moral as well as civil and diplomatic. The terms Vatican City and Holy See are not synonymous. The Holy See includes several bodies and organs that have nothing to do with Vatican City, such as the Congregation for the Oriental Churches or the Pontifical Biblical Commission. While being the sovereign of Vatican City is certainly a part of the job of being pope, in reality, it is one of the least important. Vatican City State has its own constitution,[http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2522/FundamentalLaw1.pdf] its own government, its own president,[http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/Structure_Governorate/Presidency/President/], its own legislature, its own police force, its own courts, and several other institutions that go along with being a state, that are quite distinct from the other parts of the Holy See.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So you can say a few phrases but how do you get other Japanese speakers to help you learn more words to plug in to your knowledge of the language? Like this! 

Lets brake a sentence into pieces.

&lt;center&gt;
'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;これ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;は&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;にほんご&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;で&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;lime&quot;&gt;なんと&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot;&gt;いいます&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;か&lt;/font&gt;'''

'''&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;This&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; is&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;lime&quot;&gt; what&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot;&gt; say&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt; in&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt; Japanese&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;?&lt;/font&gt;'''

''(How do you say this in Japanese?)''
&lt;/center&gt;


{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:teal; color:white&quot; | '''～　Important language notes!　～'''
|-
| で is another article that gives meaning to this sentence. 
|-
| Don't worry about it either. Learn how it all works later. 
|-
| なんと means ''what (with quotes)'', remember by it's self it is なに. 
|- 
| If you don't get all that, don't worry. Just use this like a frame. 
|-
| Notice the か is a question mark, without it we have a normal sentence. 
|}

Mary knows a lot more about words in Japanese than Johnny does. That's OK. Johnny can just ask her to explain how things are said in Japanese! 



{| align=&quot;left&quot;

You could be Mary too! If Johnny asked you how to say mobile phone or newspaper or anything you could answer him right? Let's see what Mary is holding right now.

[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd022.ogg|right]]







But Mary speaks a million languages! Let's ask her to explain things in other languages too! She's sure a super person.

{| align=&quot;center&quot;

That Mary! I bet she is reading the newspaper in order to find out all sorts of cool things about the world. I wonder what language she is reading it in?

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:green; color:white&quot; | '''～　Language note of interest!　～'''
|-
| Mary is super smart but she might not be able to answer some of Johnny's  
|-
| language questions. In that case she would say しりません or in English  
|- 
| &quot;I do not know.&quot; (polite) Of course she should smile when she says that!

We are a team of professionals developing a software called EmpXtrack. During its development and implementation, we find and learn lots of things about Human Resource practices. Some things are unique. We found that Wikipdia is a good platform to share our knowledge with our fellows. So we started writing.

'''Our Team'''

Right now we are three in this team. Major General B. K. Bhatia, Tushar Bhatia and Gireesh Sharma, who will be contributing in development of books on various subjects of Performance Management. 

'''Our Plans'''

We will be randomly contributing in the books and then edit, re-organize the stuff, as and when time permits.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">OK! If you have been following along with us, Johnny is really able to communicate quite well by now. Of course he needs some more words, so lets look at a list of plug-in words for better communication! 

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:orange; color:white&quot; | '''Plug-in words:'''
|-
| おもしろい funny/interesting/odd
|-
| たかい expensive/tall, やすい cheap
|-
| おいしい delicious, まずい　tastes bad
|}


{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:teal; color:white&quot; | '''～　Important language notes!　～'''
|-
| If you want extra credit points you can learn how to make some  
|-
| description words (but not all, half are exceptions!) negative  
|-
| by just changing some letters. These group of words ending in い 
|- 
| just needs you to change the い to くない and you get the opposite! 
|-
| おもしろくない not interesting, おいしくない not delicious, etc. 
|}

So lets hear Johnny and Mary talk about these kind of things. Oh, look, they are sitting at home watching TV. Go ahead Johnny... 



{| align=&quot;left&quot;
| style=&quot;background:blue; color:white&quot; | '''Johnny'''
|-
| これはおもしろいです'''ね'''. [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|kore WA omoshiroi desu ne]]
|-
| ''This is interesting, huh?''
|-
|}
[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png]]
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd025.ogg|left]]


[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-woman.png|right]]
{| align=&quot;right&quot;
| style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot; | '''Mary'''
|-
| これはおもしろくないです! [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|kore WA omoshirokunai desu!]]
|-
| ''This is '''not''' interesting!''
|-
|}
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd026.ogg|right]]











Wow, Mary sounds angry! I wonder what they were watching. Maybe Mary is just in a bad mood. I wonder if she likes sushi? 




{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:orange; color:white&quot; | '''Plug-in words:'''
|-
| すし sushi, りんご apple
|-
| にほんしゅ rice wine, さる monkey
|}

If you were Johnny how would you ask Mary if she thought sushi was delicious?

{| align=&quot;left&quot;
| style=&quot;background:blue; color:white&quot; | '''Johnny'''
|-
| すしはおいしいですか？ [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|sushi WA oishii desu ka?]]
|-
| ''Is sushi delicious?''
|-
|}
[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png]]
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd027.ogg|left]]

[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-woman.png|right]]
{| align=&quot;right&quot;
| style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot; | '''Mary'''
|-
| はい、おいしいですね. [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|hai, oishii desu ne]]
|-
| ''Yes, it is delicious, huh?''
|-
|}
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd028.ogg|right]]














With those words in the plug-in box you could even ask Mary if she thinks monkeys are interesting, if rice wine is expensive, or even if she thinks monkeys are delicious! 

Although we know Mary wouldn't eat a cute little monkey, right?!


Mary has been quite moody though, let's see what's on her mind. Lets ask about her feelings next.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Digital Data==

There are two different types of data: analogue and digital. Analogue data can, potentially, take on any value. Examples include a page of handwritten text, a cassette, or a painting. Digital data can only take on a set range of values. This enables it to be processed by a computer. Examples include all files stored on computers, CDs, DVDs, etc.

===Pixels===

[[Image:Pixel-example.png|right|thumb|200px|Enlarged image of a computer, showing individual pixels.]]
Digital images are made up of pixels. A pixel represents the value of an individual square of the image, and it has a value assigned to it. The total number of pixels in an image is just like the formula for the area of a rectangle: number of pixels across multiplied by number of pixels down. When representing text, each pixel is a component of one character (for example, a letter, a number, a space, or a new line), it is not the entirety of a character. For instance if the letter 'E' was to be taken as an example and a section was to be taken through the three protrusions; a minimum of seven (7) pixels would be used, one white pixel at the top, then one black (for the first protrusion), then one white for the gap, then a black one for the centre - and so on. A type face - such as Helvetica, or Times New Roman, maybe made up of a more complex pattern of pixels to allow for serif details.

===Bits===

Each pixel's value is digital: it takes on a definite value. In a higher quality image, each pixel can take on a greater variety of values. Each pixel's value is encoded as a number of bits. A bit is a datum with a value of either 0 or 1. The more values a pixel can take on, the more bits must be used to represent its value. The number of values (''N'') that a pixel represented by ''I'' bits can take on is given by the formula:

N = 2&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;

Hence:

&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\log N}{\log 2} \approx \frac{\log N}{0.301029996}&lt;/math&gt; 
Log base 10 used here. For ratios, the base of the log does not matter, now we have evaluated log 2 using base 10 log N must be base 10 as well.


A pixel may be represented by values for red, green and blue, in which case each colour channel will have to be encoded separately. When dealing with text, the number of values is equal to the number of possible characters.

Overall, for an image:

Amount of information in an image (bits) = number of pixels x bits per pixel.

===Bytes===

A byte is equal to 8 bits. The major difference between bytes and SI units is that when prefixes (such as kilo-, mega-, etc.) are attached, we do not multiply by 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; as the prefix increases. Instead, we multiply by 1024. So, 1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes, 1 megabyte = 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, 1 gigabyte = 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bytes, and 1 terabyte = 1024&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; bytes.

==Questions==

1. An image transmitted down a SVGA video cable is 800 pixels wide, and 600 pixels high. How many pixels are there in the image?

2. A grayscale image is encoded using 3 bits. How many possible values can each pixel have?

3. The characters in a text document are numbered from 0 - 255. How many bits should each character be encoded with?

4. A page contains 30 lines of text, with an average of 15 characters on each line. Each character is represented by 4 bits. How many megabytes of uncompressed storage will a book consisting of 650 pages like this fill on a computer's hard disk?

5. A 10cm wide square image is scanned into a computer. Each pixel is encoded using 3 channels (red, green and blue), and each channel can take on 256 possible values. One pixel is 0.01 mm wide. How much information does the scanned image contain? Express your answer using an appropriate unit.

'''''Physocarpus''''' ('''Ninebark''') is a genus of about ten species of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to North America (most of the species) and northeastern Asia (one species).

==Description==
They are deciduous shrubs growing to 1-3 m tall. The name comes from the appearance of the bark, which is flaky, peeling away in many layers. The leaves are maple-like, palmately lobed, 3-15 cm long and broad, with an irregularly serrated margin. The flowers are white with five petals and numerous stamens, produced in corymbs. The fruit is a cluster of inflated follicles, which turn dry and brown and then split open to release the seeds.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
*''[[../Physocarpus alternans/]]'' ('''Dwarf Ninebark''')
*''[[../Physocarpus amurensis/]]'' ('''Asian Ninebark''')
*''[[../Physocarpus bracteatus/]]''
*''[[../Physocarpus capitatus/]]'' ('''Pacific Ninebark''')
*''[[../Physocarpus glabratus/]]''
*''[[../Physocarpus malvaceus/]]'' ('''Mallow Ninebark''')
*''[[../Physocarpus monogynus/]]'' ('''Mountain Ninebark''')
*''[[../Physocarpus opulifolius/]]'' ('''Common Ninebark''')

==Uses==

&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;
Current use of this plant in its name cultivars (see below) for landscape design is to form a line of uninterrupted, loose informal hedge.  Individual specimens may be used for the attractive colors of the foliage.  There are little medicinal or food uses of this plant.

Much development has gone into developing attractive foliage and smaller size of this native shrub.  Two popular and common cultivars exist.  'Darts Gold' is a gold color leaf version of this native plant, while 'Diablo', a purple (almost black) leaf cultivar also exists.

Since the new century, much work is continuing to develop hybrids based on the above two cultivars.  'Coppertina' a cultivar exhibiting orange-red leaves, is such a development, created when the above two cultivars were crossed.

==Maintenance==
Little maintenance is required for this native shrub once established.  To maintain the shape of the plant, pruning is highly recommended.  As the old branches exhibit an exfoliating bark which is for some gardeners its chief attraction, leaving the older branches on the plant is often achieved by only pruning and rejuvenating one third of the older branches on a plant in any one year. If a more youthful looking plant is desired, then hard pruning of all the older branches may also be accomplished.  In such a case, pruning should be conducted during the spring.
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;
Like all native shrubs that originate from a basal rosette of stems from a common root, this native North American shrub is easy to propagate.

The shrub after flowering forms many tiny seeds, which are held onto the plant well into winter.  Mature seeds may be easily released when the shrub is brushed against or shaken.  Seedlings formed from self seeding into cracks and crevices may be carefully removed and transplanted.

Another method of propagation is to divide the basal clump of stems, ensuring each group of stems are attached to a viable root.  This is done by cleaving the clump at the basal rosette of stems, right down to the root level, separating the one clump into two or more smaller clumps.  Each small clump can then be transplanted.  In this initial stage, adequate watering is crucial to ensure the survival of the severed clumps.  If a severed clump survives the first winter, it will live on.  Severing of the clumps may be done anytime, but typically fall time is best, as the cooler temperatures and increased rainfall ensure less evaporation and demands on the smaller severed root system.

A third method is achieved by layering a long branch.  This is done by bending one of the younger more flexible stems to the ground, and pinning it in place.  Over the course of one year, tiny rootlets will develop where the stem touches the ground.  At that point, the rooted portion may be severed from the mother plant and carefully tended.

Cuttings rooted in rooting hormone has a lower success rate but nonetheless may be a viable option of reproducing this species.  However, many state laws prohibit the unauthorized reproduction of any named cultivar without the prior consent of the original nursery that had developed the cultivar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">That formula involved logarithms. If a&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; = c, then:

&lt;math&gt;\log _ac = b&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, a logarithm is a way of asking the question, &quot;''a'' to the power of what is ''c''?&quot; ''a'' is known as the base of the logarithm. log a is shorthand for log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;a, and can be calculated using the 'log' button on a scientific calculator.

Just as with indices, there are some laws of logarithms. At present, we are only concerned with this one:

&lt;math&gt;\log _a(c^n) = n \log _ac&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply this to the formula for calculating the number of possible values a pixel can take on (v = 2&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;), we can rearrange it to get a formula for ''b'' by taking the logarithm to the base 10 of both sides:

&lt;math&gt;\log v = \log (2^b)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\log v = b \log 2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{\log{v}}{\log{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

We can then use a scientific calculator to calculate log 2, giving us the formula:

&lt;math&gt;b \approx \frac{\log{v}}{0.3}&lt;/math&gt;

There's no reason for &quot;vectors&quot; to have its own section separate from &quot;scalars and vectors&quot;. When talking about vectors, one invariably needs to compare it with a scalar, so in any &quot;vector&quot; page one would mention scalar. The only possible reason to cover vector in its own section is to cover vector algebra and vector calculus in depth (like the triple product, vector derivatives, maybe Green's theorem, etc.) but those are too advanced for first-and-second-year physics textbook. That type of stuff usually gets covered (in U.S., at least at the university I graduated from) in upper division (third or fourth year) electrodynamics. I will merge the additional stuff (diagrams, additional explanations) in from this section to the other one as I find time, but please(unless someone has objections), feel free to do it (for anyone out there).

'''''Prunus laurocerasus''''' ('''Cherry-laurel''' or '''Laurel Cherry''') is an evergreen shrub native to regions bordering the Black Sea in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe, from Albania and Bulgaria east through Turkey to the Caucasus Mountains and northern Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Euro+Med Plantbase Project: [http://ww2.bgbm.org/_EuroPlusMed/PTaxonDetail.asp?NameId=29962&amp;PTRefFk=500000 ''Prunus laurocerasus'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?30027 ''Prunus laurocerasus'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It is an evergreen shrub or small tree, growing to 5-15 m tall, rarely to 18 m tall, with a trunk up to 60 cm diameter. The leaves are dark green, leathery, shiny, (5–)10–25(–30) cm long and 4-10 cm broad, with a finely serrated margin. The flower buds appear in early spring and open in early summer in erect 7-15 cm racemes of 30–40 flowers, each flower 1 cm diameter, with five creamy-white petals and numerous yellowish stamens. The fruit is a small cherry 1-2 cm diameter, turning black when ripe in early autumn.&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;Rushforth, K. (1999). ''Trees of Britain and Europe''. Collins ISBN 0-00-220013-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fnwe&gt;Flora of NW Europe: [http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/BIS/flora.php?selected=beschrijving&amp;menuentry=soorten&amp;id=2724 ''Prunus laurocerasus'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Karayemiş-2.JPG|thumb|left|Leaves]]
''Prunus laurocerasus'' is often called 'laurel' because of the similarity of foliage and appearance to the true laurel, ''[[../Laurus nobilis/]]''. However, the two plants are not related.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
Over 40 cultivars have been selected, including:&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'Aureovariegata' – variegated, leaves with a yellow margin.
*'Magnifolia' – vigorous, with large leaves up to 30 cm long and 11 cm broad.
*'Otto Luyken' – semi-dwarf, with small leaves 10 cm long and 2–3 cm broad.
*'Zabeliana' – selected for winter cold tolerance.

==Uses==
''Prunus laurocerasus'' has been widely planted as an ornamental plant in temperate regions worldwide, and has become naturalised widely in some areas. It is often used for screening, and also as a mass landscape and ground cover plant. Most forms are tough shrubs that can cope with difficult growing conditions (including shaded and dry conditions), and which respond well to pruning. The foliage is also used for cut greenery in floristry.

Unlike the rest of the plant, which is poisonous, the cherries are edible, although rather bland and with a somewhat astringent flavour compared to the fruit of apricots, true cherries, plums, and peaches, to which it is related. The seeds contained within the berries are poisonous like the rest of the plant, containing cyanogenic glycosides and amygdalin.&lt;ref name=Toxicology&gt;[http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/poison/Prunula.htm Poisonous Plants: Prunus Laurocerasus]&lt;/ref&gt; This chemical composition is what gives the smell of almonds when the leaves are crushed.

Laurel water, a distillation made from the plant, has a pharmacological usage.

==Maintenance==
In some regions such as the Pacific Northwest of the United States, this species is an invasive plant. Its rapid growth, coupled with its evergreen habit and its tolerance of drought and shade, often allow it to out-compete and kill off native plant species. This reduces the overall diversity of ecosystems and impacts other plants and animals that live there negatively. It is also difficult to control once it has naturalised, because some species of birds eat the fruits and spread the seeds in their droppings.

The '''Black Cherry''' (''Prunus serotina'', also occasionally Wild Black Cherry, Rum Cherry, or Mountain Black Cherry) is a large forest tree native to eastern North America from southern Quebec and Ontario south to Texas and central Florida, with disjunct populations in Arizona and New Mexico, and in the mountains of Mexico and Guatemala.&lt;ref name=silvics&gt;Marquis, D. A. (undated). U.S. Forest Service Silvics Manual: [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/prunus/serotina.htm ''Prunus serotina'' Ehrh. - Black Cherry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usda&gt;USDA Plants Profile: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PRSE2 NCRS: ''Prunus serotina'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member in the subgenus ''Padus''.

==Description==
Black Cherry is a deciduous tree growing to 15-30 m tall with a trunk diameter of up to 70-120 cm, occasionally more. The leaves are simple, 6-14 cm long, with a serrated margin. The flowers are in racemes, small (10-15 mm diameter), with five white petals and about 20 stamens, and are fragrant; there are around 40 flowers on each raceme. The fruit is a drupe, 1 cm diameter, green to red at first, ripening black; it is usually astringent and bitter to eat fresh, but sometimes sweet. The fruit is readily eaten by birds, which do not taste astringency as unpleasant.&lt;ref name=mp&gt;Missouriplants: [http://www.missouriplants.com/Whitealt/Prunus_serotina_page.html ''Prunus serotina'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=silvics/&gt;

Mature Black Cherry can easily be identified in a forest by its platy, dark grey to black bark, which has the appearance of very thick, burnt potato chips. However, for about the first decade or so of its life, the bark resembles that of a Birch, and is thin and striped. It can also quickly be identified by its long, shiny leaves resembling that of a [[../Nyssa sylvatica|Sourwood]], and by an almond-like odor when a young twig is scratched and held close to the nose.

Black Cherry is closely related to the Chokecherry (''[[../Prunus virginiana/]]''), from which it differs in the larger leaves and the cherries, which are black when ripe (hence the name), not red, though some populations of Chokecherry also produce black fruit.

==Growing Conditions==
The Black Cherry is a pioneer species. In the Midwest, it is seen growing mostly in old fields with other sunlight loving species, such as Black Walnut, Black locust, and Hackberry. It is a moderately long-lived tree, with ages of up to 258 years known, though it is prone to storm damage with branches breaking easily; any decay resulting however only progresses slowly&lt;ref name=silvics/&gt;

==Varieties==
There are two subspecies:&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?30099 ''Prunus serotina'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Prunus serotina'' subsp. ''serotina''. Canada, United States.
*''Prunus serotina'' subsp. ''capuli'' (Cav.) McVaugh. Mexico, Guatemala.
The typical subsp. ''serotina'' is sometimes further divided into four varieties, var. ''serotina'' in the east of the range, var. ''eximia'' in Texas, and vars. ''rufula'' and ''virens'' in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.&lt;ref name=usda/&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Amerikaanse vogelkers bessen Prunus serotina.jpg|left|thumb|Immature fruit]]
The fruit is suitable for making jam and cherry pies; they are also a popular flavoring for sodas and used in many ice creams.

The timber is valuable, perhaps the premier cabinetry timber of the U.S., traded as &quot;cherry&quot;. It is known for its strong red color and high price.

==Maintenance==
The foliage, particularly when wilted, contains cyanogenic glycosides which convert to hydrogen cyanide if eaten by animals.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt; It is recommended that farmers remove any Black Cherry trees that fall in a field containing livestock, because the wilted leaves could poison the animals. Removal is not always practical though, because Black Cherries often grow in very large numbers on farms, taking advantage of the light brought about by mowing and grazing. Entire fencerows can be lined with this poisonous tree, making it difficult to monitor all the branches falling into the grazing area.

Black Cherry is locally naturalized in parts of Europe, having escaped from cultivation as an ornamental tree.&lt;ref&gt;Flora of NW Europe: [http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/BIS/flora.php?selected=beschrijving&amp;menuentry=soorten&amp;id=2722 ''Prunus serotina'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propagation==
Generally propagated by seed.

==Harvest==
Wood is harvested when trees are mature (at least 24&quot; diameter). Cherries can be difficult to harvest because of the height of the tree.

==Pests and Diseases==
See [[w:List of Lepidoptera which feed on Prunus|List of Lepidoptera which feed on ''Prunus'']]. The [[../Eastern tent caterpillar/]] defoliates entire groves some springs.

'''Firethorn''' ('''''Pyracantha''''') is a genus of thorny evergreen large shrubs in the family Rosaceae, subfamily Maloideae. They are native from southeast Europe east to southeast Asia, and are closely related to ''[[../Cotoneaster/]]'', but have serrated leaf margins and numerous thorns (Cotoneasters are thornless).

==Description==
The plants reach up to 6 m tall. The seven species have white flowers and either red, orange, or yellow berries (more correctly pomes). The flowers are produced during late spring and early summer; the pomes develop from late summer, and mature in late autumn.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
;Species:
*''Pyracantha angustifolia''. Southwest China.
*''Pyracantha atalantoides''. Southern China.
*''Pyracantha coccinea'' ('''Scarlet firethorn'''). Italy east to Asia Minor.
*''Pyracantha crenatoserrata''. Central China.
*''Pyracantha crenulata''. Himalaya.
*''Pyracantha koidzumii''. Taiwan.
*''Pyracantha rogersiana''. Yunnan.

*'Watereri'

==Uses==
Pyracanthas are valuable ornamental plants, grown in gardens for their decorative flowers and fruit, often very densely borne. Their dense thorny structure makes them particularly valued in situations where an impenetrable barrier is required. The aesthetic characteristics, in conjunction with their home security qualities, makes them a considerable alternative to artificial fences and walls&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homesecurityguru.com/firethorn Firethorn, an article from hHome Security Guru]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homesecurityguru.com/yard-protection-your-first-line-of-defense Yard Protection: Your First Line of Defense, an article from Home Security Guru]&lt;/ref&gt;
They are also a good shrub for a wildlife garden, providing dense cover for roosting and nesting birds, summer flowers for bees and an abundance of berries as a food source. Pyracantha berries are not poisonous as commonly thought; although they are very bitter, they are edible when cooked and are sometimes made into jelly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plantanswers.tamu.edu/trees/pyracan.html http://plantanswers.tamu.edu/trees/pyracan.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Locust''' (''Robinia pseudoacacia'') is a tree in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, but has been widely planted and naturalized elsewhere in temperate North America, Europe and Asia and is considered an invasive species in some areas. A less frequently used common name is False Acacia, which is a literal translation of the specific epithet. It was introduced into Britain in 1636.

Like the honey locust, the black locust reproduces through its distinct hanging pods, but on the black locust they are smaller and lighter and thus easily carried long distances by the wind. Unlike the pods of the honey locust, but like those of the related European Laburnum, the black locust's pods are toxic. In fact, every part of the tree, especially the bark, is considered toxic, with the exception of the flowers. However, various reports have suggested that the seeds and the young pods of the black locust can be edible when cooked, since the poisons that are contained in this plant are decomposed by heat. Horses who consume the plant show signs of anorexia, depression, diarrhea, colic, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmia. Symptoms usually occur about 1 hour following consumption, and immediate veterinary attention is required.

The name ''locust'' is said to have been given to ''Robinia'' by Jesuit missionaries, who fancied that this was the tree that supported St. John in the wilderness, but it is native only to North America. The locust tree of Spain, which is also native to Syria, is supposed to be the true locust of the New Testament; the fruit of this tree may be found in the shops under the name of St. John's bread.&lt;ref name=Keeler /&gt;

''Robinia'' is now a North American genus&amp;mdash;but traces of it are found in the Eocene and Miocene rocks of Europe.&lt;ref name=Keeler /&gt;

==Description==
It grows to 14–25 m tall, with a trunk up to 0.8 m diameter (exceptionally up to 27 m tall and 1.6 m diameter in very old trees), with thick, deeply furrowed blackish bark. The leaves are 10–25 cm long, pinnate with 9–19 oval leaflets, 2–5 cm long and 1.5–3 cm broad. Each leaf usually has a pair of short thorns at the base, 1–2 mm long or absent on adult crown shoots, up to 2 cm long on vigorous young plants. The intensely fragrant flowers are white, borne in pendulous racemes 8–20 cm long, and are considered edible. The fruit is a legume 5–10 cm long, containing 4–10 seeds.

Although similar in general appearance to Honey locust, it lacks that tree's characteristic long branched spines on the trunk, instead having the pairs of short thorns at the base of each leaf; the leaflets are also much broader.

Native from Pennsylvania to northern Georgia and westward as far as Arkansas and Oklahoma, but has been widely spread. Reaches the height of seventy feet with a trunk three or four feet in diameter, with brittle branches that form an oblong narrow head. Spreads by underground shoots. The leaflets fold together in wet weather, also at night; some change of position at night is the habit of the entire leguminous family.

* Bark: Dark gray brown tinged with red, deeply furrowed, surface inclined to scale.  Branchlets at first coated with white silvery down.  This soon disappears and they become pale green, afterward reddish brown.  Prickles develop from stipules, are short, somewhat triangular, dilated at base, sharp, dark purple, adhering only to the bark, but persistent.
* Wood: Pale yellowish brown; heavy, hard, strong, close-grained and very durable in contact with the ground.  Sp. gr., 0.7333; weight of cu. ft., 45.70 lbs.
* Winter buds: Minute, naked, three or four together, protected in a depression by a scale-like covering lined on the inner surface with a thick coat of tomentum and opening in early spring; when forming are covered by the swollen base of the petiole.
* Leaves: Parallel, compound, odd-pinnate, eight to fourteen inches long, with slender hairy petioles, grooved and swollen at the base.  Leaflets petiolate, seven to nine, one to two inches long, one-half to three-fourths of an inch broad, emarginate or rounded at apex.  They come out of the bud conduplicate, yellow green, covered with silvery down which soon disappears; when full grown are dull dark green above, paler beneath.  Feather-veined, midvein prominent.  In autumn they turn a clear pale yellow.  Stipules linear, downy, membranous at first, ultimately developing into hard woody prickles, straight or slightly curved.  Each leaflet has a minute stipel which quickly falls and a short petiole.
* Flowers: May, after the leaves.  Papilionaceous.  Perfect, borne in loose drooping racemes four to five inches long, cream-white, about an inch long, nectar bearing, fragrant.  Pedicels slender, half an inch long, dark red or reddish green.
* Calyx: Campanulate, givvous, hairy, five-toothed, slightly two-lipped, dark green blotched with red, especially on the upper side teeth valvate in bud.
* Corolla: Imperfectly papilionaceous, petals inserted upon a tubular disk; standard white with pale yellow blotch; wings white, oblong-falcate; keel petals incurved, obtuse, united below.
* Stamens: Ten, inserted, with the petals, diadelphous, nine inferior, united into a tube which is cleft on the upper side, superior one free at the base.  Anthers two-celled, cells opening longitudinally.
* Pistil: Ovary superior, linear-oblong, stipitate, one-celled; style inflexed, long, slender, bearded; stigma capitate; ovules several, two-ranked.
* Fruit: legume two-valved, smooth three to four inches long and half an inch broad, usually four to eight seeded.  Ripens late in autumn and hangs on the branches until early spring.  Seeds dark orange brown with irregular markings.  Cotyledons oval, fleshy.&lt;ref name=Keeler&gt;Keeler, Harriet L.,''Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them'', 1900, Charles Scriber's Sons, New York, pp 97-102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Black locust is a major honey plant in eastern USA, and, having been taken and planted in France, is the source of the renowned acacia monofloral honey from France. Flowering starts after 140 growing degree days.
In Europe it is often planted alongside streets and in parks, especially in large cities, because it tolerates pollution well. The species is unsuitable for small gardens due to its large size and rapid growth, but the cultivar 'Frisia', a selection with bright yellow-green leaves, is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree.

Black locust has nitrogen-fixing bacteria on its root system; for this reason it can grow on poor soils and is an early colonizer of disturbed areas.

In 1900 it was reported that the value of ''Robinia pseudacacia'' is practically destroyed in nearly all parts of the United States beyond the mountain forests which are its home, by the borers which riddle the trunk and branches.  Were it not for these insects it would be one of the most valuable timber trees that could be planted in the northern and middle states.  Young trees grow quickly and vigorously for a number of years, but soon become stunted and diseased, and rarely live long enough to attain any commercial value.&lt;ref name=Keeler /&gt;

[[Image:Black Locust Endgrain.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Black locust is a ring-porous hardwood.]]
The wood is extremely hard, resistant to rot and long lasting, making it prized for fence posts and small watercraft. As a young man, Abraham Lincoln spent a lot of time splitting rails and fence posts from black locust logs. Flavonoids in the heartwood allow the wood to last over 100 years in soil.&lt;ref name = &quot; =bl&quot;&gt; [http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1990/V1-278.html Black Locust: A Multi-purpose Tree Species for Temperate Climates], accessed 2007-27-06&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands and some other parts of Europe, black locust is the most rot-resistant local tree, and projects have started to limit the use of tropical wood by promoting this tree and creating plantations. It is one of the heaviest and hardest woods in North America.

Black Locust is unsurpassed as firewood for wood stoves; it burns slowly, with little visible flame or smoke, and has a higher heat content than any other wood that grows in the Eastern US, comparable to the heat content of anthracite&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;firewood&quot;&gt;
[http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2503/F-9441web.pdf Heating the Home with Wood]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for this use it should be split when green, then dried for 2 to 3 years, and ignited by insertion into a stove already hot from burning of a load of some other hardwood.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In fireplaces it is less satisfactory because knots and beetle damage in black locust make the wood prone to &quot;spitting&quot; coals for distances of up to several feet.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} If the Black Locust is cut, split, and cured while relatively young (within ten years) typically damage and &quot;spitting&quot; problems are minimal. It can be an excellent firewood in stoves, campfires, and fireplaces if properly cultivated.  As it is fast-growing and highly resilient in a variety of soils it renews itself readily for future use.

'''''Rubus occidentalis''''' is a species of ''[[../Rubus/]]'' native to eastern North America. The common name '''Black Raspberry''' is shared with the closely related western American species ''[[../Rubus leucodermis/]]''. Other names occasionally used include wild black raspberry, black caps, black cap raspberry, and thimbleberry.&lt;ref&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?32401 ''Rubus occidentalis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michigan Bee Plants: [http://plants.bees.net/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=rubus&amp;id=Rubus_occidentalis_fig_2_CRW_2542_RT8 ''Rubus occidentalis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rubus occidentalis'' is a deciduous shrub growing to 2–3 m tall, with thorny shoots. The leaves are pinnate, with five leaflets on leaves strong-growing stems in their first year, and three leaflets on leaves on flowering branchlets. The flowers are distinct in having long, slender sepals 6–8 mm long, more than twice as long as the petals. The round-shaped fruit is a 12–15 mm diameter aggregation of drupelets; it is edible, and has a high content of anthocyanins and ellagic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma Biological Survey: [http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/shrub/rubu-occ.htm ''Rubus occidentalis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bioimages: [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/ruoc.htm ''Rubus occidentalis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Black raspberries are high in anthocyanins. This has led to them being very useful as natural dyes and, since anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants, to a great deal of interest in them for their potential nutraceutical value. Extensive work has been ongoing at Ohio State University to evaluate their benefit for cancer treatment in mammalian test systems,&lt;ref&gt;Ohio State University: [http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/canberry.htm Black raspberries show multiple defenses in thwarting cancer]&lt;/ref&gt; and the first clinical trials on patients with esophageal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;PubMed: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16800781&amp;query_hl=3&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also closely related to the raspberries ''[[../Rubus idaeus/]]'' and ''[[../Rubus strigosus/]]'', sharing the distinctively white underside of the leaves and fruit that readily detaches from the carpel, but differing in the ripe fruit being black, and in the stems being more thorny. The black fruit makes them look like blackberries, though this is only superficial, with the taste being unique and not like either raspberry or blackberry. In much of the Mid-Atlantic United States, black raspberries are simply called ''Blackberries'', even though they are not. 

==Commercial growing and processing==
The center for black raspberry production is in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The main cultivar, 'Munger', is grown on about 600 ha (1500 acres). Other cultivars include 'John Robertson', 'Allen', 'Jewel', 'Blackhawk', 'Macblack', 'Plum Farmer', 'Dundee', 'Hanover', and 'Huron'. The plants are summer tipped by hand, mechanically pruned in winter and then machine harvested. The yields are generally low per acre and this is why the fruits are often expensive.

The species has been used in the breeding of many ''Rubus'' hybrids; those between red and black raspberries are common under the name purple raspberries; 'Brandywine', 'Royalty' and 'Estate' are examples of purple raspberry cultivars.

The berries are typically dried, frozen or made into purées and juices or processed as colorants. Two well known liqueurs predominantly based on black raspberry fruit include France's Chambord Liqueur Royale de France and South Korea's various manufacturers of Bokbunja.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Suppose V is a vector space over a field F. A nonempty set of vectors H within the vector space V is defined to be a subspace of V when:

#If u and v are elements of H then u+v must also be an element of H

#If u is an element of H and c is an element of F, then cu is also an element of H

Where addition and scalar multiplication in H is defined to be the same as addition and scalar multiplication in V when all vectors involved are within H.

A subspace of any vector space is also a vector space because it is obviously true that when x, y and z are elements of H and c and d are elements of F, it is obviously true that x+y=y+x and (x+y)+z=x+(y+z) because they are elements of V, and also 1x=x, c(dx)=(cd)x, (a+b)x=ax+bx, a(x+y)=ax+ay because x and y are elements of V, and by the second condition, for every x, there exists a 0x within the set, which is the identity, so its identity is within the subspace, and also by the second condition, for every x, there exists a (-1)x, which is its inverse. Thus, all subspaces of a vector space are also vector spaces.

==Properties of Subspaces==
If a set of vectors are in a subspace H of a vector space V, and the vectors are linearly independent in V, then they are also linearly independent in H. This implies that the dimension of H is less than or equal to the dimension of V.

Also, for every basis in a subspace H, there exists a basis in V which contains that basis of H. This follows from the completion theorem proven earlier.

==Dimension==
A set of vectors '''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' in a vector space V over a field F is said to be linearly independent over a subspace H when, for elements a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; within the field F, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''+a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''+a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''+...+a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is an element of H only when a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; all equal 0. Linear independence over the subspace containing only the 0 vector is obviously the same as ordinary linear independence.
The maximum number of vectors in V which are linearly independent over H is defined to be the dimension of V over H.

If a set of vectors O in V are linearly independent over H and a set of vectors I are linearly independent within H, then they union of those two sets is also linearly independent. This is because if there is a linear combination of those vectors, then it can equal 0 only when the linear combination of the vectors in O is the opposite of the linear combination of the vectors of I, which is also within H, implying that the coefficients of the elements of O are all 0, but which implies that all elements of I are also 0.

If, given any subspace H of a vector space V, one has a basis B for H, and a basis C of V containing B, then the elements of C-B are linearly independent over H since any element of H must be linearly dependent on elements of B (since it is a basis of H), and since the elements of C-B are all linearly independent to the elements of C-B, any linear combination of them in which not all coefficients are 0 must not be an element of H, thus proving that they are all linearly independent over H. Thus, if a vector space has dimension d, and a subspace has dimension s, the dimension of a vector space over that subspace is d-s.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should really consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or login in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone elses.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have changed.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

Hi I´m a german Wikibookian, called [[de:Benutzer:Techni-Tom|Techni-Tom]].

== Deprecated? ==

[[File:Wikibooks-logo.svg|60px|right|link=Main Page]]
It seems that this template has been deprecated by a software feature. Images can now be linked to using the &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; variable. If no-one objects I suggest we replace transclusions with simple file tags and let the template go the way of the Vogons. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:04, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

: I don't think this template is completely deprecated yet. Using this template you can override the title attribute, which often is shown in the form of a tooltip in graphical browsers. This currently cannot be done when using the link option with File.

:: Good catch. This actually exists since [[mw:Help:Images|MW 1.14]]. The image &quot;alt&quot; attribute ''is'' set, but not the link's &quot;title&quot; attribute, which is what the template does. I guess this may just be poor choice of naming for the template variable.
:: The title-setting feature is only used on [[Template:Sisterlinks]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:58, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
::: The alt and title attributes are set by using the description field for images when not using a file/image &quot;type&quot; that shows a description. I was just trying to use similar template argument names as used with File. Template.Sisterlinks isn't the only place the title-setting feature is used. I think there are many others. [[Template:Userbox2]] is probably the latest to do so. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:31, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

'''San Marino''' is a tiny country in central Europe. It is completely surrounded by [[../Italy|Italy]]. The capital city is the '''[[w:City of San Marino|City of San Marino]]'''. San Marino is one of the smallest countries in the world.  It is not part of the [[../EU|European Union]] but it uses the Euro as its currency.

[[Image:Flag of San Marino (bordered).svg|200px|thumb|right|The national flag of San Marino.]]

==San Marino's History==
Traditionally, San Marino was founded by '''Saint Marinus''' in 301 CE. Marinus was a Christian stonemason who fled to the hills that make up San Marino to avoid persecution under the Roman Empire.  Before the 19th century most of present-day Italy consisted of small city states like San Marino. When all of the other small states in Italy united in the 19th Century San Marino refused to join and has never been part of Italy.  San Marino remained neutral during World War I and World War II.

After World War II San Marino became the first country to be democratically ruled by a communist party.

==San Marino's Geography==
San Marino is the third-smallest country in Europe, with only Vatican City and Monaco smaller.  The total area that San Marino covers is 61 km² (23.5 sq mi).  The climate is Mediterranean, with warm summers and mild winters.  The country is completely surrounded by Italy - one of only 3 such countries in the world (the others are Vatican City, also surrounded by Italy, and Lesotho, surrounded by South Africa).

==San Marino's People==
The Country has a population of approximately 31,000, including 1,000 foreigners, most of whom are Italians. About 5,000 Sammarinese live in foreign countries, predominantly in Italy. The language spoken is [[Wikijunior:Languages/Italian|Italian]]. Emiliano-Romagnolo is widely spoken also. [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religion.

==San Marino's Sights==
Over 2 million tourists visit San Marino every year.  Popular attractions include the '''Three Towers of San Marino''', The Cathedral of San Marino and the state museum.  Buying stamps and coins with the name ''San Marino'' on them is a popular souvenir for many tourists.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Digitisation of a signal is the process by which an analogue signal is converted to a digital signal.

==Digitisation &amp; Reconstruction==

Let us consider the voltage output from a microphone. The signal which enters the microphone (sound) is an analogue signal - it can be any of a potentially infinite range of values, and may look something like this waveform (from an artificial (MIDI) piano):

[[Image:Piano_waveform_analogue.svg]]

When the microphone converts this signal to an electrical signal, it samples the signal a number of times, and transmits the level of the signal at that point. The following diagram shows sample times (vertical black lines) and the transmitted signal (the red line):

[[Image:Piano_waveform_analogue_sampled.svg]]

When we wish to listen to the sound, the digital signal has to be reconstructed. The gaps between the samples are filled in, but, as you can see, the reconstructed signal is not the same as the original sound:

[[Image:Piano_waveform_reconstructed.svg]]

==Sampling Rate==

The sampling rate when digitising an analogue signal is defined as the number of samples per. second, and is measured in Hertz (Hz), as it is a frequency. You can calculate the sampling rate using the formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Sampling Rate (Hz)} = \frac{\mbox{No. of samples}}{\mbox{No. of seconds}}&lt;/math&gt;

The higher the sampling rate, the closer the reconstructed signal is to the original signal, but, unfortunately, we are limited by the bandwidth available. Theoretically, a sampling rate of twice the highest frequency of the original signal will result in a perfect reconstructed signal. In the example given above, the sampling rate is far too low, hence the loss of information.

==Number of Levels==

Another factor which may limit the quality of the reconstructed signal is the number of bits with which the signal is encoded. For example, if we use 3 bits per. sample, we only have 8 (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) levels, so, when sampling, we must take the nearest value represented by one of these levels. This leads to quantization errors - when a sample does not equal the value of the original signal at a given sample point.

==Questions==

1. Take samples for the signal below every 0.1ms, and then produce a reconstructed signal. How does it differ from the original?

[[Image:Digitisation_q1.svg]]

2. A signal is sampled for 5 seconds at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. How many samples were taken?

3. Most sounds created by human speech except for 'ss' and 'ff' have a maximum frequency of 4 kHz. What is a suitable sampling rate for a low-quality telephone?

4. Using a sampling rate of 20 kHz and 3 bits, sample the following signal, and then produce a reconstructed signal. What is the maximum frequency that can be perfectly reconstructed using this sampling rate?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. Take samples for the signal below every 0.1ms, and then produce a reconstructed signal. How does it differ from the original?'''

[[Image:Digitisation_q1_solution.svg]]

The high frequency elements of the signal have been lost.

'''2. A signal is sampled for 5 seconds at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. How many samples were taken?'''

&lt;math&gt;20 \times 10^3 = \frac{\mbox{No. of samples}}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{No. of samples} = 20 \times 10^3 \times 5 = 100000&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. Most sounds created by human speech except for 'ss' and 'ff' have a maximum frequency of 4 kHz. What is a suitable sampling rate for a low-quality telephone?'''

&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2 = 8 \mbox{ kHz}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Using a sampling rate of 20 kHz and 3 bits, sample the following signal, and then produce a reconstructed signal. What is the maximum frequency that can be perfectly reconstructed using this sampling rate?'''

First, calculate the length of each sample, by letting the number of samples equal 1:

&lt;math&gt;20 \times 10^3 = \frac{1}{\mbox{Length of one sample}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Length of one sample} = \frac{1}{20 \times 10^3} = 0.00005\mbox{ s} = 0.05\mbox{ ms}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, we can sample the waveform and create a reconstructed signal:

To calculate the maximum frequency that can be perfectly reconstructed using this sampling rate (20 kHz):

&lt;math&gt;\frac{20}{2} = 10\mbox{ kHz}&lt;/math&gt;

''(moved and adapted by [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] from Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Virtual ground|Virtual ground discussion page]])''

=== Virtual versus analog ground ===

Virtual ground implies ground potential at the node. Adding a component to a ground will have no effect if the other component connection is ground. There is no potential difference, hence no current flows.
This may not be true for a virtual ground.  In an inverting amplifier adding a capacitor between ground and the virtual ground at the (-) op-amp input can make the amplifier unstable.  Stray capacitance from a probe is often sufficient. A warning should be added. [[w:User:Djhk|Djhk]] 18:26, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

:[[w:User:Djhk|Djhk]], you hate virtual ground but this is a phenomenon, fact that exists whether or not we like it. What do we do when we haven't an access to a real ground? Then we use a virtual ground (a typical example is creating of a split supply by one voltage source). Sometimes, we use a &quot;shifted&quot; (e.g. &quot;lifted&quot;) ground instead an exact ground.
:In a broadest sense, any circuit point having a voltage that is kept artificially (e.g., by means of a negative feedback) can be named virtual ground. In a literal sense, a virtual ground is a result of subtraction of two voltages having opposite polarities. We can say that a virtual ground is actually an active ground. Every active thing in this world is more stable to influence than passive one. [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[w:User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:34, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

::You are confusing Virtual ground with analog ground. You need to split the topic into virtual and analog ground; combining the two creates confusion. [[w:User:Djhk|Djhk]] 02:49, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

:::What do you mean when you say &quot;analog ground&quot;? What is the difference between a ''virtual'' and an ''analog ground''? [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 16:27, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

::::Analog ground is just &quot;normal&quot; ground, i.e. 0V. Virtual ground behaves like a [[w:nullator|nullator]] connected to ground. -[[w:User:Rogerbrent|Roger]] 16:34, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

:::::[[w:User:Rogerbrent|Roger]], I am not sure if the more abstract concept of [[w:nullator|nullator]] can help understanding the worldly virtual ground phenomenon unless you explain what a nullator actually is. Well, let's try to &quot;decode&quot; what &quot;''The inputs of an ideal opamp (with negative feedback) behave like a nullator, as they draw no current and have no voltage across them''&quot; means. Maybe, the [[w:Baron Munchhausen|Baron Munchhausen]]'s idea of [[w:bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] can help us. [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 13:05, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

==== Analog ground ====

[[w:User:Rogerbrent|Roger]], you are right. There is nothing special in the term of &quot;analog ground&quot;; it is just a piece of wire. Analog ground is nothing else than a separate wire connected to the real (ordinary, normal, common) ground and earmarked only for analog devices; another (just the same) wire is  intended only for digital devices. In this way, analog and digital grounds are two branches of the common ground. No matter whether the ground is analog, digital or just a common ground; it is a static, passive &quot;component&quot; that can't resist influences, if they are too significant or, if the ground internal resistance is too high. [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]]) 13:05, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

==== Virtual ground ====

Virtual ground is something else (excepting that it has the same zero voltage as an &quot;ordinary&quot; ground). Virtual ground is a unique worldly, technical, electricity and finally an electronics phenomenon; there is a great philosophy behind this idea, which deserves a special attention. In electronics, contrary to the &quot;static&quot; ordinary ground, virtual ground is a &quot;dynamic&quot; point whose potential is kept zero by artificial means (e.g., parallel negative feedback). For example, in the popular circuit of an inverting amplifier, an op-amp &quot;observes&quot; the virtual ground point and makes all that is possible to keep it at zero voltage (more precisely speaking, &quot;...to keep it equal to the potential of the non-inverting op-amp input...&quot;) If we &quot;blow&quot; a current into this point, the op-amp will decrease its output voltage to &quot;suck&quot; a current from the virtual ground point; if we &quot;suck&quot; a current from this point, the op-amp will increase its output voltage to &quot;blow&quot; a current to the virtual ground point.

Generally speaking, great (circuit) ideas do not depend on the specific (component) implementation (tube, transistor, op-amp, etc.). They are non-electrical; they are eternal. In order to reveal the philosophy behind circuit ideas, we have first to show to visitors (that are human beings) examples from their human routine. These analogies will serve as educational mainstays that help understanding.

That is why, I have written the lengthy introductory part of the article about virtual ground (see the old version [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_ground&amp;oldid=124521349#Non-electrical_domain:_The_.22neutralizing.22_idea]) where I have shown various situations illustrating virtual ground phenomenon. Only, someone has moved them to the end of the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_ground&amp;oldid=124935657] and finally, somebody else has removed them at all [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_ground&amp;oldid=174639170]. As I can see, in this way, the article will gradually become the initial poor and &quot;sterile&quot; page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_ground&amp;oldid=69362395].

This is the great paradox of Wikipedia: every narrow-minded and even anonymous visitor can edit and even remove frivolously and irresponsibly a text that is created by an editor having a philosophy about the phenomenon discussed. That is why, I have abandoned Wikipedia and started [[Circuit Idea|Circuit Idea]].
[[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 13:05, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

=== The philosophy behind the phenomenon ===

In the [[w:Virtual ground|Virtual ground]] wikipedia page I have just tried to reveal the secret of the phenomenon, to show that it is not a &quot;black magic&quot; but a well-known everyday occurrence. We mustn't forget we write this encyclopedia for ordinary human beings, not for computers. Human beings can easily understand abstract electronics concepts by conveying their knowledge of life to concrete circuit phenomena. For this purpose, we have first to show some typical exemplary situations from human routine that are analogous to the phenomenon discussed, then to generalize them into a philosophy behind the phenomenon (everything in this world has own philosophy) and finally, to show the concrete circuit solutions.

Special electronics sources present concrete circuit solutions; an encyclopedia has, first of all, to reveal the philosophy behind them. In the case of the phenomenon discussed here, we have first to show in the most general (non-electrical) way that, in this case: 
*if there are two opposite (positive and negative) power sources and
*they are connected each other by a resistive medium,
*a zero point (virtual ground) appears somewhere along the medium and
*the resistive medium wastes energy continuously as the carrier flows continuously.

In electronics, all the circuits with parallel negative feedback (all the op-amp inverting circuits) operate in this way.

Contrary, all the circuits with series negative feedback (all the op-amp non-inverting circuits) operate according to the opposite great phenomenon - ''bootstrapping'':
*if there are two identical (the both positive or the both negative) power sources and
*the one of the sources follows the other (no matter if they are connected each other),
*a zero difference (&quot;differential virtual ground&quot;) appears between them and
*no energy is wasted as no carrier flows.

Combine the two phenomenon and you can explain all the circuits with negative feedback.

A month ago, I tried to show, in a human-friendly manner, this truth about the great ''virtual ground'' phenomenon (it deserves that) by means of various analogies. [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 09:10, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

=== A voltage divider viewpoint === 

For me, a virtual ground can be created either by buffering (to the degree necessary) a voltage divider to provide dual rail supplies or using negative feedback to make the potential between two points zero. For the first case the explanation is as simple as the voltage divider equation, very little elaboration should be necessary. [[w:User:Rogerbrent|Roger]] 23:32, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

:You are right: the bare electrical device - the voltage divider, after a &quot;little elaboration&quot;, is the simplest circuit for creating a virtual ground. &lt;div id=&quot;move down&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Only, if we want to obtain a true zero-voltage virtual ground, we have to &quot;move&quot; down its ground by another negative power source (to &quot;pull&quot; down the lower resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Actually, this &quot;shifted&quot; voltage divider acts as a parallel voltage summer that sums two opposite (weighted) voltages according to the superposition principle:

&lt;center&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0, therefore  '''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;

:If we respect the proportion above, the output of this nice passive circuit will serve as a virtual ground; it is imperfect, &quot;static&quot;, &quot;soft&quot;, influenceable, etc. but yet it is an artificial, ''virtual ground'' because it has zero voltage potential without a direct connection to the &quot;true&quot; ground. It can serve as an analog ground but yet it is a virtual ground. Analog ground is a true, natural ground while a virtual ground is an artificial ground. Can I conclude we have come to an agreement?

:This text is very important as it dethrones a widespread misconception - that ''the virtual ground is an electronics phenomenon inherent only of op-amp inverting circuits''. Virtual ground is an electrical phenomenon; it had existed plenty of time before the ubiquitous op-amp to appear. [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 08:07, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

=== An op-amp viewpoint === 

Again, a virtual ground can be created either by buffering (to the degree necessary) a voltage divider to provide dual rail supplies or using negative feedback to make the potential between two points zero. The second case is simple too. V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = A*(V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;), let A-&gt;infinity then (V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;) must -&gt; 0 if V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; remains finite. Or just use two of the basic  negative feedback opamp assumptions: R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is infinite and V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;. [[w:User:Rogerbrent|Roger]] 23:32, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

:You have suggested using the classical viewpoint at op-amp circuits with negative feedback that has been reigning from dozens of years in electronics resources: V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = A*(V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;), let A-&gt;infinity then (V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;) must -&gt; 0 if V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; remains finite.

:The trouble of this explanation is that it does not explain anything. It works well, if you have no time for lengthy explanations (or, if you just do not like to explain circuits) but yet you would like your students (readers) to get to know something about op-amp circuit operation; then you just toss this one-line &quot;explanation&quot; to them and they will not ever bother you asking &quot;naive&quot; questions. Another example is Ohm's law. You can present it as a fraction ''a = b/c'' and then to speculate how ''a'' depends on ''b'' and ''c'' without showing that ''a'' is a flow-like, ''b'' is a pressure-like and  ''c'' is an impediment-like quantity, without speculating what causes what, how a voltage and current sources behave, what the resistor does, etc.

:But this approach fails completely, if you want readers to understand really the circuit operation. For the first time, I saw this text in 1975 when I entered the university and was trying without success to understand what an op-amp really does in this strange circuit with two resistors. What is wrong with this presentation?

:The problem is that '''there is no TIME in this V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;=A*(V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;) explanation'''. The op-amp is considered as a non-inertial, proportional device that acts momentarily (the input and the output voltage change simultaneously). Only, if you try to understand the circuit in this way (how the op-amp has achieved the equilibrium), you will get into a vicious circle. The paradox is that, in order to understand op-amp amplifying circuits, '''we have to think of the op-amp not as an amplifier but as an integrator''', as something slow, inertial and &quot;thinking&quot; that observes the virtual ground and reacts if it tries to change. The best way of understanding the op-amp behavior is to imagine that we perform its functions (i.e., applying the [[w:Synectics|synectics's]] [[w:Empathy|empathy]]). The truth about op-amp circuit operation is hidden rather in the transition time interval where the op-amp reacts to a sudden input change than in the next calm settled state when it &quot;sleeps&quot; (...to be continued...) [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 08:07, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

::I see no problem with using the differential amplifier equation to prove/explain virtual ground. If you're explaining virtual ground in the context of an opamp circuit then you should assume your audience understands how opamps operate. If they have a problem understanding it at this point, then their understanding of opamps is probably not sufficient. In which case they should go back and understand the ideal differential amplifier equation.[[w:User:Rogerbrent|Roger]] 16:17, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

=== Voltage divider versus op-amp viewpoint ===

I usually think of the two examples of virtual ground as being completely different, but if you prefer to think of them as two special cases then thats just as valid. The negative feedback case to me is the &quot;truer&quot; virtual ground since it behaves exactly like ground (within limits) and is actually at 0V. [[User:Rogerbrent|Roger]] 16:17, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

=== Is virtual ground a relative concept? === 

The divider case is a bit different since the voltage is usually not at 0V, but we simply decide to make every voltage relative to the virtual ground. So if we have a 10V supply and divided it down to 5V we could define 5V to be our new (virtual) ground and now we have a +5V, -5V supply. There isn't really any circuitry involved, it just goes back to the fact that voltages are always relative to some reference. [[w:User:Rogerbrent|Roger]] 16:17, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

:Wonderful, this is another clever trick that complements the example above. There, we have &quot;pulled&quot; down the lower resistor by another additional negative power source, in order to &quot;move&quot; down the divider's output voltage until it becomes equal to zero (a virtual ground). Here, you suggest just to abandon the true old ground and to make the existing 5V  output voltage serve as a new (virtual) ground. I think this text (especially, &quot;...voltages are always relative to some reference...) can describe very well [[w:Virtual ground#Virtual ground serving as a power ground|Fig. 4b]]. [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 18:04, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

=== A virtual ground is another ground ===

Only, I am a little confused on this arrangement... Is [[#Is virtual ground a relative concept?|this]] really a virtual ground? I'm asking this question because, when we create a virtual ground, there is a true ground as well and the two grounds have zero voltages (regarding to what?); no, they have the ''same'' voltages. Virtual ground is ''another'' ground; it is a &quot;copy&quot; of an existing true ground. In this arrangement we have only one ground. What kind of ground is it? Virtual or true? It seems that it is a true ground... [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 18:34, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

It seems, in order to say that we have a virtual ground, another (real) ground has to exist; so, virtual ground is a counterpart of a real ground. In all the circuit diagrams of the article (see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virtual_ground&amp;oldid=124521349 old version]), there is a real ground (the common point between the two power sources) and there is a virtual ground (even if it is a voltage divider's output). [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 18:47, 18 December 2007 (UTC)

=== Can a virtual ground be ''relative to itself''... ===

I think this is getting back to the problem that the term &quot;virtual ground&quot; isn't clearly defined, perhaps anywhere. I'll get back to this issue when I reply to Wtshymanski's post below. Anyway, yes, it is a virtual ground, ''relative to itself''. Relative to real ground it is +5V (i.e. there is a p.d. between real and virtual ground). Of course in your example real and virtual ground just happen to have the same voltages relative to real ground, hence no confusion. See [http://www.tangentsoft.net/elec/vgrounds.html] for examples. [[w:User:Rogerbrent|Roger]] 18:57, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

=== ...or a virtual ground can be ''relative only to an existing ground''? ===

The &quot;''relative to itself''&quot; concept sounds very intriguing and philosophical but I am not sure if I have made sense of its meaning. For now, I continue holding &quot;''relative to existing ground''&quot; concept. I have the feeling that I have finally realized what a virtual ground is and how to define the term. Here is my story about the scope of the virtual ground term; this is a tale about the evolution of a natural ground into a virtual one (we might move later this text to [[w:Talk:Ground (electricity)|Ground]] although this page is maintained by very difficult wikipedians that are not inclined to such natural discussions). [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 18:47, 18 December 2007 (UTC)

=== A tale about virtual ground evolution ===

...Voltage is a differential quantity; so, to process &quot;true&quot; voltage signals we need differential-input (-output) devices. If we want to deal with single-ended voltages (potentials) that is usually more conveniently, we need a voltage &quot;mainstay&quot; (a ''ground'') where to connect one of the device terminals and regarding to which to measure the voltages (potentials). For this purpose, we usually use one of the power source terminals as a natural, true, genuine ground; thus, we can deal with only positive or only negative voltages. If we want to have both positive and negative voltages, we use an internal power source point as a ground (for this purpose, we usually connect two or more voltage sources in series and in the same direction, see [[w:Virtual ground#Virtual ground serving as a power ground|Fig. 4a]]). If there is no such a compound power source, we create an artificial but still real ground, for example, by using the bare voltage divider (see [[w:Virtual ground#Virtual ground serving as a power ground|Fig. 4b]]). This ground is a real one simply because there isn't any other ground (more precisely speaking, there is such a point somewhere inside the source but we have no access to it). Finally, we &quot;clone&quot; the ground (no matter it is true or artificial) by making another circuit point (virtual ground) follow the ground; for this purpose, we usually make an op-amp with negative feedback do this donkeywork:)...

      <comment>moved [[Flying the disc]] to [[Flying the Disc]]: [[WB:NC]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Flying discs (including Frisbees) can be thrown in many ways. All involve spinning the disc to give it gyroscopic stability, and accelerating its mass to a certain velocity. Without spin, a disc will wobble and fall; without velocity, the disc will not go anywhere. Using these two guidelines, any number of throws are possible. Most discs are designed to create lift when thrown with the flat side up.

==Techniques==
===Right-side up===

Right-side up throws are all similar in that they react the same way to the tilt of the disc when it is released.  A disc thrown right-side up will accelerate in the direction of the low end of the disc.  A disc tilted leading-edge up will lose speed at the end of the throw and make a gentle landing; if tilted sideways (known in aeronautics terms as roll), it can curve around objects.

There is a language for describing throws that curve.  Both descriptions are relative to the direction the person is facing and intends to throw.  This axis is marked in ''red'' in the picture.

*'''Inside-out (i-o) throws''' (''green'' paths) occur when the thrower releases the disc in such a way that it initially comes towards the throwing axis (''inside-'').  However, the disc is tilted with the side closest to the body highest, which causes the disc to curve away from the thrower (''-out'').
*'''Outside-in (o-i) throws''' (''blue'' paths, sometimes also called a ''bender'') follow the opposite path.  The thrower releases the disc moving away from the throwing axis (''outside-''), but with the side of the disc closest to the body lowest.  This tilt causes the disc to bend back towards the thrower (''-in'').

====Backhand====
This is probably the most commonly learned throw, and also one of the most powerful.  There is a long windup for the throw, both in terms of path length and time.

*'''Grip:''' Fingers are curled under the disc's rim, and the thumb is placed on top of the disc to hold it in place.  The index finger may either be on the edge of the disc (to help aim), or four fingers may be tucked underneath the rim (to aid power).
&lt;table&gt;

[[Image:Frisbee-power-backhand-bottom.jpg|thumb|100px|Power Backhand Grip, Bottom View]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

*'''Throw:''' The thrower draws the throwing arm across the body to build velocity for the disc. During this movement, the arm straightens out.  As the arm becomes straight, the wrist is flicked, to impart spin.  After release, the arm usually points towards the target.

=====Variations=====
The backhand is an excellent general-purpose throw.  Several modifications have been created; some are listed here.

*'''The High Release:''' Used to get around an object (or a person), the High Release is thrown above the thrower's shoulder, mostly powered by the flick of the wrist instead of the arm and shoulder.

*'''The Air Bounce:''' By putting downward pressure on the trailing edge (back side) of the disc as it is released, this throw will sail a short distance at a low height, then &quot;bounce&quot; up into the air. This is done by pressing down with the thumb, which is on the trailing edge at the point of release.  Skilled throwers can execute this throw such that the disc travels under a parked car.

====Forehand====
This throw (also known as the ''flick'' or the ''two-finger'', or the ''side-arm'' in the UK) is a staple of the disc fan's repertoire, as well as the bread-and-butter throw of Ultimate players.  Focused in the wrist, this throw takes little time to execute.

[[Image:Frisbee-forehand-top.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Forehand Grip, Top View]]
[[Image:Frisbee-forehand-bottom.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Forehand Grip, Bottom View]]
*'''Grip:''' The index finger is extended and laid along the rim of the disc.  The middle finger is placed against the index finger for power, or pressed on the bottom of the disc pointing towards the middle for accuracy.  Varying the middle finger from these positions allows for the throwing of curves.  The edge of the disc is tucked under the thumb.  The disc is cocked back at the wrist, and the arm is extended out from the body.

*'''Throw:''' A flick of the wrist imparts spin off the middle finger as well as some forward velocity.  Some snap of the lower arm can provide additional power.  After release, your index finger should point to your target.  

Note that 90% of this throw is below the elbow, and most of that at the wrist.  A common mistake is to attempt to use the upper arm and shoulder to add power to the throw.  Usually, this results in little or no spin being imparted on the disc, which causes it to fall quickly.  It's also common for the flick of the wrist to pull the outside edge of the disc up; to compensate, hold the disc somewhat loosely, so that the outer edge hangs down slightly.  Experiment with the cocking and flicking motions to determine how best to produce a level throw.

As you learn how to throw a flick, it may help to tuck your elbow in towards your body; this is a bad habit to get into if you play Ultimate, but may assist with preventing you from using too much shoulder and arm.  As you improve, work on extending your arm out away from your body.  Advanced throwers will note that the arm and wrist action is much like a bullwhip cracking sideways; the addition of whip-like motion in your upper arm, shoulder, and even upper body (by rotating the hips) can impart more power onto your throw, but is difficult to control.

=====Variations=====
The forehand is an extraordinarily versatile throw, and can be adapted to many different situations.

*Most upside-down throws (see below) use the forehand grip and throw, and are therefore variants of the forehand to some degree.

*'''The High Release''': Used to get around an object (or a person), the High Release is thrown above the thrower's shoulder, and is completely powered by the flick of the wrist.  In order to be thrown flat so that it will travel without curving, the middle finger is pulled in to the edge of the disc with the index finger and the outer edge of the disc is rotated down, so that the disc lies at a slight angle to the line of the knuckles.

====Push Pass====
&lt;table align=right&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Frisbee-push-top.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Push Pass Grip, Top View]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Frisbee-push-bottom.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Push Pass Grip, Bottom View]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
'''The Push Pass:''' A little-used variant of the forehand, it is thrown with a grip similar to a backhand (index finger on the outer rim of the disc, thumb on top, fingers curled underneath) but is released on the forehand side.  The wrist &quot;pushes&quot; the disc forward while spin is imparted &quot;backwards&quot; by rolling the disc off the index finger.  A final flick of the index finger finishes the release.  Frequently, very little spin is actually imparted, which makes this throw tend to flutter and fall more often than not. However, with practice the thrower can add much more spin to this throw and it may become useful over short distances.  It is also useful in Ultimate as the typical form of this throw can be placed in the region between a defender's body and extended arms.

====Beach Thumber====
'''The Beach Thumber''' (also known as a Peach) is unpopular in Ultimate circles due to its unpredictable flight path and proximity of release to the thrower's body. Its primary advantage is that it can be a very hard, very accurate throw, and therefore useful for those uncomfortable with the staple throws of the game, the forehand and backhand. 
&lt;table align=right&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Frisbee-beach-top.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Beach Grip, Top View]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Frisbee-beach-bottom.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Beach Grip, Bottom View]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

*'''Grip:''' The thumber derives its name from the grip: it is thrown on the forehand side with the thumb under the rim and the rest of the hand against the outside of the disc. The arm should also be tucked against the side, and the elbow bent. Keeping the disc parallel to the ground, (any tilt and it will fall) cock your wrist back so your thumb is pointing as far back as you can.

*'''Throw:''' To release, simply flick your wrist forward.  Spin is imparted off the flat part of the thumb; power can be gained by rotating the body at the hips.  A flat release is critical to a successful thumber.  After release, the flat part of the thumb should point towards the target.

====Overhand====
'''The Overhand''' (also known as the ''waffle'', ''discus'', ''wrist-hook'', ''chicken wing'',  or ''biscuit'' in the UK) varies in popularity among ultimate players, because the alternative, the traditional forehand, allows greater sideways arm extension, useful in moving the disc around defenders. The Overhand is most useful when the disc is caught above the head and must be thrown quickly without changing grip. It is similar to the ''Hammer'' in that release typically (but not always) occurs above shoulder level, but comes with a different set of drawbacks.  This throw is often used in attempts at The Greatest.

&lt;table align=right&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Frisbee-waffle-top.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Overhand Grip, Top View]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[[Image:Frisbee-waffle-bottom.jpg|thumb|75px|left|Overhand Grip, Bottom View]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

*'''Grip:''' The fingers of the hand are spread out over the top, with the thumb under the disc and perpendicular to the rim. For greater control, extend the index finger along the rim, as in the control grip for the forehand.

*'''Throw:''' Hold your arm horizontal and behind you, then quickly bring it forward, snapping the wrist laterally as you release. Typically, release occurs at or above shoulder height, although it is possible to release at waist height or lower.  The whole body and arm can be allowed to rotate, and the forearm must move very quickly to impart enough momentum to send the disc a significant distance. For maximum power, the entire body rotates, as in the ancient discus throw seen in track and field events; for a right-hander, the torso starts leaning right, and ends leaning left. Wrist snap is especially important, as the throw has no stability without a strong spin.

The Overhand is a situationally dependent throw. It can be extremely useful in the right situation, especially when there is no time to change grip. But the fact that the thrower typically must lean in towards the defender on release hampers its effectiveness for ultimate. This throw is popular for advanced catch and freestyle, but some ultimate players deride it as the &quot;Useless&quot;, the &quot;Push Noodle&quot;, or even the &quot;Nazi Throw&quot; as when the throw is finished, the arm is in the Nazi salute.

====Duck====
'''The Duck''' (also known as a ''bear claw'', a ''duder,'' or a ''useless'') is thrown with a similar grip to the waffle, except it is the backward version of it.  While the waffle is thrown with counter-clockwise spin (for right handers), the duck is thrown with clockwise spin.  It is usually thrown with the arm out to the side or above the head.  It is called the duck due to the shape of the gripping hand during the throw, as if making a duck shadow puppet.  This throw is used in attempts at The Greatest (jumping out of bounds and throwing the frisbee back in to play while in the air).

===Upside-down===
A disc thrown upside-down has a very different flight path than one thrown right-side up.  Lift is applied towards the rounded side of the disc; if the disc is completely upside-down, the lift is now propelling the disc straight into the ground.  Thus, these throws typically have a stronger arc to them, tend to bank or roll as they fly, and are much harder to catch.  Where a right-side up throw tends to spend a considerable portion of its flight path at a catchable height, an upside-down throw tends to land abruptly at a certain point.

To facilitate discussion, the following convention is used: a disc that is level and flying right-side up is considered to be flying at 0 degrees relative to the ground (DRtG).  A disc that is level and flying upside-down is considered to be flying at 180 DRtG.  A disc that is flying exactly vertically would be at 90 DRtG, etc.

====Hammer====&lt;!--This section is linked from hammer (disambiguation)--&gt;
'''The Hammer''' is one of the more difficult throws to master, despite being gripped just like a normal forehand throw, and the throwing motion being relatively natural.  Hammers are difficult to aim well due to their high, arcing flight path, and their tendency to catch any amount of wind.

*'''Grip:''' Identical to the forehand, when throwing a hammer one grips the disc under the thumb, with the index finger extended against the underside of the disc for stability and the middle finger pressed against the inside rim to impart spin.

*'''Throw:''' Swing the throwing arm over the head, turning the disc upside-down (somewhere between 90 and 180 DRtG) and throwing it up at an angle.  The wrist flicks to impart spin off the middle finger, just like when throwing a forehand.

A hammer, when thrown properly (and in no wind) by a right-handed thrower, will arc up and to the left as it moves away from the thrower.  As it flies, the disc will roll over until it is completely upside-down (180 DRtG), falling down and to the right again.  Ideally, it should reach its target at between 135 and 180 DRtG to make catching it as easy as possible.

However, hammers are notoriously difficult to throw &quot;properly&quot;.  Common failure modes include:
* the ''Blade'' (also known as the ''Knife'' in the UK), in which the disc does not turn over at all, but instead keeps its original orientation towards the ground.  Blades tend to fall very sharply and quickly and are difficult (and often painful) to catch.  However, it can be used very effectively in low wind conditions when throwing over an obstacle, as the blade has a speed-to-catch advantage over a hammer.
* the ''Double Helix'', when the disc over-rotates past 180 DRtG.  These throws tend to float as they fall, drifting right and then left again (for a right-handed thrower) before landing flat.

A Blade can be corrected by increasing the angle of release (closer to 180 DRtG); a Double Helix can be corrected by decreasing it.  Experimenting with the angle of release should produce a happy medium which works for the individual thrower.  Angle of release will also affect the horizontal travel of a hammer, which is difficult to judge even in the lightest breeze.  The near-vertical release of the hammer makes them highly susceptible to crosswinds, blowing them well off target.  Hammers rely on spin for stability even more than most throws; a hammer thrown with insufficient spin will flop about as it flies, making the receiver's job even more difficult.

A hammer, like most throws, can be released with any amount of angle and pitch and at any strength.  A hammer released at nearly-180 DRtG and straight ahead (i.e. with a pitch close to 0) will stay mostly flat and fly directly at a receiver.  This throw is difficult to block (in Ultimate) but tends to arrive very fast and at an unpredictable angle, since it often flies like a Double Helix. Hammers are often last ditch efforts in a game of Ultimate when the thrower has reached a stall count of 8 or 9 and needs to get rid of the disc; either as a &quot;punt&quot; or &quot;hail mary&quot; to a deep in the end zone. (See also the '''Scoober''', below.)  A Blade can also be thrown intentionally; this is commonly called a Roller in disc golf, as they tend to hit the ground and roll for long distances if thrown very near 90 DRtG.

====Wheel of Death====
'''The Wheel of Death''' (also known as '''The Corkscrew''', '''The Bammer''' and '''The Bowler''') is the “backhand version” of the hammer. It is a very difficult throw to master, and not very useful. The throwing motion is nearly as unnatural as possible. The wheel of death inherits all of the limitations and challenges of the hammer, and it has a few of its own.

* '''Grip:''' Identical to the backhand

* '''Throw:''' Swing the throwing arm more over its shoulder than over the head, turning the disc upside-down (somewhere between 45 and 90 DRtG) and throwing it up at an angle.  The action is somewhat similar to bowling a cricket ball.

The wheel of death, when thrown properly (and in no wind), should fly in a path entirely similar to that of the hammer, only with left and right directions interchanged; this is, perhaps, its only advantage. The wheel of death has many more disadvantages than advantages, however. These disadvantages include:

* The rotation of the forearm required to throw a wheel of death prevents the arm from being fully extended above the body.

* The forearm's awkward position during the throw can make a release with sufficient wrist snap to keep the disc stable painful to the wrist of the thrower.

Furthermore, the wheel of death can fail in all of the ways a hammer does, plus, if any upward pressure is placed on the trailing edge of the disc, the throw will air-bounce downwards, resulting in a highly deceptive flight path and a very short pass. Due to its myriad of deficiencies, the wheel of death is not generally implemented as anything more than a curiosity.

====Scoober====
Another upside-down variant of the forehand, the '''scoober''' (also known as the &quot;Spoon pass&quot;  or ''Hiawatha'') is similar to a hammer, but thrown over the left shoulder for a right-handed thrower instead of over the head. The scoober is an advanced throw that travels in a path similar to the hammer, although it cannot be thrown as far because it relies almost exclusively on the wrist for power. The scoober can be an effective short-range (10 to 20 yards/meters) throw and is used in ultimate for breaking the mark and against zone defenses.

*'''Grip:''' Identical to a forehand or hammer. 
*'''Throw:''' Stepping towards the backhand side, hold the disc upside down and bring the throwing arm across the body.  Leading with the elbow, swing the throwing arm forward and flick the disc off the middle finger (as in a forehand), releasing the disc somewhere between 140 and 180 DRtG. The steeper the angle of release, the more similar the path of the scoober will be to that of a hammer, and thus may the double helix pattern be avoided.

A variant of this throw is termed the '''blind scoober'''.  Rather than being thrown over the left shoulder (by a right-handed thrower), a blind scoober is thrown backwards with an outstretched arm without ever looking to see where the intended receiver is.  Though rarely successful, the comedic value of the throw is unquestionable.

Other throws are also known as a scoober; these seem to vary by geography. The hammer is sometimes referred to as a scoober.

====Thumber====
The '''Thumber''' (not to be confused with the ''Beach Thumber'') is an advanced throw that is rarely used in competitive play, compared to the Hammer or standard forehand.  It has a flight path that is the mirror-image of the Hammer (arcing high and to the right for a right-handed thrower).  It can be useful when the disc needs to drop quickly and fly with an opposite helix to the Hammer.

[[Image:Frisbee-thumber-top.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Thumber Grip, Top View]]
[[Image:Frisbee-thumber-bottom.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Thumber Grip, Bottom View]]
*'''Grip:''' The thumber derives its name from the grip: the disc is held upside-down with the thumb tightly against the rim and the rest of the hand against the outside of the disc.

*'''Throw:''' Cock the arm backwards, then bring it forward and snap the wrist to impart spin.  The disc should be approximately 135 DRtG at the point of release.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Viggiano/Underhand Hammer ====
The &quot;Viggiano&quot; is a throw without much power, but it is remarkably stable, considering its aerobatic nature (because the disc ends up in a 0 DrtG orientation). Its initial flight path is similar to that of the hammer, but opposite (flipped 180 degrees) about a plane that is horizontal relative to the ground. When thrown correctly, the disc will initially fly at about 80 degrees relative to the ground, but will turn right side up in mid-flight and remain as such, flying much like a weakly-thrown backhand after the turn. The short-windup throw is useful for short-distance passes only, but is especially helpful if no one else, including a blocker, expects it. For instance, if another player is trying to block your throw, you may be able to throw the disc underneath and around his or her arms. Typically, in competitive ultimate, however, this throw seeing that it is released to close to the body is often frowned upon unelss the thrower is being marked very tightly.  It is very easy on the joints to throw.

*'''The Grip:''' The grip is identical to that of the hammer

*'''The Throw:''' Start with a straight arm rested against the side of the body, in a neutral position (the top of the disc will naturally face the side of the body). Bring the arm forward in a partial upside-down arc, keeping the arm relatively straight, and flick the wrist up prior to release to impart spin, simultaneously twisting the wrist slightly in a clockwise manner (as though one is tightening a typical-thread screw). At release, the disc should be at about 80 DrtG and waist to chest height. Alternatively, one can wind-up prior to the throw by moving the arm backward a few tens of degrees in order to impart more kinetic energy to the spin and achieve more distance.

Variation: Reverse Viggiano: This throw is similar to the Viggiano, except one starts with the top of the disc pointing away from the side of the body, with the thumb underneath and two fingers on top. Like the Viggiano, the disc will initially have a vertical orientation (about halfway between right side up and upside-down), with the top of the disc very slightly facing the sky (280 DrtG) and turn in mid-flight, flying right-side up (0 DrtG) the rest of the way. The throw is different in that one twists his or her wrist in the opposite way prior to release (i.e., counter-clockwise, as though one is loosening a typical-thread screw) and flicks his or her wrist toward the front of the body to impart spin, much in the same way a cellist flicks his or her wrist with the bow hand toward the cello while playing.

=Grünfeld Defence=

This is the classic starting position of the Grünfeld Defence, although d5 can be delayed if White has delayed e4 which typically happens if Nf3 is played at some stage.

Black plays d5 and challenges White's occupation of the center. White has a range of choices, the main one is to exchange the pawns on d5 to displace Black's pieces.

During the 1920s, European chess was in revolution, with the entry of the Nimzo-Indian Defence into mainstream opening theory. The masters of the day termed this the &quot;Modern style&quot;. Then, in 1922, a well-known master named [[w:Ernst Grünfeld|Ernst Grünfeld]] came up with a new system that started bashing the great masters of the day, including Alekhine, Kostic, Sämisch, and Colle. This came to be known as the new &quot;hypermodern&quot; style, and Grünfeld, true to hypermodern tastes, showed in pure form how the previously accepted classical dogma could be wrong, and that a pawn center could be an object of attack as well as a boon.

The main battleground of philosophies is the '''Exchange Variation''', 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3. White's pawn center gains space, but Black has excellent play along the long, dark diagonal from a1 to h8, and can eventually target d4 with moves like ...Bg7, ...Rd8, ...c5, ...Nc6, and occasionally ...Qa5. Eventually he may also bring a bishop to fianchetto on the other diagonal, targeting e4.

The more classical moves are 4.Nf3, 4.Bf4, and 4.Qb3, which are more conservative ways to fight Black's system. The pawn center still remains, but Black's counterplay is still adequate. The most positional move is 4.Bg5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page will contain proofs relating to prime numbers. Because the definitions are quite similar, proofs relating to irreducible numbers will also go on this page.
 
== Definition of Prime ==
A prime number p&gt;1 is one whose only positive divisors are 1 and p.

== Basic results ==

''Theorem:'' &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is prime and &lt;math&gt; p|ab &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; p|a &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; p|b &lt;/math&gt;. 

''Proof'':
Let's assume that &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is prime and &lt;math&gt; p|ab &lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt; p\nmid a &lt;/math&gt;. We must show that &lt;math&gt; p|b &lt;/math&gt;. 

Let's consider &lt;math&gt; \gcd(p,a) &lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is prime, this can equal &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; p\nmid a &lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt; \gcd(p,a)=1 &lt;/math&gt;. 

By the gcd-identity, &lt;math&gt; \gcd(p,a)=1=px+ay &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; x,y\in\mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt;. 

When this is multiplied by &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; we arrive at &lt;math&gt; b=pbx+aby &lt;/math&gt;. 

Because &lt;math&gt; p|p &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p|ab &lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt; p|(pbx+aby) &lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt; p|b &lt;/math&gt;, as desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Notes ==
I started the page out as best I could with one theorem and one proof. I didn't know what to call the theorem, so I called it Theorem 1 for now. I think it could be the Definition of Prime? I want to say this upfront to avoid confusion: there is a difference between prime and irreducible numbers. Irreducible numbers are numbers whose only divisors are 1 and themselves. A number &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is prime if &lt;math&gt; p|ab &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; p|a &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; p|b &lt;/math&gt;. These definitions are often confused with each other so I think something will need to be said about them. Also, the numbers in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L\!\!^{{}_{\scriptstyle \Alpha}} \!\!\!\!\!\;\; \Tau\!_{\displaystyle \Epsilon} \! \Chi}&lt;/math&gt; seem to be coming out in different sizes. Any ideas on how to fix this?  -[[User:Rekov|Rekov]] ([[User talk:Rekov|talk]]) 19:16, 21 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

I think this page might be a perfect location for the proof that not all collections of objects are sets. I don't remember exactly how this proof goes so I will think on it and post it here, so that if someone deems it worthy to go on the page they can shift it over.  -[[User:Rekov|Rekov]] ([[User talk:Rekov|talk]]) 19:28, 21 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs)''' are used to uniquely identify motor vehicles. Prior to 1980 there was not an accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers used different formats. Modern day VINs consist of 17 characters that do not include the letters I, O or Q. 

==Parts of the VIN==
Modern Vehicle Identification Number systems are based on two related standards originally issued by the ISO in 1979 and 1980, ISO 3779 and ISO 3780, respectively. Compatible but somewhat different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the European Union and the United States of America &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/49cfr565_05.html United States Federal VIN Requirements (Title 49, Chapter V, Part 565)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The VIN is composed of the following sections:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Standard
| style=&quot;width:5%&quot; | 1
| style=&quot;width:5%&quot; | 2

==Vehicle Descriptor Section==
The 4th through 9th positions in the VIN are the '''Vehicle Descriptor Section''' or '''VDS'''. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type and may include information on the platform used, the model, and the body style. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the 8th digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 Chevrolet Corvette U= 6.0L V8, E= 7.0L V8.

      <comment>/* Transliterating the numbers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">One element that is fairly consistent in VIN numbers is the use of position 9 as a '''Check digit''', compulsory for vehicles in North America and used fairly consistently even outside this rule.

If trying to validate a VIN with a check digit, first either: (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation; or (b) utilize the multiplicative property of zero in the weight to cancel it out. You should later compare the old value of the check-bit, with the new to ensure the VIN's validity.

== Overview of the process ==

An overview of the process for calculating a VIN's check digit is as follows:
# Remove all of the letters from the VIN by transliterating them with their numeric counterparts. Numerical counterparts can be found in the table below.
# Multiply this new number, the yield of the transliteration, with the assigned weight. Weights can be found in the table below.
# Sum the resulting products.
# Divide the sum of the products by 11, to find the remainder.
# If the remainder is ''10'' replace it with ''X''.

== Transliterating the numbers ==

Transliteration consists of removing all of letters and substituting them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives can be found in the following chart. ''I'', ''O'' and ''Q'' are not allowed, and can not exist in a valid VIN; for the purpose of this chart, they have been filled in with ''N/A'' (not applicable). Numerical digits use their own values.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Transliteration key:&amp;nbsp;values for VIN Decoding
|'''A''': 1 ||'''B''': 2 ||'''C''': 3 ||'''D''': 4 ||'''E''': 5 ||'''F''': 6 ||'''G''': 7 ||'''H''': 8 ||'''I''': {{n/a}}
|-
|'''J''': 1 ||'''K''': 2 ||'''L''': 3 ||'''M''': 4 ||'''N''': 5 ||'''O''': {{n/a}} ||'''P''': 7 ||'''Q''': {{n/a}} ||'''R''': 9 
|-
||||'''S''': 2 ||'''T''': 3 ||'''U''': 4 ||'''V''': 5 || '''W''': 6||'''X''': 7 ||'''Y''': 8 || '''Z''': 9
|}

''S'' is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.

== Weights used in calculation ==

The following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Position
||1||2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||10||11||12||13||14||15||16||17
|-
!Weight
||8||7||6||5||4||3||2||10||'''0'''||9||8||7||6||5||4||3||2
|}

== Worked example ==

Consider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! VIN
|| 1 || M || 8 || G || D || M || 9 || A || {{n/a}} || K || P || 0 || 4 || 2 || 7 || 8 || 8
|-
! Value
|| 1 || 4 || 8 || 7 || 4 || 4 || 9 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 7 || 0 || 4 || 2 || 7 || 8 || 8
|-
! Weight
|| 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 10 || 0 || 9 || 8 || 7 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2
|-
! Products
|| 8 || 28 || 48 || 35 || 16 || 12 || 18 || 10 || 0 || 18 || 56 || 0 || 24 || 10 || 28 || 24 || 16
|}

# The VIN's Value is calculated from the above table, this number will be used in the rest of the calculation.
# Copy over the ''weights'' from the above table.
# The ''products'' row is a result of the multiplication of the vertical columns: ''Value'' and ''Weight.''
# The products (8,28,48,35..24,16) are all added together to yield a sum of ''351''
# One of the following operations:
#* 351 % 11 = 10 (where % is a modulo operator)
#* 351 ÷ 11 = 31 10/11
#* 351 ÷ 11 = 31.9090-
# The check digit is 10, so it has been transliterated into ''X''.

With a check digit of 'X' the VIN: &lt;tt&gt;1M8GDM9A''?''KP042788&lt;/tt&gt; is written with the check bit as: &lt;tt&gt;1M8GDM9A''X''KP042788&lt;/tt&gt;.

''Straight-ones'' (seventeen consecutive '1's) will suffice the check-digit. This is because a value of one, multiplied against 89 (sum of weights), is still 89. And 89 % 11 is 1, the check digit. This is an easy way to test a vin-check algorithm.

You can also generate VIN numbers with corrected check digit at [http://www.autobaza.pl/ab/en/web/productaa0150 VIN Generator]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''model year''' is encoded in position 10 of North American VIN codes. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the year code. Note that the year code can be the calendar year in which a vehicle is built, or a model or type year allocated by the manufacturer. The year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially General Motors and Chrysler, as &quot;A&quot; (since the 17-digit VIN wasn't mandatory until 1981, and the &quot;A&quot; or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet Ford and AMC still used a zero for 1980.  Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that &quot;Y&quot; represents the year 2000. 2001 through 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 through 9, and subsequent years are encoded as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The 10th through 17th positions are used as the '''Vehicle Identifier Section''' or '''VIS'''. This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In fact, in North America, the last five digits must be numeric.

===North American Model Year===
{{main|../Model year}}
One consistent element of the VIS is character number 10, which is required (in North America) to encode the model year of the vehicle.

===North American Plant Code===
Another consistently-used element (which is compulsory in North America) is the use of the 11th character to encode the factory of manufacture of the vehicle. Although each manufacturer has their own set of plant codes, their location in the VIN is standardized.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

==[[LGBT World History]]==
Mine [[w:LGBT history]] for leads, and [[Cultural Anthropology/Marriage, Reproduction and Kinship]]. JSTOR, Google Scholar, of course. Request transwikis if applicable.

Would have to be structured as a comparative world history text?

*Content may include:
*''Western European:''
*Cretan pederasty
*Sappho
*Ancient Greece
*Ancient Rome
*Bath Houses
*World Wars and Homosexuality in Western Europe
*20th Century Riots
*Pride Parades around the world
*''North America:''
*Stonewall
*Kinsey
*Two-Spirited Indigenous Peoples of North America
*World Wars and Homosexuality in North America (ie. Migration to New York, San Fran)
*Civil Rights Movements (Persons of Colour, Feminist)
*Marriage and the 21st Century in North America
*''Africa:''
*''Eastern European:''
*''Asia and the Pacific:''

I could easily break this into separate country-specific histories, starting with Canadian. 

=[[Feminism]]=
Restructure. Book is currently structured as a history text, little to do with theory or practice. Could this book be more than a history book? Could it work like an intro to ws? All forms of oppression are connected.)</text>

'''''Rubus pensilvanicus''''' ('''Pennsylvania Blackberry''' or '''Wild Blackberry'''), is a thorny bramble native to eastern North America. 

==Description==
The canes are green at first but then turning dark red, usually ridged, with copious straight spines. The leaves are compound, usually bearing 5 or 7 leaflets. The flowers are white with large petals, bourne in mid-spring. The fruits are large aggregates of black drupelets, thich are somewhat sweet and often used for jams and jellies. 

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

'''Soapwort''' (''Saponaria officinalis'') is a common perennial plant from the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). Other common names are Bouncing Bet and Sweet William.

The Latin name is derived from the toxic substance saponin, contained in the roots. It starts producing a lather when in contact with water. The epithet ''officinalis'' indicates its medicinal functions. However, it acquired its common name through utility in cleaning.
Soapwort's native range extends throughout Europe to western Siberia. It grows in cool places at low or moderate elevations under hedgerows and along the shoulders of roadways.

In the northern hemisphere soapwort blooms from May to September, and in the southern hemisphere October to March.

==Description==
The plants possesses leafy, unbranched stems (often tinged with red) grow in patches, attaining a height of 70 cm. The broad, lanceolate, sessile leaves are opposite and between 4 and 12 cm long. It's sweetly scented flowers are radially symmetrical and pink, or sometimes white. Each of the five flat petals have two small scales in the throat of the corolla. They are about 2.5 cm wide. They are arranged in dense, terminal clusters on the main stem and its branches. The long tubular calyx has five pointed red teeth.

==Uses==
[[Image:Saponaria-officinalis-plant.jpg|thumb|left|250px|habit]]
Soapwort has various medicinal functions as an expectorant and laxative, but care should be taken when used as saponins may be toxic. An overdose can cause nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting.

Despite its toxic potential, soapwort finds culinary use as an emulsifier in the commercial preparation of tahini halva&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1560220317 Seasoning Savvy: How to Cook With Herbs, Spices, and Other Flavorings By Alice Arndt, p.215]&lt;/ref&gt; and in brewing to create beer with a good &quot;head&quot;. In India, the rhizome is used as a galactagogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purplesage.org.uk/profiles/soapwort.htm Purple Sage page on Soapwort]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Resistivity and conductivity are material properties: they apply to all examples of a certain material anywhere. They are not the same as resistance and conductance, which are properties of individual artefacts. This means that they only apply to a given object. They describe how well a material resists or conducts an electric current.

==Symbols and Units==

Resistivity is usually represented by the Greek letter rho (ρ), and is measured in Ω m. Conductivity is usually represented by the Greek letter sigma (σ), and is measured in S m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Formulae==

The formula relating resistivity (ρ) to resistance (R), cross-sectional area (A) and length (L) is:

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{RA}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

Conductivity is the reciprocal of resistivity, just as conductance (G) is the reciprocal of resistance. Hence:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sigma} = \frac{\frac{1}{G} \times A}{L} = \frac{1}{G} \times \frac{A}{L} = \frac{A}{GL}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{GL}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

You should be able to rearrange these two formulae to be able to work out resistance, conductance, cross-sectional area and length. For example, it all makes a lot more sense if we write the first formula in terms of &amp;rho;, A and L:

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\rho L}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

From this, we can see that the resistance of a lump of material is higher if it has a higher resistivity, or if it is longer. Also, if it has a larger cross-sectional area, its resistance is smaller.

==Questions==

1. The substation of the bar bus is made up of 2-inches round copper bars 20ft long.what is the resistance of each bar if resistivity is1.724×10? 

2. A pure copper wire has a radius of 0.5mm, a resistance of 1 MΩ, and is 4680 km long. What is the resistivity of copper?

3. Gold has a conductivity of 45 MS m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the resistance of a 0.01m across gold connector, 0.05m long?

4. A strand of metal is stretched to twice its original length. What is its new resistance? State your assumptions.

5. Which has the greater resistivity: a plank or a piece of sawdust, made from the same wood?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A material has a conductivity of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; S m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is its resistivity?'''

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma} = \frac{1}{10^6} = 10^{-6}\mbox{ }\Omega\mbox{ m} = 1\mbox{ }\mu\Omega\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A pure copper wire has a radius of 0.5mm, a resistance of 1 MΩ, and is 4680 km long. What is the resistivity of copper?'''

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{10^6 \times \pi \times (0.5 \times 10^{-3})^2}{4680 \times 10^3} \approx 168 \times 10^{-9} \mbox{ }\Omega\mbox{ m} = 168\mbox{ n}\Omega\mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. Gold has a conductivity of 45 MS m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the resistance of a 0.01m across gold connector, 0.05m long?'''

First, work out resistivity:

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{1}{45 \times 10^6} = 22.\bar{2} \times 10^{-9}\mbox{ }\Omega\mbox{m}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, substitute everything possible into the resistivity formula:

&lt;math&gt;22.\bar{2} \times 10^{-9} = \frac{(\pi \times (0.5 \times 0.01)^2)R}{0.05} \approx 1.57 \times 10^{-3}R&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R \approx \frac{22.\bar{2} \times 10^{-9}}{1.57 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 14.2 \times 10^{-6}\mbox{ }\Omega = 14.2\mbox{ m}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. A strand of metal is stretched to twice its original length. What is its new resistance? State your assumptions.'''

The material does not change, so resistivity is constant. Length doubles, and we know that volume must be constant.

V = AL

A = V/L

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{RA}{L} = \frac{R(\frac{V}{L})}{L} = \frac{RV}{L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R_{old} = \frac{\rho}{1} \times \frac{L^2}{V} = \frac{\rho L^2}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

When we double L, we get:

&lt;math&gt;R_{new} = \frac{\rho (2L)^2}{V} = \frac{4\rho L^2}{V} = 4 \times R_{old}&lt;/math&gt;

We are assuming that ρ and V are constant.

'''5. Which has the greater resistivity: a plank or a piece of sawdust, made from the same wood?'''

Sawdust and a plank are artefacts, not materials. Hence, they do not have a resistivity. Even if they did, they are made of the same thing, so they would have equal resistivity.

'''''Syringa vulgaris''''' ('''Lilac''' or '''Common Lilac''') is a large shrub in the olive family Oleaceae, native to the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe, where it grows on rocky hills.&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;Rushforth, K. (1999). ''Trees of Britain and Europe''. Collins ISBN 0-00-220013-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mc&gt;Med-Checklist: [http://ww2.bgbm.org/mcl/PTaxonDetail.asp?NameId=15581&amp;PTRefFK=1276 ''Syringa vulgaris'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fe&gt;Flora Europaea: [http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Syringa&amp;SPECIES_XREF=vulgaris&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK= ''Syringa vulgaris'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Common Lilac is a very common ornamental plant in gardens and parks, because of the attractive, sweet smell of its flowers. Most garden plants are cultivars with flowers varying from white to dark lilac; some have double flowers with the stamens replaced by extra petals. The cultivar 'Aurea' has yellowish foliage. The majority of garden cultivars do not exceed 4-5 m tall.&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely naturalised in western and northern Europe.&lt;ref name=blamey&gt;Blamey, M. &amp; Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). ''Flora of Britain and Northern Europe''. ISBN 0-340-40170-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It is a deciduous large shrub or small tree, growing to 6–7 m high, usually multi-stemmed, producing secondary shoots from the base or roots, with stem diameters of up to 20 cm. The bark is grey to grey-brown, smooth on young stems, longitudinally furrowed and flaking on older stems. The leaves are simple, 4–12 cm long and 3–8 cm broad, light green to glaucous, oval to cordate, with pinnate leaf venation, a mucronate apex and an entire margin. They are arranged opposite pairs or occasionally in whorls of three. The flowers have a tubular base to the corolla 6–10 mm long with an open four-lobed apex 5–8 mm across, usually lilac to mauve, occasionally white. They are arranged in a dense, terminal panicle 8-18 cm long. The fruit is a dry, smooth brown capsule, 1–2 cm long, splitting in two to release the two winged seeds.&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;&lt;ref name=blamey/&gt;

==Growing Conditions==
Common lilac does best in full sun, tolerating most soils except wet soil. Siting for morning sun and good air circulation can help reduce the occurrence of [[../Powdery Mildew|powdery mildews]], which are a major problem for this plant in humid climates.

==Varieties==
Numerous cultivars have been selected for size, flower color and form, and more recently for mildew resistance.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Uses==
Usually grown as a specimen, but also for cut flowers.

==Maintenance==
Tolerates harsh pruning, but should only be pruned immediately after (or during) flowering to ensure the next year's bloom. The shrub produces copious suckers, which may either be pruned out or encouraged. To encourage a &quot;tree-like form, remove all suckers as they emerge, or to keep size limited remove the oldest stems every year to keep the height under control.

==Propagation==
Propagate via cuttings or grafting to preserve follower color and form.

==Harvest==
Flowers hold up well in the vase if the leaves are removed.

==Pests and Diseases==

'''''Toxicodendron radicans''''' (syn. ''Rhus toxicodendron'', ''Rhus radicans''; '''Poison ivy'''&lt;ref name=feis&gt;USDA Fire Effects Information System: [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/vine/toxrad/all.html ''Toxicodendron radicans'']&lt;/ref&gt;) is a woody vine that is well known for its ability to produce urushiol, a skin irritant that causes an itching rash for most people, technically known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis.

Poison ivy is subject to frequent taxonomic reclassification and confusion; it is currently divided into eastern and western species in the genus ''[[../Toxicodendron/]]''. At least six distinct subspecies of '''''Toxicodendron radicans''''' are recognized. Complicating identification and taxonomy are the fact that the species (even a particular subspecies) can be highly variable in growth habit and leaf appearance.

It is more common now than when Europeans first entered North America. Real estate development adjacent to wild, undeveloped land has created &quot;edge effects&quot;, enabling it to form vast, lush colonies in such places. It is listed as a noxious weed in the U.S. states of Minnesota and Michigan.

==Description==
The plants can grow as a shrub up to about 1.2 meters (4 ft) tall, as a groundcover 10–25 centimeters (4–10 in) high, or as a climbing vine on various supports. Older vines on substantial supports send out lateral branches that may at first be mistaken for tree limbs.

The leaves are ternate with three almond-shaped leaflets. The berries (actually drupes) are a grayish-white color and are a favorite winter food of some birds. Hence the mnemonic,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Leaves of three, let it be; berries white, danger in sight.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another version is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Leaves of three let it be; if it's hairy, it's a berry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/735/files/transcriptmtlivermoreangelisland.pdf Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


The color ranges from light green (usually the younger leaves) to dark green (mature leaves), turning bright red in fall. The leaflets of mature leaves are somewhat shiny.The leaflets are 3-12&amp;nbsp;cm long, rarely up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm. Each leaflet has a few or no teeth along its edge, and the leaf surface is smooth. 

Leaflet clusters are alternate on the vine, and the plant has no thorns. These three characteristics: (a) clusters of three leaflets, (b) alternate, and (c) lack of thorns, are sufficient to positively identify the plant. If it is growing up the trunk of a tree, the presence of root-hairs will identify it. &lt;ref&gt;Petrides, George A. ''A Field Guide to Trees and Shrubs'' (Peterson Field Guides), Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1986, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing Conditions==
It grows throughout much of North America, including all Canadian provinces except Newfoundland (but not the territories) and all U.S. states except Alaska, and is normally found in wooded areas, especially along edge areas. It also grows in exposed rocky areas, in open fields and disturbed areas, and even in areas with wet soils. It rarely grows at altitudes above 1,500 meters (5,000 ft).

==Varieties==
Aside from the many subspecies, individual plants can vary greatly in the shape of their leaflets. 

==Confusion with other plants==
*Boxelder (''[[../Acer negundo/]]'') saplings can look almost indistinguishable from poison ivy. While Boxelder Maples often have five or seven leaflets, three leaflets are also common. The two can be differentiated by the fact that Poison-ivy has alternate leaves, while the maple has opposite leaves; in other words, by observing where the leaf stalk (the &quot;branch&quot; the three leaflets are attached to) meets the main branch. Another leaf stalk directly on the opposite side is characteristic of Boxelder Maple. If the three-leaflet leaves alternate along the main branch, it may be Poison-ivy.

*Virginia creeper (''[[../Parthenocissus quinquefolia/]]'') vines can look like poison ivy. The younger leaves can consist of three leaflets (as opposed to the usual five) but have a few more serrations along the leaf edge, and the leaf surface is somewhat wrinkled. The rootlets of a climbing Virginia creeper are paler and much stouter than the hairy roots of poison ivy, which are dark red. Virginia creeper and poison ivy grown in the same habitat and frequently co-occur, often on the same trees.

*[[../Toxicodendron vernix|Poison Sumac]] (''Toxicodendron vernix'') has compound leaves with 7–15 leaflets. Poison sumac never has only three leaflets.

* Kudzu (''[[../Pueraria lobata/]]'') is a non-toxic edible vine that scrambles extensively over lower vegetation or grows high into trees. Kudzu is an [[invasive species]] in the southern United States. Like poison ivy it has three leaflets, but the leaflets are bigger than those of poison ivy and are pubescent underneath with hairy margins.

*[[../Rubus|Blackberry and raspberry]] vines bear a passing resemblance to poison ivy, with which may share territory. The chief difference between blackberry vines and poison ivy is that blackberry vines have spines on them, whereas poison ivy is smooth. Also, the three-leaflet pattern of blackberry vine leaves changes as the plant grows: the two bottom leaves both split into two leaves, for a total of five in a cluster. They have many teeth along the leaf edge, and the top surface of their leaves is very wrinkled where the veins are, and the bottom of the leaves is light minty - greenish white, while poison ivy is all green. The stem and vine of poison ivy are brown and woody, while blackberry stems are green with thorns.

== Toxic effects ==
:''See [[../Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis/]]'' for more details about the rash, including prevention and treatment.''

The reaction caused by poison-ivy, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, is an allergic reaction. Around 15%&lt;ref&gt;http://science.howstuffworks.com/poison-ivy.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to 30%&lt;ref&gt;http://mic-ro.com/plants/&lt;/ref&gt; of people have no allergic response, but most if not all will become sensitized over time with repeated or more concentrated exposure to urushiol.

For those who are affected by urushiol, it causes a very irritating rash. In extreme cases, corticosteroids are needed to treat rashes and severe itching. The first symptom of contact is a severe itching of the skin that develops into reddish colored inflammation or non-colored bumps, and then blistering of the skin occurs. In severe cases, clear fluids ooze from open blistered sores. The urushiol poison is quickly bound to the skin after contact.

The oozing fluids released by itching blisters do not spread the poison. The appearance of a spreading rash indicates that some areas received more of the poison and reacted sooner than other areas. The blisters and oozing result from blood vessels that develop gaps and leak fluid through the skin; if the skin is cooled, the vessels constrict and leak less. If poison ivy is burned and the smoke then inhaled, this rash will appear on the lining of the lungs, causing extreme pain and possibly fatal respiratory difficulty. If poison ivy is eaten, the digestive tract, airway, kidneys or other organs can be damaged.

Understanding why new lesions may develop for two weeks (studied on forearm) after one exposure was made clear by a University of Miami scientist: Larger amounts have earliest onset and largest reaction, smaller amounts produce a delayed reaction. The overall severity &quot;progresses&quot; with the combined active lesions. Therefore, the last new lesion should occur at two weeks after last exposure, the total rash (untreated) may go on for 3-4 weeks. 

Urushiol oil can remain active for several years, so handling dead leaves or vines can cause a reaction.  In addition, oil transferred from the plant to other objects, such as pet fur or gardening tools, can cause the rash if it comes into contact with the skin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aad.org/public/Publications/pamphlets/Poison_IvyOakSumac.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are sensitive to poison-ivy can also experience a similar rash from mangoes; the skin of mangoes has a chemical compound similar to urushiol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/339/4/235 Mangos and Poison Ivy] (New England Journal of Medicine Web Article)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar reactions have been reported occasionally from contact with the related aromatic sumac or Japanese lacquer tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__[[Image:Poisonoak.jpg|thumb|233px|right|''Toxicodendron pubescens'' (&quot;Atlantic Poison-oak&quot;), one of a large number of species containing urushiol irritants.]]

'''Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis''' (also called '''Toxicodendron dermatitis''' and '''Rhus dermatitis''') is the medical name given to allergic rashes produced by oil urushiol, which is contained in various plants, including the plants of the genus ''[[../Toxicodendron/]]'' (including poison ivy, poison oak, and poison Sumac), as well as other plants in the family Anacardiaceae (mango, Rengas tree, Burmese lacquer tree, India marking nut tree, and the shell of the cashew nut), and even unrelated plants such as ''[[../Ginkgo biloba/]]''. 

Symptoms of the rash include itching, inflammation, oozing, and in severe cases a burning sensation. The American Academy of Dermatology estimates that there are up to 50 million cases of urushiol-induced dermatitis annually in the United States alone, accounting for 10% of all lost-time injuries in the United States Forest Service. Poison oak is a significant problem in the rural western and southern U.S., while poison-ivy is most rampant in the eastern U.S. Dermatitis from poison sumac is less common, but just as problematic.

==Exposure==
[[Image:URUSHIOL_BLISTERING.jpg|thumb|233px|Blistering 48 hours after urushiol contact]]
Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is contracted by contact with a plant or any other object containing urushiol oil.  Clothing or other materials that contact the plant and then, before being washed, contact the skin are common causes of exposure.  Normally, it takes about 24 hours for the rash to first appear, though it may worsen during the next few days and may appear to spread, when in fact what is happening is that areas that received a lesser dose are reacting. The rash can take one to two weeks to run its course, and in some cases up to five weeks.

Urushiol is primarily found in the spaces between plant cells beneath the outer skin of the plant, so the effects of urushiol rash are less severe if the plant tissue remains undamaged on contact.  Once the oil and resin are thoroughly washed from the skin, the rash is not contagious.  Urushiol does not spread once it has bound with the skin, and it is not found in weeping blisters. Although the rash may worsen during the first few days and may appear to spread to new areas, this is usually simply latent reaction.

Although simple skin exposure is most common, ingestion can also lead to serious, more systemic reactions.  Burning plant material is commonly said to create urushiol-laden smoke that causes systemic reaction as well as rash inside the throat and on the eyes. A high-temperature fully inflamed bonfire might incinerate the urushiol before it can cause harm, while a smoldering fire could vaporize the volatile oil and spread it as white smoke. However, some sources dispute the danger of burning urushiol-containing plant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Colour Atlas of Poisonous Plants: A Handbook for Pharmacists, Doctors, Toxicologists, and Biologists |author=Dietrich Frohne and Hans Jurgen Pfander |year=1984 |pages=291 pp. |publisher=Wolfe Publishing Ltd |isbn=0-7234-0839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Poisonivyrash.jpg|thumb|233px|Poison ivy rash after 2 days.]]
The toxic effects of urushiol are largely indirect, mediated by an induced autoimmune response. Urushiol chemically reacts with, binds to and changes the shape of cell surface proteins on exposed skin cells. Affected proteins interfere with the immune systems ability to recognize these cells as normal parts of the body. These abnormally coated cells (perhaps confused by the immune system with invading parasites) are recognized as foreign, initiating a T-cell mediated immune response. This immune response is directed towards the complex of urushiol derivatives which are bound up in the skin proteins and attacks the cells as if they were a foreign agent. The result is an allergic eczematous contact dermatitis characterized by redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and streaking. People vary greatly in their sensitivity to urushiol. In approximately 15%[http://science.howstuffworks.com/poison-ivy.htm] to 30%[http://mic-ro.com/plants/] of people urishiol does not initiate an immune system response, while at least 25% of people have very strong immune responses resulting in severe symptoms. Since the skin reaction is an allergic one, people may develop an increasingly strong reactions after repeated exposures, or show no immune response on their first exposure, but show sensitivity on following exposures.

The rash takes one to two weeks to run its course, but normally does not leave scars. Severe cases will have small (1–2 mm) clear fluid-filled blisters on the skin. Pus-filled vesicles, containing a whitish fluid, may indicate a secondary infection. Most poison ivy rashes, without infections, will self-resolve within 14 days without treatment. Excessive scratching may result in secondary infection, commonly by staphylococcal and streptococcal species. These may require the use of antibiotics.

==Treatments==
Primary treatment involves washing exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible after exposure is discovered. Soap or detergent is necessary, as urushiol is a hydrophobic (oily) substance and is not washed off by plain water. Once an outbreak has occurred topical application of cold compresses, Burow's solution, calamine lotion, antihistamines, aloe vera and hydrocortisone ointment are common home-remedies used to abate the symptoms. Oral administration of aspirin and antihistamines may provide some relief from the itch and irritation.

No vaccine has been developed to counter urushiol symptoms, so the most effective &quot;cures&quot; are generally held to be those products that physically remove the urushiol. After about 15 minutes of exposure, the urushiol is chemically bonded to the skin and can only be removed with pharmaceutical products, which vary by person in effectiveness. Two of these products, which are both [[over the counter]] drugs in the United States, are:
* Tecnu: Originally developed early in the Cold War as a treatment for radiation exposure, it was discovered later that Tecnu provided some relief for poison ivy exposure. It is a milky liquid and the main active ingredient is octylphenoxy-polyethoxyethanol. The four octyl groups of this chemical are too large to surround the non-polar molecules in the urushiol, which remains partially active and requires multiple applications. Also, the chemical makeup of the product requires that it be applied no later than eight hours after exposure to urushiol.
* Zanfel: Developed in 1999, this paste uses an ethoxylate molecule with the large octyl groups removed. This allows the molecule to &quot;wrap&quot; around the non-polar molecules of the urushiol and inactivate it. The other ingredient, sodium lauryl sarcosinate, allows the ethoxylate to form a micelle around the urushiol molecule. This creates a large molecule that contains flexible non-polar groups and soluble polar groups, allowing it to be rinsed away with water. In rigorous company-funded studies, it appears to be effective, even in cases of advanced rash.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsburg, Erika. &quot;Itching for Relief&quot;. ''Washington Post''. August 31, 2004. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47828-2004Aug30.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike Tecnu, Zanfel is effective even many days after exposure, removing the urushiol, stopping the itching, and beginning healing of the rash after only a small number of applications. It is a fairly expensive product, about $40US for a small bottle (2007 price), but cost-effective due to the degree of suffering it alleviates, in proportion to its cost. A small bottle provides many applications, so the cost per dose is relatively low.
* Tecnu Extreme: Developed in 2005, this is also a paste with surfactants and micro-fine scrubbing particles to break the bond the urushiol has with the proteins in the skin, so the urushiol can be rinsed away with water. The product contains an active ingredient, grindelia robusta, for itch relief. It is most helpful if a rash has already started, but it can also be used to remove urushiol after exposure--before the rash has broken out. 

In cases of extreme symptoms, steroids such as Prednisone are sometimes administered to attenuate the immune response.  If bacterial secondary infection of affected areas occurs, antibiotics may also be necessary.

There are many myths that deal with treating toxicodendrons such as poison ivy. Most have been discredited, but persist despite their falsehood. Some clarifications (these statements are true):

* Scrubbing with plain soap and water will remove the urushiol from skin if it is done within a few minutes of exposure, before it bonds.
* Ordinary laundering with laundry detergent will remove urushiol from most clothing, but not leather or suede.
* The fluid from the resulting blisters does '''not''' spread poison ivy to others.
* Poison ivy is '''not''' harmless when the leaves have fallen off as the toxic resin is very persistent. Every part of the plant contains urushiol, and can cause a rash with exposure at any time of the year.
* Burning any part of the poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac plants can produce a fatal systemic reaction in any person who comes in contact with the smoke, even a mile or more away in certain conditions.
* Ice, water, soap, lotions, dry cold air, do '''not''' help cure poison ivy rashes, they only soothe the itch.
* Urinating on the affected areas has '''no''' effect.

This is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Romania|Romanian]] dish, generally served during all festive and special occasions.  It comprising of a combination of finely chopped [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] and root vegetables, folded in [[Cookbook:mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] and finished with pickled vegetable [[Cookbook:garnish|garnishes]].  The name suggests a French culinary influence as the word boeuf is old French for cow and several well know French dishes such as [[Cookbook:Beef Bourguignon|Beef Bourguignon]] still use the term.  The dish is usually made up in large quantities for the whole party. It's eaten as a side dish/salad to fried meats or as an appetiser/entree.  Slight differences exist in quantities and these vary according to taste.  The recipe below is my mothers and grandmothers.  It requires a home made mayonnaise, for which a recipe is included.

==Recipe==
Serves 6-8

;Salad
:1 kg (2lb 3oz) red [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]] - boiled gently whole in skin until tender.  Skin off once cooled.
:350 grams (12oz) [[Cookbook:carrot|carrots]] - skin peeled, cut in half along width and length. Boiled until tender.
:350 grams roasting [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] - cut in half and gently boil for one hour.
:1 can of [[Cookbook:peas|peas]] or 300 grams (10.5 oz) fresh peas which must be boiled or steamed well.
:350 grams of pickled [[Cookbook:Pickle|gherkins]] - not too sweet and very firm.
;Mayonnaise
:3 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s - 2 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled]], yolks used only and one fresh [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|yolk]].
:250 ml (8.5 oz) [[Cookbook:oil|oil]], [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola]] or [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable]], nothing with flavour like olive oil.
:1 [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon - juice of]]
:1tsp (5ml) French [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]]
;Garnish
:Sliced boiled [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]], sliced gherkins, pickled [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red peppers]] and sliced [[Cookbook:olive|olives]]. All are generally sliced very thinly into long strips and organised into patterns.

==Method==
Potatoes, carrots and beef must all be [[Cookbook:cube|cubed]] in very small size, approximately 5mm (1/5 inch). Potatoes may be cubed slightly larger.  As a guide, everything but the gherkins need to be about the size of the peas.  The gherkins need to be sliced very finely and small.  Do this by cutting 3mm (1/8 inch) thick slices and then cutting them at 3mm intervals again along the length and width.  [[Cookbook:Fold|Fold]] everything in together gently.  Do not season.

Make mayonnaise by [[Cookbook:beat|beating]] the cooked egg yolks and the raw yolk until well mixed.  Slowly add the oil while beating the eggs until they start to thicken and form a mayonnaise.  Add the juice of the lemon and the mustard once you have beaten the eggs and finished the oil.

Reserve a small quantity of mayonnaise for garnish.  [[Cookbook:Fold|Fold]] the rest of the mayonnaises into the cubed  meat and vegetables, making a nice consistency where the ingredients are well covered in mayonnaise but not suspended in it.  Season with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]].  Use [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] only if you prefer.  Place the salata de boeuf into one large or several smaller bowls.  Spread reserved mayonnaise over the top and garnish with the garnishes.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Property of R. Bryant's parametrization==
If ''z'' is replaced by the negative reciprocal of its [[w:complex conjugate|complex conjugate]], &lt;math&gt; - {1 \over z^\star},&lt;/math&gt; then the functions ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''g&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''z'' are left unchanged.

===Proof===
Let ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;'' be obtained from ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' by substituting ''z'' with &lt;math&gt; - {1 \over z^\star}.&lt;/math&gt;  Then we obtain
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Im} \left( {- {1 \over z^\star} \left( 1 - {1 \over z^{\star 4} } \right) \over {1 \over z^{\star 6}} - \sqrt{5} {1 \over z^{\star 3}} - 1} \right). &lt;/math&gt;
Multiply both numerator and denominator by &lt;math&gt; z^{\star 6},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Im} \left( {-z^\star (z^{\star 4} - 1) \over 1 - \sqrt{5} z^{\star 3} - z^{\star 6} } \right).&lt;/math&gt;
Multiply both numerator and denominator by -1,
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Im} \left( {z^\star (z^{\star 4} - 1) \over z^{\star 6} + \sqrt{5} z^{\star 3} - 1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

It is generally true for any complex number ''z'' and any integral power ''n'' that
:&lt;math&gt; (z^\star)^n = (z^n)^\star,&lt;/math&gt;
therefore
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Im} \left( { z^\star (z^4 - 1)^\star \over (z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1)^\star } \right), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Im} \left( - \left( {z (1 - z^4) \over z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1} \right)^\star \right) &lt;/math&gt;
therefore &lt;math&gt; g_1' = g_1 &lt;/math&gt; since, for any [[w:complex number|complex number]] ''z'',
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Im} (-z^\star) = \mathrm{Im}(z). &lt;/math&gt;

Let ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;'' be obtained from ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' by substituting ''z'' with &lt;math&gt; - {1 \over z^\star}.&lt;/math&gt;  Then we obtain
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Re} \left( { - {1 \over z^\star} \left( 1 + {1 \over z^{\star 4}} \right) \over {1 \over z^{\star 6}} - \sqrt{5} {1 \over z^{\star 3}} - 1 } \right),&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Re} \left( { z^\star (z^{\star 4} + 1) \over z^{\star 6} + \sqrt{5} z^{\star 3} - 1 } \right), &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Re} \left( { z^\star (z^{4 \star} + 1) \over z^{6 \star} + \sqrt{5} z^{3 \star} - 1 } \right), &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Re} \left( { z^\star (z^4 + 1)^\star \over (z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1)^\star } \right), &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Re} \left( \left( { z (z^4 + 1) \over z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1} \right)^\star \right), &lt;/math&gt;
therefore &lt;math&gt; g_2' = g_2 &lt;/math&gt; since, for any complex number ''z'',
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re} (z^\star) = \mathrm{Re} (z). &lt;/math&gt;

Let ''g&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;'' be obtained from ''g&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' by substituting ''z'' with &lt;math&gt; - {1 \over z^\star}.&lt;/math&gt;  Then we obtain
:&lt;math&gt; g_3' = \mathrm{Im} \left( { 1 + {1 \over z^{\star 6}} \over {1 \over z^{\star 6}} - \sqrt{5} {1 \over z^{\star 3}} - 1} \right), &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \mathrm{Im} \left( { z^{\star 6} + 1 \over 1 - \sqrt{5} z^{\star 3} - z^{\star 6}} \right), &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \mathrm{Im} \left( { z^{6 \star} + 1 \over 1 - \sqrt{5} z^{3 \star} - z^{6 \star}} \right), &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \mathrm{Im} \left( - { (z^6 + 1)^\star \over (z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1)^\star} \right), &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = \mathrm{Im} \left( - \left( { z^6 + 1 \over z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1} \right)^\star \right), &lt;/math&gt;
therefore &lt;math&gt; g_3' = g_3.&lt;/math&gt;  [[w:Q.E.D.|Q.E.D.]]

==Symmetry of the Boy's surface==
Boy's surface has 3-fold [[w:symmetry|symmetry]].  This means that it has an axis of discrete rotational symmetry: any 120° turn about this axis will leave the surface looking exactly the same.  The Boy's surface can be cut into three mutually [[w:congruence|congruent]] pieces. 

===Proof===
Two complex-algebraic identities will be used in this proof: let ''U'' and ''V'' be complex numbers, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re}(U V) = \mathrm{Re}(U) \mathrm{Re}(V) - \mathrm{Im}(U) \mathrm{Im}(V), \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Im}(U V) = \mathrm{Re}(U) \mathrm{Im}(V) + \mathrm{Im}(U) \mathrm{Re}(V). \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Given a point ''P(z)'' on the Boy's surface with complex parameter ''z'' inside the unit disk in the [[w:complex plane|complex plane]], we will show that rotating the parameter ''z'' 120° about the [[w:Origin(mathematics)|origin]] of the complex plane is equivalent to rotating the Boy's surface 120° about the ''Z''-axis (still using R. Bryant's parametric equations given above).

Let
:&lt;math&gt; z' = z e^{i 2 \pi / 3} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
be the [[w:coordinate rotation|rotation]] of parameter ''z''.  Then the &quot;raw&quot; (unscaled) coordinates ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''g&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be converted, respectively, to ''g&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''g&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Substitute ''z&amp;prime;'' for ''z'' in ''g&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(z)'', resulting in
:&lt;math&gt; g_3'(z') = \mathrm{Im} \left( {1 + z'^6 \over z'^6 + \sqrt{5} z'^3 - 1} \right) - {1 \over 2}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_3'(z) = \mathrm{Im} \left( {1 + z^6 e^{i 4 \pi} \over z^6 e^{i 4 \pi} + \sqrt{5} z^{i 2 \pi} - 1} \right) - {1 \over 2}. &lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt; e^{i 4 \pi} = e^{i 2 \pi} = 1,&lt;/math&gt; it follows that
:&lt;math&gt; g_3' = \mathrm{Im}\left( {1 + z^6 \over z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1} \right) - {1 \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;
therefore &lt;math&gt; g_3' = g_3.&lt;/math&gt;  This means that the axis of rotational symmetry will be parallel to the ''Z''-axis.

Plug in ''z&amp;prime;'' for ''z'' in ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(z)'', resulting in
:&lt;math&gt; g_1'(z) = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Im} \left( { z e^{i 2 \pi / 3} (1 - z^4 e^{i 8 \pi / 3}) \over z^6 e^{i 4 \pi} + \sqrt{5} z^3 e^{i 2 \pi} - 1} \right). &lt;/math&gt;
Noticing that &lt;math&gt; e^{i 8 \pi / 3} = e^{i 2 \pi / 3},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Im} \left( {z e^{i 2 \pi / 3} (1 - z^4 e^{i 2 \pi / 3}) \over z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1} \right). &lt;/math&gt;
Then, letting &lt;math&gt; e^{i 4 \pi / 3} = e^{-i 2 \pi / 3} &lt;/math&gt; in the denominator yields
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Im} \left( { z (e^{i 2 \pi / 3} - z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) \over z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Now, applying the complex-algebraic identity, and letting
:&lt;math&gt; z'' = {z \over z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1} &lt;/math&gt;
we get
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(e^{i 2 \pi / 3} - z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) + \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(e^{i 2 \pi / 3} - z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;
Both &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Im}&lt;/math&gt; are [[w:distributivity|distributive]] with respect to addition, and
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re}(e^{i \theta}) = \cos \theta, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Im}(e^{i \theta}) = \sin \theta, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
due to [[w:Euler's formula|Euler's formula]], so that
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Im}(z'') \left( \cos {2 \pi \over 3} - \mathrm{Re}(z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) \right) + \mathrm{Re}(z'') \left( \sin {2 \pi \over 3} - \mathrm{Im}(z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) \right) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;
Applying the complex-algebraic identities again, and simplifying &lt;math&gt; \cos {2 \pi \over 3} &lt;/math&gt; to -1/2 and &lt;math&gt; \sin {2 \pi \over 3} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{3} / 2,&lt;/math&gt; produces
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Im}(z'') \left( -{1 \over 2} - [ \mathrm{Re}(z^4) \mathrm{Re}(e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) - \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \mathrm{Im}(e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) ] \right) + \mathrm{Re}(z'') \left( {\sqrt{3} \over 2} - [ \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \mathrm{Re}(e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) + \mathrm{Re}(z^4) \mathrm{Im} (e^{-i 2 \pi / 3})] \right) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;
Simplify constants,
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Im}(z'') \left( -{1 \over 2} - \left[ -{1 \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z^4) + {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \right] \right) + \mathrm{Re}(z'') \left( {\sqrt{3} \over 2} - \left[ -{1 \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z^4) - {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z^4) \right] \right) \right],&lt;/math&gt;
therefore
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ -{1 \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') + {1 \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) - {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) + {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') + {1 \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) + {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the complex-algebraic identity to the original ''g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' yields
:&lt;math&gt; g_1 = -{3 \over 2} [ \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(1 - z^4) + \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(1 - z^4) ], &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_1 = -{3 \over 2} [ \mathrm{Im}(z'') (1 - \mathrm{Re}(z^4)) + \mathrm{Re}(z'') (-\mathrm{Im}(z^4))], &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_1 = -{3 \over 2} [ \mathrm{Im}(z'') - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) - \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) ]. &lt;/math&gt;

Plug in ''z&amp;prime;'' for ''z'' in ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(z)'', resulting in
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Re} \left( {z e^{i 2 \pi / 3} (1 + z^4 e^{i 8 \pi / 3}) \over z^6 e^{i 4 \pi} + \sqrt{5} z^3 e^{i 2 \pi} - 1} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;
Simplify the exponents,
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Re} \left( {z e^{i 2 \pi / 3} (1 + z^4 e^{i 2 \pi / 3}) \over z^6 + \sqrt{5} z^3 - 1} \right), &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = -{3 \over 2} \mathrm{Re} ( z'' (e^{i 2 \pi / 3} + z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3})). &lt;/math&gt;

Now apply the complex-algebraic identity to ''g&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', obtaining
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(e^{i 2 \pi / 3} + z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(e^{i 2 \pi / 3} + z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;
Distribute the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to addition, and simplify constants,
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Re}(z'') \left(-{1 \over 2} + \mathrm{Re}(z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) \right) - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \left({\sqrt{3} \over 2} + \mathrm{Im}(z^4 e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) \right) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;
Apply the complex-algebraic identities again,
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Re}(z'') \left(-{1 \over 2} + \mathrm{Re}(z^4) \mathrm{Re}(e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) - \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \mathrm{Im}(e^{-i 2 \pi \over 3}) \right) - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \left({\sqrt{3} \over 2} + \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \mathrm{Re}(e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) + \mathrm{Re}(z^4) \mathrm{Im}(e^{-i 2 \pi / 3}) \right) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;
Simplify constants,
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Re}(z'') \left( -{1 \over 2} - {1 \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z^4) + {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \right) - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \left({\sqrt{3} \over 2} - {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z^4) - {1 \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \right) \right], &lt;/math&gt;
then distribute with respect to addition,
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ -{1 \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') - {1 \over 2}\mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) + {\sqrt{3}\over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) - {\sqrt{3}\over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') + {\sqrt{3}\over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) + {1 \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the complex-algebraic identity to the original ''g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' yields
:&lt;math&gt; g_2 = -{3 \over 2} \left( \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(1 + z^4) - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(1 + z^4) \right), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_2 = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Re}(z'') (1 + \mathrm{Re}(z^4)) - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \right], &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_2 = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Re}(z'') + \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The raw coordinates of the pre-rotated point are
:&lt;math&gt; g_1 = -{3 \over 2} [ \mathrm{Im}(z'') - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) - \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) ], &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_2 = -{3 \over 2} \left[ \mathrm{Re}(z'') + \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) - \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \right], &lt;/math&gt;
and the raw coordinates of the post-rotated point are
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ -{1 \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') + {1 \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) - {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) + {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') + {1 \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) + {\sqrt{3} \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) \right], &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{3 \over 2} \left[ -{1 \over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') - {1 \over 2}\mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) + {\sqrt{3}\over 2} \mathrm{Re}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) - {\sqrt{3}\over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') + {\sqrt{3}\over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Re}(z^4) + {1 \over 2} \mathrm{Im}(z'') \mathrm{Im}(z^4) \right]. &lt;/math&gt;
Comparing these four coordinates we can verify that
:&lt;math&gt; g_1' = -{1 \over 2} g_1 + {\sqrt{3} \over 2} g_2, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g_2' = -{\sqrt{3} \over 2} g_1 -{1 \over 2} g_2. &lt;/math&gt;
In matrix form, this can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} g_1' \\ g_2' \\ g_3' \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} -{1 \over 2} &amp; {\sqrt{3}\over 2} &amp; 0 \\ -{\sqrt{3}\over 2} &amp; -{1 \over 2} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} g_1 \\ g_2 \\ g_3 \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} \cos {-2 \pi \over 3} &amp; -\sin {-2 \pi \over 3} &amp; 0 \\ \sin {-2 \pi \over 3} &amp; \cos {-2 \pi \over 3} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} g_1 \\ g_2 \\ g_3 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore [[w:coordinate rotation|rotating]] ''z'' by 120° to ''z&amp;prime;'' on the complex plane is equivalent to rotating ''P(z)'' by -120° about the ''Z''-axis to ''P(z&amp;prime;)''.  This means that the Boy's surface has 3-fold symmetry, ''[[w:quod erat demonstrandum|quod erat demonstrandum]]''.

Hello, my name is Andrew Moffett, though to avoid confusion with [[User:Whiteknight|other Andrews]] on Wikibooks, you can refer to me as '''[[w:Neoptolemus|Neoptolemus]]''', or simply '''[[w:The Matrix|Neo]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Requests_for_permissions/Archive_5#Neoptolemus.C2.A0.28_talk.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0_email.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0_contribs.C2.A0.7C.C2.A0logs.29 Per User:Jomegat's comments during my sysop nomination]&lt;/ref&gt;. I am currently a freshman at [[w:Centre College|Centre College]] in Danville, Kentucky, working towards a double major in [[History]] and [[Spanish]]. When not reverting vandalism or cleaning up redirects, my edits center around books on history and foreign languages.

I invite you to look at the [[/New book list|new book list]] shown below. Let me know if you are interested in working with me on any of these ideas. Also, if by looking at my list you think I might be interested in working with you on some idea of yours, I would be grateful if you would like to share some of your ideas for future books with me as well.

==World History and Ancient History==
After looking through the book, I believe that would be the best thing to do. As you said, it would solve the scope issues. My only question is, is how we can do it. Do you want to break it down into different sections of ancient history, and make their own chapters in the World History book?[[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 00:44, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

:It looks good for the most part. I won't be able to do it right now, but I will get around to it. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 14:25, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

::Alright then. Sounds good. Let me know if you need help. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 20:22, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

==American Founding Fathers==
I made a suggestion on [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions]] for a new book called &quot;American Founding Fathers&quot; where there would be some basic information on each of the founding fathers. Would you be interested in a book like this? Let me know. Thanks. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 19:14, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

== US history ==
We would appreciate your assistance in rewriting a book about US history.  There is considerable controversy about whether to start a new book or edit the current featured book text book &quot;US History&quot;.
I have never done a textbook before. what is the process- in what way could I make it a more collaborative effort.
besides, your past efforts at writing textbooks would be very valuable for me.--[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 17:48, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
:They will probably want to bring [[AP United States History]] up to snuff rather than [[US History]] (though I'm unclear whether those texts have significantly different audiences/scopes/etc) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:01, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[w:Wikipedia:User_page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:36, 22 December 2007 (UTC)

===Example===
===Correctness===
===Analysis===
===Usage===
A breadth first search can be used to explore a database schema, in an attempt to turn it into an xml schema. This is done by naming the root table, 
and then doing a referential breadth first search . The search is both done on the refering and referred ends, so if another table refers to to the current
node being searched, than that table has a one-to-many relationship in the xml schema, otherwise it is many-to-one.

==Classical Graph Problems==

===Topological Sort===

A topological sort is an ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph such that if there is a path from v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, then v&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; appears after v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the ordering.

Given a graph G, a topological sort can be performed with the following steps.

# Find any vertex with no incoming edges and list it.
# Remove it along with its edges. (The edges should all be outgoing.)
# Repeat step 1 until there are no more vertices.

==Vowels (అచ్చులు ''atchulu'')==

Telugu has 18 vowels of which 3 are virtually phased out and hence do not have transliterations. Like other major Dravidian languages, the Telugu vowel set adds short /e/ and /o/ in addition to the long /eː/ and /oː/ of the Indo-Aryan languages.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|+Vowels
|-
! Vowel !! [[Telugu/Transliteration|Transliteration]] !! [[:wikipedia:IPA|IPA]] pronounciation !! Pronunciation of the letter (English approximation)
|-
! అ
| ''a'' || /a/ || Like ''a'' in ''approval''. It is the default vowel.
|-
! ఆ
| ''aa'' or ''A'' || /ɑː/ || Like the vowel ''a'' in ''armour'' or ''water''.
|-
! ఇ
| ''i'' || /ɪ/ || Like the vowel in ''India'' or ''tin''.
|-
! ఈ
| ''I'' or ''ee'' || /iː/ || Like the vowel in ''eat'' or ''sleep''.
|-
! ఉ
| ''u'' || /u/ || Like the vowel in ''bull'' or ''book''.
|-
! ఊ
| ''U'' or ''oo'' || /uː/ || Like ''oo'' in ''tool''.
|-
! ఋ
| ''R'' || /ru/ || Like ''ru'' in ''rude''.
|-
! ౠ
| ''Ru'' || /ruː/ || 
|-
! ఌ
| - || /lu/ || 
|-
! ౡ
| - || /luː/ || 
|-
! ఎ
| ''e'' || /e/ || Like the vowel ''a'' in ''May''.
|-
! ఏ
| ''E'' || /eː/ || Like the vowel ''a'' in ''ancient'' or ''angel''.
|-
! ఐ
| ''ai'' || /ai/ || Like ''i'' in ''fight''.
|-
! ఒ
| ''o'' || /o/ 
|-
! ఓ
| ''O'' || /oː/ || Like the vowel ''o'' in ''hole''.
|-
! ఔ 
| ''ou''&lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(depends on transliterator)&lt;/small&gt; || /au/ || Like ''ou'' in ''vouch''.
|-
! అం
| ''am'' or ''aM'' &lt;br&gt; &lt;small&gt;(depends on transliterator)&lt;/small&gt; || /oː/ || Like ''un'' (or ''an'') in ''under''  or  ''um'' in ''umbrella'' (depending on the consonant preceding it).
|-
! అః
| - || /aha/|| Like ''aha!'' used for exclamation purpose in English.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The rhotics ఋ and ౠ (originally /r/ and /rː/), like the liquids ఌ and ౡ (originally /l/ and /lː/) have now turned into the syllables /ru/, /ruː/, /lu/, /luː/ respectively. They are fast going out of currency and are no longer included in the standard Telugu school textbooks issued by the government of Andhra Pradesh, which now prefers the actual consonants with a /u/ appended (e.g. /ruʃɪ/ (monk) used to be written ఋషి but nowadays, రుషి is preferred).

==Consonants (హల్లులు ''hallulu'')==

The consonants in Telugu, followed by their IAST characters.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Consonant !! IAST character
|-
|  క  ఖ  గ  ఘ  ఙ  || '' k  kh  g  gh  ṅ ''
|-
|  చ  ఛ  జ  ఝ  ఞ  || '' c  ch  j  jh  ñ ''
|-

|-
|  ప  ఫ  బ  భ  మ  || '' p  ph  b  bh  m ''
|-

|-
|  శ  ష  స  హ  || '' ś  ṣ  s  h ''
|-
|  ళ  క్ష  ఱ   || '' ḷa  kṣa  ṛa ''
|}


The consonants correspond almost one-to-one to the set in Sanskrit, with two exceptions. One is the historical form of /r/ఱ which is now again being phased out by the current form ర. (e.g. /gurːam/ (horse) was written గుఱ్ఱం but is now written గుర్రం). The other is the retroflex lateral ళ /ɭ/.

===== Pronunciation Notes: =====

* The '''first four''' consonants in the first two rows, '''క ఖ గ ఘ''' ఙ (''k kh g gh ṅ'') and  '''చ ఛ జ ఝ''' ఞ (''c ch j jh ñ'') and all the letters in the fifth row, '''ప ఫ బ భ మ''' (''p ph b bh m'')are pronounced exactly as they are in English. In other words, a Telugu k sounds like an English &quot;k&quot; (without aspiration).
* The last (nasal) consonants of the first two rows, ఙ (''ṅ'') and ఞ(''ñ'') are almost never found written alone; they are usually conjuncted (more on conjuncts later) with another consonant in their corresponding rows, as the other nasal consonants often are.
* The third row, ట ఠ డ ఢ ణ (''ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ'') are pronounced using the retroflex version. To achieve these sounds, curl the tongue back and touch the tip to the roof of the mouth.
* The fourth row, త థ ద ధ న  (''t th d dh n'') are dental consonants and are spelled exactly like the ''t'' or ''d'' in Spanish, with the tongue touching the back of the upper teeth.
* Voiced, aspirated consonants (gh, bh, etc.) are by far the hardest sounds for the English speaker to learn how to make; however, with some practice they are not overly difficult.
* య (''y'') is very similar to its corresponding English sound.
* ర (''r,'') like most non-English &quot;r&quot; sounds, is flipped, but not rolled.
* ల (''l'') is the same as the English &quot;l&quot;.
* వ (''w (v)'') has a somewhat flexible pronunciation, depending on context and regional dialects. Sometimes it is pronounced like the English &quot;w&quot; (as in the word ''swami''), and other times it is closer to the English &quot;v&quot;. It is often pronounced somewhere in between the two sounds.
* శ(''ś'') is the same as &quot;sh&quot; in English.
* ష(''ṣ'') is also similar to &quot;sh&quot; in English, and though it is technically pronounced farther back in the mouth, functionally there is very little or no difference between the two in spoken Telugu.
* స (''s'') is the same as &quot;s&quot; in English.
* హ (''h'') is pronounced the same as &quot;h&quot; in English.
* ళ ('' ḷa '') is pronounced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth.
* క్ష ('' kṣa '') is pronounced as (ksha) ''ct'' in ''action'' or ''friction'' is pronounced in English.


Telugu is known as '''Italian of the East''' as all words in this language end with a vowel. It is ''second largest spoken'' language in INDIA. This language has typical grammar with connection mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TeluguHeader}}
It is possible to broadly define four stages in the linguistic history of the Telugu language:

==400 CE - 500 CE==
The discovery of a Brahmi label inscription reading ''Thambhaya Dhaanam'' is engraved on the soap stone reliquary datable to 2nd century BCE on Paleographical ground proves the fact that Telugu language predates the known conception in Andhra Pradesh.
Primary sources are [[:wikipedia:Prakrit|Prakrit]]/Sanskrit inscriptions found in the region, in which Telugu places and personal names are found. From this we know that the language of the people was Telugu, while the rulers, who were of the [[:wikipedia:Satavahana|Satavahana]] dynasty, spoke Prakrit. Telugu words appear in the [[:wikipedia:Prakrit|Maharashtri Prakrit]] anthology of poems (the ''Gathasaptashathi'') collected by the first century BCE Satavahana King [[:wikipedia:Hala|Hala]]. Telugu speakers were probably the oldest peoples inhabiting the land between the [[:wikipedia:Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[:wikipedia:Godavari River|Godavari]] rivers.

==500 CE - 1100 CE==
The first inscription that is entirely in Telugu corresponds to the second phase of Telugu history. This inscription dated 575 CE was found in the [[:wikipedia:Kadapa|Kadapa]] and [[:wikipedia:Kurnool|Kurnool]] district region and is attributed to the [[:wikipedia:Telugu Cholas|Renati Cholas]]. They broke with the prevailing fashion of using [[:wikipedia:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] and introduced the tradition of writing royal proclamations in the local language. During the next fifty years, Telugu inscriptions appeared in the neighboring Anantapuram and all the surrounding regions. The first available Telugu inscription in the coastal Andhra Pradesh comes from about 633 CE. Around the same time, the Chalukya kings of Telangana also started using Telugu for inscriptions.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Telugu was most exposed to the influence of Sanskrit, as opposed to Prakrit, during this period. This period mainly corresponded to the advent of literature in Telugu. This literature was initially found in inscriptions and poetry in the courts of the rulers, and later in written works such as [[Nannayya]]'s [[Mahabharata|''Mahabharatam'']] (1022 CE).&lt;ref name = &quot;APOnline&quot;/&gt; During the time of Nannayya, the literary language diverged from the popular language. This was also a period of phonetic changes in the spoken language.

==1100 CE - 1400 CE==
The third phase is marked by further stylization and sophistication of the literary language. Ketana (thirteenth century) in fact prohibited the use of spoken words in poetic works.&lt;ref name = &quot;APOnline&quot;/&gt; This period also saw the beginning of [[Muslim]] rule in the [[Telangana]] region.

During this period the separation of [[Telugu script]] from the common [[Telugu-Kannada script]] took place. [[Tikkana]] wrote his works in this script.

==1400 CE - 1900 CE==
During the fourth phase, Telugu underwent a great deal of change (as did other Indian languages), progressing from [[medieval]] to modern. The language of the Telangana region started to split into a distinct dialect due to Muslim influence: [[Sultanate]] rule under the [[Tughlaq]] dynasty had been established earlier in the northern Deccan during the fourteenth century. South of the [[Godavari River|Godavari]] river ([[Rayalaseema]] region), however, the [[Vijayanagara empire]] gained dominance from 1336 till the late 1600s, reaching its peak during the rule of [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the sixteenth century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered to be its [[golden age]].&lt;ref name = &quot;APOnline&quot;/&gt;''Padakavithapithamaha'', [[Annamayya]], contributed many ''atcha'' (pristine) Telugu ''Padaalu'' to this great language. In the latter half of the seventeenth century, Muslim rule extended further south, culminating in the establishment of the princely state of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] by the [[Asaf Jah]] dynasty in 1724. This heralded an era of [[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Arabic]] influence on the Telugu language, especially among the people of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. The effect is also felt in the prose of the early 19th century, as in the ''Kaifiyats''.&lt;ref name = &quot;APOnline&quot;/&gt;

==1900 CE to date==
The period of the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries saw the influence of the [[English language]] and modern communication/printing press as an effect of the [[British Raj|British rule]], especially in the areas that were part of the [[Madras]] Presidency. Literature from this time had a mix of classical and modern traditions and included works by scholars like Kandukuri Viresalingam and Panuganti Lakshminarasimha Rao.&lt;ref name = &quot;APOnline&quot;/&gt;

Since the 1940s, what was considered an elite literary form of the Telugu language has now spread to the common people with the introduction of [[mass media]] like [[television]], [[radio]] and [[newspapers]]. This form of the language is also taught in schools as a standard. In the current decade the Telugu language, like other Indian languages, has undergone [[globalization]] due to the increasing settlement of Telugu-speaking people abroad. Modern Telugu [[movies]], although still retaining their dramatic quality, are linguistically separate from post-[[Indian Independence Movement|Independence]] films.

At present, a committee of scholars have approved a [[Classical language#Classical languages of India|classical language]] tag for Telugu based on its antiquity. A final notification from the Government of India is awaited.&lt;ref name=&quot;classical&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Aug92008/scroll2008080983598.asp?section=frontpagenews|title=Classical tag recommended for Kannada|work=Online webpage of The Deccan Herald|publisher=Deccan Herald|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telugu literature can be broadly discussed in to six ages as mentioned below:

#	Pre-Nannaya period (up to 1000 A.D.)
#	Age of Puranas (1000 A.D. - 1400 A.D.)
#	Age of Poet Srinatha (1400 A.D. – 1500 A.D.)
#	Age of Prabandhas (1500 A.D. -1600 A.D.) 
#	Southern Region period (1600 A.D. -1800 A.D.)
#	Modern Age (1800 A.D. – Till date)

During the age of Pre-Nannaya period, there were only inscriptions since 575 A.D. Nannayya Bhattaraka (11th Century A.D.) translated the Sanskrit Mahabharata into Telugu and this can be quoted as the first best citation of Telugu literature. The diction was highly mastered by Nannaya that many historians’ school of thought says that there might have been earlier works in Telugu, which base his major work. 

Tikkanamatyulu (13th century) and Yerrana also called Yerrapragada (14th century) resumed the translation of the remaining portions of Mahabharata started by Adi Kavi Nannaya Bhattaraka.
  
In the age of Srinatha Kavi Sarvabhowma (popular poet in 14th century) few poets translated Sanskrit slokas and dramas and others came out with native narrative poems. The popular Telugu literary form, Prabandha was evolved during this period. 

The first Ramayana in Telugu is reffred as the Ranganatha Ramayanam, works done by by Gona Buddha Reddi. Later, the memorable religious poets such as Potan (14th Century), Jakkana (14th century) and Gaurana (first half of the 15th century) have done greatest works in these roots. 

Golden period of Telugu literature was in between 16th - 17th centuries when Sri Krishnadevaraya has shown interest in Telugu Literature. Manucharitra by Peddana is another outstanding Mahakavya other than Sri Krishna Devaraya’s Amukthamalyada. As the Telugu literature flourished in the south in the Samsthanas like Madurai, Tanjavur etc., which renamed this age as `Southern Period'. 

Mughals conquered Deccan in 1687 A.D., with which the Telugu Literature lost its speciality growth. The period of transition emerged after a long gap of 200 years, when a memorable Europeans, C.P.Brown played an important role in the development of Telugu language and literature. Later the Telugu Literature was also influenced by the European literary forms such as novels, short stories, dramas etc. 

Kandukuri Viresalingam Pantulu, the father of modern Telugu literature inspired by the Vicar of Wakefield wrote a novel called Rajasekhara Charitamu. He was the first and the greatest among modern times, who used literature to suppress social evils and superstitions. The age was followed by other famous Telugu writers such as Rayaprolu Subba Rao, Gurazada Appa Rao, Viswanatha Satyanarayana, Jashuva, Devulapalli Krishna Sastry, Sri Sri, Puttaparty Narayana Charyulu and many others.

'''''Wisteria sinensis''''' ('''Chinese Wisteria''') is a woody, deciduous, perennial climbing vine, native to China in the provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Yunnan. While this plant is a climbing vine, it can be trained into a tree-like shape, usually with a wavy trunk and a flattened top. It was introduced from China to Europe and North America in 1816 and has secured a place as one of the most popular flowering vines for home gardens due to its flowering habit. It has however become an invasive species in some areas of the eastern United States where the climate closely matches that of China.

All parts of the plant contain a glycoside called wisterin which is toxic and if ingested and may cause nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, and diarrhea. Wisterias have caused poisoning in children of many countries, producing mild to severe gastroenteritis.

==Description==
It can grow 20-30 m long over supporting trees by counter-clockwise-twining stems. The leaves are shiny, green, pinnately compound, 10-30 cm in length, with 9-13 oblong leaflets that are each 2-6 cm long. The flowers are white, violet, or blue, produced on 15-20 cm racemes in spring, usually reaching their peak in mid-May. The flowers on each raceme open simultaneously before the foliage has expanded, and have a distinctive fragrance similar to that of grapes. Though it has shorter racemes than Wisteria floribunda (Japanese Wisteria), it often has a higher quantity of racemes. The fruit is a flattened, brown, velvety, bean-like pod 5-10 cm long with thick disk-like seeds around 1 cm in diameter spaced evenly inside; they mature in summer and crack and twist open to release the seeds; the empty pods often persist until winter. However seed production is often low, and most regenerative growth occurs through layering and suckering. 

==Growing Conditions==
It is hardy in USDA plant hardiness zones 5-9, and prefers moist soils. It is considered shade tolerant, but will flower only when exposed to partial or full sun. It will also flower only after passing from juvenile to adult stage, a transition that may take many years. It can live for over 100 years.

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==

&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

Generally Wisterias are propagated with cuttings (hardwood).
But it can be possible to make use of their seeds(in their flowers)
but takes more time to have a real tree!
In some articles the softwood cutting is also recommended but I checked
it doesen't work well.
Because the herbaceous (soft)stem will rot (within a few days) before rooting!

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term ''osculating plane'', which was first used by Tinseau in 1780, of a curve C parametrized by a function '''f'''(t) at a point '''f'''(a) is the plane that is approached when it is spanned by two vectors '''f'''(x)-'''f'''(a) and '''f'''(y)-'''f'''(a) when x and y both approach a.

First, assume that the curve C is at least of class 2.

Then consider the points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x+h_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x+h_2&lt;/math&gt; and consider the points &lt;math&gt;P=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_1=f(x+h_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P_2=f(x+h_2)&lt;/math&gt;. The segments &lt;math&gt;PP_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;PP_2&lt;/math&gt; are the vectors &lt;math&gt;s_i=f(x+h_i)-f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. If these vectors are linearly independent, then they span a plane.

We can divide each of those vectors by &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that the plane is also spanned by the vectors &lt;math&gt;a_i=\frac{s_i}{h_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can also replace the second vector by &lt;math&gt;b=\frac{2(a_2-a_1)}{h_2-h_1}&lt;/math&gt; and it is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and w span the same plane as the original vectors.

Using Taylor's formula, we get

&lt;math&gt;f(x+h_i)-f(x)=h_if'(x)+\frac{h_i}{2!}f''(x)+o(h_i^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

This indicates that &lt;math&gt;a_1=f'(x)+\frac{h_1}{2}f''(x)+o(h_1)&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;b=f''(x)+o(1)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, as both &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt; approach 0, &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; approaches f'(x) and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; approaches f''(x). The osculating plane is consequently spanned by f'(x) and f''(x), and consequently contains the tangent line.

Consider the position vector &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; of any point on the osculating plane.

Then it is obvious that the following scalar triple product is equal to 0:

&lt;math&gt;|(x_1-f(x))f'(x)f''(x)|=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The intersection of the osculating plane and the normal plane is called the principal normal line.

If it happens to be the case that f'(x) and f''(x) are linearly dependent, then we can consider every plane containing the tangent line to be the osculating plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Common Lisp is a '''high-level''' programming language with '''automatic storage management''' (aka '''garbage collection''').
* Common Lisp is a '''multi-paradigm''' language. It allows you to write programs in the procedural/imperative, functional/applicative and object-oriented styles. These styles may be freely mixed in a Common Lisp program.  This allows you to choose the approach and paradigm according to your application domain.
* Common Lisp is written in a '''fully-parenthesized, prefix notation'''. This means that applying the function ''func'' to arguments ''x'' and &quot;hello&quot; is written &lt;tt&gt;(func x &quot;hello&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt; rather than the more conventional &lt;tt&gt;func(x, &quot;hello&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;. This might make the syntax harder to learn if you are accustomed to other languages, but after some practice it becomes quite natural. It also makes macros possible.
* '''Macros''' allow you to extend the Lisp syntax. They can be used to define new keywords. Common Lisp macros are '''much''' more powerful than (for example) C macros: Lisp macros are code generating programs in their own right. 	
* Common Lisp has an '''interactive top-level'''. Most implementations allow you to type in programs at a prompt as well as loading them from a file, allowing '''explorative programming'''. The prompt can also be used for interactive debugging.
* Common Lisp allows '''incremental compilation'''. Most implementations have a compiler (either native-code or bytecode) as well as an interactive top-level. Compiled and interpreted code may be freely mixed.
* Common Lisp can provide '''high performance''' (but this is highly dependent on the implementation). Some implementations can compete with C/C++ compilers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Let V be a vector space over a field F. Choose n vectors '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' from the vector space V. The '''linear manifold''' spanned by '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' is defined to be all elements of V of the form a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''+a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''+a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''+...+a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' where a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are all elements of the field F, and shall be denoted S('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''). This is obviously a linear subspace of the vector space V. Since every linear subspace of V contains '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' and their linear combinations, S('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the smallest subspace containing '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

==Theorem==
If '''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' are elements of S('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''), then S('''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''') is contained within S('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''')
===Proof===
All linear combinations of vectors which belong to a linear manifold also belong in the linear manifold (since a linear combination of linear combinations of vectors is also a linear combination of those vectors), and since any element of S('''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a linear combinations of vectors within the manifold, it too is within the set, thus proving that S('''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''') is contained within S('''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''').

==Theorem==
If '''x''' is linearly dependent on other vectors upon other vectors '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''', then it belongs to S('''x''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''') also
===Proof===
'''x''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' all belong to S('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''), then S('''x''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''') must be contained within S('''x''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''). Therefore, if x is linearly dependent upon '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''', then S('''x''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''') is equal to S('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''').

==Theorem==
The maximum number of linearly independent vectors of a set of vectors is equal to the dimension of the span of the set.
===Proof===
Suppose that there are ''d'' linearly independent vectors among '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' with all other vectors being a linear combination of those ''d'' linearly independent vectors. This number ''d'' is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors among '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''. Then any element of S('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''') must be a linear combination of those ''d'' linearly independent vectors, so they form a basis, and so ''d'' is the dimension of S('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''), which is equal to the maximum number of linearly independent vectors among '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', ..., '''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gene expression is basically the control of the cell over which genes to make and which not to make at a specific time. Now why would a cell want to do this? The example we'll use to explore prokaryotic gene expression is the lac operon. The lac operon controls the transcription of genes to make an enzyme to catalyze lactose. It turns lactose into glucose and galactose, the glucose is used in cell respiration to make energy for the cell. The cell takes lactose from the environment and catalyzes it. But if there is already glucose in the environment whats the point of taking lactose when it requires an extra step to make it useful? The cell takes actions to conserve energy and protein by not making the enzyme required for lactose metabolism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the last couple of years, the LEGO company has developed a few software packages to improve its consumer's experience with LEGO. Some of these software packages are required to program certain LEGO robotics kits (Mindstorms etc).

==Lego Digital Designer (LDD)==
Lego Digital Designer is a free software download available at Lego.com. LDD is mainly used to virtually construct and animate your own home-made models and create a set of printable instructions for your model. After your model is completed, you can check the price of your model if you wish to buy the pieces required to construct it, as well as uploading it onto LEGO factory for other lego fans to see.

==Lego Mindstorms NXT/NXT-G==
Lego Mindstorms NXT/NXT-G is a software package that comes with the Lego Mindstorms kit. It can also be bought from the Lego store. You can use this software to program your Mindstorms creation with an easy drag and drop, no programming skills needed interface.

==Other Software==
There are many other unofficial software packages available for download on the internet. Some of these softwares alow the user to program the NXT beyond using the official software package by using NBC (NXT Byte Codes), NQC (Not Quite C) and many other programming languages (C++, Java etc).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Waves, basic ==
The distance between successive crests in the waves in the ocean is 7.5 m.  The crests travel 12 m in 4.0 s.  What is the frequency of a buoy bobbing up and down in this water?
=== Solution ===
First, we calculate the velocity of water wave:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t} = \frac{12~\mathrm{m}}{4.0~\mathrm{s}} = 3.0~\mathrm{m/s}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
We are given information about wavelength, so we can solve the problem using the following relationship between velocity, wavelength, and frequency:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{3.0~\mathrm{m/s}}{7.5~\mathrm{m}} = 0.40~\mathrm{Hz}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Power Functions (PF) are a LEGO Product that allows the user to motorize their design. Unlike the NXT (See LEGO Mindstorms), the Power functions range cannot be programmed and does not have any sensors. The Power Functions equipment includes:
----
'''Large Motor''' - A motor smaller than the Mindstorms Servo Motor, but equally as powerful.

'''Medium Motor''' - A motor slightly smaller and less powerful than the Large Motor

'''Battery Pack''' - Requires six AA batteries. Powers the Power Functions

'''IR Receiver''' - Picks up Infra-Red signals from the remote, has 4 channels

'''IR Transmitter Remote''' - Allows the user to control their model via Infra-Red. Has 4 channels

'''Sound Block''' - Acts like a Touch Sensor only plays a sound when triggered. Included with the LEGO CREATOR Dinosaur.
----

''' Lights''' - 2x LED lights connected together by a &quot;y&quot; shaped wire  - gives your model lights ^^

''' Switch''' - enables forward/off/reverse control of a motor ^^

^^ = available in LEGO kit 8293 - supplementary motor kit

===Electric field superposition principle   ===

1. In words, and by equation, state the principle of superposition for electric fields. 
[[Image:Campo electrico varias cargas punto.PNG|thumb|right|260px|Figure illustrating superposition principle.]]

In physics, the electric field superposition principle postulates that, for all linear systems, the net response at a given place and time caused by two or more charges is the sum of the responses which would have been caused by each charge individually. 

Mathematically that can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec E=\vec E_1+\vec E_2+\vec E_3+...+\vec E_n=\sum_{i=1}^n\vec E_i=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}\vec {u_r}_i&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this is a vector equation. Hence one must add the components using vector rules.

==Finding the electric field associated with a dipole== 
1. An electric dipole is matched, equal but opposite, charges separated by a fixed distance.  Find the electric field associated with an electric dipole. Perform this for three cases:
:a. Find the electric field perpendicular to the axis between dipole charges. Find the far field approximation. 
:b. Find the electric field along the axis of the dipole charges. Compare the far field approximation for this case with that of a) above.  
:c. Find the electric field perpendicular in a plane which includes the dipole charges

[[Image:Water-elpot-transparent-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|A [[w:water molecule]]. A molecule of water has an electric moment because of the unequal sharing of its electrons in a &quot;bent&quot; structure. A separation of charge is present with  negative charge in the middle (red shade), and  positive charge at the ends (blue shade).]]

In physics, the '''electric dipole moment''' is a measure of the separation of positive and negative electrical charges in a system of charges, that is, a measure of the charge system's overall [[w:Chemical polarity|polarity]]. It is important in understanding practical matters like the construction of a capacitor.

===Finding the electric field perpendicular to the axis between dipole charges=== 
[[File:dipolo1.png|thumb|left|250px|Figure 1: An electric dipole]]
To determine the electric field which result from the dipole charges in Figure 1 that are separated by a distance 2a, we simply sum the fields from each charge individually. Note that the fields are vectors.  

:&lt;math&gt;{\vec E}={\vec E_1}+{\vec E_2}&lt;/math&gt;


The distance of each charge (r) from the point where the electric field is measured is:

:&lt;math&gt; r =\sqrt{a^2+x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude of the electric field (E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) due to the first charge (q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and the magnitude of the electric field (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) due to the second charge (q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are the same although the directions are different. 

&lt;math&gt;E_1 = E_2 =  \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} =  \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{a^2+x^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The components of the electric field along the x axis &lt;math&gt;E_{1_x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2_x}&lt;/math&gt; have the same magnitude but opposite directions and cancel each other out.  


:&lt;math&gt;E_{1_x} + E_{2_x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;   


As a result of this the horizontal components of the electric field vectors cancelling is that summing &lt;math&gt;{\vec E_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\vec E_2}&lt;/math&gt; reduces to summing &lt;math&gt;E_{1_y}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2_y}&lt;/math&gt;. Further, the magnitude of the vertical components are identical, &lt;math&gt;E_{1_y}=E_{2_y}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \frac {adjacent} {hypotenuse} &lt;/math&gt; finding the vertical component reduces to:


:&lt;math&gt;E_{1_y} = E_{2_y} = E_1 \cos\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  or :&lt;math&gt;E_y = 2E_1 \cos\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

But we also know that: 

&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \frac {a}{\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

So we can substitute this into the equation for &lt;math&gt;E\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which yields: 

&lt;math&gt;E = 2E_1 \cos\theta\,\! = \frac{2}{4\pi \epsilon_o}\frac{q}{a^2+x^2}\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}} =\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_o}\frac{2aq}{(a^2+x^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} &lt;/math&gt;

In the region distant from the dipole x is much greater than a (x&gt;&gt;a). This is commonly referred to as the &quot;far field&quot; region. We can find how the field behaves in the far field region by factoring out x.

&lt;math&gt;E =\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_o}\frac{2qa}{(a^2+x^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} =\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_o}{\frac {2qa}{x^3}}\frac{1}{(1+{(\frac {a}{x})}^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}  &lt;/math&gt;

By inspection we can conclude that when x&gt;&gt;a then this approaches

&lt;math&gt;E \approx \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_o}\frac{2qa}{x^3} &lt;/math&gt;


An important question for some analyses might be: over what range is the far field approximation valid? We can find out by using a binomial expansion (review of binomial expansion immediately below this section if you need it). 

&lt;math&gt;E =\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_o}\frac{2qa}{(a^2+x^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} =\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_o}{\frac {2qa}{x^3}}\frac{1}{(1+{(\frac {a}{x})}^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}  &lt;/math&gt;

Where we will expand 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1+{(\frac {a}{x})}^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= (1+{(\frac {a}{x})}^2)^{-\frac{3}{2}} = 1 -\frac{3}{2} {(\frac {a}{x})}^2 + ... &lt;/math&gt;

If you want to use the approximation only when it introduces an error less than 1%, then - since the first term is unity, you want the second term to be less than 1/100th of unity, or: 


:&lt;math&gt;  \frac {1}{100} &gt; \frac{3}{2} {\left (\frac {a}{x} \right )}^2  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac {2}{300} &gt; { \left(\frac {a}{x} \right)}^2  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  \sqrt {\frac {2}{300}} &gt; {\left (\frac {a}{x} \right )}  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x &gt; \sqrt {150} \cdot a &lt;/math&gt;

So if x is 12.3 times larger than a, this approximation is valid within 1%. 

====Binomial expansion review====
Review of the binomial expansion: 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ (1 + a)^n} =  1 + \frac {n}{1!} \cdot a + \frac {n(n-1)}{2!} \cdot a^2 +  \frac {n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!} \cdot a^3 + ...&lt;/math&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ (1 + a)^{- \frac {3}{2} }} =  1 + \frac {1}{1!} \cdot \frac {-3}{2} \cdot a + \frac {1}{2!} \cdot \frac {-3}{2} \cdot \frac {-5}{2} \cdot a^2 +  \frac {1}{3!} \cdot \frac {-3}{2} \cdot \frac {-5}{2} \cdot \frac {-7}{2} \cdot a^3 + ...&lt;/math&gt;

===Finding the electric field along the axis formed by dipole charges===
[[Image:ejedipolo1.PNG|thumb|right|300px| Figure 2 - the layout for calculating the electric field along the line through the dipole charges.]]

The net electric field is the sum of the contributions to the electric field from the dipole charges. 

&lt;math&gt;{\vec E}={\vec E_1}+{\vec E_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The first thing one always should do when solving a problem is to consider what you know by simple inspection. In this case the magnitude and layout of the charges tells use several things. Since they are equal and we know that the electric field from a point charge  falls off as 1 over r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; then we know that the nearest charge will always dominate. Further we also know that along the axis that we're calculating the electric field there will be no vertical component of the electric field. 

&lt;math&gt;E_{1_y}= E_{2_y}=0&lt;/math&gt;


So now we will calculate the magnitude of the electric field from each in the x direction: &lt;math&gt;E_{1_x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2_x}&lt;/math&gt;.
 

&lt;math&gt;E_1 =  \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{{(r-a)}^2}\qquad\qquad E_2 =  \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{-q}{{(r + a)}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Adding the vector magnitudes &lt;math&gt;E_{1_x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2_x}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;E=E_{1_x} + E_{1_x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And substituting in the equations above yields: 


&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{{(r-a)}^2} + \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{-q}{{(r + a)}^2}= \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\left [ \frac{q}{{(r-a)}^2}- \frac{q}{{(r + a)}^2}\right ]=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\ 4aq\ \frac{r}{{(r^2 - a^2)}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity 2qa is defined as the dipole moment (p) and so we can substitute:

&lt;math&gt;p=2qa\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 


With that substitution we now get: 


&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{pr}{{(r^2 - a^2)}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the far field case (i.e., the case where &lt;math&gt;r\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;math&gt;a\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) 

Then one can see that &lt;math&gt;r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;math&gt;a^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;r^2 - a^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, which allows us to simplify the equation in the far field. 

&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{p}{r^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that one can use the binomial theorem just as in the section above to find out where this far field approximation (x&gt;&gt;a) is valid.

===Finding the electric field associated with a dipole anywhere on a plane===
Now that you've solved for two special cases and determined that the dipole field falls off as &lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {r^3} &lt;/math&gt; at great distances (referred to as the far field), it is instructive to find the field's behavior off the axis.

Consider the case of an electric dipole's field at a point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  with the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as represented in the figure. Note that we can represent the coordinates either as Cartesian, or as cylindrical. 

[[Image:ejedipolo.PNG|thumb|260px|dipole field in a plane.]]


:&lt;math&gt;r_1=\sqrt{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}\quad\cos\alpha=\frac{y+a}{\sqrt{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}}\quad\sin\alpha=\frac{x}{\sqrt{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;r_2=\sqrt{{(y-a)}^2+x^2}\quad\cos\beta=\frac{y-a}{\sqrt{{(y-a)}^2+x^2}}\quad\sin\beta=\frac{x}{\sqrt{{(y-a)}^2+x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


In Cartesian coordinates the electric field at any point in the plane from each charge can be found as follows: 


:&lt;math&gt;{E_r}_1= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}\quad{E_r}_2= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-q}{{(y-a)}^2+x^2}&lt;/math&gt;


We can apply the principle of superposition and add the fields from each of the charges, remembering that they are vectors so that the vertical components add to vertical and horizontal add to horizontal. 

First finding the horizontal coordinates labeled as &lt;math&gt;E_x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;:


:&lt;math&gt;{{E_r}_1}_x= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{+q}{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}\cos\alpha=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{+q}{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}\frac{y+a}{\sqrt{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{+q(y+a)}{{\left [ {(y+a)}^2+x^2\right ]}^{\frac{3}{2}}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
{{E_r}_2}_x= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-q}{{(y-a)}^2+x^2}\cos\beta=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-q}{{(y-a)}^2+x^2}\frac{y-a}{\sqrt{{y-a)}^2+x^2}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-q(y-a)}{{\left [ {(y-a)}^2+x^2\right ]}^{\frac{3}{2}}} &lt;/math&gt;


Next finding the vertical components for each of the two charges labeled as &lt;math&gt;E_y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we obtain:



:&lt;math&gt;{{E_r}_1}_y= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}\sin\alpha=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}\frac{x}{\sqrt{{(y+a)}^2+x^2}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{qx}{{\left [ {(y+a)}^2+x^2\right ]}^{\frac{3}{2}}} 
&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;
{{E_r}_2}_y= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-q}{{(y-a)}^2+x^2}\sin\beta=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-q}{{(y-a)}^2+x^2}\frac{x}{\sqrt{{y-a)}^2+x^2}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{-qx}{{\left [ {(y-a)}^2+x^2\right ]}^{\frac{3}{2}}} &lt;/math&gt;



Summing the horizontal components yields: 


:&lt;math&gt;E_x=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}q \left \lbrack \frac{y+a} {{\left [{(y+a)}^2+x^2 \right ] }^{\frac{3}{2}}}-\frac{y-a} {{\left [{(y-a)}^2+x^2 \right ] }^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right \rbrack 
=\frac{2qa}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left \lbrack \frac{1} {{\left [{(y+a)}^2+x^2 \right ] }^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right \rbrack 
&lt;/math&gt;


And for large r (either large x, large y, or their combination) this becomes: 

:&lt;math&gt;E_x=\frac{qa}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{r^3} 
&lt;/math&gt;


Summing the vertical components yields: 


:&lt;math&gt;E_y=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}q \left \lbrack \frac{x} {{\left [{(y+a)}^2+x^2 \right ] }^{\frac{3}{2}}}-\frac{x} {{\left [{(y-a)}^2+x^2 \right ] }^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right \rbrack 
&lt;/math&gt;

==Finding the electric field associated with an electric quadrupole ==
[[File:Cuadrupolo electrico.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Figure 3 - one form of electric quadrupole]]

The electric field measured at point along the vertical axis due to any single charge along the horizontal axis (shown in Figure 3) is: 

:&lt;math&gt;E_q=\frac {q}{4\pi \epsilon_o r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

So the center charges contribute: 

:&lt;math&gt;E_{2q}=\frac {2q}{4\pi \epsilon_o r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

While the left and right charges contribute a total field of magnitude: 

:&lt;math&gt;E_{-q}=\frac {-q}{4\pi \epsilon_o (r^2+d^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

By inspection we can see that the horizontal components of the electric field cancel out. Only the vertical components are left. So we multiply by 

&lt;math&gt; sin \theta = \frac {r}{\sqrt{r^2+d^2}} &lt;/math&gt;


To get the vertical component of the electric field for a single negative charge: 


:&lt;math&gt;E_{-q} =\frac {-q}{4\pi \epsilon_o (r^2+d^2)}\frac {r}{\sqrt{r^2+d^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


And for the two negative charges together we get: 


:&lt;math&gt;E_{-2q} =\frac {-2q}{4\pi \epsilon_o (r^2+d^2)}\frac {r}{\sqrt{r^2+d^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


Now we can add to obtain the total vertical component of the electric field. 

:&lt;math&gt;E = E_{2q}+E_{-2q} =\frac {2q}{4\pi \epsilon_o r^2}+ \frac {-2q}{4\pi \epsilon_o (r^2+d^2)}\frac {r}{\sqrt{r^2+d^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which simplifies to: 

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {q}{2\pi \epsilon_o}\left [ \frac {1}{r^2}-\frac{r}{{(r^2+d^2)}^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right ]&lt;/math&gt;

Factoring out r&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; from the denominator's final term yields: 

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {q}{2\pi \epsilon_o}\left [ \frac {1}{r^2}-\frac{r}{{r^3 (1+(\frac {d}{r})^2)}^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right ]&lt;/math&gt;


Which reduces to: 


:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {q}{2\pi \epsilon_o r^2}\left [ 1-\frac{1}{{ (1+(\frac {d}{r})^2)}^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right ]&lt;/math&gt;


So now we have a perfectly good equation for calculating the field. An engineer might think that sufficient since they can calculate the value when they need it, but a physicist would like to know how this behaves in the &quot;far field&quot; where r &gt;&gt; d. Fortunately we have a tool - our friend the binomial expansion - which allows us to answer the far field question, as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\left [ 1-\frac{1}{{ (1+(\frac {d}{r})^2)}^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right ] = \left [ 1- {{ \left (1+ \left ( \frac {d}{r} \right )^2 \right )}^{-\frac{3}{2}}} \right ] = \left [ 1- \left ( 1 -\frac {3}{2} \left ( \frac {d}{r} \right )^2 \right ) + ... \right ] =  \frac {3}{2} \left ( \frac {d}{r} \right )^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting back into the original equation: 

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {q}{2\pi \epsilon_o r^2}\frac {3}{2} \left ( \frac {d}{r} \right )^2&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying, we find that in the far field when r &gt;&gt; d the electric field from a quadrupole falls off as &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{ r^4} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {3qd^2}{4\pi \epsilon_o r^4}&lt;/math&gt;

==Electric field associated with a line charge==
# A very long solid nonconducting cylinder of radius ''R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and length ''L'' (''R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; L'') possesses a uniform volume charge density ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' (C/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). For points far from the ends and for which ''r &amp;lt;&amp;lt; L'', 
## Find electric fields for all ''r'', distance from axis of cylinder. You may need separate expressions for ''r &amp;lt; R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''r &amp;gt; R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. Show that electric field is continuous at ''r = R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', i.e. two expressions for electric fields agree at ''r = R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''.
## Describe the motion of a small free charge ''Q'' of opposite sign (i.e. ''Q ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0'') placed inside the cylinder. Find the frequency of oscillation &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; if the charge oscillates about the axis of cylinder. (Note: &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, frequency, has units of cycles / second, while &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, angular frequency, has units of radians / second.)
## Let's change the problem and say we have a cylindrical ''shell'' of charge (of radius ''R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''σ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' so that the total charge remains the same). How do the expressions for electric fields change for either regions ''r &amp;lt; R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''r &amp;gt; R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''? Is the electric field still continuous? Give a plausible argument why we might not expect electric field to be continuous.

==Find the electric field for a finite line with uniform unit charge of λ coulombs per unit length ==

[[Image:Lineacarga2.PNG|thumb|right|300px|an infinite line with uniform unit charge.]]

The figure shows an finitely long line chage with linear charge density of &lt;math&gt;\lambda \,\!=\frac{dq}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. The charge extends from x = -a to x = +b which are arbitrary (although not infinite) and are not shown on the figure. 


Just as it the derivation for the infinite lint, the magnitude of the electric field which results from a short section '''dx''' of this line charge as measured at point '''P''' is a result of the charge &lt;math&gt;dq=\lambda dx \,\!&lt;/math&gt;:

And with that charge we can calculate the field contribution ('''dE''') from '''dq''' as: 


:&lt;math&gt;dE=\frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\frac{dq}{r^2}=\frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\frac{\lambda dx}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1)

We can no longer argue by symmetry that the electric field will be the same at any point of equal separation from the infinite line charge, so we can solve this in detail, which we will do using 2 dimensions. Once we have a solution for 2 dimensions, simple rotation around the line charge will allow us to determine the field in the 3rd dimension. 

The electric field is a vector which we'll represent as &lt;math&gt;d\vec E&lt;/math&gt;. This we'll separate into 2-dimensional Cartesian components:


:&lt;math&gt;dE_x=-dE \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;dE_y=dE \cos \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


The sign of the electric field at &lt;math&gt;dE_x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; indicates the &lt;math&gt;d{\vec E}_x&lt;/math&gt; location of the point with respect to ''x''. 


We find the total electric field for the horizontal &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt;  and vertical &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; components to determine &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; at the point '''P''' by integrating. Note that &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta&lt;/math&gt; is used to find the components of the field horizontally, while &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; is used to find them vertically. 

:&lt;math&gt;E_x=\int dE_x=-\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \sin \theta \, dE&lt;/math&gt; 

and 

:&lt;math&gt;E_y=\int dE_y =\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \cos \theta \, dE&lt;/math&gt; 



Or in full vectorial form: 


:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E}=\int_{L} \, d\vec{E}=\int_{L}\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{dq}{r^2}\vec {u_r}=\int_{L}\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{\lambda dx}{r^2}\vec {u_r}&lt;/math&gt;  

In this example the distance, r, from the charge to point P can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates x and y. 

&lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt {x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

which allows us to calculation the magnitude of the electric field at point P from the charge dx at r using the equation. 
&lt;math&gt;dE=\frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}=\frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\frac{\lambda dx}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;  



:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac {opposite}{hypotenuse} = \frac {x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \frac {adjacent}{hypotenuse} = \frac {y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

However we must recall that that magnitude corresponds to the vector &lt;math&gt;d\vec E&lt;/math&gt;, which changes as one moves along the line. So we must find the component of &lt;math&gt;d\vec E&lt;/math&gt; which points in the x or in the y directions. 


To find the component in the x direction &lt;math&gt;dE_x=-dE \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and to find it in the y direction apply &lt;math&gt;dE_y=dE \cos \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.


The x component of the field &lt;math&gt;d{\vec E}_x&lt;/math&gt; can be found by integrating from one end of the line source at -a to the other at a. If the line source is equally long to left and right, the net field in the x direction will cancel as below. 


:&lt;math&gt;E_x=\int dE_x=-\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \sin \theta \, dE =-\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \frac {x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \, dE &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;E_x=\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \frac {x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}, \frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\frac{\lambda dx}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(2)'''


:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {\lambda }{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \frac {xdx} {\left[{x^2+y^2}\right ]^\frac {3}{2}  }&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(3)'''


:&lt;math&gt;E_x=\frac {\lambda }{4\pi {\epsilon}_0} \left [  - \frac{1}{ \left[a^2+y^2 \right ]^\frac {1}{2}} + \frac{1}{ \left[b^2+y^2 \right ]^ \frac {1}{2}}\right ]&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(4)'''


====hold 1====

Similarly the y component of the field &lt;math&gt;d{\vec E}_y&lt;/math&gt; can be found by integrating from one end of the line source at -a to the other at a. 


:&lt;math&gt;E_y=\int dE_y =\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \cos \theta \, dE =\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \frac {y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \, dE &lt;/math&gt; 





And substituting in the equation above we get: 

:&lt;math&gt;E_y=\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \frac {y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\, \frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\frac{\lambda dx}{x^2+y^2}=\frac {\lambda y}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \frac{dx}{\left[x^2+y^2 \right]^\frac{3}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(5)'''



:&lt;math&gt;E_y=\frac {\lambda y}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\int_{x=-a}^{x=+b} \frac{dx}{\left[x^2+y^2 \right]^\frac{3}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(6)'''


:&lt;math&gt;E_y=\frac {\lambda }{4\pi {\epsilon}_0 y} \left[\frac{x}{\left[x^2+y^2 \right]^\frac{1}{2}} \right] _{x=-a}^{x=+b}
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''(7)'''

==Find the electric field for an  infinite line with uniform unit charge of λ coulombs per unit length ==

[[Image:Lineacarga2.PNG|thumb|right|300px|an infinite line with uniform unit charge.]]

The figure shows an infinitely long line chage with linear charge density of &lt;math&gt;\lambda \,\!=\frac{dq}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.


The magnitude of the electric field which results from a short section '''dx''' of this line charge as measured at point '''P''' is a result of the charge &lt;math&gt;dq=\lambda dx \,\!&lt;/math&gt;:

And with that charge we can calculate the field contribution ('''dE''') from '''dq''' as: 


:&lt;math&gt;dE=\frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\frac{dq}{r^2}=\frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\frac{\lambda dx}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1)

Since we can argue by symmetry that the electric field will be the same at any point of equal separation from the infinite line charge, we can solve this in using 2 dimensions. Once we have a solution for 2 dimensions, simple rotation around the line charge will provide the field in the 3rd dimension. 

The electric field is a vector which we'll represent as &lt;math&gt;d\vec E&lt;/math&gt;. This we'll separate into 2-dimensional Cartesian components:


:&lt;math&gt;dE_x=-dE \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;dE_y=dE \cos \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


The sign of the electric field at &lt;math&gt;dE_x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; indicates the &lt;math&gt;d{\vec E}_x&lt;/math&gt; location of the point with respect to ''x''. 


We find the total electric field for the horizontal &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt;  and vertical &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; components to determine &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; at the point '''P''' by integrating. Note that &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta&lt;/math&gt; is used to find the components of the field horizontally, while &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; is used to find them vertically. 

:&lt;math&gt;E_x=\int dE_x=-\int_{x=-\infty}^{x=+\infty} \sin \theta \, dE&lt;/math&gt; 

and 

:&lt;math&gt;E_y=\int dE_y =\int_{x=-\infty}^{x=+\infty} \cos \theta \, dE&lt;/math&gt; 


In these expressions &lt;math&gt;E_x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&gt; must integrate to zero because every element of charge to the left of the perpendicular point '''P''' has a corresponding element on the right so that their contributions to the field in the horizontal direction cancel each other. So &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; points in the vertical direction only. As for the electric field contributions to &lt;math&gt;E_y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the right half and left half of the charged lines will make an equal contribution, so we can write: 


:&lt;math&gt;E=E_y=2\int_{x=0}^{x=+\infty} \cos \theta \, dE&lt;/math&gt;


Substituting the expression (1) above into this equation we get: 


:&lt;math&gt;E=2\int_{x=0}^{x=+\infty} \cos \theta \, \frac{1}{4\pi {\epsilon}_0}\frac{\lambda dx}{x^2+y^2}=\frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0}\int_{x=0}^{x=+\infty} \cos \theta \, \frac{dx}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2)


By definition &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac {x}{y}&lt;/math&gt;, which we can write as &lt;math&gt;x=y\tan \theta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Differentiating this expression yields: &lt;math&gt;dx=y{\sec }^2 \theta d \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Substitute this into (2) and you will get:


:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0}\int_{x=0}^{x=+\infty} \cos \theta \, \frac{y{\sec }^2 \theta d \theta}{x^2+y^2}=\frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0}\int_{x=0}^{x=+\infty} \frac {y}{x^2+y^2}\cos \theta {\sec }^2 \theta d \theta&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(3)


Applying futher trigonometric relationships: &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \frac{y}{r}&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\sec \theta = \frac{r}{y}\quad &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\quad x^2+y^2=r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; we can establish equivalencies:


:&lt;math&gt;\frac {y}{x^2+y^2}\cos \theta {\sec }^2 \theta d \theta=\frac {y}{r^2}\frac {y}{r} \frac {r^2}{y^2}=\frac {y}{ry}= \frac {\cos \theta}{y}&lt;/math&gt;


Which can the be substituted into equation (3) to yield a significantly simplified integral: 


:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0 y}\int_{x=0}^{x=+\infty} \cos \theta  d \theta&lt;/math&gt;


To evaluate this we need only observe that  &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta \rightarrow 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and similarly &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow +\infty \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta \rightarrow \frac {\pi }{2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, to simplify our range of integration to:


:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0 y}\int_{\theta=0 }^{\theta =\frac {\pi }{2}} \cos \theta  d \theta =\frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0 y}\Bigg[ \sin \frac {\pi }{2}- \sin 0\Bigg] = \frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0 y}&lt;/math&gt; 


Which yields a final solution:  


:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0 y}&lt;/math&gt;


And this can be generalized for any point at distance r from the line charge to: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;

|-
!&lt;math&gt;E=\frac {\lambda }{2\pi {\epsilon}_0 r}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

# &lt;p&gt;'''3.1 s'''.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use the kinematics equation &lt;math&gt;y = y_0 + v_0 t + (1/2) a t^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Let the rock's initial height &lt;math&gt;y_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then equation simplifies to &lt;math&gt;y = t(v_0 + (1/2) a t)&lt;/math&gt;. So, two solutions for ''t'' are: ''t = 0'' s and &lt;math&gt;t = - 2 v_0/a &lt;/math&gt;. Plugging in &lt;math&gt;v_0 = 15~\mathrm{m/s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a = - 9.8~\mathrm{m/s^2}&lt;/math&gt; gives ''t = 3.1 s''.&lt;/p&gt;
# Let ''L'' be the length of the escalator, ''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the speed of the escalator, and ''v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the speed the man walks on solid ground. It takes ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a man standing on the escalator to travel its length, so &lt;math&gt;L = v_1 t_1&lt;/math&gt;. If the man walks against the escalator, his net speed is &lt;math&gt;v_2 - v_1&lt;/math&gt;; it takes him ''t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' to travel the length of the escalator, so &lt;math&gt;L = (v_2 - v_1) t_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;L = v_1 t_1 = (v_2 - v_1) t_2&lt;/math&gt;, we find that &lt;math&gt;v_1 (t_1 + t_2) = t_2 v_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v_2 = \{(t_1 + t_2)/t_2\} v_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Now, when the man walks down the escalator, his net speed is &lt;math&gt;v_1 + v_2&lt;/math&gt;.  If it takes him ''t'' seconds this time, then &lt;math&gt;L = (v_1 + v_2) t = \{1 + (t_1 + t_2)/t_2\} v_1 t&lt;/math&gt;. Rewriting &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; in terms of given quantities, &lt;math&gt;v_1 = L / t_1&lt;/math&gt;, and solving for ''t'', we get: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;t = (t_1 t_2)/(t_1 + 2 t_2) = 3.75~\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that by carrying out the calculation in symbols as far as we can, we actually discover that the final answer is independent of ''L''. This is one of many benefits of ''not'' substituting in numbers until the very end. (As with any rule, this rule has exceptions, but start by following the rule&amp;mdash;you will notice exceptions by yourself when you become sufficiently skilled.)
# &lt;p&gt; '''14.4 s''' and '''200 m''' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Let ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the position of the bike and ''x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the position of the car. We know from our kinematic equations that &lt;math&gt; x_f = x_i + v_i t + (1/2) a t^2 &lt;/math&gt;.  Because we are assuming that both the bike and the car are moving at a constant velocity (25 km/hr and 50 km/hr respectively) we can say that the acceleration (a) in this equation is zero (in both cases).  Thus we can write two equations of motion : &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The equation for the bike is &lt;math&gt; x_b = x_{bi} + v_b t &lt;/math&gt; and the equation for the car is &lt;math&gt; x_c = x_{ci} + v_c t &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Because we are interested in the point at which the two meet - we can safely say that we are looking for the point at which &lt;math&gt; x_b = x_c &lt;/math&gt;.  Solving this expression gives us &lt;math&gt; x_{bi} + v_b t = x_{ci} + v_c t &lt;/math&gt; and thus the time which it will take for the two objects to reach the same location can be found to be &lt;math&gt; t = ( x_{bi} - x_{ci} ) / ( v_c - v_b ) &lt;/math&gt;.  Before we can plug in any values we need to make sure that they share the same units, so 25 km/hr becomes 6.944 m/s and 50 km/hr becomes 13.888 m/s.  Plugging in these values gives us &lt;math&gt; t = (100 m - 0 m) / (13.888 m/s - 6.944 m/s) = 14.4 s&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Finally, in order to find the location at which they meet, simply plug this value for time into either of the two equations of motion, and we get &lt;math&gt; x = 0 + ( 13.888 m/s ) (14.4 s) = 200 m &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The speed of Cinderella,&lt;math&gt; v_c &lt;/math&gt; is 12mph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The time used by Cinderella,&lt;math&gt; t_c &lt;/math&gt; is 0.25h&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The speed of Prince,&lt;math&gt; v_p &lt;/math&gt; is unknown&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The time used by Prince,&lt;math&gt; t_p &lt;/math&gt; is 0.16666h or &lt;math&gt;1/6h&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since they have to meet, their distance traveled will be equal, then&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; v_c t_c = v_p t_p&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; (12)(0.25) = v_p(1/6)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; v_p = 18 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== With Calculus ==
# &lt;p&gt;The basic equations are these: &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{d v}{d t}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{d x}{d t}&lt;/math&gt;. Since our final goal is ''x'' as a function of ''t'', we should solve for ''v(t)'' first by integrating the first expression:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v(t) = \int_0^t dv = \int_0^t a~dt' = a t + v_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And integrating this a second time yields the final expression for ''x(t)''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \int_0^t dx = \int_0^t v~dt' = \int_0^t  (a t + v_0)~dt' = (1/2)a t^2 + v_0 t + x_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
# &lt;p&gt;'''''e'' cm'''.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positions as a function of time can be written down as the infinite series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = x_0 + v_0 t + (1/2) a_0 t^2 + (1/3\cdot 2) j_0 t^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Once you let &lt;math&gt;x_0 = v_0 = a_0 = j_0 = \cdots = 1&lt;/math&gt;, you should recognize the resulting series as the Taylor series of &lt;math&gt;e^t&lt;/math&gt; (times 1 cm):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;e^t = 1 + t + (1/2)t^2 + (1/3!)t^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plug in &lt;math&gt;t = 1&lt;/math&gt;, you get &lt;math&gt;x = e^1 = e~\mathrm{cm}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observant reader should notice that we suddenly dropped units in the middle. To be thorough, we would factor out &quot;1 s&quot; from each written expression of ''t'' and absorb it into the coefficient (that way, ''t'' becomes unitless and all coefficients have unit of cm).&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==

The motivation for compiling the gcc with g++ is to allow for a fine tuned capture of 
information about the trees directly from the compiler.
Currently, the access to the tree data structures are not wrapped as tightly as they could be.
By using the c++ compiler we can monitor all read and write accesses to the tree nodes.
that way we can isolate how they are used.

then we should be able to recreate a better and more well documented tree interface.

I have tried using java to compile the gcc source code, but it does not support operator overloading and makes you rework all types of things.

Here I have introduced a smart pointer for all the members. 
and a integer wrapper for the direct values.

At this point the bitfields are no longer optimized.

the next step would be to include the original tree definitions as the internal storage and use the wrapper for the public interface.

I have also replaced the central tree union as a base class.

The idea behind using classes instead of unions is this :

Later when we have reworked the parts, there should be no need for unions.
The usage of virtual base classes and inheritance will remove the need for them.

we will need to do multiple iterations over the model before we get to the point that the gcc will run with a c++ compiled back end.
It is sure to meet some critics, so we we keep the pages here until it is ready.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As we have already seen, a digital image consists of pixels, with each pixel having a value which represents its colour. For the purposes of understanding how digital images are manipulated, we are going to consider an 8-bit grayscale image, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255, giving us 256 (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) levels of grey. 0 represents white, and 255 represents black. This is the image we are going to consider:

The image consists of an edge, and some random noise. There are two methods of smoothing this image (i.e. removing noise) that you need to know about:

==Mean Smoothing==

In order to attempt to remove noise, we can take the mean average of all the pixels surrounding each pixel (and the pixel itself) as the value of the pixel in the smoothed image, as follows:

This does remove the noise, but it blurs the image.

==Median Smoothing==

A far better method is, instead of taking the mean, to take the median, as follows:

For this image, this gives a perfect result. In more complicated images, however, data will still be lost, although, in general, less data will be lost by taking the median than by taking the mean.

==Edge Detection==

We can detect the positioning of edges in an image using the 'Laplace rule', or 'Laplace kernel'. For each pixel in the image, we multiply its value by 4, and then subtract the values of the pixels above and below it, and on either side of it. If the result is negative, we treat it as 0. So, taking the median-smoothed image above, edge detection gives the following result:

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would like to start the discussion about the famous Deboo integrator by inserting my comment to the EDN's article [http://electronicdesign.com/analog/consider-deboo-integrator-unipolar-noninverting-designs Consider The &quot;Deboo&quot; Integrator For Unipolar Noninverting Designs]. In this story that I wrote in May 2007, I showed how we can convert, in two different ways (Miller's and Deboo's), the passive RC integrator into an active op-amp one. To my much surprise, six months later I received an email from the very inventor of this clever circuit - Gordon Deboo (see the two emails below). In my reply I asked him to tell how he has invented this clever circuit. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 15:35, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

[http://pe2bz.philpem.me.uk/Comm01/-%20-%20Ion-Photon-RF/-%20Ionizing-Radiation/G-107-Geiger-w-Neon/031802IFDs.pdf Consider The &quot;Deboo&quot; Integrator For Unipolar Noninverting Designs]
 

The secret of an active integrator is simple: it is just an improved passive integrator. Then, how do we convert the passive integrator into an active one? Here is a possible &quot;scenario&quot;.

'''RC-INTEGRATOR.''' The bare capacitor is the simplest integrator. It is perfect, if only we drive it by a constant current. Most frequently, we need to drive the capacitor by a voltage. For this purpose, we connect before a resistor R acting as a voltage-to-current converter. Only, a problem appears - the voltage Vc across the capacitor disturbs the input voltage Vin. As a result, the input current decreases: Ic = (Vin - Vc)/R = Vin/R - Vc/R. What do we do to compensate the losses in the capacitor? We may borrow the remedy from the human routine: connect an additional power source, which &quot;helps&quot; the input source. From the Kirchoff's times, we can do this connection in two ways - series or parallel.

'''INVERTING (MILLER) INTEGRATOR.''' Here, we connect in series with the capacitor an additional following voltage source (op-amp voltage &quot;inverter&quot;). It produces a compensating &quot;mirror&quot; voltage -Vc equal and inverse to the voltage drop Vc across the capacitor. In this way, the op-amp adds as much voltage to the input voltage source as it loses across the capacitor; thus, it &quot;helps by voltage&quot; the input source to create the right current Ic = (Vin - Vc + Vc)/R = Vin/R. In this arrangement, the capacitor becomes &quot;flying&quot; but the compensating voltage source is grounded. That is why, we use its &quot;mirror&quot; voltage -Vc as an output that gives two advantages: first, the load is connected to the common ground; second, it consumes energy from the &quot;helping&quot; voltage source (the power supply) instead from the input source (so, the load may be low-resistive enough). A disadvantage is the need of a bipolar power supply. All the circuits with parallel negative feedback (i.e., all the inverting op-amp circuits) exploit this great idea.

'''NON-INVERTING (DEBOO) INTEGRATOR.''' Here, we connect in parallel to the capacitor an additional &quot;helping&quot; current source. It produces a compensating current Vc/R, which is proportional to the voltage drop Vc across the capacitor. In this way, the source adds the &quot;missing&quot; current Vc/R to the insufficient input current Iin = Vin/R - Vc/R; thus, it &quot;helps by current&quot; the input source to create the right current Ic = Vin/R - Vc/R + Vc/R = Vin/R. Thus we obtain the famous Howland circuit, which acts as a perfect voltage-to-current converter (if we include the input voltage source, we name it Howland current source). 

A negative resistor -R can serve as the &quot;proportional helping current source&quot; needed. It does this magic by &quot;pushing&quot; a current I = Vc/R through the capacitor instead by &quot;sucking&quot; the same current (if it was an ordinary &quot;positive&quot; resistor R). In order to create a negative resistor -R, we may convert a positive resistance R into a negative one -R ; thus we will create the famous negative impedance converter (NIC). For this purpose, we connect in series a &quot;positive&quot; resistor R and a proportional voltage source, which produces a compensating voltage 2Vc (i.e, an amplifier with K = 2). Half the voltage (Vc) vanishes in the capacitor; the rest half (Vc) remains applied across the resistor R, which acts as a voltage-to-current converter. As a result, the whole combination produces the &quot;helping&quot; current needed I = (2Vc - Vc)/R = Vc/R. We may implement this idea into a practical NIC circuit by using a resistor R (R3 on Fig. 1) and a classical op-amp non-inverting amplifier with K = 2 (the op-amp and the resistors R1, R2 on Fig. 1).

From this negative resistance viewpoint, we may present the Howland current source as two parallel connected resistors - a &quot;positive&quot; R and a negative -R. The result of this connection is that the negative resistor has &quot;neutralized&quot; (absorbed) the positive one and the effective differential resistance (the internal source's resistance) is infinite.
     
In the circuit of a Deboo integrator, both the capacitor and the compensating source are grounded; the power supply is unipolar. The voltage drop across the capacitor can serve as an &quot;original&quot; output; only, this is not a good idea because the load will affect the output (we have to isolate the load). Then, where to take a perfect output from? As above, we may use the compensating voltage 2Vc (which creates the compensating current) as a buffered output. In order to enlarge the active region, we may scale the negative resistance by the ratio R1/R2 &gt; 1 (see the article). Note that all the resistances and CMRR affect the accuracy (Miller integrator does not have these problems).
                         
For the first time, I encountered the negative resistance phenomenon and its implementations - the exotic circuits of negative impedance converter, Howland current source and Deboo integrator - in the French book &quot;L’amplificateur opérationnel et ses applications Masson, Paris, 1971&quot;. Then I was a student and was trying without success to grasp the ideas behind these famous circuits. I was asking the simple questions, &quot;What did the op-amp actually do in these circuits? What problem did it solve? Why was it connected there?&quot;; only, they were not giving me reasonable answers. Until many years later, I managed finally to penetrate into the philosophy of negative resistance circuits. Up to now, I continue revealing the mystery of the negative resistance phenomenon to my students following the &quot;scenario&quot; above.

I have decided to expose my viewpoint about these legendary circuits because, looking at this article (and the entire web), I see that the idea behind them is still hidden. Although the article is useful from a practical point of view, it does not tell us anything new about root of the matter. It only shows another possible application of MAX4250 op-amp; obviously, it is its purpose.

The sentence &quot;...ground drives the capacitor through a negative resistor...&quot; does not sound well as a ground is just a piece of wire; it is not a source. The negative resistor is the source here. So, more correctly is just to say &quot;...a negative resistor drives the capacitor...&quot; Of course, I see that the author would like to show a fine symmetrical &quot;T&quot; configuration on Fig. 3. Really, the configuration is symmetrical - two voltage sources, Vin,Vout, drive the common capacitor through corresponding &quot;positive&quot; resistors,R,R3. The entire problem is that a &quot;positive&quot; resistor contains only a resistor while a negative resistor contains a resistor and a voltage source. Actually, a negative resistor is not a resistor, it is a varying source. IMO, it deserves a special &quot;source&quot; name; for example, &quot;1-port voltage-controlled current source&quot; or &quot;2-terminal voltage-to-current active converter&quot; can serve as full descriptive names:) At worst, we may name it &quot;antiresistor&quot; or &quot;reverse resistor&quot;; &quot;negative resistor&quot; is the most inappropriate word:)

I notice from  http://electronicdesign.com/analog/consider-deboo-integrator-unipolar-noninverting-designs   that you expressed an interest in one of the circuits I designed in my old NASA days, viz. the Deboo Integrator.  There is another more complicated circuit, which serves a different purpose, that includes a Deboo Integrator along with other components.   It can be found in one of my now obsolete patents:

1.  Patent # 3493901 - A GYRATOR TYPE CIRCUIT 1968

A &quot;gyrator&quot; makes an effective inductor using an capacitor, which is important because capacitors are easy to make with integrated circuits, while inductors are not.  Therefore a gyrator enables large value inductors to be made in integrated without using physically large coils of wire, because the coil can be replaced with a capacitor.

I have been retired from NASA for many years now and I am interested and surprised when some of my old circuits are mentioned in current literature.

It's great to see younger people still working on and improving on what we old fogies did.  Keep up the good work!

...As you can see from the dates of my publications, I did most of my  
creative work in the 1960s and early 1970s working for NASA (The  
USA’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration).  After that I  
got into management, which wasn’t nearly as much fun!  So I have been  
away from circuit design for 30 years and most of what I did has been  
improved upon by the many younger people who have followed me.  Also  
I haven’t kept up with developments in the field.  A brief look at  
what has happened tells me that the part of the work I did that is  
still somewhat applicable is in circuits using operation amplifiers.

I have looked at what you have on the Internet and am impressed with  
your ability to explain many complicated circuits.  I think your  
students are lucky to have a teacher with your approach.

I am of course now retired and health and other issues do not permit  
me to give detailed answers to the many interesting questions you  
raise.  However, let me respond to some of your points...


''...It is interesting to know, if you had known about Howland idea when you invented Deboo integrator; if you applied directly the Howland circuit just adding a capacitor to it or you walked the whole way, etc... [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]]''


... I was not aware of the Howland current source when I designed my  
integrator.  I conceived my integrator a couple of years before it  
was published, so I don’t which came first...

...I’m sorry I’m not able to give you a more detailed reply, but already  
this is fairly lengthy.  I can’t imagine you would want to use  
anything from this note in your various publications but, if you  
should wish to, feel free to do so...


Best wishes,

Gordon


== A copy from the Wikipedia talk page about negative resistance ==

I have written the text below in [[w:Talk:Negative resistance#Howland circuit|Howland circuit]] section of the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Negative resistance|talk page about negative resistance]]. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 15:42, 3 March 2009 (UTC)


The second version of Howland current source (see Fig. 1 of [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/1155 MAXIM's AN1155]) consists of an input voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, a positive resistor R, a load and a negative impedance converter INIC (R1 = R2 = R3 = R and the op-amp). The input voltage source and the resistor R constitute an imperfect current source with positive internal resistance R that is connected in parallel to the negative resistor INIC and the load. The role of the negative resistance -R is to neutralize the positive internal resistance R of the source. As a result, the load is driven again by a constant current source with infinite internal resistance. Well, let's include some algebra to be more cogent.

The imperfect current source produces a current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/R = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R. As you can see, it differs from the ideal result I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R by the term V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R. It is more than obvious that we may compensate this error by adding the same term; then, I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R + V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R. That means to inject an additional &quot;helping&quot; current I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R that is proportional to the load voltage. What is this circuit that can produce such a current I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;? Of course, it is a voltage driven negative resistor with resistance -R; it is a negative impedance converter with current inversion (INIC) that is connected in parallel to the load.

As a conclusion, ''Howland voltage-to-current converter consists of two connected in parallel resistors with equivalent but opposite (positive and negative) resistances''; ''Howland voltage-to-current converter = INIC + resistor''. The &quot;neutralization&quot; between them produces an infinite resistance and, as a result, a constant current. The circuit is stable since the positive load resistance remains after the &quot;neutralization&quot; (another wisdom: ''the positive resistance has to dominate over the negative resistance to have stability'').

Deboo integrator (see again Fig. 1 of [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/1155 MAXIM's AN1155]) is just a Howland voltage-to-current converter driving a capacitive load; ''Deboo integrator =  Howland voltage-to-current converter + capacitor''. It has two advantages over the dual inverting integrator: it is a non-inverting circuit and the capacitor is grounded. But it has two disadvantages as well: it requires an op-amp with differential input and it has a bigger error depending on the resistor tolerances (here, the op-amp does not monitor the result of the compensation as it monitors the virtual ground at the inverting circuit).

It is interesting that although there was nothing new in a Deboo integrator (actually, it was just a Howland pump driving a capacitor) Deboo was not aware of the Howland current source when he invented his integrator. I found out this fact in a personal correspondence (see above) between me and Deboo a year ago (Deboo was impressed by my comments to an [http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/1633/1633.html EDN article] about his famous circuit and emailed me). By the way, then I also exchanged interesting thoughts with Deboo about the unique feature of negative feedback to [[Talk:Circuit Idea/How Do We Swap Circuit Inputs and Outputs?|reverse the causality]] in circuits (to swap circuit inputs and outputs). For example, the [[w:Negative impedance converter#Negative impedance circuits|negative inductance circuit]] is based on this idea.

Today, I found an extremely interesting [http://techpreservation.dyndns.org/beitman/abpr/newfiles/The%20Howland%20Current%20Pump%20Circuit.pdf source] about the invention of the Howland circuit. Although it is nameless, it seems it is written by the very Howland. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 15:42, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Refraction ==

Refraction is the act of preventing a rule from firing multiple times in succession. Without refraction, at each loop iteration the same rules can be added to the agenda repeatedly. This is because the same conditions are satisfied. To prevent a single rule from firing repeatedly, a refraction condition is implemented. There are many types of refraction rules.

== Refraction Rules ==

=== Once Only ===

Some systems use a refraction condition that each rule may only be fired once. Once a rule has  been fired, it may never be fired again until the system is reset.

=== Intermittant Rules ===

In an intermittant rule refraction condition, a rule may never fire twice consecutively, and may not be added to the agenda again until a different rule fires first.

=== Changing Antecedent ===

In a changing antecedent refraction condition, a  rule may only fire if the attributes in the antecedent have changed.</text>

;20 November 2008:Poor quality mishmash of various topics. Many pages are stubs. TOC is inconsistent with subpage naming. Risks becoming an encyclopedia of hardware/software configurations. Needs more examples, more pictures, more explanations. Strongly consider and maybe start planning breaking this book into smaller, more focused volumes: RTOS, C + Assembly interaction, Embedded hardware programming, Real-Time Software, etc. Might just be better off this way.</text>

The pixels at the edge of the array cannot be changed by the processing because they are not at the centre of a 3x3 section.  Edge pixels remain unchanged - try doing mean or median processing in Scion Image it also shows the edge pixels remain unchanged.
The examples on the page are incorrect.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. How could the above methods be applied to a digital sound sample?'''

By taking the median or mean of the sample and the values on either side of it. This would be unreliable, as sound is a wave, so the samples need to vary quite widely. However, something similar could be used when comparing repeating patterns in a waveform.

'''2. Which of the above methods would be suitable for smoothing sharp edges? Why?'''

Mean smoothing - median smoothing would not blur the edges.

'''3. Use median smoothing to remove noise from the following image of a white cat in a snowstorm (the black pixels have a value of 255):'''

'''4. Why would mean sampling not be appropriate for smoothing the image given in question 3?'''

It would produce a really blurred mess, instead of an image, as the noise is too dense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Well-known text (WKT)''' is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map, spatial reference systems of spatial objects and transformations between spatial reference systems. A binary equivalent, known as '''well-known binary (WKB)''' is used to transfer and store the same information on databases, such as PostGIS. The formats are regulated by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and described in their Simple Feature Access and Coordinate Transformation Service specifications.

==Geometric Objects==

Geometric objects that can be represented with WKT are: points, lines, polygons, TINs and Polyhedron]. Multi geometries are also available to represent more than one geometry of the same dimension in a single object, and geometries of different dimensions can be stored in a geometry collection.

Coordinates for geometries may be 2D (x, y), 3D (x, y, z), 4D (x, y, z, m) with a m value that is part of a linear reference system or 3D with a m value (x, y, m). Three dimensional geometries are designated by a Z after the geometry type and geometries with a linear reference system have a M after the geometry type.

WKT geometries are used throughout OGC specifications and are present in applications that implement these specifications. For example, PostGIS contains functions that can convert geometries to and from a WKT representation, making them human readable. 

The following are some example geometric WKT strings.

  POINT(6 10)
  LINESTRING(3 4,10 50,20 25)
  POLYGON((1 1,5 1,5 5,1 5,1 1),(2 2, 3 2, 3 3, 2 3,2 2))
  MULTIPOINT(3.5 5.6,4.8 10.5)
  MULTILINESTRING((3 4,10 50,20 25),(-5 -8,-10 -8,-15 -4))
  MULTIPOLYGON(((1 1,5 1,5 5,1 5,1 1),(2 2, 3 2, 3 3, 2 3,2 2)),((3 3,6 2,6 4,3 3)))
  GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(4 6),LINESTRING(4 6,7 10))
  POINT ZM (1 1 5 60)
  POINT M (1 1 80)

==Spatial Reference Systems==

A WKT string for a spatial reference system describes the datum, geoid, coordinate system, and map projection of the spatial objects. 

Well-known text is used extensively throughout many GIS programs. ESRI uses WKT in the shapefile &lt;tt&gt;*.prj&lt;/tt&gt; file.  

The following is an example of a spatial reference system WKT string.

 COMPD_CS[&quot;OSGB36 / British National Grid + ODN&quot;,

==Transformations==

A WKT format is defined to describe the transformation methods and parameters used to convert coordinates between two different spatial reference systems. 

Below are two examples of WKT transformation descriptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Geography Markup Language''' ('''GML''') is the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to express geographical features. GML serves as a modeling language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange format for geographic transactions on the Internet.  Note that the concept of feature in GML is a very general one and includes not only conventional &quot;vector&quot; or discrete objects, but also coverages (see also GMLJP2) and sensor data.  The ability to integrate all forms of geographic information is key to the utility of GML.

== Standards ==

The OGC is an international voluntary consensus standards organization whose members maintain the ''Geography Markup Language'' standard. The OGC coordinates with the ISO TC 211 standards organization to maintain consistency between OGC and ISO standards work. GML is in the process of being adopted as an ISO standard (ISO 19136) and is expected to be released as an International Standard in 2007.

GML is the XML data standard for the GeoWeb infrastructure, enabling Internet-connected devices to access geographical information, including, for example, merchant locations and traffic conditions.

GML can also be included in version 1.0 of the United States National Information Exchange Model.

== GML model ==

The original GML model was based on the World Wide Web Consortium's Resource Description Framework (RDF). Subsequently, the OGC introduced XML schemas into GML's structure to help connect the various existing geographic databases, whose relational structure XML schemas more easily define. The resulting XML-schema-based GML retains many features of RDF, including the idea of child elements as properties of the parent object (RDFS) and the use of remote property references.

GML contains a rich set of primitives which are used to build application specific schemas or application languages.  These primitives include:

* Feature
* Geometry
* Coordinate Reference System
* Time
* Dynamic feature
* Coverage (including geographic images) 
* Unit of measure
* Map presentation styling rules

===Profile===

'''GML profiles''' are logical restrictions to GML, and may be expressed by a document, an XML schema or both.  These profiles are intended to simplify adoption of GML, to facilitate rapid adoption of the standard. The following ''profiles'', as defined by the GML specification, have been published or proposed for public use:

* A ''Point Profile'' for applications with point geometric data but without the need for the full GML grammar
* A ''GML Simple Features profile'' supporting vector feature requests and transactions, e.g. with a WFS
* A GML profile for GMJP2 (GML in JPEG 2000)
* A GML profile for RSS

Note that ''Profiles'' are distinct from application schemas. ''Profiles'' are part of GML namespaces and define restricted subsets of GML.  Application schemas are XML vocabularies defined using GML and which live in an application-defined target namespace. Application schemas can be built on specific GML profiles or use the full GML schema set.

Profiles are often created in support for GML derived languages (see application schemas) created in support of particular application domains such as commercial aviation, nautical charting or resource exploitation.

The GML Specification (Since GML v3.) contains a pair of XSLT scripts (usually referred to as the &quot;subset tool&quot;) that can be used to construct GML profiles.

====GML Simple Features Profile====

The ''GML Simple Features Profile'' is a more complete profile of GML than the above ''Point Profile'' and supports a wide range of vector feature objects, including the following:

# A reduced geometry model allowing 0d, 1d and 2d linear geometric objects (all based on linear interpolation) and the corresponding aggregate geometries (gml:MultiPoint, gml:MultiCurve, etc.).
# A simplified feature model which can only be one level deep (in the general GML model, arbitrary nesting of features and feature properties is not permitted).
# All non-geometric properties must be XML Schema simple types – i.e. cannot contain nested elements.
# Remote property value references (xlink:href) just like in the main GML specification.

Since the profile aims to provide a simple entry point, it does not provide support for the following:
* coverages
* topology
* observations
* value objects (for real time sensor data)
* nor support for dynamic features. 

Nonetheless it supports a good variety of real world problems.

====Subset tool====

In addition, the GML specification provides a ''subset tool'' to generate GML profiles containing a user-specified list of components. The tool consists of a pair of XSLT scripts. The scripts generate a profile that a developer may extend manually or otherwise enhance through schema restriction. Note that as restrictions of the full GML specification, application schemas that a profile can generate must themselves be valid GML application schemas.

The subset tool can generate profiles for many other reasons as well. Listing the elements and attributes to include in the resultant profile schema and running the tool results in a single profile schema file containing only the user-specified items and all of the element, attribute and type declarations on which the specified items depend. Some Profile schemas created in this manner support other specifications including IHO S-57 and GML in JPEG 2000.

===Application schema===

In order to expose an application's geographic data with GML, a community or organization creates an XML schema specific to the application domain of interest(the ''application schema''). This schema describes the object types whose data the community is interested in and which community applications must expose. For example, an application for tourism may define object types including monuments, places of interest, museums, road exits, and viewpoints in its ''application schema''. Those object types in turn reference the primitive object types defined in the GML standard.

A list of known publicly available GML Application Schemas is being assembled. 

Some other markup languages for geography use schema constructs, but GML builds on the existing XML schema model instead of creating a new schema language.

===GML and KML ===
Note that the KML (Keyhole Markup Language) language made popular by Google is a complementary to GML. Whereas GML is a language to encode geographic content, by describing a spectrum of application objects and their properties (e.g. bridges, roads, buoys, vehicles etc.), KML is a language for the visualization of geographic information.  KML can be used to carry GML content, and GML can be &quot;styled&quot; to KML for the purposes of presentation.

===GML geometries===

GML encodes the ''GML geometries'', or ''geometric characteristics'', of geographic objects as elements within GML documents. The geometries of those objects may describe, for example, roads, rivers, and bridges.

The key GML geometry object types in GML 1.0 and GML 2.0, are the following:

* Point 
* LineString 
* Polygon

Note that this geometry model is identical to the geometry model in KML.

===Features===

GML defines ''features'' distinct from ''geometry objects''. A ''feature'' is an application object that represents a physical entity, e.g. a building, a river, or a person. A ''feature'' may or may not have geometric aspects. A ''geometry object'' defines a location or region instead of a physical entity, and hence is different from a ''feature''. The distinction between ''features'' and ''geometry objects'' in GML contrasts with models used in other geographic information systems (GIS) that make no such distinction. That is, although some other GIS define ''features'' and ''geometry objects'' interchangeably as items on a map, GML maintains them as separate entity types.

In GML, a ''feature'' can have various geometry properties that describe geometric aspects or characteristics of the feature (e.g. the feature's ''Point'' or ''Extent'' properties).
GML also provides the ability for ''features'' to share a geometry property with one another by using a ''remote property reference'' on the shared geometry property. Remote properties are a general feature of GML borrowed from RDF. An ''xlink:href'' attribute on a GML geometry property means that the value of the property is the resource referenced in the link.

For example, a ''Building'' feature in a particular GML application schema might have a position given by the primitive GML geometry object type ''Point''.  However, the ''Building'' is a separate entity from the ''Point'' that defines its position.  In addition, a ''feature'' may have several geometry properties (or none at all), for example an ''extent'' and a ''position''.

===Coordinates===

''Coordinates'' in GML represent the coordinates of ''geometry objects''. Coordinates can be specified by any of the following GML elements:

* ''&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;''
* ''&lt;gml:pos&gt;''
* ''&lt;gml:posList&gt;''

GML has multiple ways to represent coordinates.  For example, the ''&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;'' element can be used, as follows:

 &lt;gml:Point gml:id=&quot;p21&quot; srsName=&quot;urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326&quot;&gt;
    &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;45.67, 88.56&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
 &lt;/gml:Point&gt;

Note that, when expressed as above, the individual coordinates (e.g. ''88.56'') are not separately accessible through the XML Document Object Model since the content of the &lt;gml:coordinates&gt; element is just a single string.

To make GML coordinates accessible through the XML DOM, GML 3.0 introduced the ''&lt;gml:pos&gt;'' and ''&lt;gml:posList&gt;'' elements. (Note that although GML versions 1 and 2 had the ''&lt;gml:coord&gt;'' element, it is treated as a defect and is not used.) Using the ''&lt;gml:pos&gt;'' element instead of the ''&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;'' element, the same point can be represented as follows:

 &lt;gml:Point gml:id=&quot;p21&quot; srsName=&quot;urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326&quot;&gt;
    &lt;gml:pos dimension=&quot;2&quot;&gt;45.67 88.56&lt;/gml:pos&gt;
 &lt;/gml:Point&gt;

The coordinates of a ''&lt;gml:LineString&gt;'' geometry object can be represented with the ''&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;'' element:

 &lt;gml:LineString gml:id=&quot;p21&quot; srsName=&quot;urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326&quot;&gt;
    &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;45.67, 88.56 55.56,89.44&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
 &lt;/gml:LineString &gt;

The ''&lt;gml:posList&gt;'' element is used to represent a list of coordinate tuples, as required for linear geometries:

 &lt;gml:LineString gml:id=&quot;p21&quot; srsName=&quot;urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326&quot;&gt;
    &lt;gml:posList dimension=&quot;2&quot;&gt;45.67 88.56 55.56 89.44&lt;/gml:posList&gt;
 &lt;/gml:LineString &gt;

For GML data servers (WFS) and conversion tools that only support GML 1 or GML 2 (i.e. only the &lt;gml:coordinates&gt; element), there is no alternative to ''&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;''. For GML 3 documents and later, however, ''&lt;gml:pos&gt;'' and ''&lt;gml:posList&gt;'' are preferable to ''&lt;gml:coordinates&gt;''.

For more information on the ''srsName'' attribute, see ''Coordinate Reference System'' below.

===Coordinate Reference System===

A '''Coordinate Reference System''' (CRS) determines the geometry of each geometry element in a GML document.

Unlike KML or GeoRSS, GML does not default to a coordinate system when none is provided. Instead, the desired coordinate system must be specified explicitly with a ''Coordinate Reference System'' (CRS) or Spatial Reference System (SRS). The elements whose coordinates are interpreted with respect to such a CRS include the following:
* &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;
* &lt;gml:pos&gt;
* &lt;gml:posList&gt;


An ''srsName'' attribute attached to a geometry object specifies the object's CRS, as shown in the following example:

 &lt;gml:Point gml:id=&quot;p1&quot; srsName=&quot;#srs36&quot;&gt;
     &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;100,200&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
 &lt;/gml:Point&gt;

The value of the ''srsName'' attribute is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). It refers to a definition of the Coordinate Reference System that is used to interpret the coordinates in the geometry. The CRS definition may be in a document (i.e. a ''flat file'') or in an online web service.

The ''srsName'' URI may also be a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for referencing a common CRS definition. The OGC has developed a URN structure and a set specific URNs to encode some common Coordinate Reference Systems. A URN resolver resolves those URNs to GML CRS definitions.

==Examples==

Polygons, Points, and ''LineString'' objects are encoded in GML 1.0 and 2.0 as follows:

     &lt;gml:Polygon&gt;
         &lt;gml:outerBoundaryIs&gt;
                 &lt;gml:LinearRing&gt;
                         &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;0,0 100,0 100,100 0,100 0,0&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
                 &lt;/gml:LinearRing&gt;
        &lt;/gml:outerBoundaryIs&gt;
     &lt;/gml:Polygon&gt;
     &lt;gml:Point&gt;
        &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;100,200&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
     &lt;/gml:Point&gt;
     &lt;gml:LineString&gt;
        &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;100,200 150,300&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
     &lt;/gml:LineString&gt;

Note that ''LineString'' objects, along with ''LinearRing'' objects, assume linear interpolation between the specified points.

===Features using geometries===

The following GML example illustrates the distinction between ''features'' and ''geometry objects''.  The ''Building'' feature has several ''geometry objects'', sharing one of them (the ''Point'' with identifier ''p21'') with the ''SurveyMonument'' feature:

 &lt;abc:Building gml:id=&quot;SearsTower&quot;&gt;
     &lt;gml:name&gt;Sears Tower&lt;/gml:name&gt;
     &lt;abc:height&gt;52&lt;/abc:height&gt;
     &lt;abc:position&gt;
         &lt;gml:Point&gt;
             &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;100,200&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
         &lt;/gml:Point&gt;
     &lt;/abc:position&gt;
     &lt;app:extent&gt;
         &lt;gml:Polygon&gt;
             &lt;gml:exterior&gt;
                 &lt;gml:LinearRing&gt;
                     &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;100,200&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
                 &lt;/gml:LinearRing&gt;
             &lt;/gml:exterior&gt;
         &lt;/gml:Polygon&gt;
     &lt;/app:extent&gt;
 &lt;/abc:Building&gt;
 &lt;abc:Building gml:id=&quot;SearsTower&quot;&gt;
     &lt;abc:position xlink:type=&quot;Simple&quot; xlink:href=&quot;#p21&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/abc:Building&gt;
 &lt;abc:SurveyMonument gml:id=&quot;g234&quot;&gt;
     &lt;abc:position&gt;
         &lt;gml:Point gml:id=&quot;p21&quot;&gt;
             &lt;gml:coordinates&gt;100,200&lt;/gml:coordinates&gt;
         &lt;/gml:Point&gt;
     &lt;/abc:position&gt;
 &lt;/abc:SurveyMonument&gt;

Note that the reference is to the shared ''Point'' and not to the ''SurveyMonument'', since any ''feature'' object can have more than one ''geometry object'' property.

===Point Profile===

The GML ''Point Profile'' contains a single GML geometry, namely a ''&lt;gml:Point&gt;'' object type. Any XML Schema can use the ''Point Profile'' by importing it and referencing the subject ''&lt;gml:Point&gt;'' instance:

 &lt;PhotoCollection xmlns=&quot;http://www.myphotos.org&quot; xmlns:gml=&quot;http://www.opengis.net/gml&quot;    
      xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; 
      xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.myphotos.org
      MyGoodPhotos.xsd&quot;&gt;
     &lt;items&gt;
         &lt;Item&gt;
             &lt;name&gt;Lynn Valley&lt;/name&gt;
             &lt;description&gt;A shot of the falls from the suspension bridge&lt;/description&gt;
             &lt;where&gt;North Vancouver&lt;/where&gt;
             &lt;position&gt;
                 &lt;gml:Point srsDimension=&quot;2&quot; srsName=&quot;urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326&quot;&gt;                                                       
                        &lt;gml:pos&gt;49.40 -123.26&lt;/gml:pos&gt;
                  &lt;/gml:Point&gt;
              &lt;/position&gt;
         &lt;/Item&gt;
     &lt;/items&gt;
 &lt;/PhotoCollection&gt;

Note that when using the ''Point Profile'', the only geometry object is the '&lt;gml:Point&gt;' object. The rest of the geography is defined by the photo-collection schema.

Denmark, officially (translated to English) the Kingdom of Denmark (Danish: Kongeriget Danmark (help·info), IPA: [ˈd̥ænmɑɡ̊], (archaic:) IPA: [ˈd̥anmɑːɡ̊]) is a nation situated in Scandinavia in northern Europe. It is the southernmost of the Nordic countries. The mainland is bordered to the south by Germany; Denmark is located to the southwest of Sweden and the south of Norway. Denmark borders both the Baltic and the North Sea.

The country consists of a large peninsula, Jutland (Jylland) and a large number of islands, most notably Zealand (Sjælland), Funen (Fyn), Vendsyssel-Thy, Lolland, Falster and Bornholm as well as hundreds of minor islands often referred to as the Danish Archipelago. Denmark has long controlled the approach to the Baltic Sea, and these waters are also known as the Danish straits. The Faroe Islands and Greenland are autonomous provinces of Denmark with home rule.

Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. It is a member of NATO and the European Union, having joined the European Economic Community in 1973. The national capital and the largest city is Copenhagen. Originally a seafaring nation relying on fishing, farming and trade, Denmark experienced steady industrialization in the 19th and 20th centuries and developed the Scandinavian model welfare state. In 2006 a survey found Denmark to be the happiest place in the world, based on standards of health, welfare, and education. In 2007 the country's capital was ranked the third most liveable city in the world by Monocle magazine[1] and ranked as the happiest nation in the world.[2]

When I work on [[Algebra 2|this]], I have to try to decide how to interpret different standards to fit in the mix. I don't see why we need to have to coordinate books with standards that may or may not be actually good. I can testify, for instance, how standards lead to very poor academics in school. They do not interest most students, and those that do get interested is because the teacher/s lead them into further exploration. So I say, why not arrange books by interest levels, not by standards? Seems most sensible. (got this one from a leading discussion over at [[Help:Textbook Standards|Textbook Standards]] that I began. This is the opening comment.)
:(Response by [[User:Chazz|Chazz]])I'm sorry, Laleena, but I can't really agree, much as I wish I could. What the standards provide is a minimum, a level of factuality and verifiability, so that an educator using our texts (or any text) will have a basic level of trust in the materials he or she is using to teach. We &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; write to that minimum standard to be accepted. Without that minimum, we cannot be used for teaching and the whole thing becomes a pointless exercise. However: Nothing says that we can't exceed that minimum, and it is there that we hopefully can do better than the main stream. All the same, a text, even as flexible and fluid a text as WB, cannot inspire the way a teacher can. WB can, under the hands of a suitable teacher, inspire a class to new heights as it researches outside the classroom to find material to add to the text, to make a palpable contribution to the next class and to the future. There is no text that can make a mediocre teacher any good. What we have to do is meet the standards, exceed them where possible, and we have no choice but to trust the teachers to make the magic from what we can provide.</text>

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

====Hello world example====

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Text;
namespace HelloWorldLab1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to exit&quot;);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: when you create a new console project in Visual studio, all the code is generated by default except for the 3 &quot;Console&quot; lines in the Main method. Just add those 3 lines and run the program.

We have discussed all the parts of that program except for the role of the Console which will be discussed in the input/output section (Stream). For now, lets say that it is a System class, in the System namespace (the &quot;using System&quot; instruction makes the &quot;System.&quot; part of &quot;System.Console.Writeline()&quot; optional) and that the WriteLine() and ReadLine() methods write and read strings to and from the console.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

====Using Collections====

'''Exam objective: '''Manage a group of associated data in a .NET Framework application by using collections.

(Refer System.Collections namespace - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections(vs.71).aspx MSDN])

=====ArrayList class===== 

see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.arraylist.aspx MSDN]

The ArrayList class is used for arrays whose size will dynamically increase as required. An ArrayList is not necessarily sorted.

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;using&lt;/font&gt; System;
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;using&lt;/font&gt; System.Collections;
 
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; Demo {
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;public static void&lt;/font&gt; Main() {
         ArrayList myArrayList = new ArrayList();
         myArrayList.Add(&quot;Testing&quot;);
         myArrayList.Add(&quot;1...2...3&quot;);
     }
 }

===== Collection interfaces ===== 

:ICollection interface and IList interface

::ICollection interface - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.icollection.aspx MSDN]

:::The '''ICollection''' interface is the base interface for classes in the '''System.Collections''' namespace.

:::The '''ICollection''' interface extends '''IEnumerable; IDictionary''' and '''IList''' are more specialized interfaces that extend '''ICollection'''. An '''IDictionary''' implementation is a collection of key/value pairs, like the '''Hashtable''' class. An '''IList''' implementation is a collection of values and its members can be accessed by index, like the ArrayList class.

:::Some collections that limit access to their elements, such as the '''Queue''' class and the '''Stack''' class, directly implement the '''ICollection''' interface.

:::If neither the '''IDictionary''' interface nor the '''IList''' interface meet the requirements of the required collection, derive the new collection class from the '''ICollection''' interface instead for more flexibility.

:::The following tables list the members exposed by the ICollection type. 

:::'''Public Properties'''

   '''''Count''''' - Gets the number of elements contained in the ICollection.  
   '''''IsSynchronized''''' - Gets a value indicating whether access to the ICollection is synchronized (thread safe).  
   '''''SyncRoot''''' - Gets an object that can be used to synchronize access to the ICollection.  
 
:::'''Public Methods'''

   '''''CopyTo''''' - Copies the elements of the ICollection to an Array, starting at a particular Array index.   

::IList interface - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ilist.aspx MSDN]

::IEqualityComparer interface - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.iequalitycomparer.aspx MSDN]

::IKeyComparer interface - '''IKeyComparer does not exist in .Net 2.0'''

===== Iterators =====

See [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dscyy5s0.aspx MSDN]

:An iterator is effectively a lightweight version of the IEnumerable interface. It is primarily used with foreach statements.

:You will normally implement the GetEnumerator method of the IEnumerable interface.

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;public class&lt;/font&gt; Colors : System.Collections.IEnumerable
 {
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;string&lt;/font&gt;[] colors = { &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot; };
     
     &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; System.Collections.IEnumerator GetEnumerator()
     {
         &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;for&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; i = 0; i &lt; colors.Length; i++)
         {
             yield &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; colors[i];
         }
     }
 }

:This enables the class to be accessed using a standard foreach statement. A class is not restricted to implementing only a single iterator. Multiple iterators can be supplied, for example to enable iteration in both ascending and descending order of a list. To call a named iterator, use the following syntax:

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/font&gt; (&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; i &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;in&lt;/font&gt; myList.NamedIterator())
 {
     System.Console.WriteLine(i);
 }

:The yield statement marks a point where execution of a iterator will resume on a subsequent iteration. This can be used to supply multiple yield statements:

 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;public&lt;/font&gt; System.Collections.IEnumerator GetEnumerator()
 {
     yield &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; &quot;Statement returned on iteration 1&quot;;
     yield &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;return&lt;/font&gt; &quot;Statement returned on iteration 2&quot;;
 }

:To end the iteration programmatically, use the

 yield break;

:statement.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

====Using generic collections====

'''Exam objective: '''Improve type safety and application performance in a .NET Framework application by using generic collections.

(Refer System.Collections.Generic namespace [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.generic(vs.80).aspx MSDN ])

=====Collection.Generic interfaces=====

:Generic IComparable interface - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4d7sx9hd(VS.80).aspx MSDN]

::Note that IComparable&lt;T&gt; is a member of the System namespace.

::You use this interface when you create a class and you want it to be used with generic types that support ordering (ex. SortedList&lt;T&gt; or List&lt;T&gt;.Sort()) without having to specify a comparer object. The only method of IComparable&lt;T&gt; is CompareTo&lt;T&gt;(T other). There is an example on MSDN. 

::The following example implements IComparable&lt;T&gt; for a custom made Point class. The example uses a List&lt;T&gt; instead of a SortedList&lt;T&gt; or OrderedDictionnary&lt;T&gt; because the comparaison is done based on the distance of the points from the origin which can give the same value for many points.

::The Comparer&lt;T&gt; class serves as a base class to easily implement the IComparer&lt;T&gt; interface.

::The example is the same then for the IComparable&lt;T&gt; except that now a Comparer&lt;T&gt; derived object is given to the List&lt;T&gt;.Sort() method instead of implementing the IComparable&lt;T&gt; interface on Point. 

::This way of proceding has 2 advantages:
::* It can be used even if you dont have access to the source code of Point
::* You can have more than one Comparer derived class for the same Point class

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let V be a vector space, and let H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are all subspaces of V. V is defined to be a direct sum of H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; when

#For every x within V, there is x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; within H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; such that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i=1}^n x_n&lt;/math&gt;
#When x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is within H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_n=\sum_{i=1}^n y_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;implies that x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

The second condition can easily be proven to be equivalent to the following statement:

When x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i=1}^n x_n=0&lt;/math&gt;

implies that all x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are also equal to 0.

Because of the second condition, the intersection of any two of the subspaces involved in a direct sum is the single element {0} where 0 is the 0 vector. This implies that all n dimension spaces are a direct sum of n one-dimension subspaces.

==Theorem==
If V is a vector space, then for any subspace H, there exists a subspace G such that V is a direct sum of H and G.

===Proof===

Let {e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;} be a basis of H. This can be extended to a basis of V, say, {e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}. 
Then the space G spanned by {e&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;k+2&lt;/sub&gt;,..., e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} is such that V is a direct sum of H and G.

==General Sums==
Given a vector space V, and H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are all subspaces of V, then V is a sum of H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are all subspaces of V when all elements of V can be expressed as a sum of elements in H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Exercises==
#Prove that the second condition is equivalent to the following statement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, then&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i=1}^n x_n=0&lt;/math&gt;
#Prove that the intersection of of any two of the subspaces involved in a direct sum is the single element {0} where 0 is the 0 vector.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Let V be a vector space over a field F, and let H be a subspace. Define an equivalence relation where '''x''' and '''y''' within V are said to be equivalent when '''x'''-'''y''' is an element of H. Define the sum of two equivalence classes X and Y to be the equivalence containing '''x'''+'''y''' when '''x''' is within X and '''y''' is within Y, and the scalar multiple aX where a is an element of F to be the equivalence class containing a'''x''' when '''x''' is an element of X.

Sums are well-defined because if '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' are within X and '''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' are within Y, then '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''+'''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''-('''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''+'''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''')=('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''-'''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''')+('''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''-'''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''') which is an element of H, so their sums are equivalent.

Scalar multiples are also well-defined because if '''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' are within X and a is an element of F, then a'''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''-a'''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''=a('''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''-'''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''') which is an element of H, so they are equivalent.

Given equivalence classes X and Y and an element '''x''' within X and '''y''' within Y and '''z''' within Z and an elements '''a''' and '''b''' within F, X+Y and Y+X both contain '''x'''+'''y''' and so are the same, (X+Y)+Z and X+(Y+Z) both contain '''x'''+'''y'''+'''z''' and so are the same, H is the identity for addition since any for any h within H, (x+h)-x=h which is within H, so X+H=X, and the equivalence class containing '''-x''' is the inverse of X, 1X contains 1'''x'''='''x''' and so is the same as X, a(bX) and (ab)X both contain ab'''x''' and so are the same, and (a+b)X and aX+bX are the same since they both contain a'''x'''+b'''x''' and a(X+Y) and aX+aY are the same since they both contain a'''x'''+a'''y'''.

The above paragraph establishes that the equivalence classes with addition and scalar multiplication as define also form a vector space, called the '''quotient space'''. This vector space is denoted V/H.

==Theorem==
If V has dimension d and H has dimension s, then V/H has dimension d-s.
===Proof===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Having went over vector spaces, we now combine the ideas of bases and dimension with the vector spaces, and the ideas of linear dependence and rank applied earlier. We will apply these important ideas to the general solution of m linear equations of n variables.

==Definitions==

Suppose we have an a field F and an m×n matrix of elements of F, and let r be the rank of that matrix.

Consider the columns or rows of the matrix are elements of a vector space where addition and scalar multiplication were [[Linear_Algebra/Linear_Dependance_of_Columns|defined before]]. One can easily check that they form a vector space.

Let M be a minor of the matrix F with order r. This minor is called the basis minor, and the columns and rows of this minor are called the basis columns and basis rows. The column space and row space of a matrix are respectively the vector spaces spanned by the columns and rows of the matrix.

==Theorem==
The dimension of both the basis and column spaces of a matrix are both equal to r, the rank of the matrix, and the basis columns (or rows) form a basis for the column (or row) space.
===Proof===
===Corollaries===
#Any n columns are linearly dependent when n&gt;r.
#The columns (or rows) of a matrix are linearly dependent when the number of columns (or rows) is greater than the rank, and are linearly independent when the number of columns (or rows) is equal to the rank.
#The maximum number of linearly independent rows equals the maximum number of linearly independent columns.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A homogeneous system of linear equations are linear equations of the form

&lt;math&gt;a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3+\ldots+a_{1n}x_n=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3+\ldots+a_{2n}x_n=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_{31}x_1+a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3+\ldots+a_{3n}x_n=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_{m1}x_1+a_{m2}x_2+a_{m3}x_3+\ldots+a_{mn}x_n=0&lt;/math&gt;

The trivial solution is when all x&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to 0.

Consider the matrix of coefficients

&lt;math&gt;A=\left(\begin{matrix}
a_{11}&amp;a_{12}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{1n}\\
a_{21}&amp;a_{22}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{2n}\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots\\
a_{m1}&amp;a_{m2}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{mn}
\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

A linear combination of the columns of A where the sum is equal to the column of 0's is a solution to this homogeneous system. A solution where not all x&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to 0 happens when the columns are linearly dependent, which happens when the rank of A is less than the number of columns. However, if the rank is equal to the number of columns, then all the columns are linearly independent, so then the only solution is the trivial one.

==Kronecker-Capelli Theorem==
The general system of linear equations has a solution if the rank of A is equal to the rank of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and has no solution if the the rank of A is less than the rank of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
===Proof===
The system of linear equations has a solution only when the last column of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a linear combination of the other columns. If that is so, then by [[Linear_Algebra/Span_of_a_set#Theorem_2|a theorem proven earlier]], the column span of A is the same as the column span of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so their ranks are the same.
Now, suppose that their ranks are the same. Then the basis columns of A also form a basis column of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; since they have column spans of the same dimension. Thus, their column spans are the same, and so the last column also belongs to the column span of A, and so is linearly dependent on the other columns, this linear dependence is the solution to this system of equations.
Suppose that the rank of A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than A. This implies that
Another proof is if we sopose that the rank of A is r ,so if b is linear with {a1,a2....ar} it proof that the rank of {a1,a2...ar,b} is r,so the theorem is solved, But if the b is not kombination with system (a1,a2.....ar),it means that the system (a1,a2...ar,b) is a base of system (a1....an,b), if we atach any ai/r&lt;i&lt;n,the system (a1,a2...ar,b,ai}is linear it mean that system (a1,a2.....ar,b)is a base of {a1,a2.....an.b),so the rank of (a1,a2.....an,b)is equal with Rank(A)+1. So we can not solve the system,

      <text xml:space="preserve">Suppose we have a general system of linear equations, and consider its basis columns by its coefficient matrix. Subtract the variables corresponding to those columns from both sides. The remaining variables can be solved using Cramer's rule using the determinants formed by its basis minor.

'''''Veratrum viride''''' ('''Indian Poke''', '''Indian Hellebore''', ''' False Hellebore''', '''Green False Hellebore''') is a woodland herbaceous plant native to eastern and western (but not central) North America.&lt;ref name=fna&gt;Flora of North America: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=242102051 ''Veratrum viride'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usda&gt;USDA Plants Profile: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=VEVI ''Veratrum viride'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?41142 ''Veratrum viride'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely toxic, and is considered a pest plant by farmers with livestock. The species has acquired a large number of common names within its native range, including American False Hellebore, American White Hellebore, Bear Corn, Big Hellebore, Corn Lily, Devils Bite, Duck Retten, Indian Hellebore, Itch-weed, Itchweed, Poor Annie, and Tickleweed.

It is a herbaceous perennial plant reaching 0.7-2 m tall, with a solid green stem. The leaves are spirally arranged, 10–35 cm long and 5–20 cm broad, elliptic to broad lanceolate ending in a short point, heavily ribbed and hairy on the underside. The flowers are numerous, produced in a large branched inflorescence 30–70 cm tall; each flower is 5–12 mm long, with six green to yellow-green tepals. The fruit is a capsule 1.5–3 cm long, which splits into three sections at maturity to release the numerous flat 8–10 mm diameter seeds. The plant reproduces through rhizome growth as well as seeds.&lt;ref name=fna/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc&gt;Plants of British Columbia: [http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/Atlas/Atlas.aspx?sciname=Veratrum+viride ''Veratrum viride'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jeps&gt;Jepson Flora [http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?Veratrum+viride ''Veratrum viride'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colombia&gt;Columbia River Gorge plants: [http://web.archive.org/web/20040514025137/http://ghs.gresham.k12.or.us/science/ps/nature/gorge/3petal/lily/green.htm Green False Hellebore]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two varieties:&lt;ref name=fna/&gt;
*'''''Veratrum viride'' var. ''viride'''''. Eastern North America. Side branches of inflorescence erect or spreading.
*'''''Veratrum viride'' var. ''eschscholzianum''''' (Roemer &amp; Schultes) Breitung. Western North America. Side branches of inflorescence drooping.

The related western North American ''[[../Veratrum californicum/]]'' (White False Hellebore) can be distinguished from sympatric var. ''eschscholzianum'' by its whiter flowers, with erect side branches of the inflorescence.&lt;ref name=colombia/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
In eastern North America, var. ''viride'' occurs from southwestern Labrador and southern Quebec south to northern Georgia. In the west, var. ''eschscholzianum'' occurs from Alaska and Northwest Territory south through Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon to northern California.&lt;ref name=fna/&gt;&lt;ref name=grin/&gt;

It is found in wet soils in meadows and open forests, from sea level in the north of the range, up to 1,600 m in the southeast and 2,500 m in the southwest.&lt;ref name=fna/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc/&gt;&lt;ref name=jeps/&gt;

==Medicine==
The plant is highly toxic, causing nausea and vomiting. If the poison is not evacuated, cold sweat and vertigo appears. Respiration slows, cardiac rhythm and blood pressure falls, eventually leading to death.
It is used externally by several Native American nations for external treatment. Although is rarely ever used modern herbalism due to its concentration of various alkaloids, it has been used in the past against high blood pressure and rapid heartbeat. The root contains even higher concentrations than the aerial parts.&lt;ref name=pfaf&gt;Plants for a Future: [http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Veratrum+viride ''Veratrum viride'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant was used by some tribes to elect a new leader. All the candidates would eat the root, and the last to start vomiting would become the new leader.&lt;ref&gt;Fleurbec Group (ed), 1981, ''Plantes cauvages comestibles''. Saint-henri-de-Lévis, Quebec, Canada. ISBN 2-920174-03-7&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Without Calculus ==
# The most important thing to notice in this problem is that there is no force in the horizontal direction: so there is no horizontal acceleration, and therefore the horizontal velocity is constant.
## From trigonometry (draw a figure and find the right triangle with) &lt;math&gt;v_x = v_0 cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
## Same as above, &lt;math&gt;v_y = v_0 sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
## Because &lt;math&gt;a_x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_x = v_0 cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
## Note that at the top, the cannon ball is neither moving higher or lower (by definition), so the vertical velocity must be: &lt;math&gt;v_y = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
## Again, because &lt;math&gt;a_x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_x = v_0 cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
## One easy way to find this is by symmetry. In general (esp. if the final height is not the same as the initial height), we can use conservation of energy (but you most likely haven't learned this yet). &lt;math&gt;v_y = -v_0 sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. The negative sign denotes the downward direction.
# This problem uses what is called [[Wikipedia:Galilean relativity|Galilean relativity]]. Arithmatics used here are approximately correct only at speeds much less than speed of light, ''c'', which is correct for every day objects.
## &lt;p&gt;'''5 km/h'''. Keep in mind that velocity is a vector, and add two velocities vectorially. By the Pythagorean theorem, her speed relative to shore is given by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{v_{\mathrm{boat}}^2 + v_{\mathrm{walk}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plugging in the given numbers yields the answer above.&lt;/p&gt;
## '''53.1 deg'''. The easiest way to see this is by drawing two vectors tails together (so that you can see the triangle). The angle, which is the angle between the sum of two vectors and the direction north, can be found in terms of inverse tangent of ratio of the legs: &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan(4/3)&lt;/math&gt;, which has the approximate value given above.

== With Calculus ==
# This problem is more or less a calculus exercise (which is why we told you to ignore units for this problem&amp;mdash;it's not very physical).
## &lt;p&gt;Remember '''speed''' is the scalar quantity equal to the magnitude of the velocity vector. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;v(t) = \sqrt{(sin(t))^2 + e^{2t}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
## &lt;p&gt;For this, remember that in general,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \int_0^t v(t) dt'&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performing the integral separately for each perpendicular direction gives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(t) = -cos(t)~\hat{x} + e^t~\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the integration constant is zero because we start out at origin.&lt;/p&gt;
## &lt;p&gt;Remember that acceleration is also a vector quantity. This is same as above, except this time, you perform a derivative, since &lt;math&gt;\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. After the differentiation, we get:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{a}(t) = cos(t)~\hat{x} + e^t~\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'''''Viburnum  prunifolium''''' ('''Blackhaw''', also spelled '''Black haw''', '''Blackhaw Viburnum''', or '''Stag Bush'''), is a species of small trees or large shrubs native to southeastern North America, from Connecticut west to eastern Kansas, and south to Alabama and Texas.&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?41408 ''Viburnum prunifolium'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Viburnum prunifolium USDA2.jpg|left|thumb|Flowers]]
It is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to 2–9 m tall with a short crooked trunk and stout spreading branches; in the northern parts of its range, it is a shrub, becoming a small tree in the southern parts of its range. The bark is reddish-brown, very rough on old stems. The branchlets are red at first, then green, finally dark brown tinged with red. The winter buds are coated with rusty tomentum. The flower buds ovate, 1 cm long, much larger than the axillary buds. The leaves are simple, up to 9 cm long and 6 cm broad, oval, ovate or orbicular, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, serrate, acute, with serrated edges with a grooved and slightly winged red petiole 1.5 cm long; they turn red in fall. The leaves are superficially similar to some species of ''[[../Prunus/]]'' (thus &quot;''prunifolium''&quot;); they come out of the bud involute, shining, green, tinged with red, sometimes smooth, or clothed with rusty tomentum; when full grown dark green and smooth above, pale, smooth or tomentose beneath.&lt;ref name=missouriplants&gt;Missouriplants: [http://www.missouriplants.com/Whiteopp/Viburnum_prunifolium_page.html ''Viburnum prunifolium'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|pages=279|title=The Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plants: A practical reference guide to more than 550 key medicinal plants and their uses|author=Andrew Chevallier|year=1996|publisher=Reader's Digest|id=ISBN 0-88850-546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keeler&gt;{{cite book | last =Keeler | first =H.

The flowers are creamy white, 9 mm diameter; the calyx is urn-shaped, five-toothed, persistent; the corolla is five-lobed, with rounded lobes, imbricate in bud; the five stamens alternate with the corolla lobes, the filaments slender, the anthers pale yellow, oblong, two-celled, the cells opening longitudinally; the ovary is inferior, one-celled, with a thick, pale green style and a flat stigma and a single ovule. The flowers are borne in flat-topped cymes 10 cm in diameter in mid to late spring. The fruit is a drupe 1 cm long, dark blue-black with glaucous bloom, hangs until winter, becomes edible after being frosted, then eaten by birds; the stone is flat and even, broadly oval. Wherever it lives, black haw prefers sunny woodland with well-drained soil and adequate water.&lt;ref name=missouriplants/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keeler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Castleman/&gt;

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==

&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
It has both value in the pleasure garden, providing good fall color and early winter provender for birds, and medicinal properties.

It has hybridized with ''[[../Viburnum lentago/]]'' in cultivation, to give the garden hybrid ''[[../Viburnum × jackii/]]''.

The wood is brown tinged with red; heavy, hard, close-grained with a density of 0.8332.&lt;ref name=Keeler/&gt;

===Medicinal uses===
For centuries, black haw has been used for medical purposes, mainly for gynecological conditions. The bark is the part of the plant used in treatments.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

The active components include scopoletin, aesculetin, salicin, 1-methyl-2,3 clibutyl hemimellitate, and viburnin. Tannin is another chemical component of black haw.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

Native Americans used a decoction of black haw to treat gynecological conditions, including menstrual cramps, aiding recovery after childbirth, and in treating the effects of menopause.&lt;ref name=Castleman/&gt; As a folk remedy, black haw has been used to treat menstrual pain, and morning sickness. Due to its antispasmodic properties, the plant may also be of use in treating cramps of the digestive tract or the bile ducts.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

Black haw's primary use was to prevent miscarriages.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;American slaveholders also used the plant to prevent abortions. Slaves were a valuable asset, and their owner also owned their offspring, so ensuring that female slaves gave birth was of paramount importance. In defiance, some slave women would attempt to use cotton seeds to cause a miscarriage. The slaveowners would therefore force pregnant slaves to drink an infusion of black haw to prevent that.&lt;ref name=Castleman/&gt;

The primary use of black haw today is to prevent menstrual cramps. The salicin in black haw may also be of use in pain relief.&lt;ref name=Castleman/&gt;

===Safety issues===
As black haw contains salicin, a chemical relative of aspirin, people who are allergic to that substance should not use black haw.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; In addition, due to the connection between aspirin and Reye's syndrome, young people or people afflicted with a viral disease should not use black haw.

The chemicals in black haw do relax the uterus and therefore probably prevent miscarriage; however, the salicin may be teratogenic. Consequently, pregnant women should not use black haw.&lt;ref name=Castleman/&gt; Furthermore, anyone using herbs for medical reasons should only use them under the supervision of a qualified medical professional.

Black haw is not on the FDA's &quot;generally recognized as safe list&quot;.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web|title=SUBSTANCES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|work=Code of Federal Regulations - Title 21, Volume 6|date=2006-04-01|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=582&amp;showFR=1|accessdate=2007-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I'm planning to pull some of the wiki content that we use for study skills in other sources onto this page.  If I can find the time to do it, this should lead to some significant changes over the next 6 months.  If anyone's involved in managing this page and wants to touch base with me, could you please comment on this blog post - http://massageonline.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/study-skills/  ? Cheers --[[Special:Contributions/202.49.0.2|202.49.0.2]] ([[User talk:202.49.0.2|talk]]) 22:06, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

Hey this place looks pretty good already. It's definately not &quot;struggling&quot; anymore. Are there any other people who take regular care of this Wikibook? [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 13:34, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I have seen a good 'Dutch' book on this subject. It's going to take a while to summarise it (translating into English won't be that tough though). Carry On --[[User:83.116.2.193|83.116.2.193]] 13:15, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Looked good until: &quot;If you come to an essay question that you are not prepared for, you can try stating that you weren't prepared for it, and then substitute in its place an equally difficult question for which you WERE prepared and answer that instead. The idea is to demonstrate the strong points in your absorption of the material, rather than allow yourself to be penalized by what you don't know&quot;. THIS IS THE ONE THING YOU MUST NEVER DO! Never try to answer a question that is not asked. The result will only be that the examiner ignores all your hard work, as it was a question '''that was not set'''! If no one has any objections within a week, I propose to delete this rubbish. Any standardised, decent exam will have a syllabus and the questions will stick to that syllabus --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 18:00, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== honey-tongue ==

Someone needs to explain the &quot;honey-tongue&quot; technique.  I added a link to wikipedia a while back, hoping someone would explain it, but not so far.  --[[User:160.36.156.243|160.36.156.243]] 22:38, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: This book currently says
: ''&quot;honey-tongue&quot; Cicero used this technique thousands of years ago to memorize his...''

: At first I, like the anonymous writer above, thought this was introducing the next technique, meaning &quot;Cicero used the &quot;honey-tongue&quot; technique ...&quot;.
: But now I'm starting to think it's a continuation of the previously-mentioned technique, and the original author meant something more like &quot;This technique was also used by the smooth-talking Cicero ...&quot;, where &quot;honey-tongue&quot; is merely an adjective describing Cicero, and &quot;this technique&quot; refers to the previously-mentioned [[Wikipedia: method of loci]].
: That interpretation seems consistent with the mention of Cicero at [[Wikipedia: art of memory]].
: There's no such thing as a &quot;honey-tongue&quot; memorization technique, right? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 22:29, 10 December 2009 (UTC)

== I think It's Enough ==

Hello! Sorry that i'm not logged in but although you can click on the link for my Wikibook user page [[User:Mastermind_007|Mastermind 007]]. The thing I wanted to say was that you can remove the link of Study Skills from &quot;Requested Wikibooks&quot; because it looks fine and it's enough to teach one how to guide himself for studies especially. I'll add your Wikibook as an external link in &quot;How To Become A Good Student&quot; &amp; you can make it a little formal (language). Have a good day!

...People (especially those that have managed to advance in life and to hold a high position) do not like someone (especially staying below them) to express own ideas even if they are more than obvious. This upsets their mental equilibrium and they react to this &quot;intervention&quot; trying to redress the balance exactly as an op-amp reacts to any [[w:Virtual_ground#Internal circuit node|intervention to virtual ground]]:) Contrary, people adopt willingly, use and benefit from ''nobody's ideas''.

... You and your likes  have cognitive, emotional and moral problems predestining your behavior here, in Wikipedia. Your great problem is that you do not see the concepts behind circuits; you ''do not see the forest behind the trees''. You know perfectly the specific circuit implementations but you can't generalize them into a functional block-diagram and a universal operational algorithm. Simply, you know circuits but you do not understand them; as a result, you can't explain them to readers so that they to understand them. The main reason for this behavior is your unwillingness to see the existing connection between apparently different phenomena (both electrical and non-electrical) in this world, to establish associations between them, to use analogies...

Besides this cognitive problem you have emotional problems as well. Actually, you do not like circuits; circuitry is more job than favorite pursuit for you. Contrary to you, I like circuits and great ideas behind them; I love them; I adore them. Circuitry is my vocation, my pet pursuit. I created this page three years ago with plenty of love placing all the best of my abilities here. To show the truth behind these legendary circuits, I show their evolution from passive to active version: first, I have introduced passive versions looking at Ohm's law from two points; then, I have considered their imperfections and finally, I have found a remedy converting the passive versions into active ones. Later, I realized that, in this form, the article did not match the specific encyclopedic Wikipedia style and it had to be rewritten. Then I gave this opportunity to wikipedians and began creating a series of [[Circuit idea|Circuit idea]] stories about them ([[Circuit_Idea/Passive_Voltage-to-Current_Converter|1]], [[Circuit_Idea/Op-amp_Inverting_Voltage-to-Current_Converter|2]], [[Circuit_Idea/Passive_Current-to-Voltage_Converter|3]], [[Circuit_Idea/Op-amp_Inverting_Current-to-Voltage_Converter|4]] and [[Circuit_Idea/Op-amp_Inverting_Current-to-Voltage_Converter_Visualized|5]]). I agree with you the form has to be changed but the main points of the content have to be kept. As all you can (already) see, both the V-to-I and I-to-V op-amp inverting configurations are based on the same powerful Miller's idea - ''modifying (zeroing) the impedance by adding a proportional voltage''. I have discerned this common great idea in these specific circuits and I would like to share this simple truth with people. Will you keep it in your &quot;about 3 paragraphs&quot;? No, you will remove it; you will remove the truth about these circuits and will leave only banal, specific and formal &quot;explanations&quot; that do not explain anything; you will ''hide the forest behind the trees''.

You have boasted of your famous tutors at university. Well, it is wonderful that they were teaching perfectly circuit analysis to their alumni. But it would be also very well if they were showing concepts behind circuits and finally, if they were bringing up some elementary human ethics to them. Because, if you had such morals, when encountering a mind that excels (in some respect) yours, you would not consider his/her success as your unsuccess; you would not destroy else's creations or (worse) instigate stupidity and mediocrity to do this and then enjoy seeing the results... You would try to rise to his/her level instead to pull down him/her to your level; you would admire his/her achievements; you would join and improve them (what is the great Wikipedia idea); you would be wikipedian, not the opposite. If you respect the elementary Wikipedia ethics, you would restore the link to the most popular [[w:Operational_amplifier_applications#Inverting integrator|op-amp Miller integrator]] or [[w:Charge amplifier|current integrator]] in the [[w:Miller effect]] page that you have removed absolutely intentionally.

... Looking at a problem in a different way can sometimes lead to new  
ideas.  Just to give a simple example (Fig. 1), consider the attenuator  
(Figure a) and the well-known non-inverting amplifier (Figures b and  
c) shown in the pdf attachment.

The equation (4-1) for the attenuator shows that the input voltage V1  
is attenuated to V2 depending on the values of the two resistors.   
Equation 4-1 can be solved for V1 as in Equation 4-2, where V1 is  
great than V2, so that amplification has occurred.  Of course this  
can’t happen with two resistors because it would involve the creation  
of energy.  However, if the required energy is supplied from an  
external source, such as an operational amplifier (resulting in a  
conventional non-inverting amplifier as in Figure b, more usually  
drawn as in Figure c) the equation can be satisfied.

I often manipulated circuits in this way, drawing a “box” with the  
input and output I required and then figuring out what I needed to do  
to get the desired result.  This may seem obvious, but the idea was  
think about supplying energy to an attenuator to make it an amplifier  
after rearranging the equation told me what was needed.  This type of  
thinking can enable one to create...

Subject: How to reverse circuit ports by applying negative feedback (Re: Re: Deboo integrator)


Dear Gordon,


Reading your last email, I was deeply struk by your idea of how to transmute a voltage divider into a non-inverting amplifier. Will you believe me that for the first time I consider a valuable circuit idea with someone? Today's people do not like to think about fundamental ideas and principles. Every time when I tried to discuss some basic circuit idea I run upon the rocks...

[[Image:Reversed_divider_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2. A &quot;reversed&quot; voltage divider.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Surprise.''' Imagine my amazement when I was reading your excellent explanations (I suppose that the scanned page is from your book) because the same great idea conceived in my mind in the early 1990s! Then I was writing down (regrettably, in Bulgarian) all the ideas arising in my mind on squared sheets of A5 paper. I have scanned especially for you the yellowed record that I made on May 14, 1992 at my home (I was writing the circumstances surrounding the recorded idea on the top of the sheet; now, I continue doing the same). 

'''&quot;Reversed&quot; voltage divider.''' This is the title of the record, which is eloquent; the drawing too. As you can see, I have drawn (likewise you on Fig. b) the circuit with an unusual shape to show the basic idea in the best way; also, I have colored the added op-amp in a different blue color. The idea is the same: to make the passive voltage divider work conversely we supply it by an additional (properly supplied) op-amp that observes the difference between the divider's output voltage and the actual input voltage. As a result, the op-amp adjusts its output voltage Vout so that an R2/(R1 + R2) part of it to be equal to the input voltage Vin. Thus, the old output voltage VR2 is always equal to the new input voltage Vin; the old divider's input voltage serves as a new output voltage Vout = (R1 + R2)/R2.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Non-inv_lever_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. A lever &quot;divider&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Mechanical analogy.''' On another sheet, I have described a lever analogy of a non-inverting amplifier that exploits the same powerful idea. A man is looking continuously at point A (the output of the &quot;lever divider&quot;) and is comparing its height Hin' with the input height Hin. If there is a difference between them, the man moves the end of the lever (the point B) to make Hin' = Hin. As a result, Hout/Hin = (l1 + l2)/l1. By the way, this second-class lever analogy is more truthful than the third-class lever analogy of non-inverting amplifier presented by Tony Kuphald in his [http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/electricCircuits/Semi/SEMI_8.html#xtocid156014 Lessons in Electric Circuits].

'''Human analogies.''' Thinking about the essence of this phenomenon, I began discerning similar manifestations in many everyday situations (some of them -quite funny:)&lt;br&gt;
'''''Secretary &gt; boss.''''' Imagine a male chief that has a beautiful female secretary (or v.v.:); so, he indulges the pretty woman satisfying all her wishes. As a result, the boss thinks that he manages the secretary but, actually, the secretary leads the chief by the nose:)&lt;br&gt;
'''''Wife &gt; husband.''''' Similarly, husbands that indulge their wives think that they manage their wives; actually, wives manage their husbands:) Generally speaking, women lead men by the nose in this world:)&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:My cat Futie.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. My cat Futie leads me by the nose:(&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''''Cat &gt; owner.''''' I am also a victim of this phenomenon. I think that I manage my (female) cat Futie; but giving a portion of food to &quot;her&quot; every time when &quot;she&quot; says &quot;miaou&quot; actually, the cat leads me by the nose:(

'''Generalization.''' Finally, I made a general conclusion that systems with negative feedback have the unique property to reverse the cause and effect relations between the input and output quantities of the objects. In this way, they can &quot;reverse&quot; the objects. Imagine a block diagram where a converter implementing a function y = f(x) is connected in the feedback loop; as a result, the whole nfb system will implement the reverse function Y = F(X), where Y = x, X = y and F = 1/f. 

'''Applications.''' For our purposes in electronics, we can use this technique to swap the converter's ports (especially of the one-way devices) by connecting them into the feedback loop. From this viewpoint, an [[w:Voltage-to-current converter#Keeping a constant current by applying a negative feedback|active voltage-to-current converter]] is actually a reversed [[Circuit Idea/Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter|passive current-to-voltage converter]], an op-amp non-inverting amplifier is a reversed voltage divider (your idea), an op-amp integrator is a reversed differentiator and v.v., an op-amp logarithmic converter is a reversed antilogarithmic converter and v.v., an analog-to-digital converter is a reversed digital-to-analog converter, etc. Another very interesting example is a transdiode that is actually a transistor connected in the op-amp feedback loop; in this odd and never explained circuit configuration, the collector current is the input quantity (?!?) while the base-emitter voltage is the output quantity (?!?) Maybe, the same trick is used in the input part of a current mirror - the active diode, which is actually a transistor with parallel negative feedback (again, although it seems strange, the collector current serves as an input quantity while the base-emitter voltage serves as an output quantity)...

'''Popularization.''' Gordon, I am sure you will say &quot;Oh&quot; when you see the picture below (Fig. 5):) Here is the story about it.

[[Image:ShortPaper22_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5. A story about reversing the causality by applying negative feedback.&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the end of 1990s, I prepared a series of 22 short 1-page articles under the title ''How to invent circuits''. I designed them for ''Popular electronics'' (later ''Poptronics'') magazine. Only, ''Poptronics'' ceased and I refused all the print undertaking and moved to the web. A few years later I put all the ready stories into a pdf file. As you can see, the story on the page 14 (with a title ''Compensating by injecting a current'') is dedicated to your great integrator. The last story (''Let's reverse causality!''), which is not completed, is dedicated to the present idea. See the picture on the right - it is exactly as your picture! Is it not amazing that the same idea and the same picture can conceive in different minds? Below the left figure is written in red &quot;a normal divider&quot;; above the right figure is written &quot;a reversed divider&quot;.

In the beginning of 2000s I began creating [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com circuit-fantasia.com]. Then I included this basic idea in a hierarchical circuit idea [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/collections/circuit-collection/menus/old-menus/modified-circuits.html classification] (time was when I was thinking that this collection was my supreme achievement but others were not thinking as me; so, I did not obtain the recognition that I had expected). Later, I used this technique (likewise you) as a possible way to &quot;invent&quot; the non-inverting amplifier. By the way, another possible way of &quot;inventing&quot; is to &quot;disturb&quot; an op-amp voltage follower by putting an attenuation R2/(R1 + R2) into the feedback loop. As a result, it &quot;reacts&quot; to this intervention by (R1 + R2)/R2 amplification (see [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/my-students/ske2004/classes/current-ske-8.htm Class Exercise 8: Op-amp Amplifiers with Negative Feedback]). I have named this great principle &quot;attenuation causes amplification&quot;. Actually, it represents the main property of negative feedback systems to compensate disturbances).

'''Circuit idea.''' I have reserved a special place for this &quot;reversing causality&quot; phenomenon in the contents of [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] (see the section about negative feedback). I imagine that this part has to contain an introductory &quot;philosophical&quot; story and a series of specific stories dedicated to various circuits based on this idea. I would like to include in some way your materials in these stories. There are a lot of possibilities to do that.

For example, you can develop a story about &quot;inventing&quot; a non-inverting amplifier based on your idea exposed on the scanned text. It may consist of a text based on the image or a few paragraphs and the very scanned image included. If you do not want to do that, I might cite your text and include the original image into the story. Or, I can share with readers in the discussion page how I thought that... but ...

Gordon, believe me, your way of thinking in this material is even more valuable than the same idea. Thinking in this way, young people can invent new circuits. But yet, have you reveal this great idea? Have you written this text (I mean the scan)? Is this published and where? Can I place a link pointing to the source where it is published? It is extremely useful for [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]], if you send me more clever circuit ideas...

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think that the wording &quot;temporaries are const objects by default&quot; is incorrect. If this was true, then it wouldn't be possible to do &quot;this-&gt;resource_ = 0&quot; in operator proxy(), because code that modifies a constant object has undefined behavior.

The real reason for auto_ptr-style workaround is that function calls (temporary objects holding return values) are rvalues (C++98 standard, 5.2.2#10: &quot;A function call is an lvalue if and only if the result type is a reference&quot;), and rvalues can only be bound to const references (8.5.3#5).

The result is that one can implement move semantics by tricking this artificial limitation without using debatable techniques such as const_cast. The new C++09 standard will introduce rvalue references, which will make the workaround unnecessary.

[[Image:GreeceCrete.png|thumb|right|The location of the island of Crete within modern Greece.]]The '''Minoan culture''' was a Bronze Age civilization that existed on the Greek Aegean island of Crete from around 3000 to 1100 BCE. By around 1450, however, the Minoans had been replaced by the Mycenaeans as the dominant culture of the area. The name &quot;Minoan&quot; itself comes from the famous British archeologist Sir Arthur Evans, who from 1900 to 1906 excavated the palace at Knossos, which he believed to be the capital of the empire of the mythical King Minos.

==History==
Greek archeologist Nikolaos Platon devised a loose chronology of the civilization based on excavations of Minoan palaces. He divides the civilization into the following eras:

===Prepalatial period (3000-1900)===
Archeological evidence shows that Crete may have been inhabited as early as the seventh millennium BCE. New settlers skilled in metallurgy arrived by the end of the fourth millennium BCE, and replaced the earlier Neolithic peoples.

===Protopalatial period (1900-1700)===
[[Image:Knossos_Palais_2.JPG|thumb|right|400px|The semi-restored ruins of the palace of Knossos.]]The first large palaces (most notably at Knossos and Phaistos) were built during the Protopalatial period, leading to more urbanized life and centralized political authority. Around 1700, the major palaces were all destroyed (perhaps due to natural causes, such as an earthquake, or perhaps an invasion from Anatolia).

===Neopalatial period (1700-1450)===
After their destruction, the palaces soon were rebuilt, giving rise to the Neopalatial period. This period represents the apex of Minoan civilization. Population increased, new settlements were built, and impressive art, architecture, and technologies (such as plumbing) were developed. Despite these many advances, the Minoans suffered some sort of catastrophe around 1450.

===Final Palace period (1450-1380 BCE)===
Many theories have been put forth to the cause of this sudden and rapid decline. Theories include a massive volcanic eruption of Mt. Thera on the nearby island of Santorini, internal strife, or an invasion from the Mycenean culture of mainland Greece. A combination of these factors is likely the true culprit. Regardless of the reason, the Minoan culture was effectively replaced by the Myceneans by 1420. Excavations reveal that pottery and writings from Crete after 1450 resemble those of mainland Greece more so than those of pre-1450 Crete. Knossos then served as the administrative center of Mycenean Crete, until it was destroyed by fire in 1380.

===Postpalatial period (1380-1100 BCE)===
After the destruction of Knossos, economic and political influence shifted to the town of Khaniá. Despite this, Cretan civilization began to further decline, and many Minoan sites were abandoned. Khondros is one of few new sites to be settled during this period. The last Minoan site to fall was the isolated mountain town of Karfi, which was able to resist assimilation into the Mycenean culture until the early Iron Age. The widespread use of iron tools (brought by the Myceneans) rather than bronze ones (used by Minoans) is one of the main indications archeologists used to determine the date of the final Minoan collapse.

==Culture==
[[Image:Knossos_bull.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bull-leaping, featured in this famous fresco from Knossos, was a religious ritual.]]The Minoans had a culture very different from that of the later &quot;ancient&quot; Greeks. It featured a very distinctive religion, art style, and language. The Minoans were also pioneers in naval exploration, establishing several colonies on the Greek mainland and other Aegean islands, such as Akrotiri on Thera. Minoan cultural influence spread throughout the region, including over the Mycenean culture.

===Religion===
Much of what is known about the Minoan religion is based on oral tradition that was not written down until long after the Myceneans had replaced their civilization. From these records, as well as what archeologists have been able to piece together, historians have generally agreed that the Minoan religion seems to have been based on the religion of the Neolithic peoples they conquered in moving to Crete. It centered on the goddess Potnia, but was polytheistic. Bulls were sacred to the Minoans, and bull-leaping (depicted in a famous fresco unearthed in Knossos) was a religious ritual. The famous labyrinth at Knossos is the best-known example of a Minoan temple. Religious symbols include the serpent, bull, labrys (a double-headed axe, for which the labyrinth is named), sun, and tree. There has also been evidence that the Minoans engaged in human sacrifice, though this is inconclusive at best.

===Art===
[[Image:Minoan clay vase.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of pottery from Knossos.]]The Minoans are particularly well-known for their artistic developments. Excavations have revealed frescoes, statues, and pottery. Pottery was the dominant art form of the Minoans from their arrival on Crete up until the Neopalatial period, when pottery-making technology allowed for a standardization of design. Fresco-painting soon rose in prominence, and focused heavily on religious and naturalistic themes. Bulls and snakes, both religious symbols, featured prominently in many works of art, as do other non-religious animals. Perhaps the most famous of the Minoan frescoes is one depicting the religious ritual of bull-leaping, which was found in the palace of Minos. Interestingly, no frescoes depict any of the many gods.

===Architecture===
Minoans also pioneered many architectural methods. Cities featured roads paved with stone, sewers, and plumbing. The most-recognized type of Minoan architecture is the palace. The construction of the first palaces (the famous palace at Knossos was one of the first) ended the Prepalatial period. Palaces were centers of government, allowing the dozens of individual communities to come under centralized political authority. Palaces also were used to store crop surpluses, and house shrines to goddesses.

===Economy===
The Minoan economy was very diverse. Several crops were cultivated, such as wheat, barley, grapes, olives, and figs. They raised several animals, including cattle, goats, and pigs. Also, bees were domesticated for honey production, as were donkeys and oxen for plowing purposes. The Minoans also had a healthy shipping industry, as evidenced by the many colonies they established throughout the eastern Mediterranean. They were involved in the tin trade. As bronze tools and weapons (bronze is made from tin and copper) were replaced by superior iron ones, the tin trade (and therefore the Minoan economy) suffered. Their trade network extended from Mesopotamia and Egypt all the way to Spain.

===Language===
[[Image:Tablet_cypro-minoan_2_Louvre_AM2336.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A tablet with Minoan script.]]Minoan civilization featured several written languages. During the Prepalatial period, a primitive hieroglyphic script was used, but fell out of use by 1700. A writing system called Linear A developed during the Protopalatial period, and continued to be used through the Neopalatial period. Linear A featured many symbols, each of which represented a syllable, word, or number. Linear A was used for record-keeping, and some religious functions. Linear B was the script used for government records. After the Mycenean conquest, Linear A was replaced by Linear B, which would eventually evolve into what is now the modern Greek language. Linear B was deciphered in the 1950s, but Linear A and the hieroglyphic texts have yet to have been completely translated.

I would like to start the discussion about this exotic negative resistance application by inserting my comment to the EDN's article [http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&amp;ArticleID=4128 Negative-Resistance Load Canceller Helps Drive Heavy Loads ]. In this story I have revealed the secret behind negative resistance phenomenon and its most popular implementation - negative impedance converter (NIC).

&lt;center&gt;''(reader's comment to the EDN's article [http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&amp;ArticleID=4128 Negative-Resistance Load Canceller Helps Drive Heavy Loads])''&lt;/center&gt;


This exotic circuit solution seems to be original; actually, it is very, very old. For the first time, I saw it in the book &quot;L’amplificateur opérationnel et ses applications Masson, Paris, 1971&quot; by J. C. Marchais; then I was a student and was trying without success to grasp the idea behind the odd circuit). In spite of that, I have not yet seen any reasonable human friendly explanation of this clever circuit arrangement (including the book mentioned).

Believe me, it is not sufficient to say that &quot;a negative resistance -R connected in parallel with a positive resistance R gives an infinite resistance&quot;. In order to really understand the circuit, readers (as human beings) need to know what problem the op-amp solves, why it is connected there, what it actually does in the circuit, how it does this magic, etc.

The idea is extremely simple; we may see it in the daily round when someone (something) helps someone (something) else to such extent that the latter needn't do anything. Examples of this &quot;exact helping&quot;: parents help children to such extent that they needn't do anything, a husband supports his wife to such extent that she needn't do anything:), compensating the load by an anti-load (anti-weight) used in the lift systems and cranes, etc.

In the circuit discussed, the op-amp (or, more precisely, the whole NIC converter acting as a negative resistor) does exactly the same - it &quot;helps exactly&quot; the input reference voltage source by injecting the whole current needed through the load. In this way, it serves as an &quot;exact helping&quot; source, which has actually replaced the input source. As a result, the load does not consume any energy from the input source since it is supplied completely by the &quot;helping&quot; source. There is no current flowing between the output of the reference source and the load since the whole rest part of the circuit (the load + the NIC) behaves as a dynamic load with infinite internal resistance. Actually, this is the famous &quot;bootstrapping&quot; technique; it is put in practice for the first time by Baron Munchhausen who was using his own boot straps to pull himself out of the sea:)

In this circuit, the parallel connected negative resistor -R &quot;neutralizes&quot; the positive one R giving the whole load current. Then, in another implementation of this powerful idea - the famous  Howland current source (and Deboo integrator as well) - the negative resistance absorbs a part of the positive one (the positive resistance dominates); it adds only a &quot;correcting&quot; supplementary current, in order to keep a constant current through the load. Finally, if the negative resistance dominates (it has completely absorbed the positive one and some negative resistance is left) the circuit will act as a negative resistance amplifier (in this case, the input voltage source has to have an output resistance).

(after Wikipedia's [[w:Negative resistance#Using parallel connected voltage-driven negative resistor|Negative resistance]])

[[Image:Anti_load.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6: Compensating the load by an anti-load&lt;/center&gt;]]

...'''Compensating the load resistance.''' In nature, real sources (for example, human beings) have a limited power. Therefore, if they are loaded (for example, by a weight), they droop. A similar problem exists in electronics (electricity) when imperfect voltage sources are loaded. For example, the simplest varying voltage source (Fig. 7) consists of a steady voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and a potentiometer P (a voltage divider r1-r2). If there is no load connected, this real voltage source works well - V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = r2/(r1 + r2). However, when a load R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is connected, it &quot;sucks&quot; a current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; drops. The classic solution is to connect an op-amp [[w:voltage follower]] (a unity-gain amplifier acting as a [[w:buffer amplifier]]) before the load, in order to decrease the current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (to increase the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). Unfortunately, this remedy introduces some errors inherent for this circuit [http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&amp;ArticleID=4128].&lt;br&gt;
In mechanics, there is another powerful idea that is referred to as [[w:anti-weight]] or ''anti-load'' (Fig. 7). It is widely used in the lift systems, cranes etc. In electronics, this exotic solution is implemented by a voltage-driven negative resistor (a negative load); it is connected in parallel to the &quot;positive&quot; load (Fig. 7), in order to &quot;help&quot; the imperfect voltage source [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/par_nr_comp/par_neg_res_comp.htm],[http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&amp;ArticleID=4128].

[[Image:Comp_load_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7: Compensating a load resistance by a parallel connected negative resistor&lt;/center&gt;]]

The compensating voltage source B&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (a non-inverting amplifier with K = 2) produces two times higher &quot;helping&quot; voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;= 2V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. It makes a current I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/R = (2V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; flow through the load. In this way, the whole load current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is provided by the &quot;helping&quot; current source I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (the negative resistor -R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) instead by the real voltage source. The load does not consume any energy from the input source since it is supplied completely by the &quot;helping&quot; source. In order to  put this circuit into practice, they use usually a [[w:Negative_impedance_converter#Application|negative impedance converter]] acting as a voltage-driven negative resistor [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/par_nr_comp/par_neg_res_comp.htm#step5], [http://www.elecdesign.com/Files/29/4128/Figure_02.gif].
There is a striking resemblance between the mechanical and electrical versions, which helps understanding the phenomenon. According to this intuitive viewpoint, the load &quot;pulls&quot; the point A down toward the ground while the resistor R &quot;pulls&quot; the point A up toward the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result of this &quot;stretching&quot;, the point A &quot;experiences&quot; weightlessness (as it pulls itself up) and it follows easily the point B. There is no current flowing between the point B and point A since the whole right part of the circuit (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, R and V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) behaves as a load with infinite internal resistance. This phenomenon is referred to as [[w:bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] and it is put in practice for the first time by [[w:Baron Munchhausen]] (the legend says that he was using his own boot straps to pull himself out of the sea)...

{{TOC right}}

A topological space is said to be '''locally connected''' at ''x'' (where ''x'' is a [[point (geometry)|point]] of the space to be called ''X''), if for each [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] ''V'' of ''x'', there is a [[connected (topology)|connected]] neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' contained in ''V''. If a space is locally connected at each of its points, we call the space locally connected. Suprisingly, local connectedness and connectedness are independent properties; a space may satisfy one of them without satisfying the other (see the examples below).

==Examples==

1. If a space has a [[basis (topology)|basis]] consisting entirely of connected [[set]]s, then it is locally connected (to see this, let ''x'' be a point of the space. Then for each neighbourhood ''V'' of ''x'', there is a basis element ''B'' containing ''x'' which is connected and contained in ''V''. Then ''B'' is the desired connected neighbourhood of ''x'' contained in ''V'').

2. From example 1, we can conclude that the set of [[real number]]s '''R''' is locally connected and connected (since it is a [[linear continuum]]).

3. The set of [[rational number]]s '''Q''' is neither locally connected nor connected. The same is true for '''R''' in the [[lower limit topology]]. In fact, a [[totally disconnected space]] cannot be locally connected unless it has the [[discrete topology]].

4. The [[finite set|finite]] [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s is locally connected. In other words, [[elementary set]]s (see [[measure theory]]) in '''R''' are locally connected. In particular, the set 
:''A'' = (-1,0) &amp;cup; (0,1)
is locally connected but not connected.

5.The [[topologist's sine curve]] (if ''f''(''x'') = sin (1/''x''), then the topologist's sine curve is just the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of (0,1] under ''f''), is an example of a connected space which is not locally connected. The fact that the topologist's sine curve is connected follows from:
:a) The set ''S'' = ''f''((0,1]) is connected since it is the image of a connected space under a [[continuous map]].
:b) The closure of a connected space is connected.
The space is not locally connected at any point in the set ''B'' = [Closure (''S'')] – ''S''. It is locally connected at every other point though.

==Local path connectedness==

A topological space, ''X'', is locally path connected, if for each point x, and each [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] ''V'' of ''x'', there is a [[path connected]] neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' contained in ''V''. Similar examples to the previous ones, show that path connectedness and local path connectedness are independent properties. We will give a few more examples.

;Examples

1. A locally path connected space is always locally connected. The proof uses the fact that every path connected space is connected.

2. An example of a path connected space that is not locally path connected is the [[comb space]]: if ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{1/''n'' |''n'' is a natural number}, then the comb space is defined by:

: ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''K''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;[0,1])&amp;nbsp;&amp;cup;&amp;nbsp;({0}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;[0,1])&amp;nbsp;&amp;cup;&amp;nbsp;([0,1]&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{0}]

The comb space is path connected (this is trivial) but locally path connected at no point in the set ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(0,1]. It is however locally path connected at every other point.

==Weakly Locally Connected==

A more weaker property that a topological space can satisfy at a point is known as ‘weakly locally connected’:

'''Definition'''

Let X be a topological space and x a point of X. If for every neighbourhood V of x, there is a connected subspace A of V containing a neighbourhood U of x, the topological space is said to be weakly locally connected at x. If the space is weakly locally connected at each of its points, it is said simply to be weakly locally connected.

We will give a few examples and there will be one important theorem on this concept later.

'''Examples'''

1. Every locally connected space is trivially weakly locally connected (let A = U in the definition).

2. Note that neither the comb space nor the topologist’s sine curve is weakly locally connected. It is easy to see that these two spaces are not weakly locally connected at each of the points that they aren’t locally connected.

3. A totally disconnected space cannot be weakly locally connected unless it has the discrete topology (in other words, a totally disconnected space is weakly locally connected if and only if it has the discrete topology). An example is R in the lower limit topology which doesn’t have the discrete topology and hence cannot be weakly locally connected at any point. 

4. We will prove shortly that if a topological space is weakly locally connected (that is weakly locally connected at EVERY point), then it is locally connected at every point. However, the proof of this fact requires another notion related to local connectedness which is to be discussed in the next section.  

5. The previous property may seem strange. If every weakly locally connected space is locally connected, then why call a space ‘weakly’ locally connected? It doesn’t seem to be a weaker condition. However, if a space is weakly locally connected at just one point, then it need not be locally connected at that point. An example of such a space is the broom space. For this space to be locally connected at that point, it needs to be weakly locally connected in a NEIGHBOURHOOD of that point. Hence the definition of a weakly locally connected space does indeed make sense.

==Components and path components==

Define an [[equivalence relation]] ~ on a topological space ''X'', so that we declare x~y if there is a connected [[subspace]] ''A'' of ''X'' containing both ''x'' and ''y''. The [[set|collection]] of all [[equivalence classes]] are called the components of X (this is indeed an equivalence relation as the reader can check).

Define another equivalence relation ~&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (different from the first) to set ''x''~&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''y'' if there is a path from ''x'' to ''y''. Equivalently, ''x''~&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''y'' if and only if there is a [[path connected]] subspace of ''X'' containing ''x'' and ''y''. The collection of all equivalence classes with this equivalence relation are called the path components of the space (this is indeed an equivalence relation as the reader can check).

Being equivalence classes, the components are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]], [[nonempty]] [[subsets]] of the topological space ''X'', whose [[Union (set theory)|union]] is X. The same is true for the path components.

;Properties

1. Intuitively, the components are the largest possible connected subsets of ''X'' and the path components are the largest possible path connected subsets of ''X''.

2. The components are always connected (to see this let ''C'' be a component (the equivalence class containing a certain point ''x'' of the space). Then ''C'' is nonempty since ''x''~''x''. For each ''y'' in ''C'', let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; be a connected subset of ''X'' containing both ''y'' and ''x'' (since ''y''~''x''). Take the union of all such ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''y'' in ''C''. This union is ''C''. Since this is the union of connected spaces having the point ''x'' in common, this union is connected. Therefore, ''C'' is connected). A similar argument shows that the path components are always path connected and hence connected.

3. Every connected subset of ''X'' lies in a component of ''X''. This justifies property 1. To see this, let ''A'' be connected (and nonempty or else the proof is trivial), and let ''x'' belong to ''A''. Then if ''y'' belongs to ''A'', ''A'' is a connected subset of ''X'' containing both ''y'' and ''x'' so that ''y''~''x''. Since ''y'' was arbitrary, we have shown that ''A'' is a subset of the component containing x. A similar proof shows that every path connected subset of ''X'' is a subset of a path component of ''X''. 

4. The components are always [[closed set|closed]]. To see this we note that if ''C'' is a component, then ''C'' is connected, so that the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''C'' is connected. Now, C is always a subset of the closure of ''C'' so that it is sufficient to verify that the closure of ''C'' is a subset of ''C''. But we know that the closure of ''C'' is connected, and every connected subset of ''X'' is the subset of exactly one component. Therefore, ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Closure(''C'') and ''C'' is closed. This proof fails for the path components since the closure of a path connected space need not be path connected (for example, the [[topologist's sine curve]]).

5. If there are only finitely many components, then the components are also [[open set|open]]. If ''C'' is a component, then its [[set complement|complement]] is the [[finite set|finite]] union of components and hence closed. Therefore, ''C'' is open. This proof fails for infinitely many components, as the set of [[rational numbers]] show.

;Examples

1. The set of all [[real numbers]] has precisely one component; the whole space. In fact every connected space has only one component.

2. The set:

: ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(-∞,0)&amp;cup;(0,+∞)

has precisely two components; (-∞, 0) and (0, +∞). Note how these are the largest possible connected subsets of this space.

3. The set of [[rational number]]s has [[countably]] many components. Each one point set is a component. In fact, for any [[totally disconnected space]], the one point sets are the components of the space. 

4. The path components of the spaces in examples 1,2 and 3 are exactly the same as the components. However, they are not the same in general. An example of this is the [[topologist's sine curve]] which has one component (since it is connected), but has two path components:

:''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;[-1,1]

:''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''((0,1]) where ''f'' is the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined by ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sin(1/''x'')

Notice that ''A'' is closed; but not open. Also, ''B'' is open; but not closed. This shows that even though the components are always closed, the same thing does not hold for the path components. 

5. In general, the path components are subsets of the components. To see this we note that the path components of a topological space are path connected and hence connected. Since connected subsets of ''X'' lie in a component of ''X'', the result follows. We will prove later that the path components and components are equal provided that ''X'' is locally path connected.

6. The set ''I'' &amp;times; ''I'' (where ''I'' = [0,1]) in the [[dictionary order]]  [[order topology|topology]] has exactly one component (because it is connected) but has uncountably many path components. Indeed, any set of the form {''a''} &amp;times; ''I'' is a path component for each ''a'' belonging to ''I''. 

7. Let ''f'' be a continuous map from '''R''' to '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt; ('''R''' in the [[lower limit topology]]). Since '''R''' is connected, and the image of a connected space under a continuous map must be connected, the image of '''R''' under ''f'' must be connected. Therefore, the image of '''R''' under ''f'' must be a subset of a component of '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;. Since this image is nonempty, the only continuous maps from '''R''' to '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;, are the constant maps.

==Quasicomponents==

The concept of a quasicomponent is similar to that of a component and only brief attention will be given to it. We first make a definition:

'''Definition'''

Let X be a topological space. Define an equivalence relation on X to declare x~y if there is no separation of X into sets A and B such that x is an element of A and y is an element of B. 

We note that the relation given in the definition is indeed an equivalence relation as the reader can readily check. 

'''Properties'''

1. The components are always contained in the quasicomponents of X. Before proving this we will let x~&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;y if there is a connected subset of X containing both x and y (which is the equivalence relation used in defining components), and x~&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;y if x~y as in the definition given in this section. If x~&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;y, then there is a connected subset, C, of X containing x and y. If there was a separation of X into sets A and B such that x is an element of A and y is an element of B, then C would intersect both A and B. This implies in particular that ‘C intersection A’ and ‘C intersection B’ would form a separation on C contradicting the connectedness of C. Therefore, we must have that x~&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;y. 

2. From the previous property, we may conclude that the path components of a space always lie in the quasicomponents of a space (since the path components always lie in the components).

'''Examples'''

1. There is only one quasicomponent of a connected space; the space itself. This follows from property 1. 

2. In the next section, we will prove that if X is a locally connected topological space, then the quasicomponents of X are equal to the components of X. 

3. If X is locally path connected, it is locally connected (as mentioned earlier) so that the components of X are equal to the quasicomponents of X. Since if X is locally path connected, the components of X and the path components of X are equal (which we shall prove in the next section), it follows that the quasicomponents, path components, and components are all equal if X is a locally path connected space.

4. Property 2 still holds if X is weakly locally connected (that is, weakly locally connected at each of its points). This is because a weakly locally connected space is always locally connected (which we shall prove imminently). 

==Theorems==

In this section, we will prove theorems relevant to the material in this article. 

;Theorem 1

A topological space is locally connected [[if and only if]] the components of open sets are open. 

;Proof

Suppose ''X'' is locally connected (where ''X'' is the topological space in question). Let ''V'' be open in ''X'' and let ''C'' be a component of ''V''. For each ''x'' in ''C'', choose a connected neigbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' contained in ''V'' (by the local connectedness of ''X''). Since ''U'' is connected, ''U'' is a subset of ''C''. It follows that ''C'' is the union of open sets and is thus open.

Conversely, suppose that the components of open sets in a topological space, ''X'', are open. Let ''x'' belong to ''X'' and let ''V'' be a neigbourhood of ''x''. Let ''C'' be a component of ''V'' containing ''x''. Then ''C'' is open by hypothesis. Therefore, ''C'' is a connected neigbourhood of ''X'' contained in ''V'' so that ''X'' is locally connected at ''x''. Since ''x'' was arbitary, ''X'' is locally connected.

;Theorem 2

A topological space is locally path connected if the path components of open sets are open.

;Proof

The proof is similar to theorem 1 and is omitted.

;Theorem 3

The components and path components of a topological space, ''X'', are equal if ''X'' is locally path connected.

;Proof

Let ''P'' be a path component of ''X'' containing ''x'' and let ''C'' be a component of ''X'' containing ''x''. We know that ''P'' is a subset of ''C'' by example 5 in the previous section. Suppose ''P'' is a proper subset of ''C''. Since ''X'' is open, ''P'' is open in ''X'' by theorem 2. Take the union of all those path components of ''X'' disjoint from ''P'' and intersect them with ''C''; call the union of all the resulting sets ''Q''. Then, ''P'' and ''Q'' form a separation on ''C'', since they are disjoint, nonempty (''P'' is nonempty since ''x'' is in ''P''; ''Q'' is nonempty, because we are assuming that ''P'' is a proper subset of ''X''), and open in ''C'' (''Q'' is open in ''C'' by theorem 2 and the definition of the [[subspace topology]]). This contradicts the connectedness of ''C''.

;Theorem 4

Let ''X'' be a locally path connected space. Then every open, connected subset of ''X'' is path connected. 

;Proof

Let ''U'' be an open connected subset of ''X'' and let ''x'' belong to ''U''. Let ''A'' be the set of all points in ''U'' that can be joined by a path to ''X''. Then ''A'' is open. If ''y'' is in ''A'', then there is a path connected subset ''V'' of ''U'' containing ''y'' (by the local path connectedness of the space). Then we assert that ''V'' is a subset of ''A''. If ''z'' is in ''V'', then there is a path from ''z'' to ''y''. Since there is a path from ''x'' to ''y'' (because ''y'' belongs to ''A''), we can ‘paste’ these paths together to form a path from ''x'' to ''z''. Therefore, ''z'' is in ''A''. Therefore, ''V'' is a subset of ''A'' and ''A'' is open. Now if ''y'' is in ''U''&amp;minus;''A'', then there is no path from ''y'' to ''x''. If ''V'' is a path connected neigbourhood of ''y'' contained in ''U'', then ''V'' is a subset of ''U''&amp;minus;''A''. If ''z'' is in ''V'', and if there is a path from ''z'' to ''x'', then there would be a path from ''x'' to ''y'' since there is already a path from ''z'' to ''y''. This cannot be since ''y'' is in ''U''&amp;minus;''A''. Therefore, there is no path from ''z'' to ''x'' and ''z'' is in ''U''&amp;minus;''A''. It follows that ''V'' is a subset of ''U''&amp;minus;''A'' and ''U''&amp;minus;''A'' is open. We know already that ''A'' is nonempty (''x'' is in ''A''). If ''U''&amp;minus;''A'' is nonempty, then ''A'' and ''U''&amp;minus;''A'' will form a separation on ''U'' contradicting the connectedness of ''U''. Therefore, every point in ''U'' can be joined by a path to ''x''. From this it follows that ''U'' is path connected.

'''Theorem 5'''

Let X be a weakly locally connected space. Then X is locally connected.

Proof

From theorem 1, it is sufficient to show that the components of open sets is open. Let U be open in X and let C be a component of U. Let x be an element of C. Then x is an element of U so that there is a connected subspace A of X contained in U and containing a neighbourhood V of x. Since A is connected and A contains x, A must be a subset of C (the component containing x). Therefore, the neighbourhood V of x is a subset of C. Since x was arbitrary, we have shown that each x in C has a neighbourhood V contained in C. This shows that C is open relative to U. Therefore, X is locally connected. 

'''Theorem 6'''  

Let X be a topological space. If X is locally connected, the quasicomponents of X are equal to the components of X. 

Proof

We noted earlier in the section on quasicomponents that each component of the space is contained in a quasicomponent of the space. It suffices to show that the quasicomponents always lie in the components if the space is locally connected. From theorem 1, it follows that the components of X are open (since X is locally connected). Therefore, if x~&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;y doesn’t hold (x is not equivalent to y under the equivalence relation defining components), then the component containing x is both open and closed (components are always closed; the component containing x is open because X is a locally connected topological space), so that there is a separation of X into sets A and B such that A contains x and B contains y (A is the component containing x, and B = X-A). Therefore, x cannot be equivalent to y under the equivalence relation defining quasicomponents. Therefore, we have proved that if y is not in the component containing x, y cannot be in the quasicomponent containing x. From elementary set theory, this implies that if y is in the quasicomponent containing x, it must be in the component containing x. Therefore, the quasicomponents of X are equal to the components of X. 

;Some applications of the theorems

1. From theorem 4,  we can conclude that every open connected subset of '''R''' is path connected (since '''R''' is locally path connected). Also, every open, connected subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is path connected.

2. The set of [[rational numbers]] '''Q''' is not locally connected since the components of '''Q''' are not open in '''Q''' (see theorem 1).

3. The components and path components of an elementary subset of R are the same. Also, the elementary subsets of '''R''' are the finite union of intervals, since every elementary set is locally path connected.

4. Take the point, p = (0.5,0.5) in the plane. For each rational x in R, let T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; denote the line segment joining p to (x,0). Let T be the union of all such T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Then T is locally connected only at p. However, it isn’t locally connected at any other point (if x is distinct from p and belongs to T, choose a neighbourhood of x (open in R^2) disjoint from p which doesn’t intersect the x-axis. The intersection of this neighbourhood with T is homeomorphic with the countable union of open intervals in R (this we leave you to check in the exercises on homeomorphisms (see next section))and therefore cannot be connected. Therefore, no neighbourhood smaller than this neighbourhood can be connected). Therefore, T cannot be weakly locally connected by theorem 5.

5. See the infinite broom (or the broom space). This is an example of a space which is weakly locally connected at a particular point, but not locally connected at that point. The reader is directed to Wolfram MathWorld for a definition of the broom space. See also the section (in this article) on ‘weakly locally connected space’.

==Exercises==

'''Easy Questions'''

1. Prove that if X is locally path connected, then X is locally connected.

2. Prove that X has precisely one component if and only if X is connected. What is this component?

3. If f is a continuous, surjective map from a topological space X to a topological space Y, does it follow that Y is locally connected if X is locally connected? What conditions can you impose for this statement to be true, i.e. the continuous image of a locally connected space is locally connected (if your answer was yes to the first question, ignore the second; however, if your answer is yes you must prove it)?

4. a) Prove that the set I X I in the dictionary order topology is locally connected (Hint: What familiar connected subspace of R are basis elements for the topology on I X I homeomorphic to?)
    
b*) Find the path components of this space (Hint: First show that this space is not path connected by obtaining a contradiction and using the intermediate value theorem (assume [0,1] is connected)
    
c) Use your answer to b), to determine whether or not the space I X I is locally path connected. 

5. Prove theorem 2

'''Normal Questions'''

'''In these questions, we will verify whether local connectedness is preserved under products and other such operations. The reader is expected to be familiar with the product topology.'''

6. a) Consider the set X = (-1,0) U (0,1) which is clearly not connected. Prove that this set is locally connected. Also find the components of this space (Hint: When proving that this space is locally connected, assume that (0,1) is connected. Then contruct a homeomorphism from (0,1) to (-1,0) to show that (-1,0) is connected)
    
b) Apply a theorem to show that the path components of this space are equal to the components of this space. Prove any assumptions that you make.
     
c) Let E be an elementary subset of R (this term is derived from measure theory where E is said to be an elementary subset of R, if it is the finite union of intervals (not necessarily open), prove that E is locally connected by assuming that each interval is connected. 

7. Suppose we take the finite product of X with itself. Is this new space locally connected? (Hint: Use the fact that the product of connected spaces is always connected)

8. Now, what if we take the infinite product of X with itself given the product topology; call this new space Y. We will check whether Y is locally connected or not in question 8. We leave the reader to have a think about this before he reads question 8.

'''See question 7 and think before reading question 8''':

9. a) Are basis elements for the product topology on Y connected? (Hint: The projection map is continuous; therefore the projection of a connected space is always connected)

b) Possibly a) gives us a conjecture whether Y is locally connected or not. Depending on your answer to a), prove or disprove that Y is locally connected. (Hint: If your answer to a) was yes, find at least one connected neighbourhood of a point (note that a neighborhood of a point need NOT BE a basis element). If you answer to a) was no, proceed by contradiction:

If x is a point of Y and V is a neighborhood of x, suppose U is a connected neighborhood of x contained in V. Then U contains a basis element about X. Note that the projection map is continuous so that the image of U under each projection should be connected. Obtain a contradiction) 

c) Is Y weakly locally connected? Justify your answer (Hint: The idea is similar to part b))

'''Research Questions'''

'''You will be asked to formulate hypothesis based on your knowledge''':

10. Like components of a topological space are always closed, do you think path components satisfy a similar property?

'''We will analyse this question (see now question 9 and think before answering 10)'''

11. a) Is it possible to determine the path components of a connected space (without knowing what the space is)? Is it possible to determine the path components of a path connected space without knowing what the space is?

b) The topologist’s sine curve is not path connected. Assuming this determine its path components and analyze the properties these path components satisfy (determine whether they are closed or open or neither).

c) From 10.b), you should be able to answer question 9. As a question which we will leave the reader to think about:

12. Are components of a topological space necessarily locally connected?

13. Are path components of a topological space necessarily locally path connected? (Hint: This question is a little trickier than 7; you might have to construct your own space (a subspace of R^2))

14. a) Prove that homeomorphisms preserve path connectedness.
      
b) Deduce that the topologist’s sine curve and the comb space are not homeomorphic.

'''The following question is a research type question''':

15*. Like there are the components of a space, can you invent a similar equivalence relation that determines the ‘local components’ of a space. These ‘local components’ should be the largest locally connected subsets of the space.

'''Example Type Questions'''

16. Give an example where the path components of a space and the components of a space are not equal. Give a different example where the path components and quasicomponents of a space are not equal.

17. Find an example of a locally connected space that is not locally path connected.

18*. Give an example where the quasicomponents of a space and the components of the space are not equal.

19. If X is locally homeomorphic with Y and X is locally connected, need Y be locally connected? Justify your answer.

'''Questions on weakly locally connected spaces'''

20. Formulate a new notion called weak local path connectedness that uses the same idea as the definition of a weakly locally connected space.

a) Prove that every weakly locally path connected space is locally path connected

b) Give an example of a weakly locally path connected space that isn’t locally path connected (at a particular point).

21. As in theorem 2, characterize weakly locally connected spaces in terms of components (Hint: Remember theorem 5)

'''Questions on Homeomorphisms'''

22. In the section on ‘applications of the theorems’, check the details of 4.

23. Prove that if X has ‘n’ components, and Y is homeomorphic to X, Y has ‘n’ components. Give an example where f is a continuous surjective map from X to Y, and X has ‘n’ components but Y doesn’t.

24. a) Suppose p is a continuous, closed surjective map such that p^(-1) {y} is compact in X for each element y of Y (p: X-&gt;Y) (the reader who is not familiar with compactness is referred to Wikipedia). Prove that if Y is locally connected, so is X.
      
b) Prove that if Y is connected so is X
      
c) If X is locally connected, need Y be locally connected?

'''Difficult question'''

25. Is every connected Hausdorff space with more than one point uncountable (Hint: Every connected metric space with more than one point in uncountable; prove this assertion. See what difficulty arises with this proof when one considers a Hausdorff space. Remember that metric spaces are always first countable, normal, paracompact etc… whereas Hausdorff spaces aren’t)?

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can specify normals for faces you create. This is a vector that's perpendicular to the face. Specifying normals is important if you plan to use lighting. They tell OpenGL how the light is to be reflected. Although OpenGL is not a raytracer, it still influences how bright you see the face. OpenGL will not calculate the normals itself, you have to do it manually.

== Specifying Normals ==
Normals are specified using the function ''glNormal3f'' and used before you make the vertices that belong to the face. Example:

 // Create a square on the XY axis. The normal vector is then (0, 0, 1)
 glBegin(GL_QUADS);
     glNormal3f(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
     glVertex3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
     glVertex3f(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
     glVertex3f(1.0, 1.0, 0.0);
     glVertex3f(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
 glEnd();

== Calculating Normals ==
There is a quite simple approach for calculating the normal vector for a triangle. Given ''p1'', ''p2'' and ''p3'', the normal vector can be expressed as the cross product of (p2 - p1) and (p3 - p1), divided by the length of the result. In C code, using a struct type for the vectors:

 struct vector a, b, n;
 double l;
 
 a.x = p2.x - p1.x;
 a.y = p2.y - p1.y;
 a.z = p2.z - p1.z;
 
 b.x = p3.x - p1.x;
 b.y = p3.y - p1.y;
 b.z = p3.z - p1.z;
 
 n.x = (a.y * b.z) - (a.z * b.y);
 n.y = (a.z * b.x) - (a.x * b.z);
 n.z = (a.x * b.y) - (a.y * b.x);
 
 // Normalize (divide by root of dot product)
 l = sqrt(n.x * n.x + n.y * n.y + n.z * n.z);
 n.x /= l;
 n.y /= l;
 n.z /= l;
 
 // Now pass n.x, n.y, n.z to glNormal3f

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The pathophysiology and neurobiology of Bipolar Disorder ==
== Role of specific neurotransmitters in Bipolar Disorder ==

== Dopamine ==

Dopamine pathways in the midbrain help to regulate motor activity, motivation and reward circuits.  Behavioral changes of the manic phase such as increase in goal-directed behavior and excitement may involve these dopaminergic pathways.  Mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways may be directly involved in the selection and coordination of goal-directed behavior, especially those elicted by reward stimuli.  Homovanillic acid (HVA), a metabolite of dopamine, is reduced in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of some depressed patients.  Conversely, CSF levels of HVA are increased in some manic patients.{{ref|Goodwin2007}}  Pharmacological agents which act on the dopamine pathways further implicate dopamine in the pathogenesis of bipolar symptoms.  The dopamine precursor L-dopa can produce hypomania in bipolar patients.  Amphetamine, which promotes dopamine release can cause hypomania in bipolar patients and can induce hypomanic symptoms in normal people.  Bromocriptine and piribedil, which are direct dopamine agonists exhibit antidepressant properties and cause mania in some bipolar patients.  Conversely, neuroleptics which block dopamine receptors have antimanic properties.{{ref|Goodwin2007}}  Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist at the D2/D3 site, shows antidepressant efficacy as an augmentation strategy in Bipolar patients who are failing treatment with mood stabilizers.{{ref|Goodwin2007}}

: Yup.  I changed it.  I had forgotten that lower case was generally for AC.  Thanks for reminding me. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:29, 27 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

In the paragraph &quot;Command Arguments&quot;, '''options''' like &quot;-A&quot; and &quot;--symbolic&quot; are refered to as '''arguments''' - along with &quot;important notice.txt&quot;.

Surely it's more commanly to seperate between '''options''' like ''-A, -f, --symbolic'', and '''arguments''' like ''something.txt, *.doc''.</text>

* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

I wonder if you have seen the books [[Programmable Logic]] and [[Microprocessor Design]]? You might be interested in these books as well. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:48, 27 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now it's time to find out what emotions are bottled up inside. Before we try to find out Mary's emotional state of mind, lets take a quick peak at some words we can use!

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:orange; color:white&quot; | '''Plug-in words:'''
|-
| かなしい sad しあわせ happy
|-
| ねむい sleepy, うきうき cheerful
|}


{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:teal; color:white&quot; | '''～　Important language notes!　～'''
|-
| If you got your extra credit points last time, you learned that   
|-
| some description words become negative with くない but what about 
|-
| those group of words not ending in い? Please use じゃない for that.
|- 
| In that way, not cheerful would become うきうきじゃない, this same   
|-
| negation works for things. So ぺんじゃない means that it is not a pen.
|}

So Johnny, are you ready to find out if Mary is sad? She has been really moody recently, lets ask her!



{| align=&quot;left&quot;
| style=&quot;background:blue; color:white&quot; | '''Johnny'''
|-
| '''まり'''は'''かなしい'''です'''か'''? [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|Mari WA kanashii desuka?]]
|-
| ''Are you sad, Mary?''
|-
|}
[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png]]
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd029.ogg|left]]


[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-woman.png|right]]
{| align=&quot;right&quot;
| style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot; | '''Mary'''
|-
| わたしは'''かなしくない'''です! わたしはねむいです. [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|watashi WA kanashikunai desu! watashi WA nemui desu.]]
|-
| ''I am  '''not''' sad. I am sleepy.''
|-
|}
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd030.ogg|right]]











Wow, get some sleep Mary! I wonder if she has a pillow. But wait a minute! What was that わたし thing? That isn't a name! If you didn't figure it out, it is the polite way to talk about yourself. Lets look at a few more. 




{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:orange; color:white&quot; | '''Plug-in words:'''
|-
| わたし I, あたし I (female)
|-
| ぼく I (male, informal)
|-
| あなた (you, formal)
|}


Ahh, it looks like Mary got some sleep! Good for her. Lets find out how she's feeling today. Go ahead Johnny.

{| align=&quot;left&quot;
| style=&quot;background:blue; color:white&quot; | '''Johnny'''
|-
| あなたはうきうきですか？ [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|anata WA ukiuki desu ka?]]
|-
| ''Are you feeling cheerful?''
|-
|}
[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png]]
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd031.ogg|left]]

[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-woman.png|right]]
{| align=&quot;right&quot;
| style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot; | '''Mary'''
|-
| はい、そうです. わたしはうきうきですね. [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|hai, sou desu. watashi WA ukiuki desu ne.]]
|-
| ''Yes, that's right. I'm cheerful, huh?''
|-
|}
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd032.ogg|right]]
















Phew, good to hear that Mary is back to her cheerful self. Don't want any frowns to ruin our communication! Lets try to request things we want!</text>

'''Spiderworts''' (''Tradescantia'') are a genus of an estimated 71 species of perennial plants in the family Commelinaceae, native to the New World from southern Canada south to northern Argentina. Though sometimes accounted a weed, spiderwort is cultivated for borders and also used in containers. Where it appears as a volunteer, it is often welcomed and allowed to stay. The genus takes its name from John Tradescant the elder, an 17th century English plant collector and nurseryman.

The first species described, Virginia Spiderwort T. virginiana, is native to the eastern United States from Maine to Alabama, and Canada in southern Ontario. Virginia Spiderwort was introduced to Europe in 1629, where it is cultivated as a garden flower.

The Western Spiderwort T. occidentalis is listed as an endangered species in Canada, where the northernmost populations of the species are found at a few sites in southern Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta; it is however more common further south in the United States south to Texas and Arizona.

The three species of Wandering Jew, one native to eastern Mexico, also belong to the tradescantia genus. Other names used for various species include Spider-lily, Cradle-lily, Oyster-plant and Flowering Inch Plant.

==Description==
They are weakly upright to scrambling plants, growing to 30-60 cm tall, and are commonly found individually or in clumps in wooded areas and fields. The leaves are long, thin and bladelike to lanceolate, from 3-45 cm long. The flowers are white, pink or purple but most commonly bright blue, with three petals and six yellow anthers. The sap is mucilaginous and clear. A number of the species flower in the morning and when the sun shines on the flowers in the afternoon they close up, but the flowers can remain open on cloudy days until evening.

==Uses==
The cells of the stamen hairs of some Tradescantia are colored blue, but when exposed to sources of ionizing radiation such as gamma rays, the cells mutate and change color to pink; they are one of the few tissues known to serve as an effective bioassay for ambient radiation levels. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnlabstract_en.php?cdjournal=ggs1921&amp;cdvol=47&amp;noissue=6&amp;startpage=411&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Four-leaf clover.jpg|thumb|left|A four-leaf clover]]
'''Clover''' ('''''Trifolium''''') is a genus of about 300 species of plants in the pea family Fabaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution; the highest diversity is found in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also occur in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics.

They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely 5- or 7-foliate), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx.

Other closely related genera often called clovers include ''[[../Melilotus/]]'' (sweet clover) and ''[[../Medicago/]]'' (alfalfa or 'calvary clover'). The &quot;shamrock&quot; of popular iconography is sometimes considered to be young clover.

The scientific name derives from the Latin ''tres'', &quot;three&quot;, and ''folium'', &quot;leaf&quot;, so called from the characteristic form of the leaf, which has three leaflets (trifoliate); hence the popular name '''trefoil'''. 

Shamrock, the traditional Irish symbol coined by Saint Patrick for the Holy Trinity, is commonly associated with clover, though also sometimes with ''[[../Oxalis/]]'' species, which also have trifoliate leaves. Clovers occasionally have leaves with four leaflets, instead of the usual three. These four-leaf clovers, like other rarities, are considered lucky.

[[Image:Trifolium repens2.jpg|thumb|White Clover flower]]
Several species are extensively cultivated as fodder-plants. The most widely cultivated clovers are White clover ''[[../Trifolium repens/]]'' and Red clover ''[[../Trifolium pratense/]]''. Clover, either sown alone or in mixture with ryegrass, has for a long time formed a staple crop for soiling, for several reasons; it grows freely, shooting up again after repeated mowings; it produces an abundant crop; it is palatable to and nutritious for livestock; it grows in a great range of soils and climates; and it is appropriate either for pasturage or green composting.

&quot;Clover sickness&quot; in more recent times may also be linked to pollinator decline; clovers are most efficiently pollinated by bumblebees, which have declined as a result of agricultural intensification. Honeybees can also pollinate clover, and beekeepers are often in heavy demand from farmers with clover pastures. Farmers enjoy the benefits of increased reseeding that occurs with increased bee activity, which means that future clover yields remain abundant. Beekeepers benefit from the clover bloom as clover is one of the main nectar sources for honeybees.

[[Image:Red clover field.jpg|left|thumb|Red clover (''Trifolium pratense'')]]

''T. repens'', White or Dutch clover, is a perennial abundant in meadows and good pastures. The flowers are white or pinkish, becoming brown and deflexed as the corolla fades. ''T. hybridum'', Alsike or Swedish clover, is a perennial which was introduced early in the 19th century and has now become naturalized in Britain. The flowers are white or rosy, and resemble those of the last species. ''T. medium'', meadow or zigzag clover, a perennial with straggling flexuous stems and rose-purple flowers, is of little agricultural value.

Other British species are: ''T. arvense'', Hare's-foot trefoil; found in fields and dry pastures, a soft hairy plant with minute white or pale pink flowers and feathery sepals; ''T. fragiferum'', Strawberry clover, with densely-flowered, globose, rose-purple heads and swollen calyxes; ''T. procumbens'', Hop trefoil, on dry pastures and roadsides, the heads of pale yellow flowers suggesting miniature hops; and the somewhat similar ''T. minus'', common in pastures and roadsides, with smaller heads and small yellow flowers turning dark brown. The last named is often called Shamrock.

Clovers are a valuable survival food, as they are high in protein, widespread, and abundant. They are not easy to digest raw, but this can be easily fixed by juicing them or boiling them for 5-10 minutes. Dried flowerheads and seedpods can also be ground up into a nutritious flour and mixed with other foods. Dried flowerheads can also be steeped in hot water for a healthy, tasty tea.

==Maintenance==


==Propagation==
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
In many areas, particularly on acidic soils, clover is short-lived due a combination of insect pests, diseases and nutrient balance; this is known as &quot;clover-sickness&quot;. When crop rotations are managed so that clover does not recur at shorter intervals than eight years, it grows with much of its pristine vigor.

'''''Trifolium pratense''''' ('''Red Clover''') s a species of clover, native to Europe, western Asia and northwest Africa, but planted and naturalised in many other regions. The plant was named ''Trifolium pratense'' by Carolus Linnaeus in 1753. ''Pratense'' is Latin for &quot;found in meadows&quot;. It is widely grown as a fodder crop, valued for its nitrogen fixation which increases soil fertility. For these reasons it is used as a green manure crop. Several Cultivar Groups have been selected for agricultural use, mostly derived from var. ''sativum''. It has become naturalised in many temperate areas, including the Americas and Australasia as an escape from cultivation. 

It is the national flower of Denmark and the state flower of Vermont.

==Description==
It is a herbaceous perennial plant, very variable in size, growing to 20-80 cm tall. The leaves are alternate, trifoliate (with three leaflets), each leaflet 15-30 mm long and 8-15 mm broad, green with a characteristic pale crescent in the outer half of the leaf; the petiole is 1-4 cm long, with two basal stipules. The flowers are dark pink with a paler base, 12-15 mm long, produced in a dense inflorescence 2-3 cm diameter.

==Growing Conditions==

&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
There are seven varieties:
*''Trifolium pratense'' var. ''pratense'' Widespread.
*''Trifolium pratense'' var. ''americanum'' Southeastern Europe (despite the name).
*''Trifolium pratense'' var. ''frigidum'' Mountains of central and southern Europe (Pyrenees, Alps, Balkans).
*''Trifolium pratense'' var. ''maritimum'' Southern Baltic Sea coast.
*''Trifolium pratense'' var. ''parviflorum'' Europe.
*''Trifolium pratense'' var. ''sativum'' Mediterranean region. Robust-growing, with hairless or nearly hairless foliage.
*''Trifolium pratense'' var. ''villosum'' Alps. Densely hairy foliage.

==Uses==
The isoflavones and phytoestrogens from Red Clover have been used to treat the symptoms of menopause. Women who are pregnant and breastfeeding should avoid ingesting Red Clover. It has also been reported that red clover can be used for therapeutic purposes for coughs, bronchitis, eczema, sores, scrofula and can be gargled for mouth ulcers and sore throats. It is also an ingredient in eight-herb essiac tea.

==Maintenance==

&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==

&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==

&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

'''''Abelia × grandiflora''''' (Glossy Abelia) is a [[hybrid]] ''[[Abelia]]'', raised by hybridising ''[[Abelia|Abelia chinensis]]'' with ''[[Abelia|A. uniflora]]''. It is a [[deciduous]] or semi-[[evergreen]] multi-stemmed [[shrub]] with rounded, spreading, or gracefully arching branches to 1-1.8 m tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are ovate, glossy, dark green, 2-6 cm long. The [[flower]]s are produced in clusters, white, tinged pink, bell-shaped, to 2 cm long.

===Cultivation and uses===
''Abelia × grandiflora'' was first raised at the Rovelli [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] by [[Lake Maggiore]] in [[Italy]] in 1886. It is used as an [[ornamental plant]] in specimen plantings in gardens, or in a mixed border with other shrubs. [[plant propagation|Propagation]] is by [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. 

[[Synonymy|Synonyms]] include ''Abelia rupestris'' Hort., ''Linnaea pringiana'' Graebn, and ''L. spaethiana'' Graebn.

      <comment>finishing up my sandbox</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It's time to get what you want. But how do you do that? With a phrase like this.

&lt;center&gt;
'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;これ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;を&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;ください&lt;/font&gt;'''

'''&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;This&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt; please.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;/center&gt;


{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:teal; color:white&quot; | '''～　Important language note!　～'''
|-
| を &lt;small&gt;(read this time as o)&lt;/small&gt; is an article that gives meaning to this kind

|- 
| We can put action words into a special form that usually ends in　て 
|-
| or something, but we wont use を unless what we want is a noun.
|-
| Don't worry if your head is spinning, just check out the examples.
|}

This makes it pretty easy to ask for anything. Just ''thing'' with a please on it. Plug in your things and you're set! Johnny must be smiling right now. Things  you want people to do can be said in almost the same way too. OK, let's watch Johnny and Mary at a local bar. Hmmm, what will they talk about?

|-
| ''Yes, '''here you go'''.''
|-
|}
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd034.ogg|right]]













{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:orange; color:white&quot; | '''Plug-in words:'''
|-
| のみもの drinks, たべもの food
|-
| たべて eat (action word, command form)
|-
| はなして say (action word, command form)
|-
| のんで drink (action word, command form)
|-
| びーる beer, みず water, けーき cake, 
|- 
| ぽてど french fries, おちゃ tea
|-
| &lt;small&gt;NOTE: The bar &lt;big&gt;ー&lt;/big&gt; like you see here &lt;/small&gt;
|-
| &lt;small&gt;just makes the vowel long. Just pull out the sound.&lt;/small&gt;
|}

If Johnny wanted Mary to drink some too, what would he say? Lets find out!


{| align=&quot;left&quot;
| style=&quot;background:blue; color:white&quot; | '''Johnny'''
|-
| びーるをのんでください. [[Image:Blue ball.png|10px|bi-ru O nondekudasai.]]
|-
| ''Drink some beer please.''
|-
|}
[[Image:Qsjapaneseicon-man01.png]]
[[File:Wikibooksqsjapanese1-snd035.ogg|left]]






Notice that Johnny put the thing with the article thing and then the special action word right before please. He could skip the thing and the article and just ask Mary to drink, but he wanted to be more clear about what to drink. Lets hope they don't get too drunk!

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background:green; color:white&quot; | '''～　Language note of interest!　～'''
|-
| You might need to count things. The sad thing is that counting is   
|-
| really confusing in Japanese. The good thing is that there are some   
|- 
| general use numbers that will work until Johnny can learn the more 
|-
| correct forms. Put them right before ください in a sentence.
|-
|  ひとつ one, ふたつ two, みっつ three, よっつ four 
|-
|  &lt;small&gt;(Remember: Don't read the little っ in the middle of 3 and 4, because it's silent!)&lt;/small&gt;
|-

And now the final wrap up of all our new skills?

Literal Translation: &quot;Murgh = Chicken&quot; &quot;Makhini = Butter&quot;.  This is buttered chicken.

==Procedure==

Start with a parted chicken marinaded in [[Cookbook:Tandoori masala|Tandoori masala]] marinade (chicken, marinated in yogurt with ginger, garlic, and green chili paste). Fry it in butter (Tandoori Chicken would be grilled in oil) with the ginger, garlic and green chili paste.

Make a red gravy of tomato purée, red chili powder, salt, and [[Cookbook:Garam masala|Garam masala]].  Add water, bring to a boil and reduce heat.  Add the parted chicken, coat with gravy.

Add cream, simmer for 10 minutes, serve hot.

      <comment>/* Radicals */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navlist/Top}}

== Radicals ==

Radicals are sounds produced in the back of the throat. They are divided into two categories: pharyngeals and epiglottals. Pharyngeals/epiglottals are commonly found in North Africa/Middle East (Arabic and related languages) and in British Columbia, in the Salishan languages. Pharyngeal plosives are thought to be impossible. Very few languages contrast epiglottal and pharyngeal consonants.

The pharyngeals possible are the [[w:voiceless pharyngeal fricative|voiceless pharyngeal fricative]] and the [[w:voiced pharyngeal fricative|voiced pharyngeal fricative]], actually an approximant. The epiglottals possible are the [[w:epiglottal plosive|epiglottal plosive]], the [[w:voiceless epiglottal fricative|voiceless epiglottal fricative]], the [[w:voiced epiglottal fricative|voiced epiglottal fricative]], actually an approximant, the [[w:epiglottal trill|epiglottal trill]], and the [[w:epiglottal flap|epiglottal flap]], which is not known to occur in any language.

== The click consonants ==

Click consonants are consonants that do not require air coming up from the lungs or glottis. As such, they cannot be voiced. The air steam they use is ingressive, pulling air in with the tongue. The most common click sound familiar to speakers of English is the 'tsk tsk' sound used to signal disapproval. which is a dental click transcribed [||].

They are very rare, but several languages of southern Africa use them.

Click consonants are famous to the Western world mainly because of the 1980s movie, ''The Gods Must Be Crazy''.
And a singer who used them heavily in her songs, drawing on their exotic sound.

== Ingressive airstream ==

An Ingressive airstream is what is generated when, instead of breathing out, you breath in.
Ingressive consonants are voiced, note that an unvoiced ingressive stop is a click. I myself cannot produce a creaky ingressive, but that is not to say it is impossible. All of the egressive stops have an ingressive analogue.

Specifies &quot;1 can&quot; peas, how big is a can?

Specifies juice of 1 lemon, how much juice is this?

Specifies &quot;French mustard&quot;, [[Cookbook:mustard]] implies there are several kinds. Dijon mustard?

Specifies olives - black or green?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

'''Folding''' is a way of gently mixing ingredients, used to incorporate ingredients into a [[cookbook:batter|batter]] or other mixture. Use a wooden spoon or broad spatula and mix the ingredients a spoonful at a time. The technique is often used when one of the ingredients (e.g., [[Cookbook:Egg|egg white]] or [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]) has been whipped, and strenuous mixing would risk driving out the air that has been incorporated. Similarly, if a delicate ingredient, such as cooked fish, is to be mixed, folding will prevent the pieces being broken up.</text>

      <comment>/* Ingredients */general cleanup, typos fixed: jalapeno → jalapeño using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

'''Adobo sauce''' is a sauce or marinade used in Latin American- and [Southwest U.S.-style cooking, made of finely chopped or pureed chiles, garlic, vinegar, and often onions and tomatoes.  Food that has been prepared with adobo is sometimes called ''adobado''. [http://www.cookinglight.com/cooking/cs/techniques/article/0,13803,232455-232428,00.html]

Chipotles in adobo sauce is a particular use of this condiment in which chipotles (smoked jalapeño peppers) are stewed in adobo sauce.  Ingredients of this sauce generally include tomatoes, garlic, vinegar, salt, and spices.
  
==Ingredients==

*A dozen chipotle peppers or smoked, dried jalapeño peppers (most co-ops can get these for you, or try the specialty produce section of your grocery store)
*4 cups (.95 L) water
*½ cup (120 mL) onion, diced
*⅓ cup (80 mL))apple cider vinegar
*¼ cup (60 mL) ketchup
*3 cloves garlic, crushed or sliced
*pinch of cumin, oregano and salt to taste

== Procedure ==

Combine all ingredients in a heavy sauce pan
Cook over a very low heat for 1-2 hours until the chiles are very soft and the liquid has been reduced to about 1-cup; or put in a slow cooker overnight. 

Beat with a mortar and pestle or put in blender to puree for a thick sauce. 

Will keep several weeks in the fridge in an airtight container, or can it in mason jars to store longer following directions for sterilizing jars and proper sealing.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The idea behind this page ==

When we see for the first time a circuit, our natural human will is to understand it immediately, to discern the basic idea behind it and to imagine how it operates. Thinking about the new unrecognized circuit, we, human beings, begin asking a chain of natural questions. Alas, browsing through various electronics resources we usually cannot manage to find answers to our questions. Regretfully, education suppresses our most human desire - to ask questions and to get answers to questions. As a result, there are lots of questions that are never answered.

What are the questions that we need to understand, improve and invent new circuit?

== Common questions about the circuit... ==

=== ...problem solved... ===
*What is the problem that the circuit solves?
*Where does this problem spring from?

=== ... predecessors... ===
*What are the simpler passive circuits, on which the new compound passive circuit is based?
*What is the more elementary passive circuit that is transmuted into the new active one?
*What is the relation between the old passive and the new active version?
*What are the same but previous circuit implementations (tube, transistor, op-amp, etc.)?

=== ... structure... ===
*Why has the circuit the structure showed?
**What is the sense of connecting the passive components?
**Why are active components added to the circuit?
*Why are the components connected in this way?

=== ... operation... ===
*What do the active components (tubes, transistors, op-amps, etc.) do in this circuit?
*How do the active components do what they do?
*Can we substitute the abstract active electronic components by equivalent electrical ones?
*Can we put ourselves into their place?
*What do we do to perform their action?

=== ...general idea... ===
*What is the basic circuit idea?
*Where the circuit idea comes from?
*How the idea is been evolving through years?

=== ...imperfections... ===
*What are the problems in the circuit examined?
*What causes the problems? Is the cause internal or external?

=== ...improvements... ===
*How do we improve the circuit?
*What additional components do we add to elaborate it?
*Can we create an almost ideal circuit?

'''Disc golf''' (sometimes called '''Frisbee golf,''' '''folf''' or '''frolf''') is a [[w:Flying disc games|disc game]] in which individual players throw a flying disc into a basket or at a target. According to the [[w:Professional Disc Golf Association|Professional Disc Golf Association]], &quot;The object of the game is to traverse a course from beginning to end in the fewest number of throws of the disc.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PDGA1&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.pdga.com/rules/index.php?rule=all Rules]&quot;, ''PDGA.com'', Professional Disc Golf Association&lt;!--This is an improper ref. citation; use {{Cite web}} to provide source details.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Disc golf is similar to traditional golf and uses much of the same rules and terminology. As in ball golf, a course usually consists of 18 holes. Unlike ball golf, most courses are located in public parks and are free to play, although some courses require a nominal fee, and the sport requires inexpensive discs instead of costly clubs and balls. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wired1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,71195-0.html|title=Disc Golf: It's Not Actually Golf
|accessdate=2006-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern disc golf target consists of a metal basket with chains hanging over it and was invented in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC58211&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/58211/disc_golf_the_rediscovery_of_an_aging.html|title=Disc Golf: The Re-discovery of an Aging Sport|accessdate=2006-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Disc golf is sometimes informally called &quot;Frisbee golf&quot; (&quot;Frisbee&quot; being a trademark of the [[Wham-O]] toy company for its line of discs), &quot;folf&quot;, or &quot;frolf&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;Frisbee&quot; and &quot;golf&quot; made popular by a reference on ''Seinfeld''). The governing bodies of the sport and the manufacturers of equipment uniformly refer to the game as &quot;disc golf.&quot;

==Basic Terminology== 
'''Tee Pad''' - the area where the first throw of a given hole must take place. These are often concrete pads, but many courses utilize natural tees. It is not uncommon for a portion of a sidewalk or a parking lot to be used as a tee pad. 

'''The Basket''' - often called the pin. Once a disc lands in the basket, the hole is considered completed. 

'''Throw''' - the act of propelling the disc towards the basket. Each throw is counted towards the player’s score.  There are three types of throws: backhand, forehand (often called sidearm), and overhand. (styles of throw are explained later in this entry)

'''Lie''' - the spot where the disc comes to rest. This is often marked by a mini-disc marker. 

'''Par''' - like in ball golf, each disc golf course has a posted par. The ‘par’ is the number of strokes that a scratch player would need to complete the hole. This is usually the number of throws it takes to reach the green + two putts. On a hole less than 400ft, the par is usually three, depending on the number of obstacles. For holes more than 400ft, the par is usually four. Most disc golfers disregard the posted par, in favor of a universal par of three. To the competitive disc golfer, every hole is a par three, making the total par for 18 holes always 54. This serves to simplify the game. And this helps the average disc golfer measure themselves against the pros. Most pros can finish any hole in three strokes. 

'''Drive''' - any throw off of the tee pad, or a throw from the fairway designed for maximum distance. 

'''Approach''' - usually the second shot of a hole, designed to place the disc within putting distance. 

'''Putt''' - a throw is officially considered a putt if it is made within the circle.  Many players consider distances of twenty or thirty meter putts, and use their putting motion. There are special rules related to official putting however. (see below)

'''Ace''' - known as a hole in one in ball golf.  An ace occurs when a player makes their first shot, or drive, into the basket.  An ace in disc golf is fairly rare and much praise is given to those who have accomplished this spectacular feat.

'''The Circle''' - what is considered the green in disc golf. This is a circle ten meters in radius, with the basket at its center.

==Differences and Similarities to Ball Golf==
Unlike ball golf, disc golf is more able to utilize natural objects than ball golf. Forcing players to play through small holes in tree lines, or around hills and buildings, or through tight lines in the woods is not uncommon in disc golf. Having low canopies in the woods also provides an interesting challenge. Playing uphill or downhill is also common on the disc golf course. Some holes may be only 150ft, but there could be three lines, with clearance of only ten feet that the disc must fly through to get to the hole. A good disc golf hole has multiple lines that can be used to reach the basket, making the use of multiple shots an option. A good disc golf course, however, has a few holes that force a certain kind of shot. These holes force players to use a wide variety of techniques, rewarding a player who has taken the time to master many different shots. 

Older disc golf courses are generally shorter than newer courses, and all courses are much shorter than ball golf courses. The top pros generally throw between 300 ft. and 500ft, while most amateurs throw less than 300ft. People simply can't throw a disc as far as a golf ball can be hit. Older courses were designed before technology allowed discs to fly as far as they do, and so they tend to be shorter, with more technical holes, usually only featuring one or two holes that are over 350ft or even 300ft. Most new courses often feature holes that are more than 500ft.   

'''Rule differences with ball golf and disc golf:'''
* In ball golf, the player can only carry 14 clubs. Disc golf has no rule concerning how many discs a disc golfer can carry. Also, disc golfers may add discs to their bag during the round, which is not allowed in ball golf.

* Whereas club golfers must &quot;play it where it lies&quot; on the ground, it doesn't work the same with disc golf since the disc is thrown and not struck. Disc golfers must have a supporting point (usually a foot but can be any part of the body) on the playing surface within 30cm behind the front edge of where their previous shot landed (if inbounds) at the point their next throw is released. This allows the disc golfer to lean to the left, or the right to establish a better angle around obstacles. His 'pivot' foot must remain behind his marker however. A special mini-disc is usually used to mark the previous lie on the ground, however the use of a mini is only required if the player would like to use the same disc they just threw or if they are moving the lie.

*In disc golf, it is acceptable for a player to 'fall' in front of his lie. The motion of throwing the disc often involves a significant amount of force, which can cause a player to be off-balance. As long as his 'plant' of 'pivot' foot is behind his marker when he releases the disc, he may fall in front of the marker after the release. This allowance does NOT apply to putting. A throw is officially considered a putt in disc golf if the lie is marked within what is known as 'The Circle'. This is a circle with a ten meter radius, with the pin at its center. After putting, a disc golfer must demonstrate balance with his plant foot, before they may step away from his marker. However, like golfers may putt from the fringe, rough or fairway, most disc golfers still use a putting motion on shots that are longer than 10 meters, often called &quot;being out of the circle&quot; or &quot;being outside.&quot; The player may follow through on these shots and many players develop a jump putt where the golfer literally jumps towards the target. This allows a combination of accuracy that putting provides and more power on the putt.

*Falling putts (when the player follows through [as described above] on a putt 10 meters or shorter) and foot faults (when a player does not release the disc behind their mark or within the required distance of the mark, when a player has a part of their body touching the ground on release past their mark or when their tee shot is released from off the teeing area) are penalized in a unique way. The first offense is not penalized a stroke, but the golfer is required to re-throw the shot and then is warned for the offense. Any subsequent fouls, however, are penalized one stroke and the golfer must re-throw.

* Disc golf doesn't have &quot;hazards&quot; as defined in ball golf. Bodies of water, park roads and areas of cement are typically defined as out-of-bounds in disc golf, however, sometimes these are not. Most courses define these areas as out of bounds or in bounds on tee signs at each hole, however, there is no universal standard for these. As in ball golf, any out-of-bounds shot is a one stroke penalty, however, the rules for spotting the lie for the next shot are quite different than those in ball golf. If a throw lands out of bounds, unless defined by the hole, the thrower has the option of playing from the previous lie, or playing from the approximate spot where his disc crossed into the out-of-bound territory. If he chooses to play from where his disc crosses out-of-bounds, he may take a one meter relief from the out-of-bounds area, even if it puts him closer to the pin. The rules do not permit a player to have a supporting point touching out of bounds on release so this is the reason for the relief. If a player lands within a meter of the out of bounds and is in bounds, he is still granted this relief for the same reasoning. This relief is an option, the only rule regarding this involving this is when the disc is released. Most golfers use this rule to their advantage to make putts closer or to improve their lie. Some holes may require a throw from a Drop Zone. If that is the case, the thrower simply moves to the drop zone to play his next shot. A disc is only considered out-of-bounds if it is completely surrounded by out-of-bounds. If any part of the disc is touching in-bounds, then the lie is playable.

* Another difference is the optional penalty for a disc that lands more than 2 meters above the playing surface. The course designer may specify that on particular trees, holes, or the whole course, a disc landing above 2 meters will receive a one throw penalty. This is known as the 2-Meter Rule. If not specified, there's no penalty for a disc landing any height above the ground. In ball golf, it's likely a player will need to take an unplayable penalty if their ball lands above the ground. On the other hand, balls are much less likely to remain stuck above ground than discs are as they fly through trees. When the disc is stuck above ground (including on top of baskets and those that land in the wrong the basket) are to be marked directly below the disc. Even if the disc is not retrieveable, as long as the player can identify it, he is not penalized (assuming the 2- meter rule is not in effect). A tournament director has the option of enforcing the 2-Meter Rule regardless of whether or not the course enforces the rule. Many casual disc golfers often choose whether to play with the 2-Meter Rule at the beginning of a round. 

*Disc Golf holes may also have what are known as 'mandatories' or what are commonly called &quot;mandos&quot;  These are obstacles that a disc must pass in a certain way. For example, a tree may be marked as a 'right mandatory', meaning a disc must pass that tree on the right side. Failure to hit a mandatory is a one-stroke penalty, and the thrower must play from his previous lie or a drop zone if provided. Mandos are usually put in place to force a player to play down a fairway instead of down another fairway to help with safety.

'''Safety:'''  Disc golf is usually played in a public park, thus bikers, hikers, children playing and campers are often on the course. On some courses, such as on a college campus, athletic activities often take place on fairways. Disc golfers have to be very careful to avoid pedestrians, and it is a generally accepted rule that pedestrians have the right-of-way.

==Equipment==
The golf disc used today is much smaller than traditional flying discs. Also, general-purpose flying discs, such as those used for playing [[Guts (game)|guts]] or Ultimate Frisbee, have a simple edge to them, whereas disc golf discs have extended lips. They also have a much smaller diameter and profile. 

There are a wide variety of discs, divided into three basic categories: putters, mid-range discs, and drivers.

The putters are designed similar to discs you would play catch with: e.g., a Wham-o brand Frisbee®. They are designed to fly straight, predictably, and very slowly compared to mid-range discs and drivers. Mid-range discs have slightly sharper edges, which enable them to cut through the air better. Drivers have the sharpest edge and have most of their mass concentrated on the outer rim of the disc rather than distributed equally throughout. Drivers are the hardest types of discs to learn how to throw; their flight path will be very unpredictable without practice. Drivers are also often divided into different categories. Innova Discs, the most popular disc manufacturer, divides their discs into Distance Drivers and Fairway Drivers, with a fairway driver being somewhere between a distance drive and a mid-range disc. New players will find that throwing a distance driver accurately will require experience with disc golf disc response. It is better to begin play with a fairway driver and later incorporate distance drivers. 

Discraft Discs, one of Innova's biggest competitors, divides their drivers into 3 categories: Long Drivers, Extra Long Drivers and Maximum Distance Drivers. The greater the distance of the driver the less control the disc golf player has on the disc. Therefore, an unexperienced player would most likely prefer to use a Long or Extra Long Driver while an experience player would go for a maximum distance driver if they were seeking longer throws. 

'''Natural action of the disc:'''
For a right-handed, back-hand thrower (RHBH), the disc will naturally pull to the left. 
For a right-handed fore-hand thrower (RHFH), the disc will naturally pull to the right. 
For a left-handed, back-hand thrower (LHBH), the disc will naturally pull to the right. 
For a left-handed, fore-hand thrower (LHFH), the disc will naturally pull to the left. 

'''Over stable (AKA &quot;hyzer&quot;):''' A disc that is over stable will increase the natural angle of the disc.  Thrown long enough, a good hyzer will perform an &quot;S&quot; shaped curve, and not just a single arc.  

'''Under stable (AKA &quot;an-hyzer&quot;):''' A disc that is under stable will push against the natural angle of the disc. 

'''Weight of the disc:''' Golf discs typically weigh between 150 and 180 grams (5.3-6.3 oz.), and measure about 21-24 cm in diameter.  PDGA rules prohibit discs weighing more than 200 grams, or whose weight is more than 8.3 grams per centimeter of diameter. Lighter discs are more suited to less experienced players, and heavier discs are more suited to experienced players. This is not always the case however. A lighter disc will be more under stable than its heavier counterparts.

==Types of Throws and Throwing Tips==
First, some basic terminology: 

'''Distance Driving''' - a throw that is designed to produce a great deal of distance. When trying to throw for a max distance, the ideal flight path of the disc, for a RHBH thrower, is to turn slightly to the right, straighten out, and then fade to the left. This will look like a ')' or an elongated ‘?’.

'''Approaching''' - if a player is not driving the disc, he is either approaching or putting. Professional players consider around a 200-250ft shot to be an approach. For many players, however, this is the length of their normal drives. For some players, a shot does not truly become an approach until around 100ft. 

'''Putting''' - officially, a disc is being putt if it is being thrown within the circle. However, many players use their putting motion from much further away. There are many different types of putts which are explained below. As with anything, a disc golfer must find what is comfortable for them, and go with it. There is no ‘wrong’ way to putt.  A good video of putting instruction can be found at this link: http://www.discraft.com/resources.html

'''Backhand''' - when throwing backhand, a thrower must determine for himself what kinds of discs work best for them, depending on how much ‘snap’ they throw with. ‘Snap’ is generated by high arm speed and by a player cocking his wrist and literally snapping the disc on the release. When thrown correctly, a disc will literally make an audible snapping sound upon release. Players who throw with a great deal of snap should throw over stable discs, whereas a player who doesn’t throw with a great deal of snap should throw under stable discs.  

'''Forehand''' - As with backhands, players have to determine for themselves what sort of discs work for them. Generally, forehand throws generate more snap than a backhand throw, so usually, forehand shots require more over stable discs.

With both forehands and backhands, the throwing ability of different players will progress. For example, when a player first starts throwing, they do not throw with a great deal of snap, thus they should use under stable discs. However, the player will eventually learn how to throw with more snap, which will require them to move to more over stable discs. Players should not, however, remove that first disc for the bag, as it may now be good for turnover drives or anhyzers. Players have to learn their discs and learn what works best for them. 

'''Hyzer''' - a hyzer is a throw that is designed to take advantage of the natural angle of the disc. For example, a RHBH hyzer is a shot that fades to the left. There are a few types of hyzers. A soft hyzer is a throw that gradually fades, whereas a spike hyzer is a throw where the disc fades hard and drastically. Spike hyzers can result in discs that are literally ‘spiked’ into the ground. These types of throws are used to navigate certain obstacles. A disc that is slightly over stable with a high glide, such as the Innova Valkyrie, are good for soft hyzers, whereas a disc that is very over stable with a low glide, such as Innova Firebirds, are best for spike hyzers. 

'''Anhyzer''' - an anhyzer is a throw that is designed to go against the natural angle of the disc. For example, a RHBH thrower who throws a disc that fades to the right would be throwing an anhyzer. To execute an anhyzer, a RHBH would tilt the disc to the right when he releases the disc. Under stable discs are best used for anhyzers. As with hyzers, soft and spike hyzers are options.  The Innova ‘Roadrunner’ and ‘Stingray’ are good for anhyzer shots. 

'''Turnover''' - a disc is ‘turned over’ when it flies against the natural angle of the disc. For example, a RHBH thrower has turned a disc over if it flies to the right when released flat. This differs from an anhyzer because of the angle of release. Turnover drives are generally released flat or at a slight angle, whereas an anhyzer is released at a more drastic angle. Ideally, the disc will ‘flex’ back to the natural fade, creating an ‘S’ curve. Some curves are more drastic then others. A more under stable disc will turn over harder than an over stable disc. Depending on the shot, a certain type of turnover drive may be required. Lighter discs will turnover much easier than heavier discs. An ideal drive for max distance is usually slightly turned over. Depending on the thrower, many discs can be used for turnover drives. 

'''Hammer/Tomahawk''' - an overhand throw where the thrower grips the disc much like he would a forehand. This throw has a unique flight pattern which is best learned by throwing a few out in a field. It is useful for going over difficult obstacles. Mid-range discs with high glide are best for hammers. The Innova Max and Roc are good discs for hammers. 

'''Thumber''' - an overhand throw that involves placing the thumb inside the lip of the disc. Like the hammer, the thumber has a unique flight patter than is best learned by throwing a few out in a field. It is also useful for going over difficult obstacles.  The Innova Monster is a good thumber disc. 

'''Roller''' - this is a shot designed to travel a short distance in the air and then roll towards the target. Rollers can be thrown forehand and backhand, and should be considered a very advanced throw. Many disc golfers can roll a disc farther than they can throw it. Rollers are very effective in going under obstacles, such as a circle of trees around the basket. They are difficult to control, and require a great deal of practice. Innova Sidewinders and Roadrunners make good long distance rollers, and Innova Leopards and Cheetahs make for good mid to short range rollers. 

'''In-line Putting''' - a style of putting where the plant foot is directly behind the lie marker and pointed right at the basket, and the other foot is placed behind the plant foot. The disc is thrown from the chest generally straight at the pin. Some in line putter throw the disc with a bit of snap and run right at the basket, while others try to float the disc into the basket. This is just a matter of personal taste or what the situation dictates. In-line putters almost always put backhand. 

'''Straddle Putt''' - a style of putting where one foot is placed behind the lie marker and the other is parallel, rather than behind, the plant foot. The putter often squats a bit a uses their legs to propel the discs. Straddle putts can be used to navigate around obstacles and provide a clear line to the basket. Some prefer the stability of straddle putting for shorter puts and many use the stance for jump putting. Most straddle putts are backhand putts, though they can be forehand puts. 

'''Jump Putt''' - outside the circle, jump putting is used to generate more power. It is similar to straddle putting except the putter jumps forward with the release of the disc. This is a tough skill that requires some practice, but can be very effective. Many golfers do not bother with jump putting, though many use it very effectively. Jump putting is illegal within the circle. Jump putting is almost always done with a backhand throw. 

'''Turbo Putt''' - an interesting style of putt where the thumb is placed in the middle of the disc and the fingers are rested on the outer rim of the disc. The putter spins the disc slightly with the release and pushes with his fingers to propel the disc. This style of putting is not very effective outside of the circle. 

'''Pancake Putt''' - a putt used in the event a miss will create a bad disc placement (i.e. over a ledge, into water, etc.). The disc is held top plate facing away from the putter with fingertips placed on the top plate over the rim and thumb resting outstretched on the bottom of the disc rim. The putter raises his full arm above his shoulder then quickly swings in a downward motion. His arm follows through the putt; the disc is released by all fingers slightly higher than the intended target. The fingertips will press into the top plate causing the disc to flip bottom to top and halt upon impact. A heavy putter or mid-range disc is suggested.

'''Kneeling Putt''' - in disc golf, the situation often dictates that a throw must be made from a kneeling position. Any point of contact is legal as long as it follows previously stated rules, i.e., in line with the marker disc, no closer to the hole and within the acceptable distance behind the marker.

When putting, golfers also use unconventional stances. Golfers sometime contort their bodies in unique ways to navigate around obstacles. Sometimes a lunge position is utilized to putt, either forehand or backhand. Sometimes the golfer's feet are each at a different level of elevation. By rule, it is technically legal for someone to completely lie on the ground and throw, assuming their foot is behind their mini marker, and they do not use their body to decrease the distance between their marker and the pin.

==Scoring==
[[w:Stroke play|Stroke play]] is the most common scoring method but there are many others, including [[w:match play|match play]], [[w:skins game|skins]], [[w:speed golf|speed golf]] and captain's choice, which in disc golf is referred to as &quot;doubles&quot; (not to be confused with partner or team play).

In every form of play, the goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible. Scores for each hole can be described as follows:

A ''snowman'' (perhaps 4 over par on a par 4 hole) is an informal term in some countries for a score indicating that 8 shots were taken at a single hole&lt;ref name=&quot;MiMi1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Doubles play is a unique style of play that many local courses offer on a weekly basis. In this format, teams of two golfers are determined. Sometime this is done by random draw, and other times it is a pro-am format. On the course, it is a 'best-disc' scramble. Meaning both player throw their tee shot, and then decide which lie they would like to play. Both players then play from the same lie, again choosing which lie is preferable.

The first plastic listed in each entry is the Innova line, the second is the Discraft line, and the third is the Gateway line.  

1. DX/Pro-D/S - this is the economy line of plastic. It is generally very grippy when worn, but it will wear very quickly. It is easy to warp and bend these discs. They do not maintain their flight characteristics for too long. Many players use DX plastic for mid-range discs, but not in drivers. Many also prefer putters in this plastic, citing the added grip as their reasoning. 

2. Proline/Elite-X/H - A plastic more sturdy than economy plastics. Players often prefer the feel of these over the economy line. 

3. Champion/Elite-Z/E/Proton - A premier plastic that is extremely durable, more expensive, and due to the high percentage of polyurethane, often translucent. It will maintain flight characteristics even after a great deal of abuse. Players often find it is easier to control a Champion of Elite-Z disc and that they can get more of a reaction out of the disc with less effort.

4. Glow - this plastic glows in the dark when held up to a florescent light. It is a bit more durable than DX plastic, but not quite as durable as Pro-Line plastic.

5. Star/ESP - A very durable plastic that maintains flight characteristics a bit longer than Champion or Elite-Z plastic and that is a grippier plastic. Some players prefer the feel of Champion or Elite-Z plastic, while others prefer Star or ESP.

6. ESP FLX (Discraft) - A very flexible plastic offered only by Discraft. The disc can literally bend in half and spring right back into its original form. The grip it offers is superb. The discs also do not bounce far. When the hit a tree, they tend to fold and drop to the ground, rather than carry deeper into the woods. They also grip the chains very well.

==History==
Disc golf, in some form, has probably been played informally since the early 1900s, according to Victor Malafront's, &quot;The Frisbee Handbook.&quot; But modern disc golf started in the late 1960s, when it seems to have been invented in many places and by many people independently. Two of the best-know figures in the sport are George Sappenfield and &quot;Steady Ed&quot; Headrick.

===George Sappenfield and early object courses===
For example, George Sappenfield, a Californian, realized that golf would be a lot of fun if played with discs. He set up an object course for kids to play on, and other early courses were also of this type, using anything from lamp poles to fire hydrants as targets. A year later, Sappenfield introduced the game to many adults, and courses began to crop up in various places in the Midwest and the East Coast (some perhaps through Sappenfield's promotion efforts, others probably independently envisioned).  Some of Sappenfield's acquaintances are known to have brought the game to UC Berkeley. It quickly became popular on campus, with a permanent course laid out in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThinkQuest25034&quot;&gt;http://library.thinkquest.org/25034/intro-history.html&lt;!--This is not a proper reference citation; use {{Cite web}} to source specific facts inline.&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Steady Ed&quot; Headrick and the growth of the modern game===
The first standardized target course was put in by &quot;Steady Ed&quot; Headrick, a flying disc innovator known as the &quot;Father of Disc Golf&quot;, in what was then known as Oak Grove Park in La Canada Flintridge, California, California,&lt;ref name=&quot;DGA1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2006-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  (Today the park is known as Hahamonga Watershed Park). This park is immediately to the south of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which supplied at least a few of the earliest players. Ed worked for the San Gabriel, California, California-based Wham-O  Corporation and is credited for pioneering the modern era of disc sports. 

Headrick coined and trademarked the term &quot;Disc Golf&quot; when formalizing the sport and invented the [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;r=1&amp;l=50&amp;f=G&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=4039189.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4039189&amp;RS=PN/4039189 Disc Pole Hole], the first disc golf target to incorporate chains and a basket on a pole.  
Headrick founded the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA), [[Disc Golf Association]] (DGA), and [[Recreational Disc Golf Association]] (RDGA) as [[Sports governing body|governing bodies]] for professional, competitive amateur, and family-oriented play, respectively, and worked on standardizing the rules and the equipment for the quickly-growing sport. Headrick abandoned his trademark on the term &quot;Disc Golf&quot;, and turned over control and administration of the PDGA to the growing body of disc golf players in order to focus his passion for building and inventing equipment for the sport. Upon his death, Headrick was cremated and his ashes were made into a limited number of  discs per his wishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFGate20020814&quot;&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/08/14/BA158892.DTL&lt;/ref&gt; The discs were given to friends and family, and some were sold with all proceeds going toward funding a nonprofit &quot;Steady&quot; Ed Memorial Disc Golf Museum at the [http://pdga.com/idgc/index.php PDGA International Disc Golf Center] in Columbia County, Georgia. One of the discs that contains Headrick's ashes will be permanently placed on the roof of the center. When asked why this was to be done, by a member of the local media, PDGA Executive Director Brian Graham quoted an old Frisbee addage, &quot;Old Frisbee players are like old Frisbee's ... They don't die, they just land up on roof.&quot;

==Women in the sport==
{{sect-stub|date=September 2007}}
While there are more male than female players, the Women's Disc Golf Association exists to encourage female players and arrange women's tournaments. A [http://www.pdga.com/documents/2007/06demographics.pdf PDGA survey] states that out of its 11,302 members in 2006, 8% are female, or about 900.

'''''Achillea millefolium''''' or '''Yarrow''' (other common names Common Yarrow, '''Gordaldo''', '''Nosebleed plant''', '''Old Man's Pepper''', '''Sanguinary''', '''Milfoil''', '''Soldier's Woundwort''', '''Thousand-leaf''' (as its binomial name affirms), '''Thousand-seal''') is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to the Northern Hemisphere. 

==Description==
Common Yarrow is an erect herbaceous perennial plant that produces one to several stems (0.2 to 1m tall) and has a rhizomatous growth form. Leaves are evenly distributed along the stem, with the leaves near the middle and bottom of the stem being the largest.  The leaves have varying degrees of hairiness (pubescence).  The leaves are 5-20 cm long, bipinnate or tripinnate, almost feathery, and arranged spirally on the stems. The leaves are cauline and more or less clasping.  The inflorescence has 4 to 9 phyllaries and contains ray and disk flowers which are white to pink.  There are generally 3 to 8 ray flowers that are ovate to round.  Disk flowers range from 15 to 40.  The inflorescence is produced in a flat-topped cluster.  Yarrow grows up to 3500m above sea level.  The plant commonly flowers from May through June, and is a frequent component in butterfly gardens. Common yarrow is frequently found in the mildly disturbed soil of grasslands and open forests. Active growth occurs in the spring.

==Growing Conditions==
Common yarrow is a drought tolerant species of which there are several different ornamental cultivars.  Seeds require light for germination, so optimal germination occurs when planted no deeper than ¼ inch.  Seeds also require a temperature of 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit.  Common yarrow responds best to soil that is poorly developed and well drained.  The plant has a relatively short life, but may be prolonged by dividing the plant every other year, and planting 12 to 18 inches apart.  Common yarrow is a weedy species and can become invasive.&lt;ref&gt;USDA, NRCS. 2006. The PLANTS Database (http://plants.usda.gov, 22 May 2006). National Plant Data Center, Baton Rouge, LA 70874-4490 USA.[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACMI2]&lt;/ref&gt;  It may suffer from mildew or root rot if not planted in well-drained soil.

==Varieties==
There are several varieties and subspecies:
*''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium''
**''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium'' var. ''millefolium'' - Europe, Asia
**''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium'' var. ''alpicola'' - Rocky Mountains
**''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium'' var. ''borealis'' - Arctic regions
**''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium'' var. ''californica'' - California
**''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium'' var. ''occidentalis'' - North America
**''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium'' var. ''pacifica'' - west coast of North America
**''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium'' var. ''puberula'' - California
**''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''millefolium'' var. ''rubra'' - Southern Appalachians
*''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''chitralensis'' - western Himalaya
*''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''sudetica'' - Alps, Carpathians

==Uses==
Yarrows can be planted to combat soil erosion due to the plant's resistance to drought.

The herb is purported to be a diaphoretic, astringent&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchens&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Indian Herbology of North America | author= Alma R. Hutchens | isbn=0-87773-639-1 | year=1973 | publisher=Shambhala Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;, tonic&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchens&quot; /&gt;, stimulant and mild aromatic. It contains isovaleric acid, salicylic acid, asparagin, sterols, flavonoids, bitters, tannins, and coumarins. The plant also has  a long history as a powerful 'healing herb' used topically for wounds, cuts and abrasions.  The genus name ''Achillea'' is derived from mythical Greek character, Achilles,&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchens&quot; /&gt; who reportedly carried it with his army to treat battle wounds.  This medicinal action is also reflected in some of the common names mentioned below, such as Staunchweed and Soldier's Woundwort.

Yarrow has also been used as a food, and was very popular as a vegetable in the 17th century.  The younger leaves are said to be a pleasant leaf vegetable when cooked as spinach, or in a soup. Yarrow is sweet with a slight bitter taste.

===Herbal medicine===
Yarrow has seen historical use as a medicine, mainly because of its astringent effects.  Decoctions have been used to treat inflammations such as piles (hemorrhoids), and also headaches. Confusingly, it has been said to both stop bleeding and promote it.  Infusions of Yarrow, taken either internally or externally, are said to speed recovery from severe bruising.  The most medicinally active part of the plant are the flowering tops.  They also have a mild stimulant effect, and have been used as a snuff. Today, yarrow is valued mainly for its action in colds and influenza, and also for its effect on the circulatory, digestive, and urinary systems.

The flowers, rich in chemicals are converted by steam into anti-allergenic compounds. The flowers are used for various allergic mucus problems, including hay fever. Harvest during summer and autumn. Drink the infused flower for upper respiratory phlegm or use externally as a wash for eczema. Inhale for hay fever and mild asthma, use fresh in boiling water. 

The dark blue essential oil, extracted by steam distillation of the flowers, is generally used as an anti-inflammatory or in chest rubs for colds and influenza. Massage oil for inflamed joints, dilute 5-10 drops yarrow oil in 25 ml infused St. John's wort oil. A chest rub can be made for chesty colds and influenza, combine with eucalyptus, peppermint, hyssop, or thyme oils, diluting a total of 20 drops of oil in 25 ml almond or sunflower oil.

The aerial parts are used for phlegm conditions, as a bitter digestive tonic to encourage bile flow, and as a diuretic. The aerial parts act as a tonic for the blood, stimulate the circulation, and can be used for high blood pressure. Also useful in menstrual disorders, and as an effective sweating remedy to bring down fevers. Harvest during flowering. The tincture is used for urinary disorders or menstrual problems. Prescribed for cardiovascular complaints. Soak a pad in an infusion or dilute tincture to soothe varicose veins.

Yarrow intensifies the medicinal action of other herbs taken with it, and helps eliminate toxins from the body.  It is reported to be associated with the treatment of the following ailments:

Amenorrhea, anti-inflammatory, bowels, bleeding, blood clots, blood pressure (lowers), blood purifier, blood vessels (tones), Catarrh (acute, repertory), colds, chicken pox, circulation, contraceptive (unproven), cystitis, diabetes treatment, digestion (stimulates), dyspepsia, eczema, fevers, flus, gastritis, glandular system, gum ailments, Heartbeat (slow), influenza, insect repellent, internal bleeding, liver (stimulates and regulates), lungs (hemorrhage), measles, menses (suppressed), menorrhagia, Menstruation (regulates, relieves pain), Nipples (soreness), nosebleeds, piles (bleeding), smallpox, stomach sickness, toothache, thrombosis, ulcers, urinary antiseptic, Uterus (tighten and contract), varicose veins, vision. 

The salicylic acid derivatives are a component of aspirin, which may account for its use in treating fevers and reducing pain.  Yarrow tea is also said to be able to clear up a cold within 24 hours.

===Companion planting===
Yarrow is considered an especially useful companion plant, not only repelling some bad insects while attracting good, predatory ones, but also improving soil quality. It attracts predatory wasps, which drink the nectar and then use insect pests as food for their larvae. Similarly, it attracts ladybugs and hoverflies. Its leaves are thought to be good fertilizer, and a beneficial additive for compost.

It is also considered directly beneficial to other plants, improving the health of sick plants when grown near them.

__NOTOC__

== List of specific circuit questions ==

=== Passive Voltage-to-Current Converter ===
What is the cause and effect relation in a voltage-supplied Ohm's circuit? What does the resistor convert here - energy or information? Is the circuit reversible (can we swap circuit inputs and outputs)? How does a series connected load affect the circuit? How can we decrease the error caused by the load? How do we eliminate the error at all? Is there any relationship between this passive and the [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Voltage-to-Current Converter|active version]]? If yes, how do we convert the passive version into an active one? What are the input and output resistances?

=== Passive Current-to-Voltage Converter ===
What is the cause and effect relation in a current-supplied Ohm's circuit? What does the resistor convert here - energy or information? Is the circuit reversible (can we swap circuit inputs and outputs)? How does a parallel connected load affect the circuit? How can we decrease the error caused by the load? How do we eliminate the error at all? Is there any relationship between this passive and the [[Circuit Idea/Op-amp Inverting Current-to-Voltage Converter|active version]]? If yes, how do we convert the passive version into an active one? What are the input and output resistances?

.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;

=== How do We Create Sinusoidal Oscillations? ===

How oscillations arise in nature? Why does an LC tank consist of two &quot;heterogeneous&quot; accumulating elements (a capacitor and an inductor)? Why is it not assembled by two &quot;homogeneous&quot; elements (both capacitors or both inductors)? What is the role of these elements in the LC circuit? What do they actually do there? What are they? Why does the energy in an LC tank &quot;have no peace&quot;? What make it circulate (in theory, infinitely) between the two components? What makes the accumulating elements discharge completely? Why does an LC oscillation have a sinusoidal shape? Why is it no with linear or other shape? Why does not the LC natural frequency depend on the amount of the &quot;pushed&quot; energy? Why is the oscillation curve symmetrical? What are the differences between LC and other (RC, relaxation, etc.) oscillations? Is there any likeness between them and what is it? What is the connection between an LC tank and a pendulum? What is the &quot;capacitor&quot; and what is the &quot;inductor&quot; in a pendulum?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The frequency of a wave describes how many waves go past a certain point in one second. Frequency is measured in Hertz (usually abbreviated Hz), and can be calculated using the formula:

V = fλ

where V is the velocity of the wave (in ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), f is the frequency of the wave (in Hz), and λ (the Greek letter lambda) is the wavelength of the wave (distance from one peak / trough to the next, in m).

==Multiple Frequencies==

Let us consider the following signal (time is in ms, and the y-axis represents volts):

[[Image:signal_frequencies_example.svg|600px]]

This signal is constructed from a number of different sine waves, with different frequencies, added together. These sine waves are as follows:

[[Image:signal_frequencies_example_split.svg|600px]]

==Frequency Spectra==

Each of these sine waves has a different frequency. You can see this, as they have different distances between their peaks and troughs. These frequencies can be plotted against the amplitude of the wave, as in the table, and chart drawn from it, below:

{| cellpadding = &quot;2&quot;
! Wave (y=)
! Period (ms)
! Amplitude (V)
! Frequency (Hz)

|3sin x
|6.284

|12.566
|1
|80
|-
|2sin(3x - 60)
|2.093
|2
|478
|-
|}

[[Image:Signal_frequencies_example_frequencies.svg]]

This chart is known as the frequency spectrum of a signal.

==Fundamental Frequency==

The fundamental freqency is the lowest frequency that makes up a signal. In the above example, the fundamental frequency is 80 Hz. It is always the frequency farthest to the left of a frequency spectrum, ignoring noise. Other frequencies are known as overtones, or harmonics.

==Questions==

1. What is the frequency of an X-ray (wavelength 0.5nm)?

2. A sound wave, with a frequency of 44 kHz, has a wavelength of 7.7mm. What is the speed of sound?

3. What is the fundamental frequency of the following signal?

[[Image:Signal_frequencies_q3.png]]

4. Approximately how many harmonics does it contain?

5. The three sine waves sin x°, 4sin(2x-50)° and 0.5sin(3x+120)° are added together to form a signal. What are the frequencies of each of the waves? What is the signal's fundamental frequency? Assume that the waves are travelling at the speed of light, and that 60° = 1mm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. What is the frequency of an X-ray (wavelength 0.5nm)?'''

X-rays are electromagnetic waves, so they travel at the speed of light (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).

3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = f x 0.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{0.5 \times 10^{-9}} = 600 \times 10^{15} \mbox{ Hz} = 600 \mbox{ PHz}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A sound wave, with a frequency of 44 kHz, has a wavelength of 7.7mm. What is the speed of sound?'''

V = 44 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; x 7.7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = 338.8ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Image:Signal_frequencies_q3.png|thumb|Frequency spectrum from qs. 3 &amp; 4]]

'''3. What is the fundamental frequency of the following signal?'''

The big spike on the left is at approximately 750 Hz, so this is the fundamental frequency.

'''4. Approximately how many harmonics does it contain?'''

There are 14 other big spikes, plus a few other spikes which may be large enough to be harmonics.

'''5. The three sine waves sin x°, 4sin(2x-50)° and 0.5sin(3x+120)° are added together to form a signal. What are the frequencies of each of the waves? What is the signal's fundamental frequency? Assume that the waves are travelling at the speed of light, and that 60° = 1mm'''

sin x° has a wavelength of 360°. Using this, we can calculate the wavelengths of the other two waves, since f(ax) stretches f(x) by the reciprocal of a on the x axis. The frequency of each wave is given by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;f = \frac { v }{ \lambda\ } = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{\lambda\ \times 10^{-3}}&lt;/math&gt;

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
! Wave (y=)
! Wavelength (°)
! Wavelength (mm)
! Frequency (GHz)
|-
|sin x°
|360
|6
|50
|-
|4sin(2x-50)°
|180
|3
|100
|-
|0.5sin(3x+120)°
|120
|2
|150
|}

sin x° has the lowest frequency, so 50 GHz is the fundamental frequency of the signal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bandwidth is the frequency of a signal. Although original signals have varying frequencies, when these are transmitted, for example, as FM radio waves, they are modulated so that they only use frequencies within a certain range. FM radio modulates the frequency of a wave, so it needs some variation in the frequencies to allow for transmission of multiple frequencies. Since bandwidth is a frequency, it is the number of bits per. second. The bandwidth required to transmit a signal accurately can be calculated by using 1 as the number of bits, giving the formula:

&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{1}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

where B is bandwidth (in Hz), and t is the time taken to transmit 1 bit of data (in s).

The bandwidth of a signal regulates the bit rate of the signal, as, with a higher frequency, more information can be transmitted. This give us the formula (similar to the formula for lossless digital sampling):

b = 2B

where b is the bit rate (in bits per. second), and B is the bandwidth (in Hz).

==Questions==

1. A broadband internet connection has a bit rate of 8Mbit s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; when downloading information. What is the minimum bandwidth required to carry this bit rate?

2. The same connection has a bandwidth of 100 kHz reserved for uploading information. What is the maximum bit rate that can be attained when uploading information using this connection?

3. A lighthouse uses a flashing light and Morse Code to communicate with a nearby shore. A 'dash' consists of the light being on for 2s. The light is left off for 1s between dots and dashes. What is the bandwidth of the connection?

4. The broadband connection in question two is used to upload a 1Mbyte image to a website. How long does it take to do this?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A broadband internet connection has a bit rate of 8Mbit s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; when downloading information. What is the minimum bandwidth required to carry this bit rate?'''

8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 2B

&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{8 \times 10^6}{2} = 4 \times 10^6 \mbox{ Hz} = 4 \mbox{ MHz}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. The same connection has a bandwidth of 100 kHz reserved for uploading information. What is the maximum bit rate that can be attained when uploading information using this connection?'''

b = 2 x 100 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 200 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bits / second = 24.4 kbytes / second

'''3. A lighthouse uses a flashing light and Morse Code to communicate with a nearby shore. A 'dash' consists of the light being on for 2s. The light is left off for 1s between dots and dashes. What is the bandwidth of the connection?'''

One bit takes 3 seconds to transmit.

&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{1}{3} \mbox{ Hz} \approx 333 \mbox{ mHz}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. The broadband connection in question two is used to upload a 1Mbyte image to a website. How long does it take to do this?'''

The bit rate is 200 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bits / second.

1 Mbyte = 1048576 bytes = 8388608 bits.

&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{\mbox{no. of bits}}{\mbox{no. of seconds}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;200 \times 10^3 = \frac{8388608}{\mbox{no. of seconds}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{no. of seconds} = \frac{8388608}{200 \times 10^3} \approx 42\mbox{ s} &lt;/math&gt;

This type of egg is sort of a cross between a sunny side up fried egg and a poached egg.  To prepare, heat a non-stick pan over medium heat.  Add a small amount of non-stick spray, butter, or oil of your choice.  Crack an egg into the pan and add any desired seasoning (such as salt and pepper).  Allow the egg to cook only briefly before adding approximately 1 tablespoon of water.  Immediately cover the pan with a lid and allow the egg to cook for 2-3 minutes, depending on how well done you desire the egg.

The result will be an egg that is fried on the bottom and steamed on the top.  The egg will look similar to a sunny side up egg, except that the exposed portion of the yolk will take on a cloudy white appearance.</text>

A semiconductor has a conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator. They are less conductive than metals, but differ from metals in that, as a semiconductor heats up, its conductivity rises. In metals, the opposite effect occurs.

The reason for this is that, in a semiconductor, very few atoms are ionised, and so very few electrons can move, creating an electric current. However, as the semiconductor heats up, the covalent bonds (atoms sharing electrons, causing the electrons to be relatively immobile) break down, freeing the electrons. As a result, a semiconductor's conductivity rises at an increasing rate as temperature rises.

Examples of semiconductors include silicon and germanium. A full list of semiconductor materials is available at [[w:List_of_semiconductor_materials|Wikipedia]]. At room temperature, silicon has a conductivity of about 435 μS m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Semiconductors are usually 'doped'. This means that ions are added in small quantities, giving the semiconductor a greater or lesser number of free electrons as required. This is controlled by the charge on the ions.

==Questions==

1. What is the resistivity of silicon, at room temperature?

2. What sort of variable resistor would a semiconductor be useful in?

3. If positive ions are added to silicon (doping it), how does its conductivity change?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. What is the resistivity of silicon, at room temperature?'''

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{1}{ \sigma } = \frac{1}{435 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 2300 \Omega \mbox{m} = 2.3 \mbox{k} \Omega \mbox{m}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. What sort of variable resistor would a semiconductor be useful in?'''

A thermistor, as the resistance of a semiconductor decreases as heat increases (but, assuming use of a potential divider, the voltmeter would have to be on the other resistor).

'''3. If positive ions are added to silicon (doping it), how does its conductivity change?'''

Positive ions mean more free electrons, and so greater conductivity.

      <comment>/* SPARQL Query */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://www.dbpedia.org DBpedia ] is a project to convert the contents of Wikipedia to RDF so that it can be linked into other datasets to add to the Semantic Web.  A [[w:SPARQL]] [http://dbpedia.org/sparql endpoint] is provided to query this database.


== SPARQL to KML ==
This application uses DBpedia to create a kml file showing the birth places of the members of a selected UK Football team.  Data quality is limited by a number of factors:
* the age of the Wikipedia extract on which DBpedia is based
* the existence or non-existence  of individual pages in Wikipedia for players
* the consistency of property labeling on Wikipedia infoboxes


=== SPARQL Query ===

&lt;pre&gt;
declare variable  $query := &quot;
PREFIX geo: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#&gt;
PREFIX p: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/property/&gt;          
SELECT * WHERE { 
      ?player p:currentclub  &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arsenal_F.C.&gt;.
      OPTIONAL {?player p:cityofbirth ?city}.
      OPTIONAL {?player p:dateOfBirth ?dob}.
      OPTIONAL {?player p:clubnumber ?no}.
      OPTIONAL {?player p:position ?position}.
      OPTIONAL {?player p:image ?image}.
      OPTIONAL {
               { ?city geo:long ?long. }
                 UNION
               { ?city p:redirect ?city2.
                 ?city2 geo:long ?long.
               }.
        }.
       OPTIONAL {
               { ?city geo:lat ?lat.}
                 UNION
               { ?city p:redirect ?city3.
                 ?city3 geo:lat ?lat.
               }.
         }.
   }
&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This query is complicated by the need to handle possible redirection of the city name - (can this be improved - this is a generic problem?).  To obtain more complete data, the query should also handle the multiple synonyms used for place and date of birth

Changes to dbpedia lead to a short life for queries based om the data-model and vocabulary.  As of Jan 2011, the query is being updated.  Currently to get locations and birthdates for the current players at Arsenal, the following query seems to work.

&lt;pre&gt;
PREFIX geo: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#&gt;
PREFIX p: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/property/&gt;  
PREFIX dbpedia-owl: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/&gt; 
          
SELECT * WHERE { 
      &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arsenal_F.C.&gt; p:name ?player.
      ?player dbpedia-owl:birthPlace ?city;
              dbpedia-owl:birthDate ?dob.
      ?city geo:long ?long;
            geo:lat ?lat.
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

However this yields multiple geocoded locations, of which it can be assumed that the first is most specific (but not possible ? to filter in SPARQL).

=== DBpedia Query ===

The prototype SPARQL query is targeted on Arsenal_F.C. This team name needs to be replaced by the supplied team name, the query then URI-encoded and passed to the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint.

&lt;pre&gt;
let $club := request:get-parameter (&quot;club&quot;,&quot;Arsenal_F.C.&quot;)
let $queryx := replace($query,&quot;Arsenal_F.C.&quot;,$club)

&lt;/pre&gt;

Aside: Initially, the query was written with a generic placeholder ($team) rather than a protypical value (Arsenal_F.C.).  The prototype idiom has the benefit of providing an executable SPARQL query without editing, is more expressive and less tricky - the $ in $team needs escaping in the replace expression since the second argument is a regular expression.


=== Execute the SPARQL Query ===
This query uses the SPARQL endpoint provided by the Virtuoso engine. The format of the result is defined to be XML i.e. the SPARQL Query Result format. A function tidies up the interface: 

&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:execute-sparql($query as xs:string) {
  let $sparql := concat(&quot;http://dbpedia.org/sparql?format=xml&amp;amp;default-graph-uri=http://dbpedia.org&amp;amp;query=&quot;,
                   encode-for-uri($query) 
                 )
  return doc($sparql)
};

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== DBpedia Result ===
The result is in SPARQL Query Results XML format. It is more convenient to convert this generic format to tuples with named elements for later processing. 

&lt;pre&gt;

declare namespace r = &quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/sparql-results#&quot;;

declare function local:sparql-to-tuples($rdfxml ) {
   for $result in $rdfxml//r:result
   return
     &lt;tuple&gt;
            { for $binding  in $result/r:binding
               return                
                 if ($binding/r:uri)
                 then   element {$binding/@name}  {
                           attribute type  {&quot;uri&quot;} , 
                           string($binding/r:uri) 
                         }
                 else   element {$binding/@name}  {
                           attribute type {$binding/r:literal/@datatype},
                           string($binding/r:literal)
                        }
             }
      &lt;/tuple&gt;
 };


&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Query to Tuples ===

&lt;pre&gt;

let $result:= local:execute-sparql($queryx)
let $tuples := local:sparql-to-tuples($result)

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== KML output ===

Since we are generating kml, we need to set the media type and file name and create a Document node - in the appropriate places in the script:
&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=xhtml media-type=application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml highlight-matches=none&quot;; 


let $x := response:set-header('Content-disposition',concat('Content-disposition: inline;filename=',$team,'.kml;'))


return
&lt;Document&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;Birthplaces of players  in the  {$team} squad&lt;/name&gt; 
   &lt;Style id=&quot;player&quot;&gt;
       &lt;IconStyle&gt;
          &lt;Icon&gt;&lt;href&gt;http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/pal2/icon49.png&lt;/href&gt;
        &lt;/Icon&gt;
       &lt;/IconStyle&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
   .....

&lt;/Document&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
The icon is a stock GoogleEarth footballer icon.

=== Document construction ===

Due to the multiple values for some of the properties, for example cityofbirth is often expressed as an address path, there are multiple tuples for each player.  These need grouping and compressing.  Here we use the XQuery idiom which uses distinct-values to get a set of player names, and then accesses groups of rows with the name as the key.  This scripts takes a simplistic approach of using only the first of multiple tuples which contains a latitude , pending a better resolution of the multiple cityofbirth values.

We are only interested in players whose place of birth has been geo-coded, so we filter for tuples with a latitude element:

&lt;pre&gt;
    {
     for $playername in distinct-values($tuples[lat]/player)
     let $player := $tuples[player=$playername][lat][1]

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Data cleanup ===

The wikiPedia data needs some clean-up before being usable in the kml.  A generic clean function decodes the uri-encoded characters, removes some irrelevant text and replaces underscores with spaces. ( this hack needs improving )


&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:clean($text) {
    let $text:= util:unescape-uri($text,&quot;UTF-8&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;http://dbpedia.org/resource/&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;\(.*\)&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;Football__positions#&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;#&quot;,&quot;,&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;_&quot;,&quot; &quot;)
    return $text
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
     let $name := local:clean($player/player)
     let $city :=local:clean($player/city)
     let $position := local:clean($player/position)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Data typing ===
The date of birth is in the form xs:date, but is optional.  If the value is a valid date,  it is converted to a more readable form using an eXist function:

&lt;pre&gt; 
     let $dob := if ($player/dob castable as xs:date) then datetime:format-date(xs:date($player/dob),&quot;dd MMM, yyyy&quot; ) else &quot;&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;

Similarly for the position number which should be an xs:integer:

&lt;pre&gt;
     let $no := if ($player/no castable as xs:integer) then concat(&quot; [# &quot;, xs:integer($player/no) ,&quot;] &quot;) else &quot;&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;

The latitude and longitude should be xs:decimal.  Since sometimes several players in a team come from the same place, the mapped positions are dithered a little.

&lt;pre&gt; 
     let $lat :=xs:decimal($player/lat) + (math:random() - 0.5)* 0.01
     let $long :=xs:decimal($player/long) + (math:random() - 0.5)* 0.01
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Placemark Construction ===

The body of the Placemark description will contain XHTML markup to display an image if there is one and to link to the DBpedia page. The XML needs to be serialised to a string for GoogleMap to render the description in a pop-up:

&lt;pre&gt;
     let $description := 
         &lt;div&gt;
          {concat ($position, $no, &quot; born &quot;, $dob, &quot; in &quot;, $city)}
          &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;a href=&quot;{$player/player}&quot;&gt;DBpedia&lt;/a&gt;
              &amp;#160; 
              &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.co.uk/images?q={$name}&quot;&gt;Google Images&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          {if ($player/image !=&quot;&quot;) 
           then &lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{$player/image}&quot;  height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; 
           else ()
          }       
       &lt;/div&gt;
     order by $name
     return 
     &lt;Placemark&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;{$name}&lt;/name&gt;
       &lt;description&gt;
        {util:serialize($description,&quot;method=xhtml&quot;)}
         &lt;/description&gt;
       &lt;Point&gt; 
        &lt;coordinates&gt;{concat($long, &quot;,&quot;,$lat,&quot;,0&quot;)}&lt;/coordinates&gt;
       &lt;/Point&gt;
       &lt;styleUrl&gt;#player&lt;/styleUrl&gt;
     &lt;/Placemark&gt;
   } 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Club Index ==

We also need an index page, selecting all Clubs in the major English and Scottish leagues.  This script follows the same lines as the more complex script above, except that due to the simpler data, the raw SPARQL result is used without transformation.

The index is sorted alphabetically by club name and provides links to the player map and to the base DBpedia data.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

[[Image:Aphid-sap2.jpg|thumb|350px|right|An aphid feeds on sap. The cornicles are the black spikes with orange tips on the back of the aphid.]]
Aphids are small, pear-shaped insects with small heads and long antennae. Their length ranges from 1/16 inch to 3/8 inch. Some adults have wings, while others do not. The color of their soft bodies may green, yellow, brown, red or black. Some are even pink or lavender. The color depends on the species and the kinds of plants they eat.

Their long, slender mouthparts are adapted for piercing plant parts. A pair of wax-secreting cornicles (little horns) project from the back of the abdomen. Cornicles are a unique feature that distinguishes aphids from other insects. The secretions cause the body surface of some aphid species to appear waxy or woolly. 

Green Apple Aphids are relatively small, growing to a length of about 1/8 inch. In spring and summer they are bright green. Their heads are sometimes yellowish and their legs are dark. 
Rosy Apple Aphids are between 1/16 inch and 1/8 inch in length. They have a wingless form that is rosy brown to purplish in color. The winged form is brownish to brownish-green. Both wingless and winged forms are often covered with whitish powder. 

Rose, Pea, and Potato Aphids grow to about 1/8 inch long. They are pear-shaped with light to medium green or pink coloring. They have a darker green or pink midline stripe or have green and pink patches.

Root Aphids are about 1/8 inch long. Their wingless form is checkered yellow and dark colors. Their winged form is usually black. Both wingless and winged Root Aphids are often covered with whitish dust.

Cloudy-winged Cottonwood Aphids also grow to about 1/8 inch in length. They are yellow-green, green-black or blackish brown in color. Their wings have gray or white cloudlike patterns. The nymphs of this species are translucent amber in color. 

Giant Willow Aphids can be up to ¼ inch long.  They are brown with black spots. They have a covering of waxy white dust that makes them appear gray. The nymph stage is translucent amber.

==Where does it live?==

Aphids are found almost everywhere. They are usually part of a large group known as a colony. The undersides of tender leaves on trees and shrubs provide a home for aphid colonies.
Green Apple Aphids were introduced from Europe in Colonial times. Their habitat is in orchards throughout North America. Rosy Apple Aphids live wherever apple trees grow. Rose, Pea, and Potato Aphids live in crop fields, gardens, and meadows throughout the United States and Canada. Root Aphids are found in trees and on roots of plants, such as asters and goldenrod, that grow in meadows. They also live on crop plants such as alfalfa, wheat and beets. 

Cloudy-winged Cottonwood Aphids are found in cottonwood and poplar groves. They range from Montana to New Mexico and west to California. Giant Willow Aphids live in willow groves. They usually live in large colonies near ground level. Rosy Apple Aphids live in orchards in the United States and Canada.

==What does it eat?==

Almost every plant has one or more aphid species which occasionally feed on it. Aphids feed on the juices of plant stems, leaves, and flowers. Green Apple Aphids feed on the sap of apple or pear trees. Rosy Apple Aphids feed on juices of apples or plantains depending on the season. Cloudy-winged Cotonwood Aphids eat sap of poplar or cottonwood trees. Giant Willow Aphids feed on juices of willow trees.

==How does it defend itself?==

Among aphid enemies are ladybug beetles, fire beetles, and parasitic wasps. Lacewing insects, nicknamed “aphid lions” or “aphid wolves” also feed on them. 

Aphids secrete wax from their cornicles. The wax entangles mouthparts and legs of attackers. It may also protect aphids from moisture. Giant Willow Aphids raise their hind legs high above the abdomen and kick vigorously to deter their enemies.

Some ant species are attracted to the sweet, sap-like liquid secreted by aphids. It is called “honeydew” and is valuable to ants as glue for their nests. Ants protect aphid colonies and “milk” them for honeydew.

Camouflage protects some species. Male Green Apple Aphids are grayish yellow and females are dark green. They blend into their surroundings to avoid predators. In the fall, they lay pale green eggs on tree branches. Over winter the eggs turn shiny black to blend with twigs. They hatch when the leaves burst open in spring. The spring and summer color of the Green Apple Aphid is bright green like new foliage.

[[Image:Aphid-giving-birth.jpg|thumb|250px|left|An Aphid giving birth to live young. Both the mature aphid and the young aphid are female.]]

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Aphids undergo simple metamorphosis. Females produce eggs without fertilization. The eggs hatch in spring and mature as wingless females. Generations of wingless females are born and mature. During this stage, there are no male aphids. In summer, a generation of winged females is born. In the fall, these produce wingless males and egg-laying females, which mate, and the cycle begins again. 

Adult female aphids are capable of producing 40 to 60 offspring. Huge aphid colonies build rapidly. A mere dozen aphid “colonizers” can produce hundreds to thousands of aphids on a plant in a few weeks.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Aphids remember where the first colony of their ancestors was born. When the last generation of winged females is born, it can find and return to the very plant where the first colony of wingless female eggs was hatched.

==How does this bug affect people?==

The huge colonies that aphids produce make them the most destructive of all plant eating insects. Rosy Apple Aphids ruin orchards. Their colonies cause tree leaves to curl and fruit to become gnarled and ripen early. Aphid colonies transmit viruses and spread plant diseases. American Lupin Aphids carry yellow mosaic and other viruses. Green Peach Aphids are known to transmit 150 different kinds of viruses.

Uncontrolled, aphids reproduce so rapidly that entire crops can be destroyed in a short period of time. People often try to find nonchemical ways to control them and make them useful. On mature trees in citrus orchards, aphids and the honeydew they produce attract beneficial insects. Some people like the taste of honeydew and include it as part of their diets. In the Near East the sweetness of honeydew is used in candy making.

Have you seen my reply [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance#Request_for_page_deletion] ? I think this should fix your problem with the preformatting tags, although you need to be tricky to get the style as nice as you had it before. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:13, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

: I had the chance to check the prettypre template and found that it works best for plain text.  When I try to include complex items with pipes there are the expected problems.   By the way, the White-space CSS property looks useful for the future.   By using the Pre-wrap value it is possible to get wrapping for long lines as well as preformatted text; good for code lines.   Unfortunately, it was only included in Firefox with version 3, and I am not sure if IE7 can handle it.   Opera 8 and beyond works fine with pre-wrap. Regards, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 18:54, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

This sequence is not bad and wraps long lines too:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div  with styles...&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
&amp;lt;nowiki&gt;
Code goes here...
&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

or use of ''source'' tags with numbering also wraps long lines, assuming numbers are OK for the app. [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 16:47, 4 September 2008 (UTC)

== editing wikitext/Emphasis and links new section ==

Hi, I was looking at [[Editing Wikitext/Emphasis and Links]], and I noticed that there is no section for interwiki links. If you don't know what they are, there a short-hand way to link to pages on a different wiki that uses mediawiki software. If you know about them, could you please add a section about them on that page? I left a message on that pages talk page, but no one responded for the 8 days its been there.[[Special:Contributions/75.18.40.239|75.18.40.239]] ([[User talk:75.18.40.239|discuss]]) 01:46, 19 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

What exactly are these articles you are creating and editing? They were tagged in that manner because we are confused as to what exactly they are, and they are not organized in the proper manner. Could you move them to a more appropriate location? Also, please don't remove notices from your talk page unless the matter is resolved. Thanks! [[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]] 04:52, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

This is an annotated bibliography of academic papers and books on social software.  It's not meant to be a textbook.  I am assisting a professor to create these entries for an upcoming special interest group meeting.  Others scholars will be invited to contribute to bibliography as well.  I removed the tags because the notice said we could if it were an authentic contribution.  Certainly, we regard the bibliography under construction as such, though certainly some of us are new to wiki authorship.  Please excuse my lack of experience, but allow for my valid intentions to produce new collaborative work.

:Hi Gmrm, I think the bibliography will be good, as far as organization goes, you should take a look at our [[WB:NC|Naming convention]]. Unlike wikipedia, we organize pages in the same book [or the same project in your case] by using one root page (an example could be [[Annotated social software bibliography]] though you can call it whatever you want) and linking to the other pages using the &lt;nowiki&gt; [[/subpage/]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; syntax. See [[Control systems]] for an example of a book that follows this convention. Let me know if you need any help; if you create the root page I can help you out with moving the other pages to appropriate locations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This paper aims to describe systematically the characteristics of weblogs (blogs) -- frequently modified Web pages in which dated entries are listed in reverse chronological sequence and which are the latest in genre of Internet communication to attain widespread popularity. This paper presents the results of a quantitative content analysis of 203 randomly selected blogs, comparing the empirically observable features of the corpus with popular claims about the nature of blogs, and finding them to differ in a number of respects. Notably, blog authors, journalists and scholars alike exaggerate the extent to which blogs are interlinked, interactive, and oriented towards external events, and underestimate the importance of blogs as individualistic, intimate forms of self-expression. Based on the profile generated by the empirical analysis, the paper considers the likely antecedents of the blog genre, situates it with respect to the dominant forms of digital communication on the Internet today, and suggests possible developments of the use of blogs over time in response to changes in user behavior, technology, and the broader ecology of Internet genres.

==[[wikipedia:Haskell_(programming_language)|Haskell]]==
For each number, check whether it is divisible by any of the primes not above its square root. This is an optimal trial division algorithm:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
isPrime primes n = foldr (\p r -&gt; p*p &gt; n || (rem n p /= 0 &amp;&amp; r))
                         True primes
primes = 2 : filter (isPrime primes) [3..]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Note that this code utilizes Haskell's lazy evaluation, to allow &lt;code&gt;primes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;isPrime&lt;/code&gt; to be defined in terms of each other.

The Sieve of Erastosthenes has better theoretical complexity than trial division. Its intent demonstrated by:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
primesTo m = 2 : sieve [3,5..m] where
  sieve s@(p:xs) | p*p&gt;m = s
                 | True  = p : sieve (xs `minus` [p*p, p*p+2*p..m])&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Were a &lt;code&gt;(minus a b)&lt;/code&gt; operation to have a complexity of &lt;math&gt;O(|b|)&lt;/math&gt;, as it indeed is so on mutable arrays in imperative languages, this code would achieve the theoretical complexity of the S. of E. Unfortunately it is &lt;math&gt;O(|a|)&lt;/math&gt; here. So this code ends up having same complexity as optimal trial division, although it still runs faster.

Recast as unbounded definition, yet faster and with much better complexity:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
primesU () = 2 : [3,5..] `minus` unionAll [[p*p, p*p+2*p..] | p &lt;- primes'] 
  where
    primes' = 3 : [5,7..] `minus` unionAll [[p*p, p*p+2*p..] | p &lt;- primes']
    unionAll ((x:xs):t) = x : union xs (unionAll (pairs t))
    pairs ((x:xs):ys:t) = (x : union xs ys) : pairs t&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
This replaces the ''linear'' nested chain of &lt;code&gt;minus&lt;/code&gt; operations in &lt;code&gt;primesTo&lt;/code&gt; function, with an unbounded right-deepening ''tree'' of &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;s. A sizable constant factor speed-up can be further achieved [http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Prime_numbers#Tree_merging_with_Wheel with wheel factorization]. The utility functions used above are:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
minus (x:xs) (y:ys) = case compare x y of LT -&gt; x : minus  xs (y:ys)
                                          EQ -&gt;     minus  xs    ys
                                          GT -&gt;     minus (x:xs) ys
minus  a      b     = a
union (x:xs) (y:ys) = case compare x y of LT -&gt; x : union  xs (y:ys)
                                          EQ -&gt; x : union  xs    ys
                                          GT -&gt; y : union (x:xs) ys
union  a      b     = a ++ b&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

== C (Fast bitwise) ==
Fast implementation of bitwise Sieve of Eratosthenes. Little bit cheating, because it's counts only odd primes (read as: you need to add first prime - &quot;2&quot; manually).

There is also OpenMP #pragma's along the way, so you can try compile it with -fopenmp

&lt;source lang= &quot;C&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt; 
 
#define MAX_N 1000000000
#define MAX MAX_N/2 

/*
Good way to compile is:
gcc --std=c99 -O4 -o sieve_fast sieve_fast.c  
*/

int main(int argc, char * args[])
{
  size_t mem_sz = MAX / 8 + 1;
  size_t superpage_size = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2MB
  unsigned long cnt = 0;
  unsigned char * arr;

  if (posix_memalign((void **)&amp;arr, superpage_size, mem_sz)) {
    perror(&quot;memalign&quot;);
    exit(1);
  }

  bzero(arr, mem_sz);

  #pragma omp parallel 
  for(register unsigned long n=1; ((n*(n+1))&lt;&lt;1)&lt;MAX; n++)
  {
    register unsigned long t = n &gt;&gt; 3;
    if((arr[t] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (n &amp; 7)))){
      //printf(&quot;Skipped: %lu\n&quot;, n*2+1);
      continue;
    }
    //printf(&quot;prime: %lu; n: %lu\n&quot;, n&lt;&lt;1+1, n);
    #pragma omp for schedule(static, 65536)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Power is a measure of how much potential energy is dissipated (i.e. converted into heat, light and other forms of energy) by a component or circuit in one second. This is due to a drop in the potential energy, and so the voltage, of charge. Power is measured in Watts (commonly abbreviated W), where 1 W is 1 Js&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. It can be calculated by finding the product of the current flowing through a component / circuit and the potential difference across the component / circuit. This gives us the equation:

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{E}{t} = IV&lt;/math&gt;

where P is the power dissipated (in W), E is the drop in potential energy (in Joules, J), t is the time taken (in s), I is the current (in A) and V is either potential difference or electromotive force (in V), depending on the component being measured.

Since power is the amount of energy changing form per. second, the amount of energy being given out each second will equal the power of the component giving out energy.

You should be able to substitute in values for I and V from other formulae (V=IR, Q=It) in order to relate power to resistance, conductance, charge and time, giving formulae like these:

&lt;math&gt;P = I^2R&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{QV}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

==Questions==

1. The potential difference across a 9W light bulb is 240V. How much current is flowing through the light bulb?

2. How much energy is dissipated by a 10W component in 1 hour?

3. The potential difference across a top-notch kettle, which can hold up to 1 litre of water, is 240V, and the current is 12.5 A. 4.2 kJ of energy is required to raise the temperature of 1kg of water by 1°C. Assuming 100% efficiency and that the temperature has to be raised 80°C (20°C to 100°C), how long does it take to boil 1 litre of water?

4. How much energy is dissipated by a 100Ω resistor in 10 seconds if 2A of current are flowing?

5. The charge on an electron is -1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; C. How long does it take for a mole (6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles) of electrons to flow through  a 40W light bulb on a 240V ring main?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Greek letter delta means 'difference in'. So, in the case of current, it represents the difference in charge divided by the difference in time. If we write it as we would in calculus:

&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{dQ}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Without using calculus, we can only take an approximation of I from values as close together as possible on either side of the point at which we wish to calculate the current. By using calculus, we can calculate the exact value of the current at a given point. For example, if Q = 2t (i.e. 1 coulomb every 2 seconds):

&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{dQ}{dt} = 1 \times 2t^{1-1} = 2t^0 = 2\mbox{ A}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Current is the amount of charge (on particles such as electrons) flowing through part of an electric circuit per second. Current is measured in amperes (usually abbreviated A), where 1 ampere is 1 coulomb of charge per second. The formula for current is:

&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt; ([The triangle (Greek letter [[/delta/]]) means change in the quantity])

[[Image:KCL.png|framed|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

where I is current (in A), Q is charge (in C) and t is the time it took for the charge to flow (in seconds).

In a series circuit, the current is the same everywhere in the circuit, as the rate of flow of charged particles is constant throughout the circuit. In a parallel circuit, however, the current is split between the branches of the circuit, as the number of charged particles flowing cannot change. This is Kirchoff's First Law, stating that:

{{cquote|At any point in an electrical circuit where charge density is not changing in time [ie. there is no buildup of charge, as in a capacitor], the sum of currents flowing towards that point is equal to the sum of currents flowing away from that point.}}

In mathematical form:

&lt;math&gt;\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}&lt;/math&gt; (The character that resembles a sideways M is the Greek letter [[/sigma/]], meaning 'sum of'.)

==Questions==

[[Image:Stromteiler.svg|left|200px]]

1. 10 coulombs flow past a point in a wire in 1 minute. How much current is flowing through the point?

2. How long does it take for a 2A current to carry 5C?

3. In the diagram on the left, I = 9A, and I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.5A. What is the current at I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?

4. What would I equal if I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 10A and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 15A?

5. In the diagram on the left, in 5 seconds, 5C of charged particles flow past I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and 6.7C flow past I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. How long does it take for 10C to flow past I?

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is the first Arcive page of the Card Catalog Affice discussion page.

It covers the first discussion on the Card Catalog Office project in 2005 and early 2006.

== What I think ==
I think the front page needs to get rid of half its clutter so that the wikibooks can be more represented like they were a year ago. - Cyberman

== Introduction to this Wikimedia Project ==
Like many of the other sister Wikimedia projects, there are special areas of the project that are designated for doing more focused or specialized projects that can help the community in general.  On Wikipedia these are called Wikiprojects.

I'm proposing a similar kind of effort here on Wikibooks called the '''Card Catalog Office'''.

I've been looking at the Dewey Decimal page that is right off the main page, and it is in serious need of reform (if not simply chaning the name of the page from &quot;Test&quot;).  It was a good idea, but needs some serious cleanup.

In addition, sometimes people are a bit confused with where to put something (like the discussion above about the Disasters book).  This Wikiproject could help with new Wikibookians who are a little unsure on where to put things, or if bookshelves are being rearranged (like the last reorganization attempt of the IT bookshelf) things could be a little better organized.  Ontological discussions (the study of how to organize things) could also take place, and alternative search systems could be implemented for trying to locate a Wikibook.  That would be the primary focus of this Wikiproject.

I'd also like some input as to if we should merge into this organization of Wikibooks information that is also found on Wikisource.  There already is a tendancy to have content be placed on Wikibooks that really belongs over at Wikisource, so I'm proposing that we keep links to the content so it doesn't get duplicated (often duplicated again).  Keep in mind this is just links to Wikisource material, not the material itself.  Wikisource material should not appear on the main &quot;Bookshelves&quot; that appear on the front page, but rather in the classification systems that we come up with in this new Card Catalog Office.

Goals to work toward:

# New Wikibookian book placement service (and general new user help on writing a new Wikibook).
# Dewey Decimal Classification catalog
# Library of Congress organization
# Alphabetacal search of Wikibooks (not just book modules... the current system really stinks)
# Greater use of categories

If the Wikidata proposal actually gets off the ground, this would be a good candidate for inclusion into that project in terms of a way to organize everything here.  Some changes to the MediaWiki software have also made pulling off a project like this somewhat easier to accomplish.

Any other thoughts on this organization? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:29, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
:Sounding good so far, I'll add thoughts as they come to me. As already brought to Aya's attention ([[User talk:Aya#Bookshelf policy]]) the current bookshelf-related pages are a mess of redundant and duplicate information. The first priority of this project should be to organise those--after all how can you sort things out if the rules by which you organise them are so disjointed? [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:01, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
:One possibility is to use categories for each page in a book. Like for example my article at the Academic Publishing Wiki [[wikicities:c:academia:Category:Garrett - The struggle for Greece|has a category]] collecting all the connected and/'''or''' affiliated pages pages together. This way you can find pages regardless of how the author has (or hasn't) organised their wikibook, and you can find related linked-to pages. BUT the books and recent changes would have to be religiously monitored to make sure any and all new pages get put in the category. Also this helps save complexity. For example the San Andreas wikibook currently has about four different categories it's in and more were added as those ports were made--but with ''this'' system only the category would be updated, thus in turn re-tagging the pages within it. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:18, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
{{wikipedia|Wikipedia}}
:Also a method of listing about related books would be nice. Yes you can find them with the categories, but for the unknowing or lazy reader it's nice to have it &quot;in your face&quot;. Like how at Amazon or Gamespot you see a very closely related product. Ideally similar to the &quot;(wikihere) has more on&quot; template as seen to the right. The template's attributes (multiple, preferably) would allow you to enter related books. Ideally there would be a reciprocal way to get the link also on that linked-to page... what I'm really thinking of here is something just like what BoardGameGeek has. [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1406 See this page]; scroll way, way down and you'll find a Relationships section. Users can add associations, and those are then listed on the other pages automatically. In this example, manually forming an association between a themed version of Monopoly with the core edition then auto-associates that variant with other variants that have previously been manually associated. I don't know how this could be converted to a wiki structure, but it could be nice. I'm not necessarily talking about the voting, just the fact that it lists related things. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:28, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
:Also something needs to be done about the progress icon upkeep. I just updated the San Andreas icon in three different places and I bet there's two more I missed. Ideally we need some sort of parsing system, maybe even with per-project templates that the editors can edit to make site-wide changes to that percentage. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:38, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
:Also I'm thinking more about the idea of book &quot;logos&quot; to make things part of a series, with tiny versions shown on the bookshelf pages so you can recognise a familiar series logo. For example... [[:File:Booklogoexample.png]] ...like that. You have an icon thing for the core series (in this case, how-tos), and one for the book (in this case, the nonexistent telephony). So when browsing on shelves you'd see these familiar icons jump out at you. Of course it would have a text description beside it, but it would still label it for quick notice. What I'm getting at is that this you have this on dead-tree books; you have the publisher's distinctive logo (or sometimes the author's monogram) on the spine so you can recognise things. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:56, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

== Ideas on catalog templates ==

I've been thinking about a different way to try and &quot;catalog&quot; the content on here.  One approach that I've considered is to try and put right into each Wikibook a simple template that has the cataloging information.  Based on the content of the template, it would put the Wikibook into the appropriate category(ies) that help to define the Wikibook.  This template can be extended, but would serve to put some initial catalog numbers into each Wikibook.

For instaces a template something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
 {{catalog|
 |wikibook=finite state machines
 |bookshelf=IT
 |Dewey=005.42
 |LOC=QX 554.3
 }}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The problem I see is how to get the template to interpret this information to put it into categories that are incomplete.  Particularly the Dewey Decimal catalog number.  This &quot;catalog entry&quot; could also be some cool little graphic (based on the content) that would be a little bit &quot;in your face&quot; regarding other related Wikibooks.  A similar sort of template could be inserted into each &quot;page&quot; of a wikibook... helping with &quot;branding&quot;, navigation, and creation of an overall category for a single Wikibook.

What I'm envisioning is a web equivalent of browsing bookshelves in a library, where sometimes a somewhat related book will be nearby on a list even if the card catalog number is not exactly the same.  I don't know of any current search tool on the internet that allows something like this to take place, but is something that I frequently do when I am trying to research a topic in a (dead tree) library.  It isn't perfect, but something that the card catalog numbers do a very good job of... at least as long as nearby books are loosly of related topics.  Jumping from 100's levels in the Dewey Decimal system (for instance) will be a lager switch on topics, but that can't be totally helped.  That is perhaps why more than one system should be employed.  Sometimes I'll read about a topic that is totally unrelated to what I was originally searching for, but jumped out at me for some reason, and I've even used it on term papers about the original topic.

I also noticed the [[Wikibooks:Browse]] page, which has not been kept current.  It does, however, suggest totally different organizational methods than the current realm of bookshelves that are quite active at the moment.  Should this page be killed or reoganized?  Its link to the current Wikibooks catagory structure is apparent, and perhaps that should be a jumping off point as well.  Certainly this page needs to be reorganized.

I'm at a loss in regards on where to being right now.  The bookshelves seem to have &quot;sorted themselves out&quot; for the moment, and seem to be in fairly good shape in terms of future expansion of Wikibooks.  The question I have is more what to do next, and how to get this whole thing organized.  I think if we all work together on the same part of this puzzle together rather than going willy-nilly all over with our own ideas, we can make quite a bit of progress and put together what has been a neglected corner of Wikibooks.  I can come up with other cool organizational ideas, but mainly I'd like to see the current set of organization ideas cleaned up or discarded... as the rest of the interested Wikibookians that want to be involved here decide. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:09, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

{{catalog| book=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
|shelf = Games
|dewey = 123.456 GTA
|congress = GV123
|nearby = ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City''
}}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{catalog| book=Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;|shelf = Games&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;|dewey = 123.456 GTA&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;|congress = GV123&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;|nearby = ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
^^ this code generates this &gt;&gt;

I've created [[Template:Catalog]] based on the above with some minor tweaking. First of all, the IDs here are completely bogus, mainly because I can't remember the dewey system as well as I used to. Note that the numbers are redlinks; when you create the book you would click each of those and put the cat ID of the nearest category within them--for example 123.456 GTA would go within 123.456, and ''that'' within 123.400, and ''that'' within 123.000, and so on, depending on how deep and intricate we want the cat usage to be.

I've coded the template to be as brief and foolproof for the user as can be.

Anyway, see what you think, and change what you hate. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:18, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

UPDATE: see the category bar at the bottom of this page? If I was to click on the Congress one and save it this page would then appear in there... as I said, foolproof is the goal. :)

Note that the way I've set the category names up means that this page will be invisibly listed in the 123.456 category as &quot;123.456 GTA Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. Now the user does not see this special name but it means that the pages will be arranged in shelf order rather than alphabetical order. Or at least I ''hope'' it does, I will have to check that I interpreted the WP implementation of this workaround correctly. --damn, seems to only work among ''the same letters'' in a cat. Well, that's the best I can do then. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:47, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

The idea I had with the nearby attribute is that you list books that are ''very'' strongly related. Like for another example the C++ book would give nearbys for C and C#--but ''not'' for Java, you could find that through the cat links. The idea is that it would only be for direct siblings (C and C#), rather than cousins (Java, Perl, etc.). [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:06, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

== My thoughts ==

I thought I'd start a new section for clarity.

First of all - wow! Some great ideas here. Much better than I've come up with on this subject. The example template makes it very clear how effective this could be.

One thing I've found useful is to define editorial control to avoid 'edit war paranoia' and the endless discussions that result from it, so if this is a Wikiproject, we should nominate a single user to be the Wikiproject Manager. This would mean, they get editorial control on the project page to which this talk page is attached. Their job is to maintain the project page, summarizing content from the talk page, and amalgamating it into the project page. Anyone may edit the project page (this seems preferable to having the manager have to parse all the comments), but should edit wars occur, the project manager gets to make the judgement call, since they are ultimately responsible for maintaining its clarity. This is in effect what I tried to do with my 'Critique of Wikibooks' in order to keep it digestable for those who haven't been following all the discussion.

Since Rob started this project, he would seem the obvious choice for this role. I might recommend starting to write up some of the previous talk in a more imperative, less discussional fashion, before the amount of talk becomes too overwhelming. Try writing it like a policy or procedure. e.g.

----

; Goals

* To make it easy for new Wikibooks users to find the content they are looking for.
* To minimize duplicate Wikibooks with virtually identical scopes.

; Procedures

* All Wikibooks should include the 'catalog' template on their main page.
* Template parameters should consist of... blah blah blah
* To find out correct dewey codes use the list at site http://whatever...
etc.

; Examples

&lt;some examples uses of this template here&gt;

----

This project also touches upon our current lack of a 'category use' policy. Should categories be reserved for tagging books only (the existing Wikibooks:Browse page seems to hint that this was the original intention), or should they also be allowed for categorizing pages within a single book (e.g. the myriad cookbook categories)? If both are acceptable, is there an easy way to distinguish between the two? If we plan to have one category per Dewey code, what page or category is designated to form an index of those categories?

So, perhaps, put up a v1.0 of this new project on the project page, then we can take it from there. Doesn't have to be extensive, perhaps just a summary of our best ideas so far. For unresolved issues, I don't see a problem with leaving explicitly unanswered questions on the project page itself. These will no doubt decide the direction of the subsequent discussions on this talk page. The end result, hopefully, will be a really great, well thought-out policy doc, and will serve to clarify the whole issue for all Wikibooks users.

Once this policy seems clear enough, we can then start to implement it, and start adding these templates and categories to existing books. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

== Good idea ==

It's a good idea, but the card catalog office is a big project.  Anyways, it should have the following responsibilities:

* '''Bookshelf maintenance''' - the CCO is responsible to maintaining [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves|bookshelves]] &quot;nice and tidy&quot;, meaning that books that get deleted are removed from bookshelves, new books are put into bookshelves, etc.  They should also be responsible for maintaining [[Wikibooks:Bookshelf requests]] for adding and removing bookshelves from the canonical list.  Promotion and demotion of featured books on bookshelves should also go through the CCO.
* '''Classification''' - same thing, but with the Dewey Decimal and LOC index (henceforth put into [[Wikibooks:Dewey Decimal index]] and [[Wikibooks:Library of Congress index]], or [[WB:DDI]] and [[WB:LOCI]]).

I would also like to nominate [[User:Aya]] and [[User:Robert Horning]] as head librarians in the CCO.

As for category policy, we do have an informal one: each book ''Book'' should have ''Category:Book:&lt;catname&gt;'' for categories within their book, as per [[WB:NC]], for categorizing modules within a book (eg. [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Normal Pokémon]]).  All other categories are between books: ie. they tag books rather than individual modules.  I'd like to see it fine-tuned before it is canonized though.

Speaking of which, we also must develop a policy on title pages, so that these books can be categorized.  I'll get the ball rolling: For a book ''book'', the page ''book'' is considered to be the title page of the book, and should contain a short table of contents.  If a book is on vfd, speedy, transwiki, [[WB:FP|forking policy]] violation, etc., only the title page will have the tag.  Note that this may buck existing conventions: many consider [[Programming:C]] a separate book from [[Programming:Ada]], but under [[WB:NC]] the two are sections under [[Programming]].  [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 01:23, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

: Just a minor historical point. The &lt;code&gt;Programming:&lt;whatever&gt;&lt;/code&gt; books '''are''' separate books, they just don't follow [[WB:NC]]. In the olden days, the psuedo-namespace &lt;code&gt;Programming:&lt;/code&gt; was an early means of indicating that the books inside were members of the 'programming bookshelf'. This use of pseudo-namespaces is now deprecated, so the books ought to be titled e.g. &lt;code&gt;Programming C&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;C Programming&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;How to program C&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Programming:C&lt;/code&gt;. We just need someone to go through and do all the renaming. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:43, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

== Placing some initial content on &quot;front page&quot; of CCO ==

I've put some stuff up on the main project page to look at.  The list of books is (if you are paying attention) from the list of Books of the Month.  I figured we can use them as guinea pigs to see what we think of how everything is going to be organized like, and gives us some '''real''' Wikibooks to work with that will be more like how a mature system should be working like.  We do need to have an organized system for trying to classify books, and I am trying to come up with a way that we can keep things &quot;bite sized&quot; on the organization and allow us to also serve newer Wikibookians who may want to have us help them out.  This is also a way we can keep this project sustained into the future even after the initial &quot;ouch&quot; of getting stuff put together.

Tell me what you like/don't like/need to add to this page (or even update it yourself if you feel motivated).  Quite a bit more content needs to be added, but this is a rough idea of more what I wanted people to be looking at, and also to be friendly to new users.  Polcies adopted here will go through the formal guidelines and policies vetting like any other Wikibook policy. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:43, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

: Well, so far it looks like the sort of thing that ought to be on [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]] (which is in need of a serious overhaul). I was expecting something more like &quot;instructions on how to classify books&quot;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:41, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

== Catalog structure ==

My thoughts:
* Our catalogs should be moved to something like [[Wikibooks:Books by Library of Congress Classification]] and subpages like [[Wikibooks:Books by Library of Congress Classification/GV 1469]] ([[MegaMan Battle Network]] and any other Mega Man books we have are at GV 1469.35.M43, so it would be in that page).  We can also do interlinking such as having [[Wikibooks:Books by Library of Congress Classification/Q]] go to [[Wikibooks:Science bookshelf]].
* Any cataloging policy remains questionable unless we have a good policy on book title pages.  I'm about to draft a guideline at [[Wikibooks:Title pages]].  Tell me your thoughts.

[[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:34, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== main page ==

I have just finished taking the main page as a cut and paste to my user talk box, where i generated a list of what i think ought to be
the new &quot;bookshelves.&quot; The list probably is missing a few things, but
the point is, at least there is some differentiation between the smaller pieces of larger umbrellas. I have also left a note in the
staff room, as per somebodies instructions at the main page discussion area.

[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 02:37, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

:I've been seriously distracted from this for far too long.  If you are wanting to get into classifying the content on Wikibooks, I'm going to try and kick this whole think up a major notch and start the book classification process as a serious endeavor. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:52, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
--------------
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 00:38, 23 February 2006 (UTC)
excellent, I'm still trying to decide where and how and if i fit in.
Please keep me apraised of any process, and let me know if there is
anything i can do to help, or, a partial taxonomy i can come critique.
-----------------

== Blockland mapping` ==

I think [[Blockland mapping]] may be intended as the stand-alone ToC page of a book that was never written, or may belong to a book that no longer exists. I'm starting a [[Blockland]] book for it and moving it to [[Blockland/Mapping]]; hopefully, someone will pick up the torch and write new modules. (I've never played ''[[w:Blockland]]''.) [[User:Seahen|Seahen]] 23:26, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

:Note that this was just supposed to be an example of a relatively new Wikibook that needed classification.  We really need to get this sub-project (the CCO) up and running soon, and make this something that really matters.  I'm trying to still build the infrastructure (tables &amp; guidelines) to get this working properly.  It is just going to be a matter of time.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:33, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>Keeping text of categorization discussion with the CCO</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is a copy of the categorization discussion that gave way to the book list subproject of the CCO.

== Categories ==

I was planning to do some categorizing of uncategorized pages starting in a couple of weeks. I did some research and was very surprised to find that there where heated discussions on that subject!!?? For example: the [[Wikibooks:Categories|proposed guideline]] does not seem to have been adopted, past categorizations operations gave way to [[User_talk:Jguk#Please_stop_adding_categories|heated remarks]], etc. So if there are still some major problems with this concept please stop me before I start.  --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 15:51, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

:[[User:Robert Horning]], if he is around, can probably explain the opposition to this better then I could. I think a big part of the discussion was that categorization should not be compulsary: That is, we should not ''force'' pages to be categorized, but at the same time if people want to do it there is nothing to stop them. The problem, I think, was that we don't want to make it seem that pages ''must'' be categorized, especially if we don't have a standard system for doing it. However, over time, we have developed better methods and standards of categorizing pages, books, and other categories. I think (and I'm sure there are going to be complaints with this) that it should be perfectly fine to categorize pages if you want to do it.
:Also, you will learn here, that there are no issues where 100% of people agree. Every issue is a debate, and sometimes you just need to do what you want to, in order to keep yourself happy and interested. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:12, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

::I certainly have been leading the opposition to the mandatory use of categories in Wikibooks.  Wikibooks is not Wikipedia, and the same &quot;rules&quot; simply don't apply here.  Also, I think that the kinds of categories that are created just to put a page into a category aren't always well thought out or really useful.  In addition, from years of experience as an administrator on Wikibooks, I just don't think the supposed benefit of being able to watch for new pages on the [[Special:Uncategorizedpages]] is as big of a benefit here as it has been suggested on Wikipedia.  There are many other administrative tools that can be used to perform the very same task if you really get down to it, and adding categories in this regard is just a waste of time that can be better spent doing something else.  That is of course my opinion, and if you want to waste your time doing something you think may be productive, I'm not going to stop you from it.  But I'm also not going to support you either, and feel like removing categories in books that I'm working on is also just as valid of an action.

::Categories are a useful tool that can be used to index content, and nothing more.  I certainly am strongly against any sort of general Wikibooks policy that ''requires the use of categories'' in the way that you format the Wikibook.  BTW, this isn't to say that I'm against general categorization of whole Wikibooks, which in this case is much more related to how you can perceive an article on Wikipedia... but typically an individual Wikibook consists of multiple pages, so it largely breaks down the perception of what is accomplished on Wikipedia.  This, IMHO, would be like somebody trying to categorize every independently editable section of every Wikipedia article.  I suppose that might have some usefulness, but would be very clumsy to accomplish.  Of course, this is just my viewpoint on the issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 03:38, 25 December 2007 (UTC)

First thanks both of you (Andrew and Robert) for giving attention to my post. I'm new to wikibooks so I may be missing important things here. Could you please confirm / infirm the following: 
* Contrary to a Wikipedia article, a book on Wikibooks has typically many pages.
* So here the concept of uncategorized '''pages''' covers both uncategorized '''books''' and uncategorized '''subpages''' making it a different concept then on Wikipedia.
* An argument can be made about the usefullness of categorizing subpages
* Categories form the basic indexing mechanism for '''books'''. The new &quot;subject&quot; scheme that is gradually replacing bookshelves relies on categories
* It is reasonable to think that every book should be attainable thru the subject / category indexing scheme
* The exact structure of the category acyclic graph and the connection points between a particular book and that graph are clearly open to discussion 

If the previous paragraph makes any sense then can you tell me how I can get a list of uncategorized '''books''' so I can do the important stuff and leave the rest for somebody that has time to spare. Note that the list of uncategorized pages having more then 5000 entries you cannot get the list of uncategorized books from it. Regards --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 06:07, 25 December 2007 (UTC)

:* Wikipedia is more like a single book (an encyclopedia) with many pages (articles), while Wikibooks has many books which is why subpages are used here and not as much on Wikipedia.
:* Yes uncategorized pages and many other listings cover both '''books''' and '''subpages''', unlike Wikipedia which consists of only a single book.
:* Categories form the basic indexing mechanism for both '''books''' and '''subpages'''. The new &quot;subject&quot; scheme is intended for '''books''' only and should gradually replace bookshelves and departments, and yes it relies on categories.
:* I think its reasonable to think every '''book''' should be attainable through subjects and categories.
:* The exact structure of the category scheme as well as its usefulness are debatable. However I think the community's continued use of the category system shows that its desirable, both past and current common practices show that there is a general consensus as how categorization should be done, and any discontinuation or change of the category system while debatable is unlikely to happen without discussion and agreement.
: Before you can get a list of uncategorized '''books''' you would first need to be able to come up with an accurate list of all '''books''', which Wikibooks doesn't have. I think this is one reason why its good practice to categorize subpages as well into there own '''book category'''. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:36, 25 December 2007 (UTC)
::In case the above isn't clear, this is what I see happening most often, and it makes sense to me: all subpages of a book are categorized into a category which is usually the same as the title of the book (since there will never be 2 books with the same title, their categories will also not overlap). The &quot;front page&quot; (the top of the hierarchy) gets categorized into those which describe the content of the book. The &quot;book category&quot; keeps all pages together - the the binding on a book; the &quot;subject categories&quot; allow users to find the book according to its content. The &quot;subject categories&quot; should correspond to those which will make it appear in the appropriate Subject: pages (if there isn't one which is appropriate, then it should be created, though there shouldn't be too make &quot;missing&quot; ones now - we have a good set, I think). Hope that helps. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:04, 25 December 2007 (UTC)
As suspected I was missing something important. For a newcomer the lack of an exhaustive &quot;book list&quot; is kind of weird for a booksite. I understand that it is not necessarely trivial to build though (thanks in part to a chat with darklama). I will leave the discussion like this for a couple of days in case somebody as another important missing piece to add. Thanks again for your insights. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 03:39, 26 December 2007 (UTC)
:One of the problems that we are fighting here is the MediaWiki software itself.  Clearly it has been tweaked to work with encyclopedia articles almost to a fault, although there are some extensions which have been added for purposes other than building encyclopedias.  One of the policies that is very unique to Wikibooks and is not found on Wikipedia in any form is the [[WB:NP|Wikibooks Naming Policy]], which was drafted for the explicit purpose of trying to make some sense to how Wikibooks pages were organized.  I think it is reasonable to presume at this point that nearly all of Wikibooks has been moved into this naming system in one form or another, and one of the purposes of this was to help identify a collection of all books, not simply all pages.  When Wikibooks was first started (and no naming policy at all), some books had a very free-flow on how separate pages were named, and wandered aimlessly from one page name to another and no real structure at all.  In the long run, this has proven to be a disaster in terms of project management, and one of the reasons why a formal naming policy was even established in the first place.

:Several attempts have been made to try and come up with an exhaustive book list in several different forms, and this meta issue of trying to organize Wikibooks content between the front page, the actual Wikibooks themselves, and helping a reader access information that is on this website has been a tough challenge.  A concept called Bookshelves was established early in the history of Wikibooks to help organize this content, and some newer schema have also been developed over the years to help organize this content.  Finding Wikibooks content has always been a very tough problem, particularly when it was in what would be called an incomplete or stubby version that did, however, have some real potential for further expansion.  We have even had several variations of how to address the &quot;best of Wikibooks&quot;, but at the moment the [[WB:FB|Featured books]] process seems to be working rather well.  This doesn't address, however, how to find content that isn't quite one of the &quot;best of..&quot; books.

:Categories clearly can be useful in helping to find these books, and removing the sense of pure anarchy that has been the case here on Wikibooks for a considerable amount of the content currently here.  Just don't get caught up with the idea that the categories are the end goal here, but instead try to focus on the idea that the goal is to help a reader or new user to Wikibooks to be able to identify some content they are looking for that is already written here, or to confirm that an idea for a new Wikibook is a genuinely new idea that hasn't been tried before.  If this is accomplished, I am 100% supportive of any ideas you may come up with to help this general goal, and I see very little in the way of opposition from anybody to help with this huge task.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 14:17, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

::In my opinion the &quot;search and browse&quot; template on the main page is too cluttered... we DO have some space we're not using underneath it so if needed we can make the font bigger or something (at least the font of the template's title should be bigger to bring some attention to it). I'm also not sure if it's necessary to have all of the bookshelves listed on the template, maybe it would be better to just list the departments? If we do that we can bring more emphasis to the other forms of organization. Regards.  [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 16:35, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

::I agree with Rob here wholeheartedly (at least his last comment). The categories themselves are not the '''ends''', but are instead a useful '''means''' of organization. Categories do not always make sense, are not always easy to navigate, etc. This is especially true if the categories themselves are not properly categorized. Since there are so many categories, it is not reasonable to expect that they are going to be properly organized in relation to one another. However, using DPL and the [[Subject:All Subjects|Subject pages]], we can create very nice lists of books based on various category intersections. Take a look at [[Subject:Engineering]] for an example of this: Lists are automatically generated of sub-topics, engineering books, featured engineering books, engineering books with print/pdf versions, etc. In this case, we've taken a large number of categories, and combined them into a single page that really contains some useful information. If all books are categorized based on subject, features (print version, pdf version, etc), reading level, status (featured, good, needs cleanup, etc) then we can use DPL and the subject pages to display those category intersections in a very intuitive way. For instance, if you want to contribute to computer programming books, you would go to [[Subject:Programming]], scroll down to the section &quot;Books that need cleanup work&quot; (this section doesnt yet exist, it's hypothetical), and you could find a list of all programming books that need help. There is a lot of potential to this system that we haven't used yet, mostly because we can't agree amongst ourselves how exactly to do it, and because we refuse to mandate that it ''must'' be done to begin with. This is why, I think, that people like Jacques should be encouraged if they are interested in categorizing pages, because the work that they do will be helpful eventually, if we can get the correct DPL lists set up. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:38, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

:::I disagree with [[User:Whiteknight]] here on the fact that we should let resources do something if it ''might'' be usefull at some point. The problem is that this is not the main subject here so we shall eventually discuss that elsewhere. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 03:56, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

OK let’s try to close this discussion with a newbie synthesis. 
*The primary organization unit in Wikibooks is a book. Books are composed of pages.
*MediaWiki was developed primarily for Wikipedia. It implements the concept of a page but does not directly support the concept of a “book”. Wikipedia can be viewed as a single book with many pages.
*Categorization can be done at 3 levels:
:*Categorizing books (by topic, by status, etc.)
:*Categorizing pages inside a book (ex. type of recipes in the Cookbook)
:*Associating pages with their books (conceptually a page could be in more than one book thru transclusion)
*A number of organization schemes for books have been tried since the start of the project. The actual naming policy (book name/page name) makes it trivial to associate a page with its main book. Some older books do not follow this naming policy (ex. The Cookbook).
*While most books are clearly known and searchable thru subjects and bookshelves there is no exhaustive list of all books at the moment.

My main personal conclusion here is that we should not talk about categorizing pages anymore but instead of either categorizing books or of associating pages to books (assuming that categorizing pages inside a book is the job of that book's team, not a global maintenance task).

Starting with that distinction we could eventually set clear objectives like:
*All books should be attainable thru the subject / category scheme
*All books not following the present naming convention should have an alternative way of associating their pages (ex. Namespace for the Cookbook, book categories in the main namespace)
*All pages should be either a book or associated with a book (thru naming, categorization or other mean).
*Etc.

The next step for me will be to try to build an exhaustive list of all books and submit it to the community along with its maintenance procedure. If anybody wants to help or give some insight they are more than welcome to do so. I will move this discussion to the [[Wikibooks_talk:Card_Catalog_Office|Card Catalog Office]] (CCO) talk page because an eventual book list would go there in the current organization of the site.  Watch that page for other interesting category talks :-) And finally thanks again for every contributions in this discussion. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 03:56, 29 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose==
The purpose of this section of the TI-Basic Wikibook is to explore the capabilities of the TI-89 series (TI-89/Titanium, TI-92/+, Voyage 200) with the built-in interpreter. It is recommended to read through the guide from the beginning in order to build a strong understanding of the language and its applications. This section is devoted entirely to the Motorola 68k version of TI-Basic, which is more powerful than the Z80 version. For information on TI-Basic for the Z80 series, see [[TI-Basic Z80 Programming]].

==Overview==
TI-Basic is a simple interpreted language used on Texas Instruments graphing calculators, which can be used to rapidly automate equations or algorithms. However, as an interpreted language, it is generally not fast enough for a game, so for anything requiring fast processing, assembly language is required. This is, however, outside the scope of this Wikibook. Even though the language is slow, for most purposes it will serve admirably.

===Differences between Versions of TI-Basic===
*The version of TI-Basic for the 83-type calculators (73 Explorer, 83/+/SE, 84/+/SE) is less powerful, and also less integrated into the calculator itself. However, it is still powerful enough to automate most functions.
*The version for the 89-series (89/Titanium, 92/+, Voyage 200), which is more powerful and more heavily integrated into the calculator. For this section of the TI-Basic Wikibook, this is the version that will be focused upon.

All of my filed discussions.
=== Whither Wikibooks? ===

Something new is needed at Wikibooks.  We have some fair books now but these are not attracting new editors. If you look at some of our featured books they are not being edited by new experts in the field and some quite popular books have been almost untouched for months. Yet our sister project, Wikipedia, has large numbers of contributors.  We seem to have a fairly large readership with over 20000 views a day ( [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?lang=en&amp;wiki=enwikibooks&amp;ns=all&amp;limit=100&amp;month=10%2F2007&amp;mode=view Wikicharts]) and rank about 3000th on the net (for a comparison ebooks.com ranks 18000th). My hunch is that many of the readers are going straight for the pdf files (this needs to be checked).

As an internet site we are hugely successful and it seems to me that we will need to accept the awkward truth that books are written by a handful of people and read by many. 

So what is the way forward?  Some of our most complete, reliable and rapidly developed books have been written as group exercises.  '''This is a key area and possibly the front page should contain a prominent box advertising collaborative writing in a seminar/classroom context'''.  It is also the case that most criticisms of Wikibooks focus on the changeability of texts, [[Wikibooks:Wikipublish]] is probably critical to our long term success but we have so few editors with the time required.

Perhaps we could resurrect the &quot;joke book&quot; and place boxes for featured books on every page....

Any thoughts? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:45, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

:The fact that books are written by few and read by many isn't awkward or unexpected. Quite the contrary, it's exactly what many of us have assumed for a long time, and it's confirmed fact on Wikipedia (i'll dig up the statistics if i can find them). The split between readers and writers is about 90%/10%, if I remember correctly.
:Putting more information about collaboration on the main page is not a bad idea. However, for those of us who remember the old COTM, the last few COTM books before that program was cancelled were abysmal. In short, putting collaborations on the main page did nothing to actually attract collaboration, or to help improve the book. However, if we took books that already were active and put a &quot;spotlight&quot; on them, that might help. Given the historical evidence of COTM, however, i'm inclined to say that putting a collaboration on the main page just isn't going to do anything productive. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:19, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

::It would be interesting to know how many readers are going straight for pdf files...  The type of collaboration that I had in mind was collaboration in the context of an academic environment where Wikibooks is used as a tool to enthuse students with the idea of producing essays for something worthwhile. What is needed is some way of selling this concept to university dons. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:43, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

:Also, the Wikipublish thing might be getting a technological boost coming up, because the foundation is having print-on-demand and automatic PDF generation capabilities added to the software. I've also been pushing for a read-only site or sub-domain or something where books that are good and stable can be hosted. Having a stabilized version of a book will make it more usable for classrooms (since the book won't be changed mid-semester) and will make it more attractive to educators and parents (because they won't be prone to vandalism). The Wikipublish project could become something so simple as an editorial board, checking books for quality, editing and updating them, and then saving them as stabilized versions. There are a lot of things going on with the WMF and the software that is going to help us out in a big way in the coming months, so I'm of the mindset that we need to wait and see, so that we don't waste effort trying to do manually what the software will eventually be doing automatically. Of course, if the foundation drags it's feet on these things (which isn't an unreasonable assumption) we will need to take action ourselves. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:24, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

:::This is good news. The big problem is going to be getting enough enthusiastic editors with enough time. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:43, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

::I think attempting to resurrect the joke book would lead to mass hysteria, so let's not go there. As far as the reader:editor ratio is concerned, one possibility with the featured books is that most people who read them ''aren't'' that knowledgeable about the subject they're reading about, which is why they do not edit it. Even if a professional does read it (for reference or curiousity or what have you) they may be deterred from editing a book that is deemed &quot;nearly complete&quot;, or they may just want to avoid having to write more about their profession (I know WK has said before that engineers at least seldom like to write about engineering, since they have to do it all day anyways). It's somewhat different with an encyclopedia article since it's a lot smaller of a scale and less detailed than a book on the same topic, at least in my view. 

::I do agree, however, with the emphasis on collaborations, though as WK pointed out it is difficult to get those together who would want to collaborate (class projects are convenient since they all are in the same place anyways, getting a random group of people from the internet together is an entirely different proposal). 

::With regard to the publishing, it ''would'' be difficult to verify all of the information in a nearly complete book, without a bunch of people (i.e. experts in the field) who can look it over and catch any mistakes and so forth. However, if such a professional saw that we were looking for verifiers, such as through use of a template, it is possible that they would be more inclined to help. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 17:58, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

:One thing that I do want to do is find a way to get the [[Template:New|new book list]] posted on the main page. The problem with that is that it takes space to add this list, which means we need to remove something from the main page if we want to add something new to it. I am highly in favor of removing the &quot;navigation&quot; links from the lower-left corner, or at least compacting them. If we have about 5 links to the &quot;departments&quot;, and not two dozen links to various bookshelves, that would save us the space we would need for an abbreviated new book list. Putting books that are &quot;good&quot; on the new page is likely to increase readership but not necessarily increase contributions. However, putting books that are new or &quot;bad&quot; on the front page with a big &quot;you can help!&quot; message is likely to do exactly that. At least, it's a hypothesis that I think is worth testing. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:44, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

::I definitely support your idea of reducing the bookshelf list on the main page to major headings. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:43, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

: I was wondering if it would be possible to convert every book possible to PDF and actually send somebody to Wikipedia to switch at least some of their activity to Wikibooks. Meta would probably have some executives to come over, probably bringing a retinue of followers with them. However, reading over the above thing, that might also get contributors over. I know a Wikipedian ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Valentinian Valentinian]) who is majoring in English and Contemporary History at a Danish university, and he might be willing to write things on Danish in English or vice versa. That could really get us going.. Also, I know Wikipedians who might be interested in switching completely to Wikibooks. Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 01:45, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

::As for the PDF versions, it would be possible to create a PDF out of every book, but it doesnt make sense to go through the effort for stub books, or small books, or books in bad condition. However, there is going to be an automatic PDF extension being installed next year that will allow us to create PDF versions of books quickly and easily. I dont think we should do anything drastic until this new extension is installed.
::As to attracting wikipedians, I agree that it would be a great benefit to us. Some of our members, notably [[User:SB Johnny]] have tried long and hard to attract Wikipedians to Wikibooks, and it's largely not been successful. That doesnt mean that it can't happen, just that our attempts so far have not be fruitful. Maybe we just haven't tried hard enough. If you know any wikipedians who are (a) upset at wikipedia, (b) interested in writing books, (c) just looking for a change of venue, or (d) fans of wikibooks, definitely try to invite them here. We have [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] to get them started, and [[Using Wikibooks]] for a more in-depth discussion of our project. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:08, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

(previously known as Apple Computer, Inc.)
[[Image:Apple store Michigan Ave.jpg|380px||center|||Apple store at Michigan Ave]]
&lt;/div&gt;

In 1976, friends Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak quit their jobs and moved into Steve's garage in Cupertino, CA.  Here they came up with the idea of creating an inexpensive and user-friendly computer.  Wozniak being the engineer had been working on an encased circuit board which included switches with flashing lights.  Jobs insisted that he and Wozniak try to sell this play toy for computer hobbyists which they called the Apple I.  That day the Apple Computer was born and the rest, as they say, is history.

==Topics==

===Interoperability===

===Reflection===

{{wikipedia|Reflection (computer science)}}
The Wikipedia definition for reflection in computer science is: &quot;The process by which a computer program can observe and modify its own structure and behavior. The programming paradigm driven by reflection is called reflective programming&quot;.

The concept is implemented extensively in .NET because a lot of information is maintained at the common intermediate language (CIL) level.

Among other things you can:
*get information about running assembly or assembly constituents (modules, classes, methods, etc.), this is particularly useful for dynamically loaded assemblies that are not known at compile time.
*put custom attributes in your code and retrieve those attributes at run time.
*dynamically invoke methods.
*&quot;emit&quot; and execute CIL code at run time.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Classes, Interfaces, and tools===

====COM interoperability==== 

'''Exam objective: '''Expose COM components to the .NET Framework and .NET Framework components to COM

(Refer System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace)

=====Exposing COM Components to the .NET Framework=====

:First there is an article in the .NET developers guide that covers the first part of this section, see [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z6tx9dw3(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

Import a type library as an assembly - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xwzy44e4(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

:Add references to type libraries

::Same link as above, see second paragraph.

:Type Library Importer (Tlbimp.exe) - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tt0cf3sx(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

:Generate interop assemblies from type libraries - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k83zzh38(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

::Imported Library Conversion - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cwhhsx92(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

::Imported Module Conversion - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b6y86f64(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

::Imported Type Conversion - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s8sdycxx(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

::Imported Member Conversion - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k639e386(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

::Imported Parameter Conversion - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k9c48sba(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

:TypeConverter class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.typeconverter.aspx MSDN]

Create COM types in managed code - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3y76b69k(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

Compile an interop project - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/538aes2a(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

Deploy an interop application - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tc0204w0(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

=====Exposing .NET Framework Components to COM=====

:The rest of the objectives of that section directly refers to [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zsfww439(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

Qualify the .NET Framework types for interoperation - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7fcfby2t(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

Apply Interop attributes, such as the ComVisibleAttribute class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d4w8x20h(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

Package an assembly for COM - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bctyca52(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

Deploy an application for COM access - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c2850st8(VS.71).aspx MSDN]

====Call DLL functions====

'''Exam objective: '''Call unmanaged DLL functions in a .NET Framework application, and control the marshalling of data in a .NET Framework application. 

(Refer System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace)

Platform Invoke - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0h9e9t7d.aspx MSDN]

Create a class to hold DLL functions - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/khbsw73t.aspx MSDN]

Create prototypes in managed code - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w4byd5y4.aspx MSDN]

:DllImportAttribute class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.dllimportattribute.aspx MSND]

Call a DLL function - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/be80xase.aspx MSDN]

:Look for &quot;P/Invoke&quot; on the internet.

:A good reference is: http://www.pinvoke.net/

:Some short hints:
:*For the DllAttribute &quot;CharSet&quot;, Logically, CharSet.Auto is the most secure way as this will autodetect the Charset used. The CharSet can be ANSI(Win95/Win98/ME) or Unicode (Win2000/WinXP)
:*GetEntryPoint: There could be one tricky question as the EntryPoint states the method that should be called. In case the name of the method used differs from the method to be called, this flag is necessary.

Call a DLL function in special cases, such as passing structures and implementing callback functions

:Same link as above

:Passing structures - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/awbckfbz.aspx MSDN]

:Implementing callback functions - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d186xcf0.aspx MSDN] 

Create a new Exception class and map it to an HRESULT - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9ztbc5s1.aspx MSDN]

Default marshaling behavior - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zah6xy75.aspx MSDN]

Marshal data with Platform Invoke - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/fzhhdwae.aspx MSDN]

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.

I thought my [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=ERP5_Handbook/Getting_Started&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1124760 most recent edit] made sense to me at the time -- it was an attempt at a [[wiki:PromptingStatement]].
But I see now that it was far from clear.
In fact, that edit doesn't make any sense.

I'm going to try again.
Perhaps if I use actual complete sentences this time, it will make more sense.

Or are you complaining about some other edit I've made?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Weblogs have become so ubiquitous that for many of us the term is synonymous with &quot;personal Web site,&quot; though many commercial sites now incorporate them, too. For others, they are &quot;sites made with blogging software,&quot; which seems obvious, except that some of us still update ours by hand. In either case, the form is familiar: frequently updated, reverse-chronological entries on a single Web page.  Spurred by easy-to-use commercial software, blogging is less about creating links and references to sites and sources, and increasingly about bloggers' own comments and personal interests.

[[File:Homeric_greece.png|thumb|right|350px|The location of many of the places mentioned in Homer's ''Iliad''.]]

The '''Mycenaean civilization''' refers to a Bronze Age civilization on mainland Greece, inhabiting the area from around 1600-1100 BCE. The name &quot;Mycenaean&quot; refers to the city of Mycenae, which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann beginning in 1876. Schliemann is also well-known for discovering and excavating the city of Troy in Asia Minor, which was at the time believed to be fictional. Mycenaean Greece is the period in which the Iliad and Odyssey are set.

==History==
Mycenaean civilization begins with the arrival of many tribes to the Greek mainland around 2000 BCE. These tribes began to establish themselves as political units sometime around 1600. The Mycenaeans quite possibly lived under Minoan dominance until around 1400, when they conquered Crete.

===Conflicts with Minoans===
The Mycenaeans are often cited as one of the contributing factors to the rapid decline of Minoan civilization. The Minoans lived on the Aegean island of Crete, and had a naval influence that likely subjugated the Mycenaeans. Around the year 1600 BCE, it is believed that a volcanic eruption on the island of Santorini near Crete devastated the Minoans. The resulting weakness is thought to have allowed the Mycenaeans to overthrow the Minoans and replace them as the dominant culture of the region.

===The ''Iliad''===
[[File:MaskAgamemnon.png|thumb|right|180px|This golden mask, discovered at Mycenae by Schliemann, was named the ''Mask of Agamemnon'', after the character from the ''Iliad''.]]

The Classical vdfdfdfdfdfdfdfdfdfvvd  vvev sdcpoet called Homer wrote the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' in the 8th or 7th century BCE, long after the Mycenaeans had vanished as a recognizable civilization. Because of this centuries-long gap in time, most scholars agree that Homer's epics cannot be viewed as accurate accounts of Mycenaean culture. Homer's works would more likely reflect the culture of his day instead. It has been verified, however, that many of the places referred to in the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' were actual Mycenaean sites, including Troy. The individual characters of these stories, such as Achilles, Hector, Priam, Diomedes, and Agamemnon, should not be interpreted as historical figures.

===Decline and collapse===
Sometime around 1100, a tribe from the north known as the Dorians invaded the Peloponnesus and destroyed the Mycenaean civilization. Greece was subsequently thrown into a Dark Age, from which it took several centuries to recover. The written Mycenaean language was completely forgotten, forcing the Greeks to reinvent their writing system centuries later.

==Culture==

===Religion===
Not a great deal is known about the Mycenaean religion. It has been observed, however, that it was influenced to some degree by that of the Minoans. Many of the Mycenaean gods are recognizable to us as the well-known Classical gods, such as Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Ares, Athena, Dionysus, and Hermes. Apollo, Aphrodite, and Hades are notable absences!

===Art===
[[File:Mycenaean Woman.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Fresco of a Mycenaean woman.]]

Mycenaean artwork was influenced, like nearly all other aspects of their civilization, by the Minoans. Pottery, statues, and paintings make up the majority of Mycenaean art. Mycenaeans developed advanced bronzeworking techniques, creating swords, shields, and suits of armor.

===Architecture===

In contrast to the Minoans, the Mycenaean leaders built fortresses — enormous walled structures that contained a ''megaron'' like the Minoan palace, but were primarily fortifications for defense.  The walls of these structures often stood forty or fifty feet high, and were composed of enormous blocks of stone weighing two to three tons, fitted together without mortar.  Fortresses at Tiryns and at Mycenae are considered the best examples of these military structures.

[[File:Gla_se_gate.JPG|thumb|left|The south gate of Gla, in Boeotia.]]

Unlike the Minoans, the Mycenaeans are not known to have built many religious shrines. A sacrificial site on Mount Lykaon sacred to Zeus in the Classical period has recently been found to pre-date Mycenaean occupation of the Greek peninsula or the Peloponnese, but no substantial structures of a religious nature have been identified at Mycenaean sites.  Such buildings may have been incorporated into the palace-fortresses, but they are not specifically identified as such.

A Mycenaean common house has been located and identified.  Dating from late in the Mycenaean period, it consists of a long, narrow building of posts with wattle-and-daub curtain walls and likely a thatched roof.  One end of the house held an entry porch, while the opposite end was rounded and held the likely sleeping quarters.  The interior was divided into two rooms, the aforementioned sleeping area farthest from the entrance, and a living area that contained a rudimentary hearth and a food-preparation area.  The presence of sheep feces and wool fibers in the porch area suggest that the front entrance was used as a pen for holding animals.

===Language===


The language spoken by the Mycenaeans was an ancestor of modern Greek.  The written language of the Mycenaeans was known as Linear B (in contrast to the Minoan script, Linear A). Linear B was deciphered in 1951, and proved to be an ancient form of the modern Greek language. This orthography resembled modern Japanese, in that it was syllabic instead of alphabetic. This form of writing, however, was forgotten during the Dark Ages, leading the Greeks of the classical era to redevelop a system of writing from a Phoenician model, allowing the alphabetic system to come into use.

===Economy===

A substantial number of Linear B texts, deal with matters of economic concern — inventories of possessions and lists of goods being brought to the palaces or sent out from the palaces.  One of the most famous, used in the process of cracking Linear B as a language, lists provisions for the coast guard: apparently the so-called &quot;Palace of Nestor&quot; mounted a seaward watch on the approaches to its landfall, and paid the watchers in food and goods.  These records suggest that the palaces were the principal economic engines of the era.  They took in raw materials into workshops, where trained artisans produced finished goods, that would then be exchanged with other palaces for the best products of their local regions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Weblogs--frequently updated, independently produced, and curiously addictive--have become some of the most popular sites on the Web today. ''The Weblog Handbook'' is the first book to explain how weblogs work and explore their impact on the media landscape.  There is no formula for creating a superb weblog--but there are lessons to be drawn from maintaining one. In ''The Weblog Handbook'', Rebecca Blood draws on her experience as an early participant in the weblog community to share what she has learned in three years of &quot;living online.&quot;  With a clear and engaging voice, Rebecca explains how to choose among the available tools, even walking the beginner through the process of creating their first weblog. Along the way she answers commonly asked questions concerning weblog etiquette, how to attract readers, and the qualities that make a weblog stand out, alerting the novice to considerations--and pitfalls--they didn't know to ask about.  For students of digital culture, ''The Weblog Handbook'' provides an account of the history of the movement, an explanation of the &quot;weblog method&quot;, and a thoughtful examination of weblogs and journalism.  Finally, Rebecca examines how the weblog community has grown and changed, the dangers confronting it, and the ways in which weblogs are affecting and affected by both online and offline culture.

[[Image:Sinusoid_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|&lt;center&gt;How does a sinusoidal oscillation conceive in an LC tank?&lt;/center&gt;]]__TOC__


&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Questions to be answered ==

LC tank is a legendary electrical circuit, and conceiving sinusoidal oscillations in an LC tank is a popular electrical phenomenon. It is well described in physics, electricity and electronics resources (see for example one of the best LC explanations on the web&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/electricCircuits/AC/AC_6.html#xtocid220940 An electric pendulum] by Tony Kuphaldt is a classical but maybe the best written story about the operation of LC tank, although it seems to imply that pendulums exhibit Simple Harmonic Motion (they don't, quite).&lt;/ref&gt;). Browsing through these resources you will probably get to know what an LC tank is and how it operates in terms of electricity. Only, although these resources explain in detail what an LC tank does they do not say how and why it does this magic. 

The point is that LC oscillation is not only a specific electrical occurrence; this is a great worldly phenomenon. There are many its manifestations in &quot;non-electrical&quot; world (mechanics, pneumatics, hydraulics, etc.) If you want to penetrate deeply into its nature, you will begin asking dozens of &quot;philosophical&quot; questions that are still unanswered. What are these questions? Here are some of them.

''Why does an LC tank consist of two &quot;heterogeneous&quot; accumulating elements (a capacitor and an inductor)? Why is it not assembled by two &quot;homogeneous&quot; elements (both capacitors or both inductors)? What is the role of these elements in the LC circuit? What do they actually do there? What are they? Why does the energy in an LC tank &quot;have no peace&quot;? What make it circulate (in theory, infinitely) between the two components? What makes the accumulating elements discharge completely? Why does an LC oscillation have a sinusoidal shape? Why is it no with linear or other shape? Why does not the LC natural frequency depend on the amount of the &quot;pushed&quot; energy? Why is the oscillation curve symmetrical? What are the differences between LC and other (RC, relaxation, etc.) oscillations? Is there any likeness between them and what is it? What is the connection between the two-component LC tank and the one-component pendulum? What is the &quot;capacitor&quot; and what is the &quot;inductor&quot; in a pendulum?''

In this story, we will answer these questions in a manner that is quite different from the classical one. Here, we will forget temporarily the conventional &quot;electrical&quot; LC explanations (e.g., &quot;...the inductor discharges through the capacitor and the field collapses...&quot;); they will help us not so much to answer the questions above. Because we, human beings, cannot understand concrete (electrical) phenomena by concrete (electrical) explanations. In order to grasp the specific electrical ideas, we need first to reveal the most general, non-electrical ideas behind the concrete electrical phenomena.

In this exciting story we, ''circuit ideators'' and ''circuit philosophers'', will try by ourselves to find out the truth about this great worldly phenomenon. For this purpose, we will re-invent and build step-by-step the famous LC tank, in order to grasp the basic idea benind it. Thus we will create a general, non-electrical philosophy for the specific electrical LC phenomenon.

== Creating the first half of the sinusoid ==

=== Initial steady quantity ===

'''General sources.''' First of all, to do something in this world, we need a steady power source. According to the two kinds of energy - ''kinetic'' and ''potential'', there are also two kinds of sources - a ''flow-like'' source and a ''pressure-like'' one (see the top of Fig. 1a). A flow-like source keeps up a constant flow rate and a pressure-like source keeps up a constant pressure difference of something (air, water, oil, spring tension, etc.) - Fig. 1b.

[[Image:Steady_sources_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1a. There are two kinds of power sources.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Steady_quantity_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1b. A steady quantity to be made change periodically.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Electrical sources.''' Similarly, in electricity we have two kinds of sources - a ''current source'' keeping up a constant current&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/What is a Current Source?|What is a Current Source?]] (unusual negative feedback viewpoint at the classical current source&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''voltage source'' keeping up a constant voltage&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/What is a Voltage Source?|What is a Voltage Source?]] (unusual negative feedback viewpoint at the classical voltage source)&lt;/ref&gt; (see the bottom of Fig. 1a).

'''The problem.''' Only, for variety of reasons, we want to make the output quantity of the steady source begin changing periodically through time. Of course, we can take a varying source and just begin controlling it; but we want it to ''oscillate'' by itself, without our help. So, the problem is:

&lt;center&gt;'''''How do we make the steady quantity wiggle regularly through time?'''''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== The first quarter ===

==== Making a quantity depend on time ====

First and foremost, we have to make the steady quantity depend on (change through) time. At this point, it is not so important how it varies in time; it is only important that it changes in time. So, the main question is: ''How do we make time-dependent quantities?''

'''Philosophy.''' Obviously, we have to start some process in time (''but what is time?'':) In order to make something to change, we have to take from it or to give to it; this means to ''move'' something from one place to other... One source is not enough for this purpose since it keeps up steady its output quantity; we need two elements - source and load connected to each other, to begin transferring energy from the source to the load (and maybe, v.v.) We already have a source; it remains to choose the kind of load.

'''A need of accumulating.''' A resistor is useless for such a load since it can instantaneously change current (when voltage is instantaneously changed). A resistor cannot store energy, it cannot &quot;remember&quot;. It is clear that we have to begin transferring and storing continuously some quantity in an ''accumulating'' element (an ''integrator''). Integrators can accumulate energy, matter or information; mostly they store energy.  So, we can make its output quantity  increase by continuously adding energy to the accumulator and to decrease it by subtracting continuously energy from the accumulator. According to the two kinds of energy - ''kinetic'' and ''potential'', we can build two kinds of integrators - ''flow-to-pressure'' and ''pressure-to-flow'' integrator.

'''Flow-to-pressure integrator.''' In this case, we begin converting a ''flow-like quantity'' (carrying kinetic energy) into a ''pressure-like quantity'' (carrying potential energy) and storing it into an accumulating element having a property ''to contain'' (see the top of Fig. 2a). The energy moves from the flow to the pressure accumulator and the pressure-like quantity begins changing linearly through time (Fig. 2b). 

[[Image:LC_phase1_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2a. A current source drives an I-to-V integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Sin_phase1_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2b. Making the steady quantity change through time.&lt;/center&gt;]] '''Examples:''' moving mass pushes a spring, an accelerated pendulum raises, a child wind up a spring motor, an archer draws a bow, a flywheel puts in motion a toy car, a motor lifts a mass, an air pump blows up a tire, a water pump fills a reservoir, etc. We can even, in order to feel the process, imagine that very we are moving (in synectics, this technique for creative thinking is known as &quot;empathy&quot;).

Note that the flow-to-pressure integrator consists of two heterogenous elements connected to each other - a source of kinetic energy and an accumulator of potential energy. If we connect two homogeneous elements to each other (a source of kinetic energy and an accumulator of kinetic energy), a big pressure appears and the process ceases momentarily&lt;ref name=&quot;ind dif&quot;&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Making an Inductor Differentiate|Making an Inductor Differentiate]] (building an &quot;incorrect&quot; inductive differentiator)&lt;/ref&gt;; this arrangement will differentiate rather than integrate. A mechanical example: imagine what happens, if a moving car hits a car at rest.

'''Current-to-voltage integrator.''' In electricity, we have two elements that can accumulate energy - a capacitor stores potential energy and an inductor stores kinetic energy. So, we can build two kinds of electrical integrators - ''current-to-voltage'' and ''voltage-to-current'' integrator. Let's begin with the first and more popular of them.

According to the general flow-to-pressure arrangement, in a current-to-voltage integrator we begin converting a current (carrying kinetic energy) into a voltage (carrying potential energy) and storing it into a capacitor. So, the circuit includes a current source charging a capacitor (see the bottom of Fig. 2a).  As a result, the voltage across the capacitor changes linearly through time (Fig. 2b). Note the current enters the positive plate of the capacitor; so, the capacitor acts here as a load.

The circuit consists of two heterogenous electrical elements connected to each other - a current source and a capacitor. If we connect two homogeneous elements to each other (a current source and an inductor), a high voltage appears across them and the process ceases momentarily; the circuit will differentiate rather than integrate&lt;ref name=&quot;ind dif&quot;&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Making an Inductor Differentiate|Making an Inductor Differentiate]] (building an &quot;incorrect&quot; inductive differentiator)&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Rounding the curve... ====

So far, we have made the steady quantity change linearly through time. Thus, we have obtained a quantity that increases continuously in time. In many cases (e.g., in ramp generators), this is a desired feature; but here we need a sinusoidal shape, not a linear one. So, the new problem is, &quot;''How do we round the linear curve?''&quot;

Then, let's scrutinize the present linear curve trying to find a remedy for converting it to a sinusoidal shaped. What does it mean? It means that after the quantity was changing linearly for a while, at this point it has already to begin changing (decreasing) its slope, to bend down, &quot;to loose its nerve&quot; (Fig. 3b). How do we achieve such an effect?

'''The general idea.''' So far, we have obtained a linear change by an integrator that was integrating a constant quantity. Now, we ask ourselves, &quot;How do we make the integrator to slow down its output quantity?&quot; The answer is: &quot;By decreasing the input quantity.&quot; Here is the basic idea needed - ''to decrease the input quantity''.

===== ...by reducing the effective voltage... =====

Remember the imperfect RC integrator&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Making a Capacitor Integrate|Making a Capacitor Integrate]] (building a resistive-capacitive integrator)&lt;/ref&gt;, whose linear curve is naturally rounded (exponentially shaped).

[[Image:RC_integrator_10002.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3a. The input voltage source V and the resistor R in an RC integrator form a decreasing current source.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:RC_exp_curve_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3b. As the current decreases in time the curve of V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; decreases its slope as well.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The &quot;problem&quot; (here, this is an advantage) of this integrating circuit (Fig. 3a) was that the capacitor was been charging by an imperfect &quot;self-made&quot; current source (assembled by a voltage source V and a resistor R). As a result, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; across the load (the capacitor) enervates the excitation voltage V; in this way, it disturbs the imperfect current source. In this arrangement, the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = V - V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current I instead the excitation voltage V. As the current-creating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; decreases through time the current decreases as well. Because of this ''decreasing in time current source'' the curve of V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; begins decreasing its slope as well; this is what we want here.

===== ...by decreasing the input current... =====

But here we have a perfect current source whose current does not depend on the voltage across the load (the capacitor). That means, if the load voltage increases, our current source increases its internal excitation voltage as well thus eliminating the voltage disturbance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/current_source/current_source_philosophy/current_source_philosophy.htm#step5 Keeping a constant current by a following excitation voltage] reveals the philosophy of constant current sources.&lt;/ref&gt;. It looks strange but here the problem is the very perfect current source:) What do we do then? How do we make it behave as an imperfect one?

Having been looking at Fig. 3, some rudiments of new idea can begin conceiving in our minds... It turns out that we can manage to round, change and finally decrease the slope of the curve by making in some way the perfect current source begin decreasing ''by itself'' the current produced when the voltage across the load increases... We can generalize this assertion:

&lt;center&gt;''The only way to change (decrease) the slope of the curve representing the output quantity of a perfect integrator is to begin changing (decreasing) its input quantity.''&lt;/center&gt;

Whereas in the imperfect RC integrator the rounding is a result of decreasing the effective current-creating voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, here the rounding will be a result of decreasing the whole input voltage V. Well, it is wonderful but how can we do this magic?

Of course, we can regulate the input voltage but this will require some electronic circuit. Do not remember here we &quot;invent&quot; the simplest &quot;thing&quot; that can oscillate; so, we need the simplest &quot;trick&quot; that can exist! What is it?

===== ...by exhausting the input current source =====

It seems another new idea begins conceiving... We would like to decrease a quantity... It is produced by a power source... It has got a limited reserve of energy... Eureka! If we begin taking away energy from the source, its output quantity will begin decreasing! Here are some examples: pushing the spring, the moving mass begins slowing its speed; running into an elastic barrier, we slowing your run; rising, the pendulum begins slowing, etc.

[[Image:LC_phase2_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4a. A decreasing I source drives an I-to-V integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Sin_phase2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4b. Making the changing quantity retard.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The right idea.''' If, in a kind of way, the input current source begins weakening, depleting, exhausting its reserve of energy, the source's current will begin decreasing as well (Fig. 4a). As a result, the voltage across the capacitor will begin changing slowly and its curve will begin &quot;loosing its nerve&quot; (Fig. 4b). Is this source an imperfect current source as [[#...reducinging the effective voltage...|above?]] No, it is not; it is an ''exhausting but still a perfect'' constant current source that decreases gradually its output quantity. Here, the current decreases not because of the load voltage (as it was at the [[#...reducing the effective voltage...|imperfect RC integrator]]) but because of the load consumption!

What an electrical element can serve as such an exhausting perfect current source? Of course, an inductor charged with kinetic energy&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Is an Inductor a Current Source?|Is an Inductor a Current Source?]] (comparison with a &quot;real&quot; current source)&lt;/ref&gt;! It seems strange but it produces a &quot;constant&quot; current (for quick load changes) that gradually decreases:

&lt;center&gt;''A charged inductor can serve as an exhausting current source that decreases gradually its output current''.&lt;/center&gt;

Eurika! We have obtained the arrangement needed (Fig. 4a); we have almost &quot;invented&quot; the LC tank:

&lt;center&gt;''An initially charged inductor suppplies an initially empty capacitor''.&lt;/center&gt;

Note the current leaves the positive lead of the inductor; so, the inductor acts here as a source.

==== Stopping the &quot;movement&quot; ====

We are already at the top of the curve and now it's time to stop here. But how can we make the integrator's output quantity stop? Will it stop, if we stop the input quantity? No, it will not. Even if we decrease significantly the input quantity, the integrator will not cease changing its output quantity. The only way to stop the integrator's output quantity is to zero the input quantity. To convince yourself of this phenomenon imagine you fill a vessel with water: even if you lower the rate of flow to an insignificant quantity, the water level will still continue increasing. More examples: if you feed up gradually a money deposit with small change, the amount of money increases slowly (but still increases) through time; pushing the spring, the moving mass finally stops; moving pendulum stops at the top.

[[Image:LC_phase3_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5a. The capacitor is charged  completely.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Sin_phase3_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5b. Making the changing quantity stop&lt;/center&gt;]]

The &quot;exhausting&quot; flow source [[#...exhausting the input current source|above]] that produces gradually decreasing flow has already helped us to change the slope of the curve and to round it. Here, at the top of the curve, it can help us now to stop the &quot;movement&quot;. Indeed, at the maximum of the quantity, the source has completely exhausted its reserve of kinetic energy. Actually, at this instant, it is not merely a source; it is an ''empty'' source. As a result, the flow becomes zero (Fig. 5a) and the integrator stops changing its output quantity (Fig. 5b). Then, let's draw another conclusion:

&lt;center&gt;''The only way to stop changing the integrator's output quantity is to zero its input quantity.''&lt;/center&gt;

In the electrical implementation (an LC tank) the inductor serves as an exhausting current source (Fig. 5a). At the top of the curve, it has fully discharged and produces no current. As a result, the voltage across the capacitor stops changing.

'''Why does the inductor discharge completely?''' We have already [[#...exhausting the input current source|said]] that an inductor is an exhausting but still a ''perfect'' constant current source. Furthermore, an inductor is a ''natural'', pure, monolithic current source; it is not an ''artificial'' current source that is composed of an internal voltage source and a resistor as in the case of the [[#...reducing the effective voltage...|imperfect RC integrator]]. This means it can create a high enough voltage across the load to produce the current desired. In other words, the current created by the inductor does not depend on the voltage across the capacitor; this voltage is not an &quot;opposition&quot; to the current. As there is nothing to oppose the current produced by the inductor, no matter how small energy is left in the inductor; the current continues flowing until the inductor discharges completely.

'''The opposite arrangement.''' In order to feel the difference, compare this &quot;discharging inductor -&gt; charging capacitor&quot; arrangement with the &quot;discharging capacitor -&gt; charging inductor&quot; arrangement mentioned [[#Reversing the direction|below]]. In the latter case, the charged capacitor is discharging and the empty inductor is charging. In this way, both the elements are finally charged with some energy. The voltage across them has some middle value - the point of the system equilibrium.

=== The second quarter ===

==== Reversing the direction ====

So far, we have been &quot;moving&quot; in one direction (initially fast, then slow) and finally we have stopped at the top of the curve. As we have been &quot;pushing&quot; continuously energy into the accumulator (the integrator), its output quantity has been having a continuously increasing magnitude. Thus we have obtained a monotonous and quite uninteresting signal:) However, we would like to obtain a periodical quantity; so, we have here, at the top of the curve, to change, to ''reverse'' in some way the direction of the &quot;movement&quot;. Something has to happen at this point that to make the integrator's output quantity begin decreasing... What can cause this to happen?

Looking at many analogies of integrating, we can conclude that the only way to change the direction of the integrator's (here, a pressure-like) output quantity is to change the direction, not the magnitude, of its input (here, a flow-like) quantity. Imagine again the water analogy: while we fill the vessel the water level increases; to make it decrease, we have to begin emptying the vessel. Or imagine the money analogy: while you feed up gradually the deposit, the amount of money increases through time; to make it decrease, your wife has to begin &quot;emptying&quot; the deposit:) Of course, we should mention again the famous mechanical analogy: after the moving mass stops, the spring begins beating it back; after we strike into the elastic barrier, it repulses us, it acts as a kind of &quot;reverser&quot; that changes the direction of our movement. We are ready enough to draw two conclusions:

&lt;center&gt;''A flow-to-pressure integrator can reverse the flow direction.''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;''The only way to change the direction of the integrator's output quantity is to change the direction of its input quantity.''&lt;/center&gt;

But this integrator is not only a bare accumulator... [[#...by exhausting the input current source|Remember]] that so far a flow-like source has been exhausting slowly and charging this pressure accumulator (a flow-to-pressure integrator). So, at the end of this process, the integrator has transmuted into an opposite pressure source. Now, it is a charged with energy accumulator; it has become a power source! So, it can by itself change its output quantity by passing a current through the load. But what is the load here? The other element (the former source) acts now as a load. What kind of load is it? [[#...by exhausting the input current source|Remember]] it is an accumulutaing element that stores kinetic energy.

'''Pressure-to-flow integrator.''' So, we begin now converting a ''pressure-like quantity'' (carrying potential energy) into a ''flow-like quantity'' (carrying kinetic energy) and storing it into an accumulating element having a property of ''inertness'' (see the top of Fig. 6a). Now, the energy moves in an opposite direction - from the pressure to the flow accumulator, and the flow-like quantity should change linearly through time (Fig. 6b). 

[[Image:LC_phase4_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6a. A &quot;voltage source&quot; drives a V-to-I integrator.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Sin_phase4_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 6b. Reversing the changing quantity.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Examples:''' a spring (or gravitation) puts in motion a mass, a spring motor actuates a toy, a child accelerate a flywheel car, air compressed in a reservoir spins an air turbine, water stored in a lake spins a water turbine, a boulder rolls down a mountain going faster and faster, &quot;putting the pedal to the metal&quot; makes a constant-horsepower engine push a car faster and faster, pressurized air escaping from a balloon rocket causes it to accelerate and fly away, water rocket, &quot;pushing off&quot; with your foot starts a bicycle moving, etc.

Note that this arrangement includes again two heterogenous elements connected to each other - a source of potential energy and an accumulator of kinetic energy. If we connect two homogeneous elements to each other (now, a source of potential energy and an accumulator of potential energy), a big current flows and the process ceases momentarily&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Discharging a Capacitor through a Capacitor|Discharging a Capacitor through a Capacitor]] (transferring instantly energy between voltage &quot;sources&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;. As [[#Making a quantity depend on time|above]], this arrangement will differentiate rather than integrate.

'''Voltage-to-current integrator.''' According to the general pressure-to-flow arrangement, in a voltage-to-current integrator we begin converting a voltage (carrying potential energy) into a current (carrying kinetic energy) and storing it into an inductor. So, the circuit includes a voltage source charging an inductor (see the bottom of Fig. 6a). As a result, the current through the inductor should change linearly through time (Fig. 6b). Note the current leaves the positive plate of the capacitor (so, it acts here as a source) and the current enters the  positive plate of the inductor (so, it acts here as a load).

The circuit consists of two heterogenous elements connected to each other - a voltage source and an inductor. If we connect two homogeneous elements to each other (a voltage source and a capacitor), a big current flows through them and the process ceases momentarily&lt;ref name=&quot;ind dif&quot;&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Making a Capacitor Differentiate|Making a Capacitor Differentiate]] (building an &quot;incorrect&quot; capacitive differentiator)&lt;/ref&gt;; the circuit will differentiate rather than integrate.

'''An exhausting voltage source''' As [[#...by exhausting the input current source|above]], in order to round the curve, our source has to have a limited reserve of energy; it has to exhaust, deplete gradually. The capacitor serves exactly as such an exhausting voltage source. Only, whereas [[#...by exhausting the input current source|before]] we wanted to round the curve in the final part, here we want to round it in the initial part. Let's see what the situation is. In the beginning, the current is low and the inductor consumes a little energy. Later, the current through the inductor increases and it begins consuming more and more energy from the voltage &quot;source&quot;. Wonderful! The curve is rounded in its initial part exactly as we wanted!

&lt;center&gt;''The charged capacitor in an LC tank serves as an exhausting voltage source that decreases gradually its output voltage.&lt;/center&gt;

==== Crossing the zero level ====

At the end of this stage, the source has completely exhausted its reserve of potential energy. As above, at this instant, it is not a source; it is just an empty source. As a result, the pressure becomes zero (see the top of Fig. 7a) and the pressure-to-flow integrator stops increasing its output quantity (Fig. 7b). It has accumulated maximum kinetic energy at this point.

If you look again at our favorite analogies, you will see that the moving masses from all the mechanical examples above are maximum accelerated (e.g., imagine how fast we run at this point:) Here, we have to remember that these objects have an interesting property - ''inertness''. If they were non-inert, they would stop at this point and the system would be in state of equilibrium. But they are inert; that's why, they pass by this zero point (a neutral position) and continue moving... As if there are some devilish force:) that make them continue moving beyond this point (remember Newton's laws of motion).

[[Image:LC_phase5_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7a. The inductor is charged  completely.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Sin_phase5_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 7b. Making the changing quantity pass through zero.&lt;/center&gt;]]

We can already compare the behavior of the two different accumulating elements. We have [[#Reversing the direction|already]] seen how the accumulator of potential energy (the capacitor) acts as a kind of an elastic barrier that repulses the moving &quot;mass&quot; thus reversing the direction of the movement. Now, we can see how the accumulator of kinetic energy (the inductor), because of its inherent inertness, &quot;passes&quot; beyond the equilibrium point (the zero level) and continues &quot;moving&quot;.

A little while ago, the capacitor served as an exhausting voltage source. At this point, it has fully discharged and there is no voltage across it. The current through the inductor has its maximum rate but it has stopped changing. So, at the end of the stage both the current and the energy consumption have increased to its maximum value. 

'''The opposite arrangement.''' We have already managed to answer why the [[#Stopping the &quot;movement&quot;|inductor]] discharges completely through the capacitor - ''because it is a natural true current source''. Now situation is even more interesting. In order to answer why the capacitor discharges completely, let's again consider the [[#Stopping the &quot;movement&quot;|opposite arrangement]] - a charged capacitor connected to an empty one. If you prefer analogies, imagine communicating vessels where the one vessel is full and the other is empty. We know the result: a big current flows in the beginning; the &quot;opposing&quot; voltage across the initially empty capacitor (the water level of the initially empty vessel) begins rising rapidly; as a result, it decreases and finally stops the current. At this point, the energy is distributed between the two capacitors and the system is at ''static equilibrium'' (remember Newton's third law). The initially charged capacitor has not managed to discharge completely.

'''Why does the capacitor discharge completely?''' Contrary, if we connect the charged capacitor to an initially empty inductor (the present case), the current is negligible in the beginning and the capacitor begins discharging slowly through the inductor. In the course of time, the inductor lets the current increase gradually. The increasing current discharges the capacitor more and more thus hastening its discharging; finally, the capacitor is fully discharged. Figuratively speaking, an inductor has a time-dependent behavior: in the beginning, it consumes little current but in the end it devours a large quantity of current (a capacitor has an opposite time-dependent behavior - in the beginning, it devours a maximum current but in the end it consumes little current).

At first glance, it seems the system is moving to its equilibrium; we might suppose it has managed to reach this point and the energy inhabiting the LC tank &quot;has found a peace&quot;...

== Creating the second half of the sinusoid ==

So far, we was considering in details how to create the first half (the first and the second quarter) of the sinusoid curve. The common sense suggests that we can create in the same manner the second half. Then, let's try it.

=== The third quarter ===
 
[[Image:LC_phase6_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8a. The decreasing I source drives the I-to-V integrator in an opposite direction.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Sin_phase6_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 8b. The quantity begins changing, slowing and finally stops.&lt;/center&gt;]]

At the end of the second quarter and at the beginning of the third quarter, the situation is the same as it was at the first quarter. From one side, the inductor is fully charged with kinetic energy and it has transmuted from an integrator into a current source again (Fig. 8a). From the other side, the empty capacitor is connected to this &quot;current source&quot;. What does the inductor begin doing then? Of course, it will start charging the capacitor and begin exhausting gradually. The only difference is the direction of the current that creates across the capacitor a negative voltage. As a result, the curve begins falling (in the beginning - rapidly, then - slowly) and finally stops at the bottom. It is rounded in the final part as we want.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== The fourth quarter ===


[[Image:LC_phase7_1000.jpg|left|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9a. The decreasing V source drives the V-to-I integrator in an opposite direction.&lt;/center&gt;]][[Image:Sin_phase7_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 9b. The quantity begins reversing, hastening and finally crosses the zero level.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Similarly, in the beginning of the final fourth quarter, the situation is the same as it was at the second quarter. From one side, the capacitor is fully charged with potential energy and it has transmuted from an integrator into a voltage source again (Fig. 9a). From the other side, the empty inductor is connected to this &quot;voltage source&quot;. What does the capacitor begin doing then? Of course, it will start charging the inductor and begin exhausting gradually. The only difference is the negative voltage across the capacitor that creates a current with an opposite direction. As a result, the curve stays under the zero level but begins rising (in the beginning - slowly, then - rapidly) and finally crosses the zero level (Fig. 9b). It is rounded at the initial part as we want.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== A generalization ==

At the end of this incredible story, let's generalize what we have managed to do.

=== Basic structure ===

[[Image:Generalization_1000.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 10. Energy exchange&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the beginning, we have assembled a system of two connected to each other heterogeneous elements that can process two different kinds of energy: they can ''convert'' energy (acting as true energy converters), ''store'' energy (acting as accumulators) and ''supply'' loads by energy (acting as sources). The one of them can ''convert potential to kinetic energy'', ''store the kinetic energy'' and ''transfer gradually this kinetic energy'' to the load keeping up a gradually decreasing flow-like quantity; the other element can ''convert kinetic to potential energy'', ''store this potential energy'' and ''transfer gradually this potential energy'' to the load keeping up a gradually decreasing pressure-like quantity. The first element has a property of ''inertness'' while the second one has a property of ''strain''; so, the first element can &quot;pass&quot; beyond the equilibrium point and continue moving while the second one can reverse the direction of the &quot;movement&quot;. Each of these reversible elements can act as a load as well as an gradually exhausting source. These kinds of ''rechargeable sources'' are fitted perfectly to each other - when the one element acts as a ''flow-output source'', the other one acts as a ''flow-input load'' and v.v. - when the other element acts as a ''pressure-output source'', the first one acts as a ''pressure-input load''. As a result, they can exchange energy gradually in time between each other.

=== Electrical circuit ===

In electricity, we have implemented this arrangement by connecting an inductor and a capacitor to each other; thus we have obtained the famous circuit of an ''LC tank''. The inductor can convert voltage to current, store the kinetic energy of moving electrons in the magnetic field and transfer gradually this kinetic energy to the load keeping up a gradually decreasing current; the capacitor can convert current to voltage, store this potential energy in the electrostatic field and transfer gradually this potential energy to the load keeping up a gradually decreasing voltage. Simply speaking, the inductor acts as a ''rechargable current source'' and the capacitor acts as a ''rechargable voltage source''.

=== Operation === 

In the beginning (see ''point '''a''''' on Fig. 11), there is no energy in the LC tank; it is at rest. Then, we charge the inductor connecting momentarily a current source (with the same success we might charge initially the capacitor connecting momentarily a voltage source and this is the more usual case in electronic oscillators). After we disconnect the source a wonder begins...

[[Image:Sinusoid_1000.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 11. Assembling a full sinusoidal oscillation&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''[[#...by exhausting the input current source|Phase 1]]'''. The inductor (acting as a positive current source) discharges gradually through the capacitor (acting as an accumulating load). The energy moves from left to right; the voltage increases above the zero level. At the top (''point '''b'''''), the capacitor becomes a positive voltage source.&lt;br&gt;
'''[[#Reversing the direction|Phase 2]]'''. The capacitor (acting as a positive voltage source) discharges gradually through the inductor (acting as an accumulating load). The energy moves from right to left; the voltage decreases toward the zero level. At the end (point '''''c'''''), the inductor becomes a negative current source.&lt;br&gt;
'''[[#The third quarter|Phase 3]]'''. The inductor (acting as a negative current source) discharges gradually through the capacitor (acting as an accumulating load). The energy moves from left to right; the voltage decreases below the zero level. At the bottom (''point '''d'''''), the capacitor becomes a negative voltage source.&lt;br&gt;
'''[[#The fourth quarter|Phase 4]]'''. The capacitor (acting as a negative voltage source) discharges gradually through the inductor (acting as an accumulating load). The energy moves from right to left; the voltage increases toward the zero level. At the end (point '''''e'''''), the inductor becomes a positive current source.

'''Assembling.''' If there are no losses in the circuit, the four phases will repeat continuosly one after another (1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 1 - etc.) thus forming the whole LC sinusoidal oscillation (Fig. 11). The LC tank keeps the initially injected energy intact but this energy is not at rest, it &quot;has no peace&quot;. The energy inhabitting the LC tank moves continuously to and fro between the two elements and changes alternatively from one to other form. Accordingly, the electrical quantities (current and voltage) representing the corresponding kinds of energy (kinetic and potential) change in а sinusoidal manner; so, we can use them as outputs.

=== Natural frequency === 

'''Energy independence.''' As we have seen, after we inject energy into an LC tank it begins producing a sinusoidal oscillation with a ''natural period''. If we inject more energy, the amplitudes of the voltage and the current increase but they change more quickly and v.v.; as a result, the natural period remains constant. The reason of this &quot;energy-independent time behavior&quot; is the ''variable consumption'': when we increase the initially injected energy, the consumption increases as well and v.v. In the case when we charge the inductor with more energy, the current passing through the inductor will reach a bigger magnitude and then, when we disconnect the &quot;pushing&quot; current source, this bigger current will determine a bigger consumption; as a result, the time remains the same. In the other case, when we charge the capacitor with more energy and then disconnect the &quot;pushing&quot; voltage source, the inductor will begin gradually consuming a bigger current; as a result, again the time remains the same (we can observe a similar &quot;time constant&quot; effect in an [[w:RC time constant|RC circuit]]). So, we can make a conclusion: ''the natural frequency of an LC oscillation does not depend on the amount of the &quot;pushed&quot; energy (on the magnitudes of the voltage and current)''.

'''LC dependence.''' Contrary, if we change the values of the &quot;storage properties&quot; (inductance L and capacity C) of the accumulating elements (inductor and capacitor), the natural frequency changes as well. We can easily realize by intuition that the bigger the value of the storage property is, the bigger the duration of the corresponding quarter period is (e.g., if the capacitor is &quot;bigger&quot;, the inductor needs more time to charge it).

'''Symmetry.''' But why the oscillation remains symmetrical (T&lt;sub&gt;Phase1&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;Phase2&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;Phase3&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;Phase4&lt;/sub&gt;), even if we change the value only of one storage property (the inductance L or the capacity C)? The answer is simple. During an every half of a period, each of the two elements changes two times its &quot;role&quot;: during the first quarter it acts as a load and during the second quarter it acts as a source. In this way, its storage property defines the duration of both the neighboring quarters; changing the property, we change simultaneously both the quarter durations. As a result, the curve remains symmetrical when we change either the inductance L or the capacity C or both of them.

=== Final conclusion === 

LC tank is the simplest electrical circuit that can generate oscillations with a perfect sinusoidal shape. This unique circuit consists only of two elements but it can do all that is needed to produce sinusoidal oscillations somewhat by itself. It is an almost ideal circuit that resemble a perpetual motion machine:) - we have only to inject initial energy and then it continues acting by itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this example, the SIMILE project's [http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/ Timeline] JavaScript is used to display the chronology of the albums released by a selected artist or group. As with the football teams in the previous example, the data is extracted from DBpedia via a SPARQL query.

This example has three components:
* an XQuery script which creates the HTML page, linking to the Timeline JavaScript
* an XQuery script to query DBpedia for albums for a selected group, assign a year of release to each album and generate a set of events in the form expected by the TimeLine script.
* an XQuery script to provide an index of groups in a given category

== HTML Page script ==

The script accepts one parameter, the name of the artist or group.  The JavaScript required to customize the Timeline is defined in-line in a CDATA section. The onLoad function accepts two parameters, the name of the artist and a date to provide the initial focus for the timeline. The event stream is provided by the call to the XQuery script group2tl.xq, passing the group name.

The JavaScript interface here is minimal.

  theme.event.label.width = 400; // px
  theme.event.bubble.width = 300;
  theme.event.bubble.height = 300;

  var eventSource1 = new Timeline.DefaultEventSource();

  var bandInfo = [
    Timeline.createBandInfo({

    }),

  ];
  Timeline.create(document.getElementById(&quot;my-timeline&quot;), bandInfo);
  Timeline.loadXML(&quot;group2tl.xq?group=&quot;+group, function(xml, url) { eventSource1.loadXML(xml, url); });

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


&lt;/pre&gt;

== TimeLine events  group2tl.xq ==

This script has a similar structure to the football team script. A prototype SPARQL query is edited to change the default name to the supplied name, the query sent to the DBpedia SPARQL service and the resultant SPARQL  XML result converted to XML tuples.  

Note - the group name needs an additional encoding because SPARQL requires URIs to be uri encoded and group names may contain characters such as ( and ) which require encoding.  Hence Queen_(band) must appear in the URI in SPARQL as Queen_%28band%29. In addition the whole query is uri encoded which allows this encoding to be recovered when the whole query is decoded by the SPARQL service. (Whew!) 

As with the Football clubs, there may be multiple tuples for the same album and the best (at present just the first non null) set of data needs to be extracted from these tuples.  The year of release is hacked out of the multitude of different date formats which may appear and  each album represented in the format expected by Timeline, with the pop-up contents serialised.

[[Image:Source_Four_ERS.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Source Four ERS with a warm gel]]
An '''Ellipsoidal reflector spotlight''' or '''Profile Spotlight''' (abbreviated to ''Ellipsiodal'' or ''ERS'') is a light with a strong, well defined beam, and is very versatile. Leko and Source Four are two of the most common brand names of these lights.

Commonly the light includes:
*A gel holder
*A gobo holder
*Several shutters to shape the beam.
*An adjustable barrel, allowing a lighting designer to change the size and focus of the light thrown by the unit by changing the distance between the mirror and the smooth, plano-convex lens or lenses

[[Image:Leko.JPG|thumb|240px|left|A Leko ERS]]

There are several advantages of the ERS that make it one of the most common lights in a theatre. Its Ellipsoidal lens means only a 500w or 750w bulb is needed, instead of a 1000w bulb, while retaining the same brightness. Some ERSes, notably the Source Four, also include a dichroic reflector, so the beam is much cooler than other lights. Dichroic reflectors only reflect light from the visible spectrum, allowing infrared (''heat'') radiation to pass out the back of the light. This prolongs the life of gels and gobos.

Ellipsoidals can have either a fixed field angle, normally from 5° to 50°, or a variable field angle, commonly called a &quot;Zoom&quot;. ETC, who manufacture the Source 4, produce a variety of attachments, commonly called &quot;barrels&quot;, to change the field angle of the Source 4.

==Uses==
Ellipsoidals can be used for colour washes, with an attachment to change the field angle, but this job is better suited to PAR cans, Fresnels and Floodlights. Ellipsoidals are good for gobo projection, and highlighting actors or scenery on stage. They can also be used to god-spot actors by placing them at a sharp (5° - 10°) angle. This gives the effect of divine intervention, or, if used with a green gel, alien abduction.

== A dedication ==

''I dedicate this incredible story to my former student [mailto:Kirillgenev@abv.bg Cyril] who has inspired me to start the series of stories about this great (circuit) phenomenon.''

The story that I have told here is the most incredible happening in my teacher's life. I have been teaching circuitry for more than 20 years. I have been having good,  responsive, clever, curious, capable and even talented students that have been helping and inspiring me in my pursuit of revealing the truth about circuits through these years. But, as a rule, my best students loose interest in the subject after passing the examination. I have been receiving sporadically emails from some of them at that when they need some help.

That's why, imagine how much I was amazed when Cyril whom I was teaching basic circuitry two years ago, came on one of my consultation hours and showed willingness for discussing circuit phenomena. In the beginning, I supposed that Cyril has just to pass some examination or he has failed to take an examination or he has to make a project... But imagine how much I was amazed when I knew that Cyril wanted just to understand circuits! He brought out a few textbooks, showed to me obscure circuit diagrams of various oscillators and told me that he had not understood anything from these explanations. He just wanted to know why, when and how oscillations arise, where currents flow, why the inductor and capacitor of an LC tank discharge completely, what make energy circulate between the two components of the LC circuit, what transistors and op-amps do in oscillating circuits, how an RC oscillator oscillates although it does not actually contain any oscillating circuit, etc. Then I started reading the vague texts and, as a result, I realized that I also do not understand them. I knew but I didn't realize the basic ideas behind these great phenomena.

It happened half a month ago; since that time I have no peace. I stopped writing temporarily the introductory methodological stories of [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] and began thinking about oscillation phenomena. During my consultation hours Cyril and I discuss these famous circuits. Usually, our &quot;brainstorming sessions&quot; last two hours. I record them on a solid-state recorder; then I write down them on a paper and finally I use the valuable thoughts in creating circuit stories. So, I would like to dedicate this exciting introductory story about the philosophy of oscillations in this world to Cyril who has inspired me to start and then to keep this series of stories.

== In the beginning ==

Will you believe me how difficult it was for me to start this page? How do I begin writing a new story about something so simple, old, and legendary? Because it is easy to explain complex things in this world but it is so difficult to explain the simplest things. Everybody knows how an LC tank operates in terms of electricity and nobody understands why it operates just in this way. Thousands of writers have explained the concrete electrical LC circuit in thousands of sources down the years. Don't you think it's time finally to extract the general idea from the bare 2-component circuit, to reveal the philosophy behind it?

=== The challenge ===

I realize that it is a great challenge to begin writing a story about such a great phenomenon and to pretend to say something new about the topic. Those who venture to start such an adventure have to be prepared for bearing (mostly negative) reactions of others. People do not like someone to express own new ideas about old things even, if they are more than obvious. This upsets their mental equilibrium and they react to this &quot;intervention&quot; trying to redress the balance. Contrary, people adopt willingly, use and benefit from nobody's, conventional, approved and &quot;reputable&quot; ideas. I have known this truth from my experience since I have been bearing the (negative) reactions of people around me through my life...

But, in spite of all, I begin writing this incredible story about the great, not only an electrical but in the first place, a worldly phenomenon. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 10:18, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

=== Succession problems ===

Maybe, the main problem of this page is that it is based on a few preceding pages, which are not yet written. These pages are dedicated to the behavior of accumulating elements (capacitors and inductors) and to relaxation oscillations; they are included in the contents:

&lt;center&gt;'''Stories about capacitor's behavior:'''&lt;/center&gt;

[[Circuit Idea/Is a Capacitor a Voltage Source?|Is a Capacitor a Voltage Source?]] (comparison with a &quot;real&quot; voltage source)&lt;br&gt;
[[Circuit Idea/Making a Capacitor Integrate|Making a Capacitor Integrate]] (building a resistive-capacitive integrator)&lt;br&gt;
[[Circuit Idea/Making a Capacitor Differentiate|Making a Capacitor Differentiate]] (building an &quot;incorrect&quot; capacitive and a &quot;correct&quot; capacitive-resistive differentiator)&lt;br&gt;
[[Circuit Idea/Discharging a Capacitor through a Capacitor|Discharging a Capacitor through a Capacitor]] (transferring instantly energy between voltage &quot;sources&quot;)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Stories about inductor's behavior:'''&lt;/center&gt;

[[Circuit Idea/Is an Inductor a Current Source?|Is an Inductor a Current Source?]] (comparison with a &quot;real&quot; current source)&lt;br&gt;

[[Circuit Idea/Discharging an Inductor through an Inductor|Discharging an Inductor through an Inductor]] (a conflict between &quot;incorrect&quot; connected current sources)

&lt;center&gt;'''Stories about relaxation oscillations:'''&lt;/center&gt;

[[Circuit Idea/How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle|How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle]] (creating a philosophy of the relaxation oscillator by comparing with the LC one)

Of course, it would be better to write first these simpler pages before to start the more complex page about LC tank. But what do I do when I was so eager to reveal the secret of the legendary LC tank? I have been longing for that for years; so, I have yielded to temptation:)  That's why I have decided to start this page and, in order to compensate the absence of the pages above, to insert explanatory texts about capacitor's and inductor's behavior where it is needed. Later, when we write the missing pages, we might move or copy these texts to the appropriate places.

=== What the talk page to contain ===

I suggest to shape this talk page as a second, enlarged and more colorful written version of the main page that to serve as a counterpart of the basic story. Here we - wikibookeans, ''circuit ideators'', ''circuit philosophers'' and just curious visitors, might discuss more freely the subject. In the discussion page, we will comment what and how to say while in the main page we will just say it.

Frankly speaking, I have the feeling that the discussion page will become more interesting than the main one. That's why, I am divided in my decision of what to develop; this evening I decided to enrich the talk page with some wisdom:) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 19:36, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

== What the secret of LC oscillations is ==

Maybe, we have first to say here ''what the truth about LC oscillation is'' and then to discuss [[#How to reveal the truth about LC oscillations|how to present this wisdom to visitors]] (these are different things). Well, let's begin with the first.

=== The initial point: ''A steady quantity'' ===

At the starting point we need a steady quantity. Where to get it from? As usual in this world, we need energy to create a quantity. We can get this energy from some power source. So, the first thing what we need (in this world) is a power source.

=== The problem: ''How to make it oscillate?'' ===

Then, we ask yourself, &quot;How do we make the steady quantity oscillate?&quot; But what does mean &quot;to oscillate&quot;? Simply speaking, to oscillate means just to make the quantity increase and decrease consecutively and regularly. How do we do this magic?

=== Preparing a steady quantity to be changed ===

It seems it's too difficult to make the very power source oscillate (power sources keep up constant their output quantities). Then, what do we do? We can act like in many situations of routine: instead to change the whole source energy we get some amount of energy from the source and store it in some &quot;place&quot; with the purpose to change it. As there are two kinds of energy - kinetic and potential, we can store energy in two kinds of energy accumulators (integrators). Let's do it; we have got the initial steady quantity. Examples: if we have stored a kinetic energy in an inductor, we obtain a constant current; if we have stored a potential energy in a capacitor, we obtain a constant voltage.

=== Changing the accumulated quantity ===

Now, we can begin doing the &quot;veritable work&quot; - to increase and decrase the steady quantity, in order to make it oscillate. How can we make it increase? Of course, by adding continuosly energy to the accumulator. And how can we make it decrease? Contrary, by subtracting continuosly energy from the accumulator. In both the cases we move, transport, transfer energy from one place to other - from the source to the accumulator and v.v.

==== Relaxation oscillations ====

''(...We might explain what an LC oscillation is, if we say what it is not. Here, we might say that an LC oscillation is not a '''relaxation''' one. Only, we would explain what a &quot;relaxation oscillation&quot; is. This phenomenon is no less vague and mystic than the LC phenomenon (I have never met good resources about it). Now, we have opportunity to reveal the secret behind relaxation phenomenon by comparing it with LC one. After that, we may move these thoughts to the future [[Circuit Idea/How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle|story]] about relaxation oscillations...)''

[[Image:Relaxation_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt; A relaxation oscillator has only one accumulating element; the energy moves only in one direction.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The basic idea.''' According to the powerful idea [[#Changing the accumulated quantity|above]], we might first build the simpler and more intuitive ''relaxation oscillator'' by using three elements: a flow (current) source, an accumulator of potential energy (a capacitor) and a load (a resistor). Such an arrangement operates in two stages as follows: in the first stage, we connect the current source to the accumulator and begin charging it; in the second stage, we connect the accumulator to the load (turn on the switch SW) and discharge it. Let's repeat it in other words: in a period of a relaxation oscillation, we first draw a kind of energy (usually, potential) from the flow source to fill the accumulator, then &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator and just &quot;throw out&quot; it to the environment. Thus, in the first stage of every period the source has to restore the energy in the accumulator.

'''Features.''' Note that the relaxation arrangement needs only one accumulator. It lies on the way of energy and serves as a buffer that interrupts temporarily the flow (only, the average flow remains constant). In this way, it intermits, tears to &quot;pieces&quot; the energy flow. It is interesting fact that a continuous current enters the accumulator while an intermittent current leaves it; so, we might say that a relaxation oscillator &quot;discretisizes&quot;, &quot;portens&quot;, &quot;doses&quot; the unceasing input flow of energy. At the same time, the accumulator's contents increases and decreases periodically. The shape of the curve is not sinusoidal because at the points of switching (at the peaks) the &quot;flow-creating&quot; quantity has a maximum magnitude. Note also that increase and decrease can have different durations. Examples of this possibility (see the analogies below) are a photoflash (slow charging, fast discharging), a toilet tank, a husband that fills slowly and continuously a family money deposit while his wife empties rapidly and regularly it:)

'''What does &quot;relaxation oscillation&quot; mean?''' I have been asking myself many times what the word &quot;relaxation&quot; means in this context. What does &quot;relax&quot; here? Maybe, the capacitor? If yes, when does the capacitor relax? Maybe, when we charge it (in this case, &quot;relaxation&quot; would mean restoring, retrieving, recreating the content of the accumulating element). Or maybe, the capacitor relaxes (returns to its initial &quot;zero energy&quot; state of equilibrium) when we discharge it...

'''Relaxation analogies.''' We can see many manifestations of this phenomenon in nature, routine, engineering and finally, in electronics. For example, I have a remembrance from my childhood how sometimes faulty toilet tanks began working intermittently (filling -&gt; emptying -&gt; filling -&gt; emptying... up to infinity:) Similarly, imagine you were foolish enough to make a common money deposit with your wife:) Then, you begin working hard to feed up continuously the deposit. As a result, the amount of money increases continuously through time. Only, at some point your wife decides that's enough and draw out all the money accumulated. You begin working again... and she empties the deposit again... and this repeats again... and again... and again...:) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 20:06, 18 January 2008 (UTC)

==== LC oscillations ====

[[Image:LC_oscillator_1000.jpg|right|thumb|550px|&lt;center&gt;An LC oscillator has two accumulating elements; the energy circulates between them.&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The basic idea.''' Contrary, in order to create an ideal LC oscillation (assume an LC tank without losses), we charge the accumulator only once in the beginning (by turning on the switch SW in the figure on the right). Then, we &quot;suck dry&quot; the energy from the accumulator but do not &quot;throw it away&quot;; instead, we convert it into an opposite kind (''kinetic to potential'' or ''potential to kinetic'') and store the converted energy in another accumulator. We move, transfer, convey the energy from the one accumulator to the other. After, we use this energy to restore the energy of the first accumulator instead to &quot;suck&quot; energy from the source (we move back the energy). By the way, maybe is more correctly to say &quot;energy moves&quot; rather than &quot;we move the energy&quot;. But why the energy moves by itself? What makes it move? What makes it move to and fro without end? Don't you think there is something mystic in this endless &quot;ping-pong&quot; movement?

'''Implementation.''' For this purpose, the LC arrangement consists of two heterogenious (regarding to the two kinds of energy) accumulating elements. Each of them can either provide energy (when it serves as a source) or store the energy (when it serves as a load). When acts as a source, it is a weakening, depleting, exhausting source because the other (accumulating) element &quot;sucks out&quot; the source's energy. The energy moves from the source to the accumulator and the source's output quantity decreases.

==== Relaxation versus LC oscillations ====

===== Similarities =====

#Both the oscillating circuits contain (at least one) accumulating element that acts either as a source or as an integrator.

===== Differences =====

#A relaxation oscillator consists of only one accumulating element while an LC oscillator consists of two accumulating elements.
#The relaxation accumulator is either ''flow'' or ''pressure'' like; the LC accumulators are heterogenious (the one is ''flow-like'' and the other is ''pressure-like'').
#A relaxation oscillator stores only one kind of energy (usually potential) in the accumulator while an LC oscillator stores two opposite kinds of energy (''kinetic'' and ''potential'') in the two accumulators.
#In a relaxation oscillator we &quot;throw away&quot; the energy while in an LC oscillator we treasure it temporarily in an additional accumulator with the purpose of future usage. That's why, LC oscillators are more economical than relaxation ones.
#Resonance phenomenon does not exist in a relaxation circuit; it can be observed only in an LC tank.
#In a relaxation oscillator the energy moves only in one direction (source -&gt; accumulator -&gt; load) while in an LC oscillator the energy changes periodically its direction (it circulates between the two elements).
#The shape of a relaxation oscillation is peaked, angular while the shape of an LC oscillation is rounded (sinusoidal). The reason of that is that at the peaks the source of a relaxation oscillator changes its output quantity with the maximum magnitude while the &quot;source&quot; of an LC oscillator (charged accumulator) does not change its output quantity.
#The shape of the relaxation oscillation can be asymmetrical (the increase and the decrease can have different durations) while the shape of the LC oscillation is precisely symmetrical.

== How to reveal the truth about LC oscillations ==

If we assume that we have already revealed the secret of LC oscillations, now we have to decide how to present this wisdom to visitors (one thing is to understand somethning but the other thing is to explain it in the most credible, interesting and attractive way). For this purpose, we have to create a &quot;scenario&quot; of this story.

== Starting and maintaining oscillation ==

In every kind of oscillator (including LC and relaxation oscillators), there must be at least 2 different components that &quot;remember&quot; 2 &quot;instantaneous values&quot;: at any point in the oscillaton, there has to be at least the output voltage value, and also something else that remembers if we are going &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;.
:It sounds very philosophical. I need time to assimilate this wisdom:) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 08:57, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

Since resistors can instantaneously change current (when voltage is instantaneously changed), they are useless for &quot;remembering&quot;.
:I like this thought; I have inserted it into the [[Circuit Idea/How do We Create Sinusoidal Oscillations?#Making a quantity depend on time|story]]. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 08:57, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

Components that can be used for remembering:
* capacitors
* inductors
* positive-feedback amplifiers (flip-flops, [[w:Schmitt trigger]] inverters, etc.)


:David, I have finally finished this incredible story about LC oscillations and now I can reply with pleasure to your assertion. It sounds very fresh and original; as I can see, it is  a sort of &quot;informational viewpoint&quot; at the topic about oscillators. IMO, it fits very well relaxation oscillators but it is not so suitable for explaining LC oscillators (regarding to RC oscillators, they are wrapped in mystery). An &quot;energetical viewpoint&quot; would fit LC oscillators quite better than the &quot;energetical one&quot;. So, I suggest including this assertion into the [[Circuit Idea/How to Make the Voltage across a Capacitor Wiggle|page about relaxation oscillations]]. Well, let's exchange some thoughts about the topic.

:#First at all, it goes without saying that any oscillator has to contain a ''&quot;remembering element&quot;'', which represents the current state of the oscillator and which continuously changes its contents. From this viewpoint, we can think of an oscillator as a sequential circuit - e.g., a counter that increments or decrements continuously its contents (a &quot;digital analogy&quot;). Oscillators discussed here are analog devices; so, their &quot;remembering elements&quot; are analog as well. The capacitor is the simplest analog memory cell (as far as I know, the John Atanasoff's computer was based on a capacitor memory).
:#Then, we need an ''input source'' that charges gradually through time the memory element. In a case of a capacitor memory, we need a ''current source''.
:#After, we need a comparator that compares the current magnitude with the maximum (if we are moving up) or minimum one (if we are moving down). For this purpose, we may use either two separate ''comparators'' or a comparator with hysteresis (the so called [[w:Schmitt trigger|Schmitt trigger]]).
:#Finally, as you have said, we need a second memory element that &quot;remembers&quot; the comparator's condition (a comparator with hysteresis serves both as a ''comparing'' and a ''&quot;remembering&quot;'' element). Only, this element is a digital (discrete) memory that &quot;remembers&quot;  only one bit.

:Following the &quot;scenario&quot; above we will actually build a relaxation oscillator that will produce a triangle-shaped oscillation. If we try to apply this procedure to an LC oscillator, IMO we will obtain quite artificial and unnatural explanation. In an LC oscillator, we obtain &quot;remembering&quot;, ''comparing'' and even &quot;rounding&quot; somewhat by itself. IMO, we have to look at LC oscillator rather from an &quot;energetical viewpoint&quot; than from this &quot;informational viewpoint&quot;.

:[[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:13, 31 January 2008 (UTC)


In a real LC oscillator, there also is ''something else'' that regulates how energy from the power supply is fed into the rest of the circuit -- it &quot;pushes&quot; the rest of the circuit.

Some people use a complicated circuit (op amps, PTR resistors, etc.) that very gently puts in just enough energy to compensate for the parasitic resistance of the LC, making as &quot;pure&quot; a sine wave as possible.
There are a variety of less complicated circuits that are perhaps easier to understand, but generate a waveform that is more distorted from the &quot;ideal&quot; sine wave.

Would it help or make things more confusing to discuss an example &quot;pusher&quot; circuit?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 22:51, 18 January 2008 (UTC)

:David, you have actually started the discussion about [[Talk:Circuit Idea/How to Help an LC Tank|sustaining oscillation in an LC tank]] (&quot;pushing&quot; energy into an LC tank). I have started the [[Talk:Circuit Idea/How to Help an LC Tank|talk page]] of this story and copied this discussion there. I suggest to continue discussing about &quot;pushing&quot; circuits on the new talk page.

# Because &lt;code&gt;show x&lt;/code&gt; needs to evaluate &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to convert it to a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;.
# &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is stricter: it must walk through the whole list to discover its length, even if it does not need to examine the single values.

Instead, to evaluate &lt;code&gt;length [head x]&lt;/code&gt;, when &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; evaluates the passed list it obtains &lt;code&gt;thunk_0:[]&lt;/code&gt;, where thunk_0 represents the result of &lt;code&gt;head x&lt;/code&gt;.
Thus, you can verify that &lt;code&gt;f undefined =&gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; (actually, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;const 1&lt;/code&gt;) while &lt;code&gt;g undefined&lt;/code&gt; fails.
Also note that, if &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; is a valid &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; list (which does not contain &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; among its elements), all following expressions fail to evaluate:
 g (1:undefined) =&gt; length undefined =&gt; undefined

whereas the following evaluate successfully:
 g (1:undefined:ls) =&gt; length (undefined:ls) =&gt; 1 + length ls
 g (undefined:ls) =&gt; length ls

The difference between &lt;code&gt;g (1:undefined)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g (1:undefined:ls)&lt;/code&gt;may appear confusing, but is correct, because in the first case &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; replaces a list (in particular, the tail of the cons cell passed to &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;), while in the second case &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; replaces a list value (which is not needed).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Floodlights''' are basic theatrical lighting instruments, consisting of primarily of a reflector box and a lamp, usually attached to a yoke to allow the instrument to be hung. They are often used in the theater for color washes, or left uncolored for use as work lights. They offer practically no control of the beam or focus. Gels placed over a floodlight tend to fade quickly because floodlights generate a great deal of heat. However, floodlights tend to be among the least expensive lighting instruments due to their simple construction and few complicated parts.

== Enumerated Section headings? ==

When a table of contents is automatically generated for a page with multiple sections, each section is enumerated in the TOC. Is there any way to have that enumeration automatically generated at the actual location of the section heading?

This would  both help disambiguate the section's level within the page and provide some feedback that the reader has reached the correct section in the page.

...[[User:Selden|Selden]] 13:06, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

:I don't think so. If you could, I do believe that that and the normal enumerating will occur. [[User:Qwerty Binary|Qwerty Binary]] 13:59, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

:: There IS a way to have it show up automatically on the headers when ''you'' are logged in (it's in the preferences under &quot;misc --&gt; auto-number headings&quot;, but I'm pretty sure there is no way to do it automatically and make it so it appears that way to ''everyone''.

I understand wikibooks is primarily for educational purposes when it comes to books; discussion, outlines etc. I was uploading book covers on Commons of books from my Small Press publishing company and found Commons supported Adobe PDF format. I am adding my full text books in pdf on the Commons page for my publishing company HMS Press. I was wondering if Wikibooks will have a section for just books, ones that the public can download the pdf files and read? Guttenburg Project comes to mind but they are in text (TXT) format. PDF is not editable. Is there room for fiction and poetry n here? Thanks [[User:WayneRay|WayneRay]] 12:14, 27 November 2007 (UTC)WayneRay

:This page [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Books_with_print_version Category:Books with print version] kinda does serve that function, but our main goad is to enable participation and contribution of content so probably some work could be put into the distribution/accessibility aspect...
:As for the fiction and poetry for the moment they are out of our scope, but you are free to defend and provide valid arguments for it on the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]] policy proposal, your participation is welcomed.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 14:52, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

:First off, I have to wonder whether the PDFs that you uploaded to commons are going to remain there. Commons doesn't typically host PDF files, especially not files of books. These files, by the way, are they released under the GFDL, or a similar free license? Are these PDFs of books that have been published? If these are books that are being donated under a free license, we could work on a way to transform them into Wikitext, and upload that text here on wikibooks. We do not host lone PDF files of books, we only host PDF versions of wikitext books. If you are willing to have your books translated into Wikitext, we would be happy to accept them as a donation. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:46, 27 November 2007 (UTC)
::I do have text copies of the published books and I released the two files under PD, I will have to re-read GFDL and other licenses. I don't know wikitext, is that where anyone can edit as in Wikipedia. PS there are 9378 pdf files in Commons [[User:WayneRay|WayneRay]] 16:21, 29 November 2007 (UTC)WayneRay

:From a historical viewpoint I'd like to mention that the topic of fiction has been brought up before here on Wikibooks, and there were some strong (at the time) defenders of allowing at least an educational book oriented fiction that served specific educational goals.  Think here something along the lines of the Dick and Jane readers from a couple of decades ago, and more specific to Wikibooks there was a project called &quot;Aardvard the Aardvark&quot;.  It really was a wonderful book, and there even were some awesome illustrations added by some of the participants that would have made this an excellent juvenile reader (and fit within the basic textbook scope of Wikibooks).  The real problem with books of this nature is that there is no real means to resolve an edit dispute when you have two different people trying to take content into different directions, as there is nothing to verify or point to from an objective perspective.  This is also the problem with original research... even if the results are reproducible.  We had a chemical laboratory that added some of their lab notes to Wikibooks a while back, with the intention to make them available under the GFDL.  Both of these were excellent ideas, but they also make it very difficult to work in a collaborative manner.
:BTW, a sure sign that something is original research is when you go through and make major changes to a page that you didn't write in the first place, when the original author starts to strongly complain and keeps &quot;reverting&quot; the text back to the original version.  This is a common wiki phenomena (also known as an [[w:Wikipedia:Edit War|Edit War]]).  Policies such as a neutral point of view and no original research were established to try and calm down these type of editorial disputes, and allowing an appeal to an outside source to confirm or exclude a certain piece of information that was added to Wikibooks.  This was something that was originally a part of Wikipedia, and Wikibooks inherited this general philosophy due to the close ties this project has with Wikipedia.
:I don't want you to think we don't have fiction here because of some strong-arm political move on the part of a few participants here on Wikibooks, but rather understand the context for why the general prohibition of fiction has evolved over the years of working on books with this project.  I wouldn't say that the door is completely shut on the topic, but some very compelling reasons for adding this kind of material to this project would have to be made, and it would be a major policy change for this project.  Adding fiction or poetry opens up a whole bunch of potential problems that most people involved with this project don't want to deal with them. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:06, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

== GFDL and CC-BY-SA license harmonization ==

For anybody who doesnt read foundation-l, and hasn't been a part of all the conversation lately, there is a bit of an important announcement. For a while now, the WMF, FSF and CC people have been in talks to try to find a way to harmonize the GFDL and CC-BY-SA licenses. The idea being that these two licenses are very common on WMF projects, and they accomplish the same general goals. Well, there is news that a deal has been struck, and future versions of the GFDL are going to be compatible with CC-BY-SA (probably 3.0 or later). Here is a blog post about it:

http://blog.jamendo.com/index.php/2007/12/01/breaking-news-wikipedia-switches-to-creative-commons/

What does this mean for wikibooks? First off, authors who want to cross-license their books no longer need to worry about that. License compatibility means that the two licenses can be used interchangably. That's the most important thing, there may be additional affects as well. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:46, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

::I'm not in on the full details of CC-BY-SA, so I guess I'm going to have a &quot;crash course&quot; on the topic.  I am worried that quite a bit has been given up on the part of the Free Software Foundation in terms of general goals of the GFDL to achieve this end.  There certainly is a substantial faction within the Wikimedia community that thinks it was an awful decision to use the GFDL in the first place, and that Creative Commons has a much better set of licenses than anything the Free Software Foundation could come up with.
::BTW, if you use a CC license for some of your content... still be careful about dual licensing.  Not all (read *most* are not) CC licenses are interchangeable.  There still may be a need for dual-licensing in some situations if you work with people who insist upon using CC licenses... even with this change.
::For those interested, you might want to also look at the slashdot thread on this topic.  It is rather enlightening (and no, I didn't start it):  http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/01/2032252  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:18, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

:::If you consider that the prime goal is the free distribution of information, the ideology of any particular license is really not important. That said, I dont think giving up any of the &quot;general goals of the GFDL&quot; is a big deal, because the license was never important: the freeness of the content was. Now, I think there certainly are people who are adherents of the politics of the FSF and the specific language of the GFDL, and those people are likely to be feeling a little upset about all these changes (a few have been voiced on foundation-l already). I think the important aspect of this for us (with &quot;us&quot; being en.wikibookians) is that the concerns we have about cross-licensing books disappear, or are diminished significantly. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:30, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

== Please Help Me Get Started on Our Class Book ==

I am a professor at the University of Northern Iowa.
My students want to create a wikibook on Emerging Instructional Technology.

I have already added our project to the &quot;Wikibook:List of class projects.&quot;

I am having problems getting started.  I get to the blank editing box at the bottom of the I want to use a template of a previous book for our book.  How do I get that template copied to our page?

The intro materials say to find a model book.  I like the one entitled European History.  I like the idea of having the table of contents on the first page and then linking to separate pages for each of the chapters.

I need someone to talk with about this.  Can you please contact me?
You can send me a note through Wikibooks, but I would much rather 
**receive an email [mailto:zeitz@uni.edu zeitz@uni.edu] or

== Question on screen shots copyrights ==

Another stupid question... I was trying to analyse the exact status of some books and I ran into a series of copyright notices on a [[User_talk:Gfocaraccio|user page]] related to a new guide to Microsoft Project. Should I understand from those notices that having screen shots of a commercial software product is illegal in wikibooks, I tried to understand the copyright pages but could not get a specific answer. If screen shots are illegal I understand that any book like &quot;Quick Guide to Excel&quot; or &quot;How to use Photoshop&quot; would not make much sense in wikibooks context, right? --[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]] 04:39, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

:HA! it looks like mike really went to town on that guy's userpage! The problem here at Wikibooks it that images come from a lot of different places, and are copyrighted under a wide variety of different copyright licenses. It's important that we know what the particular licensing arrangement is for every single image here on Wikibooks. In short, it is acceptable to have screenshots of copyrighted programs on Wikibooks. For this, we use a special &quot;Fair Use&quot; license. When uploading an image, there will be a drop-box that contains the various licenses that you can use for the image. Scroll down to the bottom where it says &quot;Proprietary software screenshots&quot;: this is the license to use for these types of images. The items on [[User talk:Gfocaraccio]] were a problem because they weren't properly labeled with the license, not because they were screenshots of proprietary software.
:I hope this answers your question, and you are right that there isn't a lot of explanatory material about images, copyrights, and licenses to be found around here. I'll draft up some stuff on this topic, in hopes that it will be helpful. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:47, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

Is the following license permitted? I'd like to use the documentation supplied to seed a new book on postgresql.

:That's a tricky question, and I am inclined to say that this license would not be permitted. I say this because it is ''viral'': it requires all future versions to be released under that license. Wikibooks is GFDL, and we cna't require our contributors to also release their work and contributions under an additional license. I may be wrong about this, however. I think the best course of action would be to contact the distributors of this documentation, and ask them if they would consider offering a license for Wikibooks to release that documentation under the GFDL. As part of that license agreement, it would be possible for us to include a note about where the material came from originally, this preserving the chain of attribution. If people have questions, you can point them to [[WB:DONATE]], because that page answers many questions related to this issue. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:48, 12 November 2007 (UTC)
::I'd say &quot;no&quot; as well. It does seem likely that the copyright holders could be convinced to license it under the GFDL though. The GFDL does require attribution, so they shouldn't really be able to complain about that. The &quot;viral&quot; aspect that WK mentioned is the only sticking point I can see. If they'll let that slide, then it becomes GFDL-compatible. You should ask them for permission to release it as GFDL; if not, then I don't think it can have a home here. Hope that helps.

:::One thing to keep in mind is that you can read that documentation, and then write about it from memory, like you would cite a source in a school paper. You can use it as a resource, but you can't copy it without proper citations, that is unless you get permission.

::It is a shame. Since it's such an insignificant requirement though, they may be amenable to dropping that requirement and GFDL-licensing the content.

[[User:EvanCarroll|EvanCarroll]] 17:01, 14 November 2007 (UTC)
::::Yes, third-party contributions do raise problems. You'd have to go back to the original, get permission from whoever owns the rights, and update from there.

:::::Not quite, I'm not 100% sure that is how at works. I say that because I realize the license isn't viral, so it might be safe to assume the work that occurs within the book is in public domain with that following exception; ie, treat the license as if it was viral, unless otherwise noted, even though it isn't explicitly so. It would seem to fall under ''good-faith'' anyway. You can't possible track down the hundreds of people that have donated doc-patches to postgresql.

== [[C++ Programming]] ==

I got a complaint about this page today, and I have to say that I agree with the complaint 100%. Some history: There are basically two competing TOCs for the C++ book, and a third TOC that is designed for editors (not readers). These two TOCs are championed, respectively, by [[User:Panic2k4]] and [[User:Darklama]]. I put links on this page, and protected it from editing several months ago in response to an edit war between these two (and some other accounts which I suspected to be sock-puppets, but did not investigate). I told the involved parties to discuss the issue on the relevant talk page, and the conclusion that they came up with was to keep the page the way it is now. Frankly, I find this to be an unacceptable fate for one of the most popular pages on our site (based on the wikicharts page hit count). Because the people involved can't come up with a solution themselves, I want to get the community's input on the issue. Here are some ideas:

#We could merge the page (not the book) [[C++ Programming]] with the page [[C++]]. The second page is a much more aesthetic disambiguation-style page that could easily be expanded to include the two competing TOCs for the book.
#We fork the C++ book into two books, one for each TOC. I think that this sets a bad precedent, and I also have a fear that issues of editorial control would become rampant in at least one of the forks. Plus, if we allow this book to be forked (and by extension, any book) whenever there is a dispute between authors, we've basically nullified the idea of &quot;collaboration&quot;, and we've given a free license to authors to become uncompromising tyrants over their own book: After all, they can always fork if somebody disagrees.
#We, as a community can select one of the two competing TOCs, and forcibly &quot;implement&quot; it. I think we all can agree that this is a lousy option because we rarely like to exercise top-down control over individual pages or books. However, the previous discussion was about trying to chose one TOC or the other, and we can consider this discussion to be an extension of that previous discussion, and find a solution that eluded the authors previously.
#We try to force a merger between the two TOCs. This can be as problematic as option #3, and for the same reasons. But then again, we can side-step the idea of trying to maintain two competing TOCs, and we also mitigate fears of a fork.

I would like to get some opinions on this from various community members. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:50, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

:My suggestion is to merge [[C++]] with the page [[C++ Programming]] and make the three TOCs as sub-bullets of the C++ programming book and tag the merged page as protected and get rid of [[C++]] page. That way we don't lose any information. The [[C++]] page is anyways quite stable. The merged page should have the same title as [[C++ Programming]] as it is one of the most popular pages on wikibooks. Top level navigation pages to reach these books should be aesthetic to build up confidence among the readers. Lastly, [[Programming languages bookshelf]] page needs to change in some places after that. ---- [[User:Sutambe|Sutambe]] 20:54, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

:I wouldn't mind the merge of the C++ page with the C++ Programming page (If I got it right [[User:Sutambe]] problem is of visibility) if that meant the C++ Programming Book would be renamed/restored to the old name. (I remind everyone that the actual book title was an imposition after the merge, and not selected by the contributors (book community), the rational to defend the actual title was more or less the problem with the  external link number to the page), at that time the C++ Programming was going to be the made the only work on C++ (results of the creation of the proposal for the fork policy and enforcement of it).
:I also get complains about the book title page since I do promote the book (but wouldn't mind it being renamed), I took upon myself to seek references for the C++ Programming as THE C++ WIKIBOOK and correcting them (ie Wikipedia C++ page) so to diminish the problem [[User:Sutambe]] raises.
:For the actual TOC problem there seems not to be any conclusion to the discussion, that is consensus for the alteration made was not archived. The main problem being that any use of multiple TOCs would (does) break the navigation of the book (the Editor's TOC was not included on the dispute as it doesn't cause problems and was not attempting to take the place of another already existing TOC).  
:The fork solution was partially taken [[User:Darklama]] did create another C++ Book, with a different scope and different audience as is shown on the C++ page, as for the actual content on the TOC2 most of the differences are only on location not content and some pages were already contributed (moved) toward the new book.
:As for the proposal of a forced TOC there we would have a problem, Darklama original action was result of a &quot;misplaced&quot; BeBold action that was challenged (and even previously objected to)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:25, 25 November 2007 (UTC)
:Btw I take this change to call your attention to the excellent work [[User:Sutambe]] has been doing on the C++ book [[More C++ Idioms]], almost single handed. (The books is being translated into the JP Wikibooks also)
:&quot;A relaible, growing and useful collection of important C++ idioms. A must-know before one writes industrial-strength C++ code.&quot; AbhayB, Aug ‘07 (del.icio.us - one in many positive comments)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:46, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

::[[C++]] is basically a &quot;portal&quot; page that provides navigation to multiple books. Maybe we should make a [[Subject:C++]] page that contains all these links instead. Although a subject page would make a poor main page for a book. Maybe people need to basically keep [[C++ Programming]] as a start page with two TOC options, buy at least make it better looking then it is now. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:11, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

:::Yes it was a redirect, I transformed it into an aggregation/listing of the C++ books and corrected the information on the bookshelves and on several sites that pointed to the C++ Programming or Programming:C++ as a way to improve visibility of the other works...
:::For what I understand of [[User:Sutambe]] proposal, the problem is that there are still many links to the C++ Programming or redirect pages (probably hunting down all pages redirecting to C++ Programming or Programming:C++ on every Wikimedia project and fixing them to C++ would help), the proposal of the user and comment about the facts as they are only reflect this side (the state the actual C++ page is not useful, and the fact that merging C++ to it would help increase visitations to the other books, and I completely agree... (but to satisfy his merge request the book would have to be moved/renamed, idea that I did not object to)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:27, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

::::I'm not sure why renaming or moving of any book is required. I'm saying that the top level page (which is popular) should be dedicated to the broad world of C++ Programming and not to a specific book on C++ Programming. Having said that, there can/should be at least a book with a name &quot;C++ Programming&quot; (which we have). The reason is that, a google search for &quot;C++ Programming&quot; gives &quot;C++ Programming - Wikibooks, collection of open-content textbooks&quot; in the top 5 items. It naturally gives an impression of a collection of books. As of today, that page disappoints readers. I believe &quot;C++ Programming&quot; is a more intuitive search phrase than C++ alone, which is indicated by the hit rate of that not-so-useful [[C++ Programming]] page. The distinguishing factor of the two books with identical name is obviously the TOC, which I believe will be bookmarked when a reader has a preference among the two books. On the top level navigation page, we should call those two TOCs as Book1 and Book2, which in turn will take the reader to existing TOCs. I hope that will give an impression of two independent books on &quot;C++ Programming&quot; rather than two in conflict. As a result there will be 4 navigable books from the top page, which is exciting for a book collector. We can again make the [[C++]] page a redirect as it was earlier to preserve existing links to it. ---- [[User:Sutambe|Sutambe]] 18:22, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

::::::Renaming is equal to move, since the C++ Programming is(should be) the cover of the work (and not a list of other works), and needed as part the navigation scheme (as the root of the structure), in this case it should be the TOC as the book was formated like that from the start...
::::::The view that a list of other works shouldn't be on the cover/toc was made by some administrators for a while I add a listing of other programming books on top and bottom of the page (it was smaller at the time so visually/size wise it had a minor impact), I'm not partial of any solution and wouldn't mind an option shared by all books, we already have the category navigational there.
::::::Have you tried hunting down all mentions to C++ Programming and Programming:C++ and redirecting them to the C++ page, there must be still several other pages on Wikibooks alone and on other Wikimedia projects fixing that would probably influence the visibility of it even on Google.
::::::I would object making the C++ Page a redirect to C++ Programming (not the other way around), my logic for having selected that page to start the listing of all C++ works was the way Wikibooks and Wikipedia is structured (namespaces), and using any other page name would be almost (but not quite) as arbitrary.
::::::If you wish to press the point of the merge, select and extend one of the options and if indeed a merge/rename is needed post something on the C++ page and ask Whiteknight to tag the protected page to inform others of the pending change. On the C++ page most edits were done by me, you and Darklama (he didn't yet state any views on this) on the C++ Programming there are a couple of other active contributors, tagging and informing others of the change could set a time frame to have this resolved. I have already stated my views, I do comprehend and simpatize what your goal is (you can start by taking on that work of fixing redirects, I have not done an exhaustive cleanup, only some Wikibooks pages and the En. Wikipedia page if I remember correctly). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:57, 26 November 2007 (UTC)
:::::::Humm! Now I kind of see the whole situation but don't see any easy, cut and dried solution to it. Lets just add &quot;Category:C++ Programming&quot; and &quot;Category:C++&quot; on the [[C++ Programming]] page and keep it as is. ---- [[User:Sutambe|Sutambe]] 08:52, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

== Stuttering ==

I am a new user to Wikibooks, and have just travelled over from Wikipedia to alert you to concerns expressed over there about the Stuttering wikibook and its principal author. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Anti-stuttering_devices.2C_Stuttering]  and follow some of the links there for further details.  This wikibook, which is a featured one, has been largely written by [[User:Tdkehoe]] who is the owner/manufacturer of anti-stuttering devices made by Casa Futura Technologies, as he notes on his userpage. While much of the book is unproblematic from my perspective, there are issues with promotion of device use and in particular his products.  As a quick example of what is doing on, you might want to compare the chapter about his device,[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/Casa_Futura_Technologies] and that of his major competitor[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/SpeechEasy].
I note that his conflict of interest has been commented upon in 2006, though it does not appear that anything was done about it. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ATdkehoe&amp;diff=486100&amp;oldid=418144]. I am particularly concerned because these companies have a history of using media etc to promote extravagant claims of efficacy in the absence of solid evidence. See [http://www.rgj.com/news/stories/html/2004/01/26/62445.php] for a quick overview.  

Since I am a newbie here, I was not sure where the appropriate spot to post this was. Please forgive me if I have got it wrong and direct me accordingly. I would be glad to provide further information, if necessary.--[[User:Slp1a|Slp1a]] 13:53, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the heads-up! Wikibooks tends to have a far more relaxed attitude towards this, although it is still considered a problem (just not as big a problem). Certainly if a bias has been introduced into the book towards one product, we will need to correct that bias. However, Tdkehoe's involvement in a company that manufactures anti-stuttering devices doesn't necessarily make him unfit to be a book author, nor does it necessarily make the majority of his contributions on the topic suspect. 
:Of course, the article that you presented does raise the question about the efficacy of anti-stuttering devices in general, so that's something that maybe deserves some attention as well. I'll try to read over the book and see how much work would need to be done to bring it into NPOV compliance. I would suggest that other wikibookians do the same. Depending on how much work it would take (and how severe the problem is), the book could be un-featured, or it could even be deleted (although I doubt it would come to that). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:55, 2 December 2007 (UTC)
::Thanks very much.  I agree that Tdkehoe should be welcome to contribute his knowledge, and as I said, there is a fair amount of good material in the book.  I think it is right, however, that some other editors take a look and see what they think about the NPOV etc. I trust the task you have set yourself won't be too arduous! I'm afraid I have enough to do without embarking on this project myself, but let me know if you have any questions, or need resources etc. --[[User:Slp1a|Slp1a]] 20:03, 2 December 2007 (UTC)
:::I've sent the author a note (he has email disabled), and I am going to try and read through the stuttering book soon when I have more time to devote to it. Maybe a few other wikibookians would volunteer to give it a quick once-over to find any obvious trouble spots? many eyes make light work. We can remove any problems that we find, and ask this user (and any additional users) to try and avoid future problems to the best of their ability. Of course, if it persists... --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:23, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

== Promoting a Wikibook to search engines ==

In HTML there are meta tags for '''keywords''' and '''description''' strings to help a search engine to identify the content of web pages. I see that the '''keywords''' tag is put in automatically, but the '''description''' tag does not seem to be used. I have read that search engines pay more attention to '''description''' than '''keywords''' nowadays due to abuse of '''keywords.''' Is there any way of producing a '''description''' tag in wiki markup or is this treated in a different way in Wikibooks? Any comments most appreciated. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] 22:15, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

:The short answer is '''no'''. The long answer is that there is nothing we can do directly here, although we can contact the website developers and submit a bug report asking for some kind of additional functionality. We could ask for a way to specify the page description meta tag, but that would likely cause problems from a programming standpoint. Of course, nothing asked, nothing gained. I'll submit a bug report and post tabs about the response. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:19, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

::Bug posted here at bugzilla: [[bugzilla:12196]]. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:33, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

I don't know much about how the software works but I would have expected there to be less work in the bug fix if we asked for a way for the user to write the content of the '''description''' string by hand, rather than expecting it to be calculated automatically. The wiki text must be scanned already to put in the HTML '''keywords''' string. If we had an HTML meta tag in the text, I would expect it could be picked up fairly easily and written into the page header. Anyway, I will be interested to see what the developers have to say, whether they decide to change anything or not. 

Another way of attracting interest might be to enable Wikibooks entries to appear in searches on ''Wikipedia'', particularly if people include the words '''book''' or '''course''' in their searches. (Am I getting a bit technical for this page?) [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] 01:49, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

:Unfortunately the developers have already denied the request to add the meta description tag. They said that it was too difficult to automatically generate relevant keywords, and that any automatically-generated description would be just as unhelpful, if not worse. They didn't say anything about a user-specified description solution, but I can imagine that it won't be positive.
:As to cross-site searching, I think that's a bit of a pipe-dream for now. There are enough complaints already about the search feature that I doubt a massive expansion in capabilities is something the developers want to get into. Searching multiple sites together would require search hits to multiple databases, which would massively increase server load. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:06, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

== Online Text Books For The Seventh Grade ==

I'm wondering how to find the online social studies text book for seventh grade. Thank You!=)
:I don't know if this is the right place to ask that question, but I'll try and help. What's the book name, publisher, and edition? Do you need the actual textbook or just worksheets, notes, etc.? Unless your teacher has a password to the actual textbook, you'll probably either have to pay for the online version, or use the paper version.

== Wikibookian.org ==

Some people may be familiar with http://www.wikipedian.org and http://www.wikinewsie.org. These are websites, not officially associated with the WMF, where members of these projects can do things which generally can't be done on the wiki itself. I would like to propose the creation of a &quot;wikibookian.org&quot;, a website for established (assuming a definition for &quot;established&quot;) wikibookians can be listed and can get some special capabilities. Here are some ideas of things that such a website could be used for:

*Blogging, by wikibookians, about wikibooks, WMF, and other related topics.
*Email aliasing: USERNAME@wikibookian.org. This way, wikibookians can send and receive wiki-related emails without having to expose their email address to the public, and without having to create a junk account specifically for the purpose.
*Posting news and announcements about Wikibooks, individual wikibookians, etc. This could also be in the form of a blog, or a forum of sorts.
*Ability to host personal information, such as images of yourself, which are not released under a free license.
*Have an IRC client (probably in the form of a java applet) that could connect to #Wikibooks, #Wikijunior, #cvn-wb-en, and #en.wikibooks. This way people can do live chat without having to install an IRC client.
*Host software tools specific to wikibooks, similar to the toolserver but specific to our website.
*Host files which are not suitable for Wikibooks, but which could be adapted to become acceptable
*Have poles or questionaires to get information from wikibookians 

Many of the issues above are pipe-dreams, admittedly. I think that blogging and email-aliasing could be done very quickly and easily on a cheap server setup. There is certainly a lot to discuss before anybody does anything along these lines, but what are people's initial impressions? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:40, 5 December 2007 (UTC)
: Wikibookian.org is a link farm as of now but besides that, I think the biggest issue with this is that it could create schisms in the community (between those that are part of the &quot;wikibookian.org&quot; group and those that are not); if this were to be created, I'd like to make sure that nothing related to the administration of the project is hosted there, because it would create a rather biased sampling of the community's viewpoints. Email aliasing sounds like a good idea, though I wouldn't use it since I have too many email addresses already.

:: I own wikibookian.org already, I just haven't changed the default text there. I didnt want to do anything with it until we had a plan (if we even get a plan). But you are right, that site shouldn't be used for &quot;business&quot; in any sense, it would just be a way for wikibookians who were both established and interested to get extra abilities, such as the email aliases. I know on a number of occasions, such as when i'm communicating with people about book donations or whatever, that I wish i had a more official-looking email address. Wikiversity allows blogging in people's userspace, although we generally dont. Having a place where wikibookians were free to blog about wikibooks would open things up a little bit, i think. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:39, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

:Unfortunately, there really isn't a good way to have changes emailed to you. There are two things that I can suggest to you: First, add all the pages that you want to keep track of on your [[Special:Watchlist|personal watchlist]]. This way, you can keep track of all changes that you're interested in by simply bookmarking that page and visiting it regularly (about once a week). Second, individual page histories have automatic RSS feeds associated with them. If you have an external feed reader, you can add these pages to that service, and get regular RSS updates about those pages. However, using this method, you would need to add 1 RSS feed for every page that you are interested in. Unfortunately, there is no RSS feed for your watchlist. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:01, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

:::I would assume it's a volume problem. If I received an email every time a page on my list were changed, or even a daily digest, that would be a decent volume of mail.

:We could start going through the list at [[WB:FB]]. That's probably the best place to start looking for a &quot;good book&quot;.

::: You're right that it did get left by the wayside, but mostly because there wasn't a lot to write about, and people couldn't agree on how best to distribute newsletters. I have a bot that can do it, but bots become untenable for very large lists of contributors. In addition, the list of recipients was not &quot;opt-in&quot;, but was instead populated with users who ''appeared to be active'', which is not always the best way to do it. If we had a templatized version similar to the WP version, people could put the template on their user page and news stories could be updated directly in the template. Plus, we could use a bot to send stories or notifications to people who &quot;subscribed&quot; to the newsletter by including the template on their user page.

== Intrinsic POV? ==

Hi.  I hope this is the correct page to ask this question.

I am writing an essay entitled &quot;The Case for &lt;something&gt;&quot;.  In this essay, I survey a particular field of knowledge and then assert that that it would be useful for HS students to be familiar with that field, giving examples of how such knowlege would make the students better able to deal with problems they will face during their lives.

With regard to my survey of the field in question, I believe that I am maintaining an NPOV.  But I am not neutral about whether I think students would benefit from the knowledge.  The point of the essay is to assert a point of view on that question.

I'd like to take advantage of the Wikibook medium to open my essay up for collaboration, but I'm afraid it may be impossible for the overall concept to meet the requirement of an NPOV.

Your guidance, please?  Thanks.  --[[User:Lindsay Ridgeway|Lindsay]] ([[User talk:Lindsay Ridgeway|talk]]) 06:01, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

:I suggest putting your essay up on [[v:|Wikiversity]] instead. Essays are more appropriate there, where this sort of original research is generally accepted. As far as the NPOV problem (sense NPOV exists on WV too), I think using facts to backup your view that its beneficial would reduce or possibly eliminate any NPOV issues. Allowing other people to balance it by contribute facts to the contrary would also help make the essay more neutral. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:05, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

== The Front Page and Featured Books ==

Ebook sites have a quite different approach to showing off their wares from the approach at Wikibooks:

http://www.ebooks.com/

http://ebooks.whsmith.co.uk/345C9A6D-B0B9-4A85-AAB3-F3661D572A88/10/46/en/Default.htm

http://e-library.net/

etc...

The difference is that these sites show their books up front.  If Wikibooks were a commercial site it would disappear without trace because it is so hard to browse.  People want to look up and down the book list and select things that grab their attention, they don't always go straight for a known topic.

I know that this issue has been discussed before.  What has happened in the past is that Wikibooks is temporarily opened up and then three other views prevail: tidiness, performance concerns and the view that Wikibooks is for contributors rather than readers.  Slowly these views take over and our wares, the things we want people to see, get tucked away ever further.

I would like to see the Library catalogue put away in a separate area for contributors and all the navigation paths for '''reading''' books filled with descriptive summary boxes.  Like they do on commercial sites (see http://www.ebooks.com/ ).  

Most importantly the link to &quot;featured books&quot; shouldn't be an afterthought, tucked away at the bottom right of the screen, it should be the most prominent link on the front page.

When we get to &quot;featured books&quot; there should be a selected list of book summaries with little pictures. Above each list there should be a link to a department where a similar, but larger list appears. 

In fact [http://www.ebooks.com/ ebooks.com] is an excellent model for how an ebook site should appear and we could do a lot worse than adopting their approach.  However, for the moment my chief gripe is that &quot;featured books&quot; is not a prominent link on the front page and when you get there all you see is an uninspiring list and some cryptic drop down prompts that take you into the library catalogue, not featured books, if you click straight on them.

:I can agree in theory that our Main Page can always use a little improvement. But, if we compare our main page to the www.ebook.com main page, we have just as many book images displayed on the main page (they use cover shots, we use regular images, but the point is the same). We also have more in the way of explanation that we need to put on the main page, and more links to other sites, etc. I can agree with you that there should be a more prominant link to featured books. What if we made the title of the right-hand column say simply &quot;Featured Books&quot;, and made that title a link to the page? Let me actually try that right now, and we can see if it addresses this concern. 
:One other thing that we could try would be to remove the title bar from the main page, probably using Javascript. This would free up some valuable screen realestate where more books and links could be jammed in.
:Another thing worth considering is that there has been some non-negligible talk about creating something similar to http://www.veropedia.com for Wikibooks: A place where &quot;good&quot; stable versions of books could be posted as read-only. Books that are good could be imported from Wikibooks to the stable sight for reading, and development versions would stay on wikibooks for continued editing.

::I have been getting a real itch to start digging into the MediaWiki codebase and start becoming a developer, in part because of the issue of having some sort of stable pages.  I've tended to shy away from even the thought because I haven't been all that thrilled with the politics involved, but I've come across a couple of limitations lately that are just screaming for some sort of MediaWiki extension or modification that IMHO would be incredibly simple to implement if I could just find the appropriate section of the code to modify.  Stable pages are one of them, with the only caveat that it would require a new data field in the page record.  Essentially some way to mark what is the current &quot;stable&quot; page.  I've dug through the data dumps enough that I have a pretty good idea on how the MediaWiki data is organized, and I don't think this would be that radical of a new change.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:19, 6 December 2007 (UTC)
:::The FlaggedRevs extension aims to do just that, providing &quot;stable versions&quot; of a page that are displayed by default, and an extra tab to go to the &quot;development version&quot;. Because of some of the technical challenges of that project, en.wikibooks is being considered as an early beta tester of this extension. I think with some lobbying, we could get en.wikibooks slated for the same test. This would very quickly solve our problem with stable versions (or at least provide a good temporary solution until we get a good automated PDF generator), so I dont think we need to jump into the code and hack together our own solution to it. However, I'm sure you know as well as any, Rob, that there are plenty of other extensions and improvements that we here at Wikibooks could definitely use. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:13, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

== Checkusers ==

Some people may not be aware, but there is a new checkuser up for vote at [[WB:RFA]], I would like to ask all wikibookians who haven't yet to go there and take a look.

There have also been some questions as to how many CUs we need here on Wikibooks. We currently have 4, [[User:SB Johnny]], [[User:Derbeth]], [[User:Herbythyme]], and [[User:Whiteknight|myself]]. Adding [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] makes 5. The question is, is 5 too many? For people who don't know, a CU is a person who has access to the IP records of the website, and IP addresses of registered users are not pieces of information that are commonly available. This raises security and privacy concerns which should not be dismissed out of hand.

Because of the security issues involved, there are some questions that need to be considered: 
#What requirements, if any, should we impose on candidates above what the WMF requires?
#How many CUs do we ''need''? Should we set hard limits? We have, because of the WMF, a hard-minimum of 2 CUs already. 
#Should CUs have something akin to &quot;term limits&quot;? Should they have stricter activity limits then ordinary administrators? 

These are things that we very much need to consider, and I would love to get all possible input. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:17, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

:I feel that Checkusers are a very sensitive matter and Wiki projects should ensure that as few people as absolutely necessary have access to such a tool.  Use of the tool should be available to other administrators and/or editors on request (only to show the frequency of use with IP addresses removed).  The Wiki foundation or stewards should have proof of identification for anybody with access to Checkuser.  Activity limits for checkusers should be very strict and tools suspended when a user is absent (reactivated upon request).  What are the WMF requirements for checkusers?  How do they verify the identity of people wanting such tools?  How can we find out how frequently it's being used?

::Seeing as I'm the administrator being nominated, I might as well make some comments. I agree with Whiteknight and the [[m:Checkuser|CheckUser Policy]] (which is Foundation-wide) that access to the data in the CheckUser log is a privacy concern. It would seem, then, paradoxical that the Foundation would require a 2-CU minimum per-wiki. This is because there must be a minimum of 2 so they can be a balance on each other - they can check each other's activity; this avoids a single user monopolizing access, which has serious implications that need to further explanation.

::The CU policy does have a 1-year inactivity limit, after which CUs will have the rights removed. This is the correct course of action. I'd argue for a shorter period, since the CheckUser data has a shelf-life dependent on the rate of editing. That is, an unavailable CU is useless, since the data doesn't last forever. Our current CheckUsers, while certainly trustworthy, and certainly competent with the tools, are not particularly active here, and this has been the case for some time now. If a request could linger here for so long the check is impossible due to the CU's inactivity, then that's not OK. I don't know whether that's the case with any of our current CheckUsers, but is something worth looking at.

::I think setting a specific number of CUs to have is too rigid. Rather, we should maintain enough for current and anticipated needs. What that number is depends on the community.

::On the subject of a term-limit, I see no justification for this. If a CU has the trust of the community and is doing their job (active and responsive to requests from the community) then there's no need to re-confirm every X months. OTOH, since they have access to private information, we should have some system to recall CUs if they lose the trust of the community. I'm not sure how that might work, but I want to outline a few features I think this process should have:
:::#It must not be a popularity contest; the most effective CUs may not be well-liked, but that's not the point
:::#It must be easily initiated by anyone in good standing with the community
:::#Once initiated, there should be a period of discussion, followed a simple re-confirmation vote (using the same requirements as the initial vote as outlined in the CU policy).
::Addressing Xania's idea of making portions of CU activity available to the community upon request: This has been addressed at Foundation-level and rejected because this would leak private information to the community - which is the point of having CheckUsers. The loss of transparency is trumped by privacy concerns. See several threads at Meta: [[m:Talk:CheckUser policy#The log is problematic]] [[m:Talk:CheckUser policy#checkuser in user log]].
::Hopefully this will clarify my stance on certain issues, and help others come to their own conclusions, both about the issues addressed here, and about me. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:47, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

:::In direct response to Xania, the WMF has a number of specific policies (I am searching for a link to the relevant policy now, will post a link when I find it). CUs must be &quot;of age&quot;. Proof of age and identity must be provided to the WMF. For me personally, I photocopied a piece of personal identification (a drivers' license, in my case) and emailed it to the WMF office. To my knowledge, all other CUs and stewards must do the same thing. Because of the legal ramifications of having access to IP information (and a CU can see slightly more then &quot;just&quot; IPs), all CUs must be adults, must be identifiable, etc. I am not entirely certain, but I think that when a CU steps down or has their tools removed, they can request the WMF to destroy the copy of their information (it may be held for a certain time, I dont know). There are people who have not run in the past, and people who have withdrawn from the position in response to these requirements. 
:::The WMF also has a special &quot;Ombudsman Committee&quot;, or &quot;... Commission&quot; (i dont remember which) that specifically handles problems related to CUs and personal information. That is, if there is a complaint about a CU, or if a CU did something inappropriate, the Ombudsmen can be contacted, and they do all the necessary legal mumbo-jumbo. To my knowledge, this issue has never come up, but they do have apparatus for it. 
:::As another issue, and one that I just heard about recently (again, not sure how accurate it is), a CU election requires 25 &quot;votes&quot;, with a &quot;majority&quot; of them being positive. That is, if there are 24 support votes, and somebody casts an &quot;oppose&quot; vote, that brings the total to 25, and in effect causes the person to be elected. In short, opposition votes, unless there is a majority of them, actually serve the same purpose as a support vote (in that they can cause a CU to become elected). I have to double-check this issue, of course, but I have a decently reliable source and no particular reason to doubt him.

== Print version vs templates and categories ==

:&lt;small&gt;This message will be archived normally&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- 00:43, 12 December 2007 (UTC) --&gt;

I have a [[Template:honor header|template]] that I use at the top of each of the chapters in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]].  One of the things this template does is put the chapter name in a nice little box at the top by using SUBPAGENAME.  Unfortunately, this shows up as &quot;Print version&quot; on the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Health and Science/Print version|print versions]] of each section.  (There are multiple sections because this book is pretty huge.)  

A more important thing that I'd like a little help fixing is the way this template slaps the chapters (based on SUBPAGENAME) into various categories (based on the arguments passed to the template).  I don't want the print versions to show up in the categories.  I tried checking SUBPAGENAME against &quot;Print version&quot; in [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Honor_header&amp;oldid=1016511 an old version]], but there was no joy.  I prolly messed something up, but I have no clue where I went wrong.

== &quot;Why Give?&quot; blog ==

The WMF has started a blog to accompany the current fundraiser effort. Posts come from many people, and are meant to discuss the value of WMF projects, some reasons to donate, stories about donating and helping, etc. I would like to put up a post about Wikibooks and the sister projects, and how donations to the WMF can help them too (not just wikipedia, which is what most other posts are likely going to focus on). I would be willing to write such a post myself, but I would like to get input from other wikibookians, and possibly even write the post collaboratively here on-wiki. 

The blog is located at: http://whygive.wikimedia.org

Quotes from the blog, as well as the approved comments are used in the sitenotice for the fundraiser, above, so things that we say about wikibooks could easily get some very good coverage around wiki-world. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:08, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

== [[m:GIP|Greenspun illustration project]]: requests now open ==

Dear Wikimedians,

This is a (belated) announcement that requests are now being taken for illustrations to be created for the Philip Greenspun illustration project (PGIP).

The aim of the project is to create and improve illustrations on Wikimedia projects. You can help by identifying which important articles or concepts are missing illustrations (diagrams) that could make them a lot easier to understand. Requests should be made on this page: [[m:Philip_Greenspun_illustration_project/Requests|Philip_Greenspun_illustration_project/Requests]]

If there's a topic area you know a lot about or are involved with as a Wikiproject, why not conduct a review to see which illustrations are missing and needed for that topic? Existing content can be checked by using [[tools:~tangotango/mayflower/|Mayflower]] to search Wikimedia Commons, or use the [[tools:~magnus/fist.php|Free Image Search Tool]] to quickly check for images of a given topic in other-language projects.

The community suggestions will be used to shape the final list, which will be finalised to 50 specific requests for Round 1, due to start in January. People will be able to make suggestions for the duration of the project, not just in the lead-up to Round 1.

* General information about the project: [[m:Philip_Greenspun_illustration_project]]
* Potential illustrators and others interested in the project should join the mailing list: [[mail:greenspun-illustrations]]

== Split module from book ==

Hi. Stupid question once again... Do we need some kind of authorization to &quot;split&quot; a module from a book to make it a book by itself (and changing the title accordingly). The idea would be to split [[Microsoft_Certified_Technology_Specialist/Exam_70-536]] from the [[Microsoft_Certified_Technology_Specialist]] book and make it a book on its own. The title could be something like &quot;.NET Development Foundation (70-536)&quot;. There are two main reasons we would want to do that:
*The exam is part of more then one certification (6 in fact), its kind of weird that it is &quot;glued&quot; to one of them.
*Putting .NET somewhere in the title would be a little more meaningfull about the content of the module.

I would like to it now because:
*I am starting to split the document (pages are getting too big and Mike is sending posting &quot;split&quot; requests :-)). I would like to do the change before having too many pages. 
*Also I am referencing the book on discussion groups and other places and I would like to have an address that would not be redirected. So any problem if I do that split?

== I'm new ==

{{user|Mike.lifeguard}} added a welcome template to my talk, suggesting I say hi here... So, I'm doing so. I'm an experienced [[:w:|en]] editor, and don't necessarily expect to be devoting very much time here, unless it's requesting imports from tagged articles over on en. I ''did'' work for a time on the &quot;distributed proofreaders&quot; project on Gutenberg, but that's basically as far as it goes for my experience with PD (or otherwise Free) books. I also took an interest in voting for [[:meta:Wikibooks/logo/archive-vote-4|wikibook's logo]], but that's all :-). Cheers, all! --[[User:Storkk|Storkk]] ([[User talk:Storkk|talk]]) 15:28, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

:Hello Storkk, and welcome! Experienced Wikipedians are great to have around here, several of our books were created by adapting wikipedia articles. We also have another [[meta:Wikibooks/Logo|logo discussion]] going on right now, if you want to participate in that as well.

== Greetings ==

At Whiteknight´s invitation I thought I would drop in and say hello. I edit at the English Wikipedia as myself (Haiduc) and specialize in Greek mythology, gay history and psychedelian bric-a-brac. I look forward to being of use over here, though it is not yet clear how that will unfold. As a closing remark, perhaps you will forgive a bit of doggerel that occurred to me the other day:

== Fair Use again ==

This topic receives occasional attention on the various policy talk pages, but never on a prolonged or continuous basis. With discussions elsewhere about allowing books to be cross-licensed under GFDL and CC-BY-SA for better flexibility, it seems strange to me that we are still allowing completely unrestricted fair use image uploads. Anybody who goes sorting through the list of fair use images is likely to find many abuses of the &quot;license&quot;.

People upload fair use images all the time, often improperly, and the burden falls onto the intrepid admins who sort through images to find the mistakes and to take action. There are abuses and misuses of fair use that have never been caught, and more are being uploaded regularly. I can tell you that I spend little to no time sorting through uploaded images, and I know that there are several other admins who don't deal with the topic either. I believe that the burden for properly asserting fair use should fall onto the image uploader, not on the admins. Before uploading a fair use image, a person should have to make the case as to why a free image cannot be substituted or created for the purpose, or why the author of the image will not agree to grant Wikibooks a license to use it. I'm not advocating here that we restrict fair use images, or that we delete them or whatever. 

What I envision is a process where people should have to &quot;apply&quot; to upload a fair use image. Only after the use of the image has been approved on a per-image or per-collection basis can it be uploaded and tagged with {{tlx|Fair use}}. The approval process would be minimal, possibly as little as a single admin saying &quot;okay&quot; or &quot;not okay&quot;, optionally with some discussion if the case wasn't clear-cut. This ensures that all fair-use images are examined by an admin (many of our existing images have not been so examined), and that fewer abuses of the system are allowed to be uploaded to our server. This is, I think, a pretty good compromise between people who want to continue to allow fair use images here, and those who want to try and limit the abuses of fair use images that have historically been prevalent here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:46, 19 November 2007 (UTC)
:I think the idea of having fair use images pre-approved is great. In essence, this is the best of both worlds (the &quot;unrestricted fair use&quot; and &quot;Ban fair use&quot; camps). There are, however, some problems with implementation:
:#Restricting &quot;approval&quot; rights to admins is too restrictive. I already have a method I'd like to suggest.
:#Someone could just upload a fair use image, and not tell us. This is something we need to solve before any process (including the one below) could work. Monitoring new uploads is feasible now, but may not be in the future. As part of this initiative, we might consider making un-approved fair-use uploads a candidate for speedy deletion. Also, disabling the fair use templates in the drop-down might be useful; it would encourage users to ask first. A really easy way (though it may not be possible) is to disable upload for everyone ''except'' admins. Again, this may not be technically possible. If it is, though, free images go to Commons, and fair use gets approved and then uploaded by admins (since they're giving us the source anyway).
:#We need to do something about the bad fair use images we already have. This is a huge undertaking, and one that will require a plan, if only to avoid duplication of work and drama when it comes time to delete some (which is inevitable).
:We could borrow a process from [[w:WP:BAG|WP:BAG]] - a set of people who know what they're talking about, who provide specific recommendations. In this case, we'd get all admins plus people who have a good record with image uploads; anyone from that list can &quot;approve&quot; a fair use image for upload. We'd have a noticeboard where would-be uploaders can make a request to upload a fair use image (or batch of images) and provide appropriate source and rationale prior to upload. Once it's decided that the image is legit, upload away.
:This can also be used like [[commons:Commons:Help desk|Commons:Help desk]] - users can also ask about tricky licensing questions for other works. This may seem redundant to [[WB:HELP]], and (o noes!) another page to watch, but I think having a page dedicated to licensing issues will be useful. (Of course, licensing questions would still be welcome on other discussion pages, but this would be a central location) In addition, we can create a focused &quot;tutorial&quot; for uploaders, which could function much like upload wizard at WP and Commons. Uploaders are required to look at this page, and potentially navigate through subpages as they narrow down towards what license they should use. (Alternatively, we can direct them to Commons if Commons would accept the license) If they hit &quot;this image is a logo&quot; (etc) they're taken to this pre-approval page, where they ask before uploading.
:This is only an outline of several versions of a process that I think could work if we decide to go down this path. I believe it strikes a necessary balance. Fair use ''is'' a problem, and ignoring that fact weakens the project. On the other hand, there ''are'' legitimate uses for fair use, and those legitimate uses shouldn't be unnecessarily restricted because fair use has been misused in the past. This sort of system would allow fair use, while eliminating (or at least greatly reducing) the potential for misuse.

::One thing that I mentioned on IRC is that we could change {{tlx|fair use}} to include a category for [[:Category:Fair Use (unverified)]]. Next, we could create a template {{tlx|fair use verified}} that would not include that category. Verifying fair use images, and avoiding duplication of work would be as simple as changing templates on images that we verify. The beauty of this approach is that any user could change the template, but users who are not familar with the process here would be unlikely to know how to (and thus less abuse). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 03:28, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

:::I would like to note that one of the reasons I put together [[WB:FUP]] in the first place was to attempt to simplify the process of acting as an administrator in determining if an image would be acceptable on Wikibooks or not, in terms of being a copyright violation.  I read dozens of threads about this topic on Foundation-l, and I am openly noting that this &quot;policy&quot; was one I borrowed from the Italian Wikipedia.... being in my opinion one of the most reasonable and simple policies on the topic that I have ever seen.  The English Wikipedia policy on fair use is nearly unworkable in my opinion, and something that is still causing all sorts of problems.  Better put into a nutshell, there was a camp or school of thought on en.wikipedia that all images should be allowed unless there was an overwhelming rationale to eliminate them.  The WMF board (and particularly Erik) have been very active in trying to change the opinion including by &quot;official decrees&quot; by the WMF on the topic, but it still hasn't eliminated people trying to push fair use to the hard boundaries allowed by law.  Another reason for writing the FUP was trying to convince contributors to Wikibooks that the educational rationale for uploading content simply doesn't apply in the context of Wikibooks.  I still find people who don't understand that concept.&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it might be useful to require fair-use images to state the explicit reason (aka &quot;rationale&quot;) if they are to be kept.  The &quot;upload&quot; page already has listed the general exceptions covered under the FUP in the drop-down box, and perhaps we could &quot;enforce&quot; that further to suggest that if no reasonable rationale is given (or if it is given improperly) that the image could be a candidate for speedy delete.  If it falls into one of the noted categories in the FUP, it is considered &quot;safe&quot;, but other kinds of images may be considered.  One of the weakest excuses I've seen on en.wikipedia is allowing fair use because there is no other method to get a copy of an iconic photo such as [[w:Image:WW2 Iwo Jima flag raising.jpg]].  Historical justifications are not allowed under American copyright law (there may be weak common law to support the idea, but it isn't statutory), and I don't understand why they are permitted here.  For this one image, however, a rare exception is made because the Associated Press did grant copyright permission to Wikipedia...but the person who asked for the permission screwed up and didn't force it to be GFDL compatible (being before such an idea was widely encouraged).&lt;p&gt;BTW, I support the idea that non-admins can help out in the process of sorting through fair-use images.  I have no doubt that anybody insane enough to be helping out with this process is likely to be nominated very quickly to become an admin. (hint, if you want to become an admin, helping with projects like this is one sure way to make it happen).  This is similar to somebody labeling pages for spam and other cleanup work on Wikibooks where marking with templates can flag the content for review.  I completely support such an approach that you are suggesting here, Whiteknight.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:07, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

::::I figured that saying the words &quot;fair use&quot; in public would be a good way to get rob more involved :). You know as well as anybody that i'm very anti-fair-use, but I recognize that there just isn't enough support around here to ban it outright. At the very least, I think it's prudent to try and limit the abuses of {{tlx|fair use}}. This kind of system doesnt put any restrictions on how fair use can be applied, but it does require that every instance of it be properly justified and attributed (which are legal requirements of a fair use defense anyway). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:00, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

===Straw poll on fair use===
Whiteknight mentioned above that there would be a lot of opposition against just banning fair use and being done with it, but I'm not so sure. Could we have a straw poll please, to see if that's true? --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:17, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;'''Should Wikibooks ban all fair use images? Please give reasons with your response.'''&lt;/big&gt;
*{{support}} banning all fair use images. We make textbooks here, at least in part with the intention that someone can make a copy of the textbook someday (printed or digital), and give it to students who will use it to learn something. If instructors, universities, or printing presses need to carefully look through every image in a book to make sure they don't need to go look for permission somewhere, we're that much less likely to succeed in our goal to improve how textbooks are created and used. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:17, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

*{{oppose}} The cover of [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book|&quot;my&quot; book]] is fair use.  It is artwork generated from scratch just for this book, but since it incorporates logos from the official Pathfinder organization, the artist thought it would be safer to declare it as fair use.    The Pathfinder organization itself OK's the use of its logos for Pathfinder-related publications, and the Answer Book certainly falls into this category.  However, if someone were to create a derivative work based on it, they would have to forgo using the cover art.  If those who wish to reproduce Wikibook books need an easy way to detect fair use, I would advocate the requirement for a prominent fair use declaration rather than an outright ban.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 22:42, 19 November 2007 (UTC)
*:Couldn't you just come up with a different logo? I'm not being flip here (and I realize that anyone printing that book out would almost certainly be using the book in a way that the church elders would approve of), but a &quot;book logo&quot; actually strikes me as one of the least justifiable uses of a fair use image. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:55, 19 November 2007 (UTC)
:: I think having the organization's logo incorporated into the book cover is an effective way of indicating what the book is all about.  The people who use this book are immediately reassured that what they're looking at is what they ''think'' they're looking at.  I suppose something different could be used, but I am not about to ask the guy who spent hours coming up with this to try again.  His contributions to this book have added a lot of value to it (and by extension, to Wikibooks). I certainly don't want to jeopardize his participation because of a policy change, especially if there is an alternative (i.e., a prominent warning).  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 23:38, 19 November 2007 (UTC)
::: I really have to wonder if fair use rationale is the only way in which a copyrighted logo can be used in something like a book? In places where fair use is not permissible, does that mean that news organizations cannot use a company's logo, or that people writing books and documentation about products of that company cannot use the logos? I wonder if such a logo image, if used appropriately, is any different conceptually from using a company name (which is typically a registered trade mark) in a book without permission. This is certainly something that we could research, but I have a gut feeling that so long as the book isn't libelous, that such use of a logo for company identification would be permissible. I also wonder if, in a situation like Jim is in here, if we could get special permission to use the image in the book, so long as the image itself is not open to modification, while the book itself may be. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:02, 20 November 2007 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - I support a much more limited version of fair-use over what Wikipedia encourages, but at the same time I think there is a vast number of potential images that clearly could be used for textbooks and textbook like material.  There are times when you have to talk about a specific product where obtaining a &quot;free image&quot; is simply impossible to complete the task at hand, and necessary for illustrating topics.  The best example I can give is a book about Modern Art, which by its very topic alone would require reproducing specific examples to illustrate themes or concepts from that movement.  Virtual no &quot;modern art&quot; is in the public domain, nor can you find good examples from a free image repository like Commons.  Other examples include technical books about products by commercial organizations (aka Intel and Microsoft) where legitimate fair use is used by commercial textbook publishers.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:56, 19 November 2007 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol oppose vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Oppose}}}''' a ''ban'' on fair use, but definitely [[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Support}}}''' a restriction on future fair use uploads and a &quot;cleansing&quot; of past uploads. It boils down to what I said above... There ''are'' problems, which ''must'' be addressed for reasons that [[User:SB_Johnny|SB_Johnny]] expressed adequately. ''However'', there ''are'' legitimate uses, as Rob points out; those legitimate uses shouldn't be unreasonably restricted due to the misuse in the past.

:Good questions! Wikibooks isn't like wikipedia, so we ''generally'' don't use the reference tags like they do. Some books list sources at the bottom of each page, and some books list all the sources for the entire book on a separate &quot;resources&quot; page, or something like that. I would take a look at how the rest of the book does it (if it lists sources at all). If the rest of the book does it, follow the style already in use. If the book doesnt use any sources, you can come up with the best way to implement them. 
:It is perfectly acceptable to list other books on the subject, although again, we aren't Wikipedia. If you must link to other books, do it in a separate &quot;see also&quot; section, or possibly an entire &quot;see also&quot; page (you can name it whatever you think is appropriate, of course).  If you have a separate page for &quot;resources&quot;, you could list all your references and related wikibooks in one page.

The Gadgets extension (which we discussed above and in other places) was installed on all Wikimedia projects. Already, a few gadgets have been submitted and installed here for people to try and use. Some of these gadgets are very interesting, and are worth testing out.

I've submitted my &quot;Print Version Creator&quot; javascript. It's a semi-automatic tool for creating a printable version of a book.

But whenever I go to a section like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|this]], I see the Beginner level and the Intermediate level, but no Advanced level. I think I stumbled across an Advanced level that had nothing under it, but I can't find it anymore. Also you said that The Greater Picture is tagged with the advanced level, but I've only seen it tagged with the Intermediate level, there isn't even an Advanced level [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|here]], yet there is a Greater Picture. Hmmm.... Confusing?

:Mildly. The thing is: there are no warnings for a beginner. If you're intermediate, you can go past the warning that says that beginners should go no further. If you're advanced, you can go past the warning that says intermediates should stop here. The spoiler warnings are end markers, not beginning markers, and they are warnings only.

== Hello there! :) ==

Because of Whiteknights warm welcome, i want to introduce myself to you. My name is Stefan and i am mostly involved in the german wikibooks, where i am writing currently on books about Inkscape, Making Soap, Computerbased translation, Drawing for beginners and astronomy for beginners, which can be considered finished. I alredy thought about translating one or two of them to give english readers the opportunity to make use of them, but currently i have simply not the time to start such a big project. If you understand german language, you are welcome to take a peek in my books. --[[User:SvonHalenbach|SvonHalenbach]] ([[User talk:SvonHalenbach|talk]]) 17:04, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

== Dual Licensing Books ==

I would like to dual license the books I have contributed to Wikijunior, GFDL and CC By 3.0. From a technical standpoint do I need to put the license statement on every page? or can I just put it on the author's page? Also are there any small prefabbed dual license templates, or should I make one? -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:36, 14 November 2007 (UTC)

:You can't dual license a book unless every past, current and future contributor agrees. However I don't think dual licensing can be enforced as a requirement for contributing to any book, making dual licensing an entire book unrealistic, and there is problem with its viral nature which would also prevent it. You can however release all your own contributions under both licenses and for example state on your user page that all your contributions are dual licensed under the GFDL and CC By 3.0. Hope that answers your questions. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:26, 14 November 2007 (UTC)

:::The Wikibooks interface says all over the place that text is released under the GFDL. It's under that assumption that authors are making edits. If an editor comes to your page and makes a contribution without noticing the special licensing requirements, we could end up with a problem of having to delete some edits from the page history. I grant to you that this is not a likely problem, but my point is the same: Many editors may not see the special license before they start to make edits, and we can't expect everybody who edits every page to take note of all possible special license restrictions. 
:::Unfortunately, [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] is significantly vague on this point. It says &quot;''All content is considered to be released under the following terms [GFDL] unless otherwise indicated (for example; a clearly-marked quotation)''&quot;. It says that content can be clearly marked as being under a different licensing scheme, but it only gives the example of a quotation, which implies small snippets of text embedded within the larger document. 
:::I will note, however, that some other books have already tried this same thing. Specifically, the [[WNDP-APDIP Books]] are noted as being dual-licensed under GFDL and CC-BY-SA-2.5. Nobody yet has raised any concerns over this, although that may simply be an indication that not enough people have seen it. I think the time is getting ripe for us to contact the foundation about this point, because it seems to be getting raised more frequently. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:39, 14 November 2007 (UTC)

:This subject has actually been getting some good coverage lately on foundation-l. The general trend there is to say that dual-licensing an individual book is not a good thing. There are a few points that have been mentioned:
:#If you dual-license a book, you cannot move or merge content with a book that is not dual-licensed.  this means that parts of our collection become essentially incompatible with other parts of it.
:#We can't change the copyright notice on the bottom of the edit page to show different copyright warnings on a per-book basis. As an aside, it would be possible to show different warnings on a per-namespace basis. If people insist on dual-licensing, that may be a route for us to pursue.
:#We run the risk that google, or other sites like it, may stop indexing our site so aggressively because of our license inconsistencies. This may not be a big problem with a CC-BY-SA cross-license, but if we give editors freedom to choose any arbitrary cross-licensing or alternate-licensing scheme, we could easily get into this situation.

::I'll try to respond to the textbook-l thread, but I don't see what the problem is with dual-licensed content.  One of those &quot;dual-licenses&quot; absolutely must be the GFDL when adding content to Wikibooks and/or Wikipedia, and it would be strongly encouraged that the other &quot;license&quot; be something that is generally free-content (as in freedom) compatible.  I have a hard time seeing a dual-licensed Microsoft EULA/GFDL document for example, but that is potentially one weird combination you could see under such a combination.&lt;p&gt;I also strongly disagree with the invocation of Google here, as I highly doubt that they will stop indexing Wikibooks strictly because of inconsistent licenses.  As long as we are being consistent with the GFDL as a minimum requirement, this is a complete non-issue here.  Mind you, this is under a dual-licensing concept that allows you to use either license, allowing the end user the freedom to choose one or the other license for future end distribution.  A dual license that requires both licenses for all future releases is a violation of the GFDL, making any distribution (or even modification through a Wiki interface) of the content a copyright violation because the GFDL terms would be violated.&lt;p&gt;I also disagree that a dual-licensed book can't be moved or merged with content of a book that is not dual-licensed.  The issue that does come up in this situation is that the content must be declared to be one license or another.  In the case with merging with other Wikibooks content that is not dual-licensed, it simply reverts to the GFDL and the second (or third) license is ignored from that point on.&lt;p&gt;The copyright notice on the bottom of the page ''could include'' a note that some of the Wikibooks content is dual licensed, and before redistribution you may want to check out some sort of &quot;about&quot; or &quot;introduction&quot; page of the Wikibook for specific license information.  That certainly could be added to the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] page for more details about what may be dual-licensed.  This copyright disclaimer on a per-book basis isn't as big of a deal as you are making out here.  Again, if you assume it is licensed with the GFDL alone, you are fine.  The second license is just an alternate way of obtaining the content and redistributing the content.&lt;p&gt;The one valid argument against dual-licensing is under the scenario of somebody taking Wikibooks content that is dual licensed, copying the content to another Wiki that uses the second license (such as a CC-by second license.... there are many Wikis that are now using CC licenses instead of the GFDL).  In this situation, they have created a fork of the dual-licensed Wikibook under the alternate license, and if they make further modifications those additions may not be available under the terms of the GFDL.  Meaning that we on Wikibooks can't &quot;take the content back&quot; and bring it back to Wikibooks.  But the original GFDL version on Wikibooks would still be available, so it isn't a total loss, just that additions would have to be re-written and it would cause forking of the content.  Forks are generally not desirable as it does cause confusion as to which version is the latest or &quot;most authentic&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:24, 21 November 2007 (UTC)

Whiteknight seems to have left out one point that was brought up on foundation-l, which I consider to be main issue with dual licensing any works on Wikibooks or any other existing Wikimedia project. Dual-licensing is about giving everyone a choice between which license to use when using, modifying, creating derived works or redistributing the work. If books could be dual-licensed on Wikibooks, we couldn't say that all modifications/derived works on Wikibooks have to be under GFDL or both licenses without violating the dual-licensing terms. This could lead to all sorts of problems if the licensed picked isn't GFDL and would violate Wikibooks' current copyright policy. That could lead to problems with mixing GFDL and non-GFDL books or mixing GFDL modules with non-GFDL modules within the same book depending on your POV, and problems with determining what the correct license is for the book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:29, 21 November 2007 (UTC)

:Why is this an issue?  I think contributors to a specific Wikibook perhaps should be notified somehow (on the TOC page and introduction, perhaps a special template on most of the &quot;main pages&quot; as well) that the content contributed is dual-licensed before they add the content, but mixing GFDL and non-GFDL books is not a problem...as long as the content is dual-licensed to include the GFDL as a minimum requirement.  A problem does come when you mix non-GFDL content that does not allow its inclusion with GFDL content in any form, and that is a situation we should try to avoid.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:13, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

::If Book &quot;A&quot; starts off dual licensed with GFDL and MS's EULA, then I could come along and make some contributions to it and say that I choose to use MS's EULA only. Everyone is than forced to agree to the terms of MS's EULA if they want to use it in any way, can no longer mix it with GFDL material because EULA is incompatible with GFDL and its no longer dual-licensed, and can no longer be used, modified or redistributed as freely as the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikibooks requires. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:14, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

:::This situation that you are describing here is only a problem if &quot;Book A&quot; is placed somewhere other than on Wikibooks.  All contributions to Wikibooks must be done according to the terms of the GFDL as an absolute minimum, so any contributions that you add only under the terms of another license simply aren't allowed here on Wikibooks.  It says that right on the edit window....  &quot;'''Please note that all contributions to Wikibooks are considered to be released under the GNU Free Documentation Licence.'''&quot;  This is something that must be made clear to anybody contributing to Wikibooks, and is IMHO something that should be made clear in every situation for this project.  So WMF requrirements are irrelevant and it really isn't a problem a problem as far as the WMF is concerned.&lt;p&gt;The real trick is to convince the contributor that the second license must also be used.  This is where local Wikibooks policy is more useful when you can try to enforce a dual-licensing regime on individual Wikibooks, where there has been established ''when the Wikibook was started'' a second license that is an opt-out dual licensing regime.  Under this sort of policy which permits a dual license, the contributors to the individual Wikibook can decide to keep the dual licenses, or by consensus opt-out to switch to GFDL-only.  This doesn't have to be complicated, and we can still preserve the GFDL requirements here for Wikibooks.  Again, I don't see the problem.  As I pointed out above, if somebody opts-out on the second license and adds substantial content to a Wikibook ''somewhere other than the Wikibooks website'' does this become a real problem.  But that is not really a concern for us on this website because we still have the dual-licensed version that was before it was changed or updated.  There is no copyvio for the older content to be forked from the modified version that no longer uses the GFDL version.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:14, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

::::If dual-licensing were allowed on Wikibooks without changing the requirements that all contributions must be released under the GFDL, required GFDL be used as a minimum, and disallowed opting out of GFDL, Wikibooks could at worst be putting itself in legal trouble for violating the terms of use for dual-licensing, misrepresentation of what is permitted, or for violating the terms in which someone contributed contents, and could result in a lot of lost contributions from having to rollback to a point before there contributions were added. Also basically by stating that people can't opt-out of GFDL, that books aren't really dual-licensed and can't be dual-licensed because people have no say in what license is used for derived works on Wikibooks. Making all books eventually only GFDL again, without the possibility for using any other license. To me that means there really would be no purpose achieved in even trying to dual-license a book or allowing it, because only the first-version would be dual-licensed and all contributions from that point forward would be GFDL and would only allow reuse, modifications, etc. under the terms of GFDL. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:04, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

:::::I would have to agree with your concern here about allowing something other than a voluntary opt-out dual licensing regime would cause problems.  I also think it would violate the terms of the GFDL to use any other licensing regime that requires a second license for all future versions in addition to the GFDL, which is not a problem for Wikibooks.  Content added under such an arrangement is simply a copyvio and must be deleted as any other copyvio contribution.  You (Darklama) and I have gone the rounds on how critical a copyright violation absolutely must be taken care of (I don't think you need to press the panic button so quickly), but there are already very well established policies and precedents to deal with this situation.&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I'm not saying that people can't opt-out of the GFDL, but I think it would be an astoundingly wise policy (and fits with the rest of the project) that people can't opt-out of the GFDL....''if they insist on keeping the content on Wikibooks''.  That is a completely different creature than suggesting that people aren't legally permitted to opt-out of the GFDL elsewhere.  At the same time, I think it would be a good policy for Wikibooks as a project to strongly encourage...or even require content to maintain the dual licensing arrangement for those Wikibooks which have one.  If a book has been &quot;abandoned&quot; by some general criteria (no active edits for several months, for example), a new group of contributors might be able to remove the second license and make the Wikibook GFDL-only.  But if a book has been abandoned in this way, the reason for maintaining the second license is irrelvant as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:43, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

::::::My concern is only with what Wikibooks would or wouldn't permit when modifying a dual-licensed book kept on Wikibooks and not what happens to a copy of any books outside of Wikibooks (pushing a panic button is far from what I'm trying to do, rather just trying to get my concerns across to you in a way I think you'll understand). For GFDL-only works its pretty straight-forward any use, modifications or derived works, and redistributions must be licensed under the GFDL whether its kept on Wikibooks or not. For dual-licensed works any modifications or derived works can be under any one of the licenses used. For example works dual-licensed under GFDL and CC-By-ShareAlike gives a person using, modifying or creating derived works, a choice between using the GFDL or CC-By-ShareAlike. What I understand you are suggesting as wise is that Wikibooks should limit these permissions for any dual-licensed works kept on Wikibooks, which I'm suggesting can't be done without violating the permissions to modify a work kept on Wikibooks under CC-By-ShareAlike use only. I'm also suggesting that a work can't be required to be dual-licensed for all modifications or derived works kept on Wikibooks either without violating the same permissions. I think what Wikibooks does, doesn't, would or wouldn't permit, would be in conflict with what the licenses permit (possibly not being legally permitted). --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:49, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

Something I forgot to add is that I think this would make knowing what license our books are under much more confusing and would probably discourage there use in favor of something less confusing, which would not help Wikibooks in its goals to make free textbooks for schools and other educational institutions. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:44, 21 November 2007 (UTC)

:This doesn't have to be confusing if we maintain that the GFDL is a minimum requirement, and that all dual-licensed books must be done with opt-out licenses that permit a GFDL-only version.  If in doubt, assume that the terms of the GFDL apply and you can ignore the other licensing terms.  The point of a second license is to give more flexibility to those who are going to use the content elsewhere, particularly if a Wikibooks is being used as a development area for a book that has an outside community that may for one reason or another require a second license... to be compatible with content that has absolutely nothing to do with Wikibooks.  It becomes a problem when you have a dual-license regime that requires both licenses ''which must be maintained'', as this violates the GFDL.  So I admit that there can be some problems with a dual-license environment, but it doesn't have to be confusing if we can narrow the scope of when a dual-license is permitted here on Wikibooks.  Again, I don't see what the problem is as long as we maintain that the GFDL is a minimum requirement for all content contributed to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:34, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

::The problem arises when editors (like me) are just not comfortable with the Creative Commons licenses, since they have serious weaknesses when it comes to preserving the virality of free use in derivative works. GFDL can be a pain when publishing individual images or even encyclopedia articles, but it's really not a big deal at all for publishing a book. While it's true that a lot of other collaborations have opted to use the CCs, there's really no reason why someone couldn't just make a derivative (&quot;book fork&quot;) here on wikibooks, or anywhere alse using GFDL. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:19, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

:::So little of Wikibooks is dual-licensed that I highly doubt that you have any real problems finding much content that is GFDL-only for licenses, particularly if you insist to work on only GFDL'd content.  Still, this is an interesting situation where you could have a major contributor to a Wikibook that would insist upon a &quot;fork&quot; of a dual-licensed book, resulting in completely different development as a separate Wikibook.  Such separate branches have been frowned upon in the past, even to the point of merging Wikibooks together when they covered more or less the same identical topic.  The question that would have to be raised is should we as a project allow forks of this nature to exist at all to create several &quot;versions&quot; of these books?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:32, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

::The point of allow contents to be used elsewhere under a different license could not happen under this setup, since any contributions to the book would make the book GFDL-only and so any use of it elsewhere would have to be under GFDL. Making the dual-license short-lived without the intended benefits. I agree with Karl Wick's view on this matter, the only way to convince me that this isn't going to be a legal problem with the described setup would be if a good copyright attorney said so.

:::I don't see why the dual-licensed Wikibook has to be short-lived here.  Perhaps you or I am reading too much into this or are getting confused.  The GFDL is non-negotiable on the part of the WMF... in part to try and keep a consistent licensing arrangement between sister projects (Wikinews not withstanding), but I'm just trying to suggest that you can maintain a Wikibook with additional contributions from multiple people that also uses a dual-licensing arrangement.  This certainly doesn't violate copyright law in any form, and is something very common in the free software/open source software environment.  That it may be more unusual with free content non-software projects (like Wikibooks) is all that is different here.  I'm also trying to explain that there are some very legitimate constraints on what sorts of dual-licensing arrangments that can be used on Wikibooks...when you understand that GFDL-compatibility throughout the project is something desirable. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:32, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

::::GFDL is negotiable according to what was said on the foundation-l mailing list, just impossible to get rid of due to the impossibility of tracking down all the anonymous users and getting there mission to use a different license. However as was said on foundation-l, we could say that all works created after a certain date are under a different license and slowly move to recreate all the other books from scratch under the new license (but thats not really the issue here). What I'm saying is if GFDL must be used, then any dual-licensed works that includes GFDL as a choice would become GFDL work once modified, since contributors would not be able to pick a different license for works kept on Wikibooks. I'm suggesting if a book were modified by person &quot;A&quot; and there contributions have to be released under the terms of the GFDL, then person &quot;B&quot; couldn't then require there modifications to that book be released under CC-By-ShareAlike only, since it wouldn't be compatible with the GFDL. I'm trying to explain that even though there may be some very legitimate constrains desired that they may not be legal under copyright law, once you try to dual-license a work, because you have to consider what the licenses permit and what dual-licensing permits, and that it would be better to leave it to a good copyright lawyer that is consulted or used by the WMF to figure out what would be legally permitted for Wikibooks to do, if the Wikibooks community decides to go this way. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:49, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
:::::As for switching licenses and gradually changing all old content to the new license through some sort of re-write.... I don't see how that is possible.  I would love to see somebody well versed in FLOSS licenses (like CC-by and GFDL) who also has a legal degree to demonstrate how that may even be legally permissible at all.  I don't think it can be done at all.  People suggesting it may be possible are doing only wishful thinking and trying to come up with a legal scenerio that would allow them to change the terms of the GFDL.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:28, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

Trying to break this up a little bit, I don't think it is an impossibility to suggest that parts of Wikibooks clearly marked as being developed under a dual-license arrangement must attempt to keep that arrangement when additional edits are added.  Page forking is a real issue if somebody wants to be a real pain and insist upon GFDL-only, but I think we can insist as a project policy that any such edits which are done here on Wikibooks maintain the dual license on all edits, unless some sort of consensus among all those editing the page/book want to switch to GFDL-only.  We are not preventing anybody from taking this content and redistributing it elsewhere under just the GFDL, but a GFDL/CC-by-SA dual licensed book certainly could be developed with an internal policy (internal to just that book) to insist that any edits done here on Wikibooks maintain that dual license arrangement.  Why is this such a huge problem?  If you don't want to contribute under the dual license, then don't contribute.

I'm also trying to suggest there are often some very good reasons for developing a dual-license situation, particularly if we are trying to involve another community outside of the normal Wikibooks users for a specific project where they are unsure of using the GFDL when the book begins.  I think that sort of situation would be an ideal use for dual licenses.  Or as I pointed out, if one of the applications of how the content will be used is in conjunction with substantial content that is using another license (such as the [[Scratch]] book I have been working on), there is again a strong and compelling reason to include a second license.  In both of these situations, if conditions change in the future (due to those involved becoming much more comfortable with the GFDL), a switch to a GFDL-only license may eventually happen.  And it would be a huge loss to Wikibooks as a project if book projects like these couldn't be started because of a blanket prohibition of dual-licenses on specific pages.  I don't think it is always in our best interest to insist upon only GFDL'd contributions.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:28, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

:I agree its not impossible, I think I've seen documents flying around on the internet that are dual-licensed before. I just don't think dual-licensing is as simple as it seems to be suggested when working in a collaborative wiki environment that has historically been GFDL-only like this project is. I'm all for allowing dual-licensing and even maybe allowing the use of any free-license for any book like is already allowed for images and other media, so long as WMF and WMF's copyright attorneys say its legally permitted, Wikibooks come up with something to help readers and writers understand what this means, and has a consistent way for writers to indicate what license there work in a book is released under so that anyone who wants to use, edit, or redistribute it knows what license(s) are used. Its already confusing as it is when wanting to redistribute books with images and other media files that use different licenses, Wikibooks shouldn't make it even more confusing and harder to do without addressing the current problems. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:28, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

It looks like this whole issue is going to be moot shortly. WMF, FSF and CC have been in talks to make the GFDL compatible and interchangeable with the CC licenses and will supposedly by used on Wikipedia soon to make it easier for [http://blog.jamendo.com/index.php/2007/12/01/breaking-news-wikipedia-switches-to-creative-commons/ Wikipedia to migrate to CC]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:31, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

The problem seems that we can't establish a limit for the creation of things in the same way we act on removing them.  Some of the structural, or community oriented projects/ideas should benefit from having a prioritization or a chain, but I don't see it working out.  It's more or less the problem that I have with talkpages on a book, people post to them but very few Wikibookians notice(reply) the posts.

::Another newbie remark here. If you look at wikipedia's wikiprojects [[w:Wikipedia:Project_shortcuts#WikiProjects.2C_tasks.2C_and_groups|list]] it is very interesting to note that most are related to subject areas (without even counting the portals). My understanding is that on wikibooks those are covered by books. So books are actually wikiprojects and they essentially have all the exposure. The management of books is done at the book level, I have some difficulty to see the benefit of having another structure for those. For the &quot;maintenance&quot; projects there are very few ressources around here so management overhead is certainly an issue. On the other hand I have some difficulty to identify exactly where to discuss the maintanace tasks (ex. the discussion below on categories). Maybe Helpfulstuffnz or RobinH would have some ideas on how we could centralize those discussions without creating management overhead. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 04:08, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

== Whither Wikibooks? ==

Something new is needed at Wikibooks.  We have some fair books now but these are not attracting new editors. If you look at some of our featured books they are not being edited by new experts in the field and some quite popular books have been almost untouched for months. Yet our sister project, Wikipedia, has large numbers of contributors.  We seem to have a fairly large readership with over 20000 views a day ( [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~leon/stats/wikicharts/index.php?lang=en&amp;wiki=enwikibooks&amp;ns=all&amp;limit=100&amp;month=10%2F2007&amp;mode=view Wikicharts]) and rank about 3000th on the net (for a comparison ebooks.com ranks 18000th). My hunch is that many of the readers are going straight for the pdf files (this needs to be checked).

As an internet site we are hugely successful and it seems to me that we will need to accept the awkward truth that books are written by a handful of people and read by many. 

So what is the way forward?  Some of our most complete, reliable and rapidly developed books have been written as group exercises.  '''This is a key area and possibly the front page should contain a prominent box advertising collaborative writing in a seminar/classroom context'''.  It is also the case that most criticisms of Wikibooks focus on the changeability of texts, [[Wikibooks:Wikipublish]] is probably critical to our long term success but we have so few editors with the time required.

Perhaps we could resurrect the &quot;joke book&quot; and place boxes for featured books on every page....

Any thoughts? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:45, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

:The fact that books are written by few and read by many isn't awkward or unexpected. Quite the contrary, it's exactly what many of us have assumed for a long time, and it's confirmed fact on Wikipedia (i'll dig up the statistics if i can find them). The split between readers and writers is about 90%/10%, if I remember correctly.
:Putting more information about collaboration on the main page is not a bad idea. However, for those of us who remember the old COTM, the last few COTM books before that program was cancelled were abysmal. In short, putting collaborations on the main page did nothing to actually attract collaboration, or to help improve the book. However, if we took books that already were active and put a &quot;spotlight&quot; on them, that might help. Given the historical evidence of COTM, however, i'm inclined to say that putting a collaboration on the main page just isn't going to do anything productive. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:19, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

::It would be interesting to know how many readers are going straight for pdf files...  The type of collaboration that I had in mind was collaboration in the context of an academic environment where Wikibooks is used as a tool to enthuse students with the idea of producing essays for something worthwhile. What is needed is some way of selling this concept to university dons. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:43, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

:Also, the Wikipublish thing might be getting a technological boost coming up, because the foundation is having print-on-demand and automatic PDF generation capabilities added to the software. I've also been pushing for a read-only site or sub-domain or something where books that are good and stable can be hosted. Having a stabilized version of a book will make it more usable for classrooms (since the book won't be changed mid-semester) and will make it more attractive to educators and parents (because they won't be prone to vandalism). The Wikipublish project could become something so simple as an editorial board, checking books for quality, editing and updating them, and then saving them as stabilized versions. There are a lot of things going on with the WMF and the software that is going to help us out in a big way in the coming months, so I'm of the mindset that we need to wait and see, so that we don't waste effort trying to do manually what the software will eventually be doing automatically. Of course, if the foundation drags it's feet on these things (which isn't an unreasonable assumption) we will need to take action ourselves. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:24, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

:::This is good news. The big problem is going to be getting enough enthusiastic editors with enough time. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 11:43, 21 December 2007 (UTC)

::I think attempting to resurrect the joke book would lead to mass hysteria, so let's not go there. As far as the reader:editor ratio is concerned, one possibility with the featured books is that most people who read them ''aren't'' that knowledgeable about the subject they're reading about, which is why they do not edit it. Even if a professional does read it (for reference or curiousity or what have you) they may be deterred from editing a book that is deemed &quot;nearly complete&quot;, or they may just want to avoid having to write more about their profession (I know WK has said before that engineers at least seldom like to write about engineering, since they have to do it all day anyways). It's somewhat different with an encyclopedia article since it's a lot smaller of a scale and less detailed than a book on the same topic, at least in my view. 

::I do agree, however, with the emphasis on collaborations, though as WK pointed out it is difficult to get those together who would want to collaborate (class projects are convenient since they all are in the same place anyways, getting a random group of people from the internet together is an entirely different proposal). 

::With regard to the publishing, it ''would'' be difficult to verify all of the information in a nearly complete book, without a bunch of people (i.e. experts in the field) who can look it over and catch any mistakes and so forth. However, if such a professional saw that we were looking for verifiers, such as through use of a template, it is possible that they would be more inclined to help. Regards.

:One thing that I do want to do is find a way to get the [[Template:New|new book list]] posted on the main page. The problem with that is that it takes space to add this list, which means we need to remove something from the main page if we want to add something new to it. I am highly in favor of removing the &quot;navigation&quot; links from the lower-left corner, or at least compacting them. If we have about 5 links to the &quot;departments&quot;, and not two dozen links to various bookshelves, that would save us the space we would need for an abbreviated new book list. Putting books that are &quot;good&quot; on the new page is likely to increase readership but not necessarily increase contributions. However, putting books that are new or &quot;bad&quot; on the front page with a big &quot;you can help!&quot; message is likely to do exactly that. At least, it's a hypothesis that I think is worth testing. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:44, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

::As for the PDF versions, it would be possible to create a PDF out of every book, but it doesnt make sense to go through the effort for stub books, or small books, or books in bad condition.

:[[User:Robert Horning]], if he is around, can probably explain the opposition to this better then I could. I think a big part of the discussion was that categorization should not be compulsary: That is, we should not ''force'' pages to be categorized, but at the same time if people want to do it there is nothing to stop them. The problem, I think, was that we don't want to make it seem that pages ''must'' be categorized, especially if we don't have a standard system for doing it. However, over time, we have developed better methods and standards of categorizing pages, books, and other categories. I think (and I'm sure there are going to be complaints with this) that it should be perfectly fine to categorize pages if you want to do it.

::I certainly have been leading the opposition to the mandatory use of categories in Wikibooks.  Wikibooks is not Wikipedia, and the same &quot;rules&quot; simply don't apply here.  Also, I think that the kinds of categories that are created just to put a page into a category aren't always well thought out or really useful.  In addition, from years of experience as an administrator on Wikibooks, I just don't think the supposed benefit of being able to watch for new pages on the [[Special:Uncategorizedpages]] is as big of a benefit here as it has been suggested on Wikipedia.  There are many other administrative tools that can be used to perform the very same task if you really get down to it, and adding categories in this regard is just a waste of time that can be better spent doing something else.  That is of course my opinion, and if you want to waste your time doing something you think may be productive, I'm not going to stop you from it.  But I'm also not going to support you either, and feel like removing categories in books that I'm working on is also just as valid of an action.

::Categories are a useful tool that can be used to index content, and nothing more.  I certainly am strongly against any sort of general Wikibooks policy that ''requires the use of categories'' in the way that you format the Wikibook.  BTW, this isn't to say that I'm against general categorization of whole Wikibooks, which in this case is much more related to how you can perceive an article on Wikipedia... but typically an individual Wikibook consists of multiple pages, so it largely breaks down the perception of what is accomplished on Wikipedia.  This, IMHO, would be like somebody trying to categorize every independently editable section of every Wikipedia article.  I suppose that might have some usefulness, but would be very clumsy to accomplish.  Of course, this is just my viewpoint on the issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 03:38, 25 December 2007 (UTC)

First thanks both of you (Andrew and Robert) for giving attention to my post. I'm new to wikibooks so I may be missing important things here. Could you please confirm / infirm the following: 
* Contrary to a Wikipedia article, a book on Wikibooks has typically many pages.
* So here the concept of uncategorized '''pages''' covers both uncategorized '''books''' and uncategorized '''subpages''' making it a different concept then on Wikipedia.
* An argument can be made about the usefullness of categorizing subpages
* Categories form the basic indexing mechanism for '''books'''. The new &quot;subject&quot; scheme that is gradually replacing bookshelves relies on categories
* It is reasonable to think that every book should be attainable thru the subject / category indexing scheme
* The exact structure of the category acyclic graph and the connection points between a particular book and that graph are clearly open to discussion 

If the previous paragraph makes any sense then can you tell me how I can get a list of uncategorized '''books''' so I can do the important stuff and leave the rest for somebody that has time to spare. Note that the list of uncategorized pages having more then 5000 entries you cannot get the list of uncategorized books from it.

:* Wikipedia is more like a single book (an encyclopedia) with many pages (articles), while Wikibooks has many books which is why subpages are used here and not as much on Wikipedia.
:* Yes uncategorized pages and many other listings cover both '''books''' and '''subpages''', unlike Wikipedia which consists of only a single book.
:* Categories form the basic indexing mechanism for both '''books''' and '''subpages'''. The new &quot;subject&quot; scheme is intended for '''books''' only and should gradually replace bookshelves and departments, and yes it relies on categories.
:* I think its reasonable to think every '''book''' should be attainable through subjects and categories.
:* The exact structure of the category scheme as well as its usefulness are debatable. However I think the community's continued use of the category system shows that its desirable, both past and current common practices show that there is a general consensus as how categorization should be done, and any discontinuation or change of the category system while debatable is unlikely to happen without discussion and agreement.
: Before you can get a list of uncategorized '''books''' you would first need to be able to come up with an accurate list of all '''books''', which Wikibooks doesn't have. I think this is one reason why its good practice to categorize subpages as well into there own '''book category'''. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:36, 25 December 2007 (UTC)
::In case the above isn't clear, this is what I see happening most often, and it makes sense to me: all subpages of a book are categorized into a category which is usually the same as the title of the book (since there will never be 2 books with the same title, their categories will also not overlap). The &quot;front page&quot; (the top of the hierarchy) gets categorized into those which describe the content of the book. The &quot;book category&quot; keeps all pages together - the the binding on a book; the &quot;subject categories&quot; allow users to find the book according to its content. The &quot;subject categories&quot; should correspond to those which will make it appear in the appropriate Subject: pages (if there isn't one which is appropriate, then it should be created, though there shouldn't be too make &quot;missing&quot; ones now - we have a good set, I think).

As suspected I was missing something important. For a newcomer the lack of an exhaustive &quot;book list&quot; is kind of weird for a booksite. I understand that it is not necessarely trivial to build though (thanks in part to a chat with darklama).

:One of the problems that we are fighting here is the MediaWiki software itself.  Clearly it has been tweaked to work with encyclopedia articles almost to a fault, although there are some extensions which have been added for purposes other than building encyclopedias.  One of the policies that is very unique to Wikibooks and is not found on Wikipedia in any form is the [[WB:NP|Wikibooks Naming Policy]], which was drafted for the explicit purpose of trying to make some sense to how Wikibooks pages were organized.  I think it is reasonable to presume at this point that nearly all of Wikibooks has been moved into this naming system in one form or another, and one of the purposes of this was to help identify a collection of all books, not simply all pages.  When Wikibooks was first started (and no naming policy at all), some books had a very free-flow on how separate pages were named, and wandered aimlessly from one page name to another and no real structure at all.  In the long run, this has proven to be a disaster in terms of project management, and one of the reasons why a formal naming policy was even established in the first place.

:Several attempts have been made to try and come up with an exhaustive book list in several different forms, and this meta issue of trying to organize Wikibooks content between the front page, the actual Wikibooks themselves, and helping a reader access information that is on this website has been a tough challenge.  A concept called Bookshelves was established early in the history of Wikibooks to help organize this content, and some newer schema have also been developed over the years to help organize this content.  Finding Wikibooks content has always been a very tough problem, particularly when it was in what would be called an incomplete or stubby version that did, however, have some real potential for further expansion.  We have even had several variations of how to address the &quot;best of Wikibooks&quot;, but at the moment the [[WB:FB|Featured books]] process seems to be working rather well.  This doesn't address, however, how to find content that isn't quite one of the &quot;best of..&quot; books.

:Categories clearly can be useful in helping to find these books, and removing the sense of pure anarchy that has been the case here on Wikibooks for a considerable amount of the content currently here.  Just don't get caught up with the idea that the categories are the end goal here, but instead try to focus on the idea that the goal is to help a reader or new user to Wikibooks to be able to identify some content they are looking for that is already written here, or to confirm that an idea for a new Wikibook is a genuinely new idea that hasn't been tried before.  If this is accomplished, I am 100% supportive of any ideas you may come up with to help this general goal, and I see very little in the way of opposition from anybody to help with this huge task.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 14:17, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

::In my opinion the &quot;search and browse&quot; template on the main page is too cluttered... we DO have some space we're not using underneath it so if needed we can make the font bigger or something (at least the font of the template's title should be bigger to bring some attention to it). I'm also not sure if it's necessary to have all of the bookshelves listed on the template, maybe it would be better to just list the departments? If we do that we can bring more emphasis to the other forms of organization. Regards.

::I agree with Rob here wholeheartedly (at least his last comment). The categories themselves are not the '''ends''', but are instead a useful '''means''' of organization. Categories do not always make sense, are not always easy to navigate, etc. This is especially true if the categories themselves are not properly categorized. Since there are so many categories, it is not reasonable to expect that they are going to be properly organized in relation to one another. However, using DPL and the [[Subject:All Subjects|Subject pages]], we can create very nice lists of books based on various category intersections. Take a look at [[Subject:Engineering]] for an example of this: Lists are automatically generated of sub-topics, engineering books, featured engineering books, engineering books with print/pdf versions, etc. In this case, we've taken a large number of categories, and combined them into a single page that really contains some useful information. If all books are categorized based on subject, features (print version, pdf version, etc), reading level, status (featured, good, needs cleanup, etc) then we can use DPL and the subject pages to display those category intersections in a very intuitive way. For instance, if you want to contribute to computer programming books, you would go to [[Subject:Programming]], scroll down to the section &quot;Books that need cleanup work&quot; (this section doesnt yet exist, it's hypothetical), and you could find a list of all programming books that need help. There is a lot of potential to this system that we haven't used yet, mostly because we can't agree amongst ourselves how exactly to do it, and because we refuse to mandate that it ''must'' be done to begin with. This is why, I think, that people like Jacques should be encouraged if they are interested in categorizing pages, because the work that they do will be helpful eventually, if we can get the correct DPL lists set up. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:38, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

:::I disagree with [[User:Whiteknight]] here on the fact that we should let resources do something if it ''might'' be usefull at some point.

OK let’s try to close this discussion with a newbie synthesis. 
*The primary organization unit in Wikibooks is a book. Books are composed of pages.
*MediaWiki was developed primarily for Wikipedia. It implements the concept of a page but does not directly support the concept of a “book”. Wikipedia can be viewed as a single book with many pages.
*Categorization can be done at 3 levels:
:*Categorizing books (by topic, by status, etc.)
:*Categorizing pages inside a book (ex. type of recipes in the Cookbook)
:*Associating pages with their books (conceptually a page could be in more than one book thru transclusion)
*A number of organization schemes for books have been tried since the start of the project. The actual naming policy (book name/page name) makes it trivial to associate a page with its main book. Some older books do not follow this naming policy (ex. The Cookbook).
*While most books are clearly known and searchable thru subjects and bookshelves there is no exhaustive list of all books at the moment.

My main personal conclusion here is that we should not talk about categorizing pages anymore but instead of either categorizing books or of associating pages to books (assuming that categorizing pages inside a book is the job of that book's team, not a global maintenance task).

Starting with that distinction we could eventually set clear objectives like:
*All books should be attainable thru the subject / category scheme
*All books not following the present naming convention should have an alternative way of associating their pages (ex. Namespace for the Cookbook, book categories in the main namespace)
*All pages should be either a book or associated with a book (thru naming, categorization or other mean).
*Etc.

The next step for me will be to try to build an exhaustive list of all books and submit it to the community along with its maintenance procedure. If anybody wants to help or give some insight they are more than welcome to do so. I will move this discussion to the [[Wikibooks_talk:Card_Catalog_Office|Card Catalog Office]] (CCO) talk page because an eventual book list would go there in the current organization of the site.  Watch that page for other interesting category talks :-) And finally thanks again for every contributions in this discussion. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 03:56, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

== 2007: Year in Review ==

It's getting towards the end of the year, and I decided to write up a recap of what we did as a community over the past year. I have put all that I could find/remember into a blog post here: 
:http://wikibooks.blogspot.com/2007/12/2007-year-in-review.html
I have also looked at some of the page counter data since it was installed in October, and made some observations about our page hit counts in a blog post here:
:http://wikibooks.blogspot.com/2007/12/page-counts.html
I'm certain that I am missing a few details here and there, so definitely let me know and I will add it. Here are some points that I find most interesting:
*We passed 1 million page edits (i dont know if this includes deleted edits)
*We have over 90,000 pages
*We seem to have about 3000 or more page hits per day, on average. This is likely a very low estimate.
*We promoted 8 new admins, 3 new checkusers and 0 new bureaucrats. We de-sysopped 12 admins, 2 of which were bureaucrats. While the project does appear to be growing, our corps of administrators appears to be shrinking. 

Here is another point that is worth making:

*We currently have about 33 administrators. Of these, 4 of them are stewards or developers and aren't going to be active here anyway. About 10 or so (by a quick count) are probably going to be de-sysopped within the coming year due to inactivity. That means there are only about 19 &quot;active&quot; administrators. It may be worth asking in 2008 whether 19 is enough or not.

Anyway, this is just a short progress report, I think the information here is generally positive and shows that Wikibooks is continuing to grow at a steady pace. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:37, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== Quenya ==

Well I'd like to file an official complaint as the [[Quenya]]-book is the ONLY book which is no longer featured. The remarks Whiteknight made are really quite arbitrary! A lot of the other featured books have even more unresolved links, etc. (and to my knowledge the Quenya-book has none!)

Or is it that every Wikibook has to be in the form lesson 1, lesson 2, ...?

If you don't like a book that treats grammar systematically or a book on a constructed language, then please let me know and I'll remove it.

And btw I have removed that template &quot;no longer featured&quot;, it is really offensive!

[[User:Dirk math]] ([[User talk:Dirk math|talk]]) 07:30, 29 December 2007 (UTC)
:The [[Wikibooks:Good books#Criteria|criteria]] for featured status are fairly clear, though they are guidelines. I don't see how {{tlx|Was Featured}} is &quot;really offensive!&quot; but if you want to change the wording, [[WB:BOLD|go for it]]. For the problems with having [[Quenya]] featured (ie where it isn't meeting the featured book criteria), read through the discussion. The problem is ''not'' that every Wikibook has to be in the lesson format you describe (most are not), nor is it a problem that the book deals with a constructed language (we have many others which do the same thing). The community was in favour of defeaturing it due to its small size and incompleteness. It was once among the best Wikibooks had to offer, but that is no longer the case. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:25, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

::I just want to add that this isn't the first book to be de-featured and that just because a book has been de-featured doesn't mean it can't become featured again later on. Any de-featured book can become featured again if the quality of the book improves to meet the community's current expectations and the community supports featuring it again. However it wasn't until recently that someone thought to create a template to use for books that have been de-featured. I can agree with putting the {{tlx|Was Featured}} template on books can be bad thing and misinterpreted. I propose if this template is to be used at all in any form, that it should be put at the top of book discussion pages instead and that it would be better to just remove the featured template from the book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:52, 29 December 2007 (UTC)
::: There may well be other books which are of the same standard as Quenya and are still featured - if that's the case then nominate them for removal of featured book status.
I agree though that the 'was featured' template isn't very good.  It's kind of advertising that a book isn't very good anymore.  This template should only be used if the editors of the book want such a thing on their book - I'd imagine that most might like a little template saying something like &quot;Quenya is a former featured book&quot; - any other comments and suggestions should be left on the talkpage.

:First off, the [[Quenya]] book is not the only book that previously was featured and has since been removed from that list. Some other such books are: [[Demystifying Depression]], [[Nanotechnology], and [[Wikijunior Human Body]] are three that I can find in a very brief search. However, it is the first book that the {{tlx|Was Featured}} template was ever put on. In fact, I created that template specifically for the [[Quenya]] book because of comments that people made to me about it. I will admit that the template may not be my best work, but the beauty of wiki is that nothing needs to be perfect the first time around. What I wanted to show with that template was that featured book status is a revolving door: a book that is removed from the list can be upgraded and then made featured again. In other words, I don't want to highlight the past glory of the book, but instead highlight the need for authors and editors to rise to a higher standard. About my &quot;arbitrary&quot; comments on the matter, are you referring to [[User_talk:Whiteknight#Quenya-book|this]] or [[WB:FBN#Quenya|this]]?
:Also, we don't have a set format about how a book must be, and a quick look around some of our other featured books will show a very large diversity in terms of formatting and presentation. We also have nothing against Conlangs, one of our other featured books, [[Unilingua]] is featured still (although a brief inspection of it shows that perhaps it too needs to be reconsidered now). If a featured book is not worthy of being featured now for whatever reason, it should be nominated as such. Again, this isn't punishment, but instead admission that our standards are rising around here, and some of our authors are doing phenominal work that other books should aspire too. It's not an offense, but instead a celebration. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:51, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

For the second method, go to [[Special:Preferences]], click on the &quot;'''gadgets'''&quot; tab, and then check the box for &quot;'''Edit Top Section'''&quot;. This javascript-based gadget will add an &quot;edit top&quot; link to every page, so you can edit only the top section of the page.

The developers installed a couple patches to the software yesterday, and one of those patches (submitted by our own [[User:Darklama]]) rearranged the order in which javascript scripts are loaded. This is a good change because it allows people to skin and customize various extensions. However, a lot of our previous javascript here was dependent on the old order of things. If anybody finds a bug or an error or a missing feature or something, let us know so we can fix it ASAP. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:47, 28 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

The views of the data about individual teams or groups needs to be supplemented with indexes to the resources for which those views are appropriate. Generating the indexes on demand is one approach but loads the SPARQL server.  Given the batch nature of the DBpedia extract, it makes more sense to cache the index data and use the cache to generate an index page. (triggering the cache refresh is another problem!)

== Non-caching approach ==
The following script generates an index page with links to the HTML view and the timeline views of a artist album.  

&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;
declare variable $query := &quot;
PREFIX skos: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&gt;
PREFIX p: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/property/&gt; 
SELECT * WHERE { 
      ?group  skos:subject &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees&gt;.
   }
 &quot;;

declare function local:clean($text) {
    let $text:= util:unescape-uri($text,&quot;UTF-8&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;\(.*\)&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;_&quot;,&quot; &quot;)
    return $text
};

 let $category := request:get-parameter(&quot;category&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
 let $categoryx := replace($category,&quot;_&quot;,&quot; &quot;)
 let $queryx := replace($query,&quot;Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees&quot;,$category)
 let $sparql := concat(&quot;http://dbpedia.org/sparql?default-graph-uri=&quot;,escape-uri(&quot;http://dbpedia.org&quot;,true()),
                                      &quot;&amp;amp;query=&quot;,escape-uri($queryx,true())
                         )
let $result  := doc($sparql)
return
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;{$categoryx}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
   {  for $row in $result/table//tr[position()&gt;1]
      let $resource := substring-after($row/td[1],&quot;resource/&quot;)
      let $name := local:clean($resource)
      order by $name
      return      
        &lt;tr&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;         
           {$name}
           &lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;
           &lt;a href=&quot;group2html.xq?group={$resource}&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;
           &lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;
           &lt;a href=&quot;groupTimeline.xq?group={$resource}&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/a&gt;
           &lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;/tr&gt;
   }
   &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Index examples ==

*[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/RDF/groupIndex.xq?category=Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees Rock and Roll Groups]

== Caching Approach ==

Two scripts are needed - one to generate the data to cache, the other to generate the index page.  The approach is illustrated with an index to Rock and Roll groups based on the Wikipedia category Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees.

==   Generate the index data ==

This script generates an XML file. A further development would store the XML directly to the database but it could also be saved manually to the appropriate location. It is parameterised by a category.

&lt;pre&gt;
declare variable $query := &quot;
PREFIX skos: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&gt;
PREFIX p: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/property/&gt; 
SELECT * WHERE { 
      ?group  skos:subject &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees&gt;.
   }
 &quot;;

declare function local:clean($text) {
    let $text:= util:unescape-uri($text,&quot;UTF-8&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;\(.*\)&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
    let $text := replace($text,&quot;_&quot;,&quot; &quot;)
    return $text
};

declare function local:table-to-seq($table ) {
   let $head := $table/tr[1]
   for $row in $table/tr[position()&gt;1]
   return
     &lt;tuple&gt;
            { for $cell at $i in $row/td
               return
                 element {$head/th[position()=$i]}
                     {string($cell)}
            }
      &lt;/tuple&gt;
 };
 
let $category := request:get-parameter(&quot;category&quot;,&quot;Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees&quot;)
let $queryx := replace($query,&quot;Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees&quot;,$category)
let $sparql := concat(&quot;http://dbpedia.org/sparql?default-graph-uri=&quot;,escape-uri(&quot;http://dbpedia.org&quot;,true()),
                                      &quot;&amp;amp;query=&quot;,escape-uri($query,true())
                         )
let $result  := doc($sparql)/table
let $groups := local:table-to-seq($result)
return
&lt;ResourceList category=&quot;{$category}&quot;&gt;
   {for $group in $groups
    let $resource := substring-after($group/group,&quot;resource/&quot;)
    let $name := local:clean($resource)
    order by $name
    return      
        &lt;resource id=&quot;{$resource}&quot; name=&quot;{$name}&quot;/&gt;
   }
&lt;/ResourceList&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note:  I guess a better approach would be to use triples here, saved to a local triple store.

== HTML index page ==

This script, groupList, uses the cached index data 
&lt;pre&gt;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;
let $list := //ResourceList[@category=&quot;Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees&quot;]
return
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Rock Groups&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
   {for $declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;
lresource in $list/resource
    order by $resource/@name
   return      
        &lt;tr&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;         
           {string($resource/@name)}
           &lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;
           &lt;a href=&quot;group2html.xq?group={$resource/@id}&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;
           &lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;
           &lt;a href=&quot;groupTimeline.xq?group={$resource/@id}&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/a&gt;
           &lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;/tr&gt;
   }
   &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to understand bases, you should look at decimal to see how they work first.

For example, look at the number 123:

The 1 in the 100s place means 1 x 100&lt;BR&gt;
1 x 100 = 100

The 2 in the 10s place means 2 x 10&lt;BR&gt;
2 x 10 = 20&lt;BR&gt;
100 + 20 = 120

The 3 in the 1s place means 3 x 1&lt;BR&gt;
3 x 1 = 3&lt;BR&gt;
100 + 20 + 3 = 123

Notice how 100 = 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 10 = 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 1 = 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.

Duonos gira (Lithuanain kvass) A low or no alcohol drink made from fermented dark rye bread. 

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb dried black rye bread (Lithuanian rye- like sour dough)
* 5 qt. water
* 1 lbs. sugar (I've found sugar is optional)
* 4 teaspoons yeast
* 1 cup raisins

==Procedure==

# Boil water and cover cubed bread. Let stand 24 hours.
# Strain and add yeast and sugar. Keep in a warm place for 48 hours.
# Place in bottles add raisins or other dried fruit and close off bottles. Ready to drink. Store bottles in cool place for up to 2 months. Often served in Lithuania as a summertime drink but is also good served hot in winter.</text>

      <comment>add question: Remove blank / empty pages and renumber the pages?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''How to XXX?''' is not a question. All those chapter headings should be changed to '''How to XXX''' (no question mark) or '''XXXing'''.&lt;br /&gt;
So eg '''How to ''verb'' a ''noun''?''' should become '''How to ''verb'' a ''noun''''' or '''''Verbing'' a ''noun'''''.&lt;br /&gt;

Too hard! A very simple tutorial on PostScript needed, such as:
:/func_name { ''...insert-code-here...'' } def 
defines a function, and
:/var_name ''...value...'' def
defines a variable.

Said the yet unregistered (?) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rursus user Rursus]. 09:40, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

== How to remove blank / empty pages and renumber the pages afterwards? ==
Is there anybody out there who can help me with the following issue: 

How can i remove blank or empty pages from a PostScript-file and renumber the pages afterwards? I was thinking of a commandline tool or PostScript-Code I can use with ghostscript. This is an example how a blank page looks like in my PostScript-file:

 %%Page: 4 4
 %%PageOrientation: Landscape
 %%PageBoundingBox: 18 18 279 402
 %%BeginPageSetup
 %
 %%EndPageSetup
 gsave
 [ 0 0.24 0.24 0 18 18] concat
 gsave
 grestore grestore
 showpage
 %%PageTrailer

In case this is not the right place to ask, please refer to an appropriate forum e.g.

Thank you very much, forest ([[Special:Contributions/208.80.80.223|208.80.80.223]] ([[User talk:208.80.80.223|discuss]]) 08:24, 29 January 2012 (UTC))</text>

I'm seriously considering concentrating my effort on this site instead of on en.wikipedia and sv.wikipedia. En.wikipedia is starting to be a little boring, since almost everything interesting has been written on it (as regards my interests). Mostly corrections and infrastructure work to be done there. 

The most important ''Rursus'' links, in priority order:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vellkumme, to ze Rursus/todo diskussion paye, bork, bork!

If there's anything you wish to know about, maybe I (User:Rursus) may consider writing that on my spare time. Propose in [[#Proposals|&quot;Proposals&quot; below]]!

==User:Rursus'es skills==
In short: 60 hp Maths, 240 hp Computer Science, 60 hp Science of Human Behavior ('''not''' my own b.!), and lots of undocumented and partial knowledge, such as Astronomy, History, Writing and Fonts, Linguistics extra (outside CompSci), Chemistry, Communication/Documentation Science (if such exists), Biology.

===Maths===
Mostly simple, up to and including maths proofs, algebra, 2D up to 3D Analysis, numerical methods, 3D geometry and coordinate systems, logics and some very very elementary group theory. I'm actually not a math star, but pretty much more a ''user'' that with some effort may create simple proofs and formulae at need.

===Computer Science===
Almost anything, although my electronics skill is somewhat lacking. The computer from bits-and-bytes and up. I speak any programming language, but prefer low-levelisms, such as C, C++ and such bit-diddling. I'm continually developing my mediawiki knowledge, since I falled into WikiBooks as a result of searching [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Meta Wiki] for bot code. Imagine f.ex. a '''map server''' instead of a myriad of maps at Wikimedia Commons. This imaginary '''map server''' could generate maps at need, by some server code, f.ex.

[[Image:Mapsample se og norrkoping.svg|thumb|right|Sample map]]
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;map
  |language=Swedish
  |names=black white
  |country=Sweden/exclusive green black
  |region=South/exclusive
  |county=Östergötland/inclusive darkgreen named
  |city=Norrköping/inclusive yellow named
  |city name=black red yellow
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Should give the map at the right.

''(This sample shouldn't be here. It should be on metawiki.)''

===Science of Human Behavior===
Basic psychology, sociology and pedagogy. Organisation theory and science philosophy. Since too many humans consider psychology, sociology and philosophy being obscure and subversive knowledges, I'll consider carefully what to say here. But later...

''...(Except that effective computer technology development requires new organization forms)...''

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 140%; color: red; background: #FFFFC0; font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Feel free to propose here, below!&lt;/span&gt;

'''Wood Mulches''' are the most commonly used mulch in many regions, since wood tends to be in plentiful supply. There are a number of different kinds of wood mulches, but all are essentially from the same source: waste materials from either the lumber industry or the landscaping industry. 

==Wood Chips==
Wood chips are the product of [[../Woodchippers|chippers]], which are used to process waste wood after pruning or clearing. 

===Advantages===
*The big advantage with wood chips is that they are generally free (or at least inexpensive), since they receive no processing aside from the chipping on site. 

===Disadvantages===
*Fresh wood chips are &quot;hot&quot;, and need to be seasoned for several months before they are safe to use in garden beds (though they are fine for pathways)
*Wood chips have an inconsistent texture.
*Wood chips may contain thorns, coniferous needles, poison ivy, diseased materials, herbicides and pesticides, trash, etc. 

==Shredded Wood==
Shredded wood is made from either wood chips or larger pieces of wood using a [[../Drum Grinders|drum grinder]] or similar industrial-scale machine. 

===Advantages===
*Consistent texture
*Readily available in many regions

===Disadvantages===
*Can sometimes be hot or sour
*Can contain disease spores if not seasoned

==Dyed Shredded Wood==
Dyed wood mulches are derived from a number of sources, including chips, larger wood, and waste lumber such as pallettes.

===Advantages===
*Consistent texture and color

===Disadvantages===
*Dyes stain hands and clothing.
*Does not biodegrade as quickly

==Bark Mulch==
Bark mulch is derived from forest products, when trees are debarked at the mill.

===Advantages===
*Attractive and long-lasting

===Disadvantages===
*Expensive

'''Shredded Leaves''' are often considered to be the best organic mulch available for use in the garden. Leaves contain a great number of [[../Nutrients/]], are lightweight, and biodegrade quickly. 

The major disadvantage to shredded leaves is that they are almost never available commercially, so the gardener generally has to make them herself using either a [[../Leaf Shredder|leaf shredder]] or by running them over with a [[../Lawn Mowers|lawn mower]].

[[Image:rice straw.jpg|thumb|bundles of rice straw]]
[[Image:pile-of-straw.jpg|thumb|Pile of straw bales, sheltered under a tarpaulin]]

'''Straw''' is an agricultural byproduct, the dry stalk of a cereal plant, after the nutrient grain or seed has been removed. Straw makes up about half of the yield of a cereal crop such as barley, oats, rice, rye or wheat. In times gone by, it was regarded as a useful by-product of the harvest, but with the advent of the combine harvester, straw has become almost a nuisance to farmers.

The most common use for straw is as bedding material for livestock, but it has a number of other uses as well. For the gardener, its most important use is as a mulch or as a bedding material to keep fruits such as strawberries or cucurbit crops off of the soil. Straw is a &quot;cool&quot; material (containing little nitrogen), and can be used fresh. Used straw from animal pens tends to be hot, and should not be used under food crops because of the risk of infectious organisms.

The biggest advantage of straw is that it is widely available and relatively inexpensive compared to other mulches. It also provides plentiful air and water circulation due to its texture, and can be laid thickly to discourage weeds. Its greatest liabilities are that it has a very low nutrient value, and its coarse texture and bright color is not universally appreciated by gardeners.

== Other uses==
Straw bales can be used for controlling runoff (as a silt screen), and are often used as building materials for raised beds, retaining walls, and compost piles. Straw bales can also be used for making mazes and other playground features for children (in fact it is even used in constructing houses), and in some parts of the world is used roofing, for making beds for people, and as packing material.

Straw is also used to cover the ground when lawns are seeded, creating some shelter for the seeds by regulating humidity, preventing seeds from being washed away by water or wind, and confusing hungry birds. 

In Japan, certain trees are wrapped with straw to protect them from the effects of a hard winter as well as to use them as a trap for parasite insects.

Straw is used in ponds to reduce algae by changing the nutrient ratios in the water.

Still other uses include:
*There are several styles of [[w:straw hat|straw hat]]s that are made of woven straw.
*[[Archery]] targets, where heavy gauge straw rope is coiled and sewn tightly together. This is no longer done entirely by hand, but is partially mechanised.
*[[w:Corn dolly|Corn dollies]]
*[[w:Straw marquetry|Straw marquetry]]
*[[w:Harvest cross|Harvest cross]]es
*[[Basketry]]
*[[w:Beehive (beekeeping)|Bee skeps]] and linen baskets are made from coiled and bound together continuous lengths of straw. The technique is known as lip work.
*Rope made from straw was used by thatchers, in the packaging industry and even in iron foundries. 
*Straw can be pulped to make paper.
*The use of straw as a carbon-neutral energy source for biofeuls is increasing rapidly, especially for [[w:biobutanol|biobutanol]].

'''Pine straw''' is a term used in the southern United States to refer to pine needles. A pine tree will produce pine needles that can be anywhere from 5 to 18 inches in length, the most desirable type of pine straw is referred to as Longleaf pine straw. These needles will fall to the ground and are then harvested for use as a mulch. 

Pine straw has been used mainly in the southern US in the past, but has more recently become available in other parts of North America as well. Like regular straw, pine straw is lightweight and porous, so it can be laid thickly as a weed barrier. It is also much slower to biodegrade, and has a better nutrient value. 

Its major liabilities include expense (in areas far from where it is harvested), and the strong acidity of the needles as they break down (though this is actually an asset when growing [[..Ericaceae|ericaceous plants]] and other acid-lovers). Pine straw can also make cleanup difficult, as fallen leaves and other debris tend to get stuck in a pine straw mulch, making it difficult to either rake or blow off debris without removing the mulch itself in the process.

      <comment>Added missing words to Q4; reworded slightly to make more sense.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Electrons, like many other particles, have a charge. While some particles have a positive charge, electrons have a negative charge. The charge on an electron is equal to approximately -1.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; coulombs. Coulombs (commonly abbreviated C) are the unit of charge. One coulomb is defined as the electric charge carried by 1 ampere (amp) of current in 1 second. It is normal to ignore the negative nature of this charge when considering electricity.

If we have n particles with the same charge Q&lt;sub&gt;particle&lt;/sub&gt;, then the total charge Q&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:

Q&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = n Q&lt;sub&gt;particle&lt;/sub&gt;

By a simple rearrangement:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{Q_{total}}{Q_{particle}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Questions==

1. How much charge do 1234 electrons carry?

2. How many electrons does it take to carry 5 C of charge?

3. The total charge on 1 mole of electrons (6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles) is equal to 1 faraday of charge. How many coulombs of charge are equal to 1 faraday?
 
4. The mass of a ball is 50mg. It is supplied 5C of charge. Will there be any change in the mass of the ball? If so, calculate the change of the mass.

This book serves as an introduction to the field of microprocessor design and implementation. It is intended for students in computer science or computer or electrical engineering who are in the third or fourth years of an undergraduate degree. While the focus of this book will be on Microprocessors, many of the concepts will apply to other ASIC design tasks as well.

The reader should have prior knowledge in Digital Circuits and possibly some background in Semiconductors although it isn't strictly necessary. The reader also should know at least one Assembly Language. Knowledge of higher-level languages such as C or C++ may be useful as well, but are not required. Sections about soft-core design will require prior knowledge of Programmable Logic, and a prior knowledge of at least one HDL.

The MIPS microprocessor paradigm was created in 1981 from work done by J. L. Hennessy at Stanford University. Since that time, the MIPS paradigm has been so influential, that nearly every modern-day processor family makes some use of the concepts derived from that original research. This book will discuss the MIPS architecture and (perhaps most importantly) MIPS assembly programming.

This book is in an early stage of development. Any contributions would be helpful and appreciated.

      <comment>/* Molarity */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Relative Atomic Mass and Relative Molecular Mass ==

The isotope &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C is the standard for relative mass: a relative atomic mass of 1 is 1 twelfth of the mass of 1 atom of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.

== The Mole and the Avogadro Constant (L) ==
===Avogadro Constant and The Mole===
The '''Avogadro Constant''' is a quantity and is given the symbol L:
    L = 6.023 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; 
A '''mole''' of particles is L particles. I.e.
    1 mole of particles = 6.023 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles.

The mass of 1 mole of particles of a substance with a relative atomic mass of 1, is precisely 1g.&lt;br /&gt;
1 mole of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C (relative atomic mass 12) is 12g.

===Molarity===
is a quantitative expression of the concentration of a solution.  

Or more simply, it is the concentration when measured in moles per dm3.  

Sometimes you will see 'm' used as a short version of this.  E.g. 5m acid means 5 moles per cubic decimeter. A capital M should not be used as that means meters so a small m should be used or mol to be extra clear.

===Isotopes===

Isotopes have different mass numbers but the same atomic numbers; in other words they have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

== The Ideal Gas Equation ==

&lt;math&gt;pV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;

p is the pressure of the gas in Pa (Nm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;)

V is the volume of the gas in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

n is the number of moles

R is the gas constant (8.31 J K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)

T is the temperature in Kelvin (equivalent to degrees Celsius + 273)

== Empirical and Molecular Formulae ==

An empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of atom types present in a molecule of a compound.&lt;br /&gt;
Molecular formula is the actual number of atoms of each element present in a molecule of a compound.&lt;br /&gt;
To determine a molecular formula you need the given mass of the substance and the empirical formula mass. Divide the given mass by the empirical formula mass.&lt;br /&gt;
Multiply the given answer by the ratios in the empirical formula and you will have the molecular formula.

== Balanced Equations and Associated Calculations ==

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
Many have constant problems with different courses, despite the effort put in. This short guide will show some basic steps on how to pass a course.  

This is not meant to be a full treatise on study methods, but rather a practical guide of various techniques. 

Also, please remember that study technique effectiveness is a most personal question - this wikibook is concentrating mostly on the techniques that commonly work well. Some people who will find that a personal technique, sometimes unconventional, works better.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;Arabic - العربية   &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
'''Arabic''' ({{lang|ar|الْعَرَبيّة}} ''(al-ʿarabiyyah)'' or simply {{lang|ar|عَرَبيْ}} ''(ʿarabī)'') is the largest living member of the Semitic language family in terms of speakers. Classified as Central Semitic, it is closely related to Hebrew and Aramaic, and has its roots in a Proto-Semitic common ancestor. Modern Arabic is classified as a macrolanguage with 27 sub-languages in ISO 639-3. These varieties are spoken throughout the Arab world, and '''Standard Arabic''' is  widely studied and known throughout the Islamic world.

Modern Standard Arabic derives from '''Classical Arabic''', the only surviving member of the Old North Arabian dialect group, attested epigraphically since the 6th century, which has been a literary language and the liturgical language of Islam since the 7th century.  

Arabic has lent many words to other languages of the Islamic world, as Latin has contributed to most European languages. And in turn, it has also borrowed from those languages, as well as Persian and Sanskrit from early contacts with their affiliated regions. During the Middle Ages, Arabic was a major vehicle of culture, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy, with the result that many European languages have also borrowed numerous words from it.

This wikibook aims to teach Arabic, and we are always looking for contributors.

===Classical Arabic Readings===

&lt;br /&gt;
The Qur'an is often claimed to be, in addition to the Muslim scripture, the pinnacle of Arabic literature.  The Qur'an is divided into chapters (in Arabic, sura pl. suwar [سورة ج. سور]).  The sura in this link is the first sura in the Qur'an and is a common starting point for reading the Qur'an.  Note though, that after this sura, it's often not advised to read the suwar in sequence, since the second sura, al-Baqara, is the longest in the Qur'an and can be daunting.

&lt;br /&gt;
Ibn Khaldun is considered one of the most important figures of Islamic history writing; some consider him the most important pre-modern historian from any culture.  He developed a philosophy of history and is considered by some to be a founding father of sociology.  The Muqaddima, or Introduction, is his most famous work, and is the first part of a longer work of universal history.  In the Muqaddima, he lays out his philosophy of history.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook is for learning Arabic. So far it is in mediocre shape, and is still in its beginning stages. It is approximately 5% complete.


The goal of this book is to provide materials for an easy way to learn Arabic. 

=Advanced Details=

==Dialect coverage==
This book teaches Arabic. Therefore its complete version must endow a person with the ability to learn enough to compete with a native Arabic speaker. 

A native Arabic speaker -nowadays- must be familiar with more than one variety of Arabic. That is simply the way the Arab world is. Education requires the standard dialect. Literacy requires the standard dialect. Popular culture requires multiple other dialects. Cross-dialect conversation usually requires multiple non-standard dialects. The standard and non-standard dialects do influence each other, at least in live conversation. Therefore they are both necessary to gain access to the Arab world.

==Dialect conflict and compliment==
However; multiple dialects can hamper progress, because to the learner it seems like what one dialect does conflicts with how it is done in another dialect. Also; some people may want to learn Arabic in order to read and comprehend, rather than converse in it. For them non-standard dialects would be a distraction. Therefore, we have to teach standard and non-standard separately.

In order to get over this conflict, we have to present the dialects as complimentary rather than conflicting. The best way to do this that I can think of, is having a dialect chapter at the end of each unit, that teaches dialect versions of whatever was taught in the unit. That way, the dialect is covered as a sort of extra review for the unit.

==Justification for Standard Arabic as base dialect==
If someone really only requires one non-standard dialect (for example staying in one relatively local Arab city), then their best option is to learn the local dialect through immersion. For such people we should provide a page that gives them enough information about what all Arab dialects have in common, so that they can speed up the immersion process.  Therefore we can safely use standard Arabic as the first dialect taught, and teach the other dialects as a sort of afterthought. Why? Because lessons in non-Standard Arabic are not as necessary as those in Standard Arabic, because with non-standard Arabic immersion is the best option.

 
As for the non-standard dialects that will be taught, the more the better. However; region of the dialect should be denoted to help people learning Arabic figure out their dialect priorities.

==Dropped endings==
Due to dialect influence, people can and do get away with omitting the grammatical niceties of Standard Arabic. This does not affect comprehension for the Arabs (Probably because they are used to comprehending Arabic without them from the non-Standard dialects, and also because Arabic writing omits a lot of these niceties as well). I know that, calling them grammatical niceties is a bit silly, but that is how the Arabs treat them. Therefore, we will take advantage of this fact. The romanisations will provide the grammatical niceties within brackets, to indicate that they are often silent. And these grammatical niceties will not truly be explained until they start changing (read: declining). Explanation of these grammatical phenomena will go in a chapter known as  
advanced grammar.

&lt;br&gt;

=Format=
First, lessons will be made in Standard Arabic, and then a link at the bottom of each Standard lesson will link to the dialect versions. At the dialect version of the exercise, the user gains the ability to comprehend the same idea, spoken in a dialect. The student will match a recording of a dialect to the standard form, to reflect the reality that Arabs tend to write what they say in its Standard form even if they spoke it in a non-Standard form. 
&lt;br&gt;
In summary: There will be a long series of lessons teaching how to express one idea such as &quot;existance&quot;. These lessons will link to pages where the user learns to understand a dialect way of saying that. The more significantly different ways of saying something, the more dialect pages there should be per a lesson.

The final part will be a text-study section. Here, a wide variety of texts including unwritten text (i.e. audio) will be displayed alongside study notes, and comprehension questions. There will be multiple text sections, divided by dialect or topic. 

==Reading==

Although, Arabic is written in script where every character written does represent a spoken sound. Lots of the sounds are not written, specifically the vowels (in writing). In reading, one is supposed to be fluent enough and literate enough for the correct vowels to just come out of your mouth, without them being written. There are actually two solutions, one is to always read Arabic silently, just looking at the words, and getting the meaning, no sub-vocalization. The other is to read without vowel endings, this is done by some people. However; there are still problems, because some words that are always pronounced differently, are actually written the same. They tend to mean completely different things. Therefore a person needs practice to read Arabic, unless all the vowels are written into the text (almost no books do that).

===Vowelization lessons===
The two solutions, of silent-reading and reading without final vowels, will not befit everyone. Some people will want to read with all the vowels when few if any are written in. We need to provide a unit, that teaches people how to do that.

===Learn more words, you will learn how to vowelize them===
This is something that can't be taught. Why? You can insert the vowels when you know the word. In some cases you can guess how to read a word, if you don't know it but know the grammar, the context and have a feeling of the language.

It's not unsimilar to Chinese and Japanese (only for words written in Kanji) where you learn the words and learn how to read them. It may sound surprisingly, but in some case these two are easier to read, since the components are reusable, and their reading is largely predictable. The Arabic reading is much easier of course, when you can speak it, the more words and situations you know, the easier it gets but you can't learn to read fluently in Arabic, if you don't understand what you are reading, that's for sure.

Cases where Arabic pronunciation is predictable (without the knowledge of the grammar and the context) are not many:

إ alif with the hamza below is always followed by kasra, so it's always &quot;i&quot;.

ا alif in the middle of a word (excluding words after al- and one-syllable prepositions) is always pronounced with a long &quot;aː&quot;

وا is always &quot;wa:&quot;

يا is always &quot;ya:&quot;

ﺓ tāʾ marbūṭa‎ is always preceded by a fatḥa, so &quot;a&quot; should be always pronounced, followed by &quot;-t&quot; in non-pausal cases if the classical pronunciation is followed, otherwise, read always as &quot;a&quot;.

Arabs themselves make mistake in vowelisation, there are variants of pronunciation of same words or the pronunciation is affected by their dialect, which may differ from MSA.

=Exposure to the language=

The text-study section is intended for exposure to the language. A link to Arabic media on the net (such as videos, interviews, music, news broadcasts, and whatever) will be provided. Each page of the text-study section, will have the link to the particular piece that a student should get exposed to. And underneath the link, there can be information to help the student understand the piece. For example, transcripts, translations, exercises would be useful. Ideally there should be a set of questions at the very end to test comprehension. The text study section can also have the text at the top, rather than a link to media. The goal is to give students enough text and media, so that their confidence increases in their abilities in the Arabic language.

==Text Display==
Ideally every text would have audio along with it.

There will be three writing systems employed: Perso-Arabic with vowellization, Perso-Arabic without vowellization, and the Latin-numerical transliteration scheme. 

The Latin-numerical transliteration scheme is one of the author's adaptations from the transliteration that gradually developed among youth   through chat.


&lt;br&gt;
The Latin-numerical scheme is as follows:

 2 b t t' j 7 7' d d' r z s s' 9 9' 6 6' 3 3' f q k l m n h w y
&lt;br&gt;
ة  = et/ e &lt;br&gt;
ى = a(ya)

ٍShort vowels:    
a i u
Long vowels
a' i' u'

	This tutorial is intended as an intermediate introduction to the Blender game engine, in the form of a  game, and is the sequel to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Platformer: Creation and Controls|Platformer: Creation and Controls]].  It will require a familiarity with the Blender UI, simple commands (such as '''AKEY''' to select) and basic modeling skills.  The game we will create within Blender will have the following features:

# a protagonist controlled by means of the WASD keys
# a maze surface without walls
# death on falling off the maze
# multiple levels
# dynamic obstacles
# a goal within the maze that will transfer you to the next level

This tutorial was written for version 2.44 and has been tested for all later versions (as of April, 2008)




== Maze Surface ==

Now we'll make the maze.  When you are creating the path of the maze surface keep in mind that you need a start and a goal.

[[Image:MazeTutorial.01_grid-select.png|frame|Selecting the faces]]

# Clear the scene; Select all ('''AKEY'''), delete selected items ('''XKEY''' &amp;rarr; '''ENTER''')
# Go into top view ('''NUM7''')
# Add a grid ('''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; Add &amp;rarr; Mesh &amp;rarr; ''Grid'') with X and Y resolution of 16
# Scale grid by 24 times ('''SKEY''', type 24, '''ENTER''')
# Enter edit mode with the grid selected ('''TAB''')
# Go into face select mode ('''CTRL+TAB''' &amp;rarr; ''Faces'')
# Start selecting faces so as to make a two dimensional maze (use '''BKEY''' to draw selection boxes)
# With the faces selected, duplicate those faces ('''SHIFT+D''', '''RMB''')
# Move those faces away from the original grid ('''GKEY''' or the movement wiget '''CTR+ALT+GKEY''')
# Delete original grid
# Center your maze using '''GKEY''' or by pressing the '''Center''' button in the '''Mesh''' panel of the Editing buttons ('''F9''')
	

You should now have a two dimensional maze.  In the game engine, we only see one side of every face, so this maze will not appear to be there when seen from below, and will be obviously two dimensional when seen from the surface of the maze itself.  This is undesirable so we will make our maze 3 dimensional by extruding the maze surface down.

[[Image:MazeTutorial.14_maze-extruded.png|frame|The extruded maze]]

# Go into side view ('''NUM3''')
# Select all the faces ('''AKEY''')
# Extrude down, -1 unit ('''EKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Region''), hold '''CTR''' to constrain to 1 unit increments, or manually type in the value -1, like you scaled the grid in the beginning.
# '''LMB''' to accept the operation, or '''RMB''' to cancel the move of the faces.  If you cancel it, the faces will have extruded, but will simply not have moved.  You can undo the operation ('''CTRL+Z'''), or delete the vertices/faces you have extruded ('''WKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Remove Doubles'').


Your maze is now complete, only lacking someone trapped in it...

== Character ==

[[Image:MazeTutorial.02_cone-extrude.png|frame|Extruding a nose]]

We will create a very basic character sufficient to illustrate the concepts meant to be conveyed in this tutorial.  You can make a character as complex or basic as you desire, but it is important to always have an indicator of direction on your protagonist, otherwise the player may become confused.  So, we will use a primitive with a 'nose' (i.e. a face or vertex extruded away from the object center in order to provide a point of rotational reference).  I'll use a cone for this tutorial, simply because they don't roll very easily.

[[Image:MazeTutorial.03_cone-align.png|frame|Rotate to the direction character will move]]

# Enter top view ('''NUM7''')
# Add the cone ('''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Mesh'' &amp;rarr; ''Cone'', use default values)
# Select cone and enter Edit mode ('''TAB''')
# Enter face select mode ('''CTRL+TAB''' &amp;rarr; ''Faces'')
# Select a face on the side of the cone
# Extrude it about 1/4 of a unit or less ('''EKEY''')
# Merge the extruded face to make the nose pointy ('''WKEY''' &amp;rarr; ''Merge'' &amp;rarr; ''At Center'')
# Enter object mode ('''TAB''')
# Rotate the cone so the nose is aligned with the positive Y axis ('''RKEY''', align with the green arrow)


You've got your character now (Not exactly Pixar-like, but it will do for now).  Now we just need to give it motivation.


Note:  From points 8 to 9 it would seem that the cone should rotated so that the “nose” is aligned with thee Y-axis in object mode, but after doing this I encountered the cone still moved in the original Y-axis direction (before rotation).  To remedy this I did the alignment of the “nose” to the Y-axis in edit mode instead, this seems to have solved the problem.

== Motion ==

We'll now make the character move, via the use of the WASD keys. In order to do this, game logic needs to be associated with the WASD keys.  Copy the configuration seen in the screenshot, taking care to include the convex hull polytope collision in the top left as well as depressing the 'L' buttons, which make the force and torque local to that object rather than global.  If the force was global, the protagonist would continue moving in a straight line, even when turning.


# Go to the Logic buttons (The purple pac-man icon or '''F4''')
# Add four Sensors, Controllers and Actuators.
# Maximize the logic window ('''CTRL+UPKEY''')
# Copy the configuration seen in the screenshot below.


[[Image:MazeTutorial.04_character-logic.png]]

&lt;sub&gt;(Note: I made the simulation using Actor-&gt;Dynamic since there was no way to use both dynamic and rigid body in 2.49b. After some testing it appears to work correctly.)&lt;/sub&gt;

'''dLoc/dRot vs Force/Torque'''

The character logic in this tutorial is very similar to that of the previous platformer logic, but it differs in that it uses force and torque rather than dLoc and dRot, respectively.  The difference between these two is that force and torque move and rotate the object within the bullet physics engine, applying friction and collision to the process, whereas dLoc and dRot move and rotate the object without regard for any other 'actors' (objects factored in to the physics engine's calculations).  Although dLoc and dRot would serve in most maze games, many other instances demand force and torque.  However, most of these instances occur in more complicated games with a multitude of interactions with dynamic objects.  Later in this tutorial we will add dynamic objects to our maze, and the reasons for using force will become clear.

== Testing ==

Now the time has come for the first test of our game.  

# Add a light source well above the maze ('''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Lamp'' &amp;rarr; ''Lamp''), align in front view ('''NUM1''')
# Press '''NUM5''' to enter perspective viewmode, which gives a realistic view, rather than a view in which objects stay the same size with distance. Be sure to switch back to orthographic view when you are editing ('''NUM5''')
# Enter textured mode ('''ALT+ZKEY''') -- press '''ZKEY''' to switch back to solid view mode
# Switch into top view ('''NUM7''') or camera view once we install the camera ('''NUM0''')
# '''PKEY''' to play the game
# '''ESC''' to escape testing the game

If you receive a &quot;No camera&quot; error, disregard it.  We'll be adding a camera later.

If your character doesn't move at all make sure you drew the connecting 'wires' between the actuators in the logic panel, as well as setting the &quot;Actor&quot; &quot;Dynamic&quot; and &quot;Rigid Body&quot; buttons to True.

You should now have a nosy cone that speeds around the maze.

[[Image:MazeTutorial.05_mazegame-test.png]]


&lt;sub&gt;('''Noob Question: My cone likes to rotate without me pressing A or D.  It also likes to find hidden/nonexistant bumps on the maze surface.  How do I fix this? )

('''Answer''': If I understand your question right. If i used torque to turn and force to move forward and pressed forward then turned it started spinning out of control. My solution was to use rotation instead of torque.)
&lt;/sub&gt;

== Falling ==


	We will now implement the &quot;death on falling off maze&quot; feature.  In order to accomplish this, we'll add something that allows us to check whether the cone has fallen off the maze or not.  The simplest way to do this is with a 'skydome' object the entire maze is within, and although there are a number of more elegant ways to accomplish the goal, we will use the skydome method for its simplicity to replicate.
From now on we'll need to test the maze with both layers one and two enabled ('''SHIFT+2KEY''')

# Add a material to your cone called coneMat ('''F5''', press &quot;Add New&quot;, Links and Pipeline, Link to Object, MA:coneMat).
# Add a new cube
# resize it to gargantuan proportions ('''SKEY''', just large enough to encompass the maze, and all within it)
# Move it to layer 2 ('''MKEY''', '''2KEY''', '''Enter''')


Now that you have a massive cube, go to the logic panel and add one Sensor, Controller, Actuator set, and set them as seen in the screenshot.

# Sensor: Touch, coneMat   
# Controller: And   
# Actuator: Scene, restart


[[Image:MazeTutorial.06_cube-touch.png]]

Enable the actor button and press &quot;ghost&quot; this will let the dynamic obstacles, which are added later on, fall through and not get stuck there!


If you test you game now, you should see the game be restarted when you fall off the maze.  As we discussed earlier, faces are one-sided in the game engine, so you should not be able to see the cube.



&lt;sub&gt;(''Newbie Question 1'': When I did this, my cone just kept on falling. When I moved the cube back to layer 1, it worked fine. Am I missing something?)
(newb note: ok i had the same problem everytime i was just in layer 1 but when i was just in 1 then i just kept falling)

(''Answer'': The tutorial says to create the cube in layer 2, although the layer shouldn't matter.  Make sure you test the game with both layers one '''and''' two selected.  Also double check the logic for the 'skycube')

(''Answer2'': I had the same problem.  I fixed this by replacing the cube with a grid, scaled and placed under the maze.  The grid had the touch logic mentioned above.)

(''Answer3'': Same here. I thought I'd remove &quot;coneMat&quot; from the material reference, but that wouldn't do if the bricks fell down and touched the cube, it'd just restart the level... the solution: create a property in the cone, a bool value named &quot;isCone&quot; (=true), then in the cube add a sensor 'collision' that checks for the object's property 'isCone' and keep the rest as shown.)

(''Answer4 (to restart when block hits cube)'':Do all as the pic shows you and RMB the cone and go to links and pipelines and rename the MA: to cone or whatever you want, then RMB the cube then in the Touch sensor then rename the MA: to whatever you called the other MA: .  :D this is in 24.9b)  

(''Answer5'': For blender 2.57a you need to place a plane or something under the maze. Then give it (touch -&gt; and -&gt; Scene(restart)) game logic. If it isn't working make sure that actor is selected under physics tab.)

(''Question 2'': How do I make the box translucent? Right now all I see, also when testing, is the skybox. Also, when I put the box underneath the maze, it works fine, but then none of the objects have shading, while when not showing layer 2 everything looks shaded. Can anybody give a solution? This is in 2.48a)

(''Answer'': To make something transparent- press '''F5'''; press the &quot;Material Buttons&quot; button; under the Links and Pipeline tab press Halo and ZTransp, unpress Shadbuf; under Material make A 0.000.)

(''Answer 2'': My solution was to press the Invisible button (Logic section, next to Ghost in 2.49))

&lt;/sub&gt;


-------------------------------------

I have put in a new way to die. Add a static Plane, give it a property called Killer and place it just below the level. Add an ALWAYS sensor and connect it to a MOTION actuator that has 0.01 as the top last value. This way it will sloooowly come up. Now, select the player and add a COLLISION sensor. For the property, add Killer. Connect it to a GAME actuator, select Start New Game. You've just added some tension to your game! If you run out of time, you will touch the floor and restart! If you need more time, just put another 0 in 0.01 so it will look like 0.001
Sorry if you can't understand it very well, this is the first time I edited a page on Wikipedia + I don't speak English very well. Have fun! :)

== Camera ==

'''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Camera'' near the protagonist cone.  There are two easy ways to do the camera: logic camera and child camera. In this case you might be better off with the logic camera, but it really is a matter of personal preference.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Logic Camera:''' Add to the camera's logic panel 
# Sensor: Always
# Controller: And
# Actuator: Camera, to object &quot;Cone&quot; (or whatever your protagonist is called--look under the object panel when you have the protagonist selected) height 5, min 5, max 10.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
'''Child Camera:''' Select the camera, then select the protagonist (order is important) then '''CTRL+PKEY''' to parent the cone to the camera.  Align the camera in a view that you like, and test the game.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
'''First Person Camera:''' Well, this one doesn't really count as another method, but if you're willing to redo your motion to just move the camera instead of the character, (just do everything you did for the character for the camera) you can run around in the first person. Or you can just put the camera in the cone because one of the sides always are invisible (look in texture mode) and parent it to the cone. REMEMBER: To access the ingame camera during gameplay, before you start, hit ctrl 0 or you can go to (view &gt; camera)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;sub&gt; (''Newb Question 1'': No matter what I do (even delete the camera!), when I hit 0 or ctrl+0, I always see either only the death plane (I used a plane below the maze instead of a cube around it) or nothing, depending if I have layer 2 selected or not.  There's only the one camera (or none, if I delete it), according to the Oops Schematic.  What's wrong?)

(''Answer'': Ctrl+0 assigns the selected object as a camera. To solve your problem select your camera and press ctrl+0, to enter camera view press 0)
&lt;/sub&gt;

== Beautification ==

Blender is a great 3D modeling program, and with such a vast number of tools at your disposal, you should be able to make your game look better than this:

[[Image:MazeTutorial.09_no-textures.png]]

We'll add one or two textures to each of our objects.  

[[Image:MazeTutorial.10_edit-material.png|frame|Press the 'new' button then the 'assign' button to assign a material to a number of faces]]

# Select the object you want to texture
# Go into edit mode if you want your object to have more than one color
# Select all the faces you are going to assign to a color ('''CTRL+TAB''' → ''Faces'')
# Go to the edit panel ('''F9''') on the buttons window
# Near the left there should be a panel that says &quot;Link and Materials&quot;.  Click on the buttons highlighted in the screenshot
# Adjust the color of that material by going to the material buttons and changing the &quot;Col&quot; (color) value to something other than white


[[Image:MazeTutorial.11_with-materials.png|frame|Maze game with materials]]



It looks better now, but when the camera is nearly horizontal, you can see where the camera stops rendering the maze.  You can fix this by selecting the camera and, in its edit buttons, changing its clipping range... but there is a better way.  Mist.

[[Image:MazeTutorial.12_with-mist.png|frame|With mist and raised sections]]





Mist obscures everything a certain distance away, is the same color as the world texture, and can be handy.  We'll add some mist to our game so the player can't see too far ahead of him, thus making the game too easy.


We'll make the mist quite close, although you can vary the distance.  Go to the Material button, and to the World sub-buttons, then copy the settings in the screenshot.  '''When you test this out, make sure you are in texture mode to see the mist.'''

[[Image:MazeTutorial.13_mist-buttons.png]]


&lt;sub&gt;
(''Question'': I copied the screenshot but i can't get the mist to work. What's going on?)

(''Answer'': Change Start to a smaller value like 15.)
&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;(''Question'': Is the screenshot correct, or are my sizes different. I found that a mist distance of 10 was barely visible, yet a distance of 1 had a much better effect. Is this normal?)&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;(''Question'': I have been able to create the mist, and can see it when I start the game, but the background colour is still grey, so the maze is obscured but everywhere else is still grey.
&lt;/sub&gt;

== Levels ==

Now all that remains is to create the next level with some obstacles.
# Add a cube at the end of the maze, just above the floor level so the cone can touch it ('''SPACE''' → ''Add'' → ''Mesh'' → ''Cube'')
# Press the Scene dropdown menu and select &quot;ADD NEW&quot; → ''Full copy''
# You can now go back to the Maze Surface section to make a new maze mesh
# Go back to level one via the Scene menu
# Select the End of level cube
# Change its logic panel to resemble this:


* Sensor: Touch, coneMat
* Controller: And
* Actuator: Scene, Set Scene, Scene.001 (or whatever you named your level 2)

&lt;sub&gt;(noob: When I went into level 2 my player name changed to coneMat.001 and I had to change all my goals and the giant restart cube assignments.) ''Answer: Rename the coneMat.001 to whatever you had the material named for the first scene - this fixed it for me.''

(noob: In my level 2 my cone hits the cube and nothing happens!) ''Answer: Make sure that the Sensors, Controllers and Actuators tabs under the Logic panel (F4) are connected with wires.''&lt;/sub&gt;

(noob: When I went to level two I can't see anything!
 
[[Image:MazeTutorial.15_scene-button.png|frame|The scene button is on the top panel]]

To make it so multiple objects have to be touched (or acquired by the character, as it may be), give each object the logic settings described above and change the actuator type to Message with the subject &quot;goalget&quot;. If you'd like the object to disappear after it is collected, add an Edit Object actuator to the object of the type &quot;End Object&quot;, and link it to the existing AND controller.

Next, select the massive cube that restarts the level upon contact with the character. If you chose not to include one such cube, create an empty at the start of the level (so you can easily find it again later). Give the cube or empty the following logical operators:

* Sensor: Message, goalget
* Controller: And
* Actuator: Property, Add, wincon, -1

* Sensor: Property, Equal, wincon, 0
* Controller: And
* Actuator: Scene, Set Scene, Scene.001 (or whatever you named your level 2)

Then click &quot;Add Property&quot; and give it the Type Int, the Name wincon, and a value equal to the number of objects needed to be collected to complete the level (if all of them, make it equal to the number contained in the level). This can be expanded to include other multiple win conditions besides the collection of an item by making the completion of each condition subtract from &quot;wincon&quot;.

You now have a multilevel maze game.  Feel free to elaborate on the gameplay mechanics and models so they look better.

''Noob note:  I typed in where i thought everything should go but it's not doing anything.  I'm not sure of what I'm looking for while in playmode.''

== Dynamic obstacles ==

This part of the tutorial will assume increased skills and knowledge of the Blender interface and basic commands.  As such, this section will be written less specifically, and the shortcuts for all basic commands will not be covered here.  From this point on, this tutorial is of an intermediate level.  If you cannot follow this part of the tutorial, you can learn the basic functions used below in an [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Learn_to_Model earlier tutorial].

We will now add some dynamic obstacles.  In this case, they will constitute a 'brick' wall that can be broken through by your character.

# Add a cube
# Scale it (in edit mode) to the dimensions 1,0.5,0.5
# Bevel it (WKEY) recursion 1, size 0.03 (press space to enter value manually)
# In logic panel, set it to Actor, Dynamic, Rigid body, Mass 0.5
# Go right below that to click Bounds and leave it on &quot;Box&quot;.  That makes Blender realize that what you added is a box, and should act like it (instead of rolling, it will slide now)
# Move it to an intersection in your maze (GKEY) and duplicate it until you have a brick wall (ALT DKEY, LMB)

[[Image:MazeTutorial.08_brick-wall.png]]

You now have a barrier that your character can break through.

By using this

== Conclusion ==

You have now learned enough of the Blender Game Engine (BGE) to create your own game.  If you wish to go very far into Blender games, I recommend you learn Python, as trying to make a full game within the graphical interface for the BGE is like trying to dig a grave with the blunt half of a toothpick.  Blindfolded. And the toothpick is glued to your forehead. However, you are now well on your way to becoming a game-maker!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smooth Movement ==
Smooth movement in Scratch Projects is difficult to achieve when you use a &quot;when (key) key pressed&quot; from the control tab. To make smooth movement you need to use &quot;forever&quot; loops, from control, and &quot;&lt;key (key) pressed?&gt;&quot;, from sensing. For example, this script:

[[image:Scratch Screenshot, Smooth Move Script.png]]

works far more efficiently than this script:

[[image:Screen shot 2010-01-01 at 4.11.55 PM.png]]

In all of the tutorials below you will use movement techniques based around this idea.
== Side View Platformers ==
In side view platformers it is typical to use &quot;velocity&quot; to control the movement of the sprite.
This is your guide to advanced programming of movement with the Velocity variable.
&quot;Velocity&quot; is just the name of a variable, just because it is named velocity doesn't make a difference.
However, the concept of velocity adds a complex and advanced motion system to your project.

== Y Velocity ==
Using yVelocity will help you create a semi-realistic and dynamic gravity system.
To start this session of testing arrange the stage like this:

[[image:Scratch_Screenshot,_Stage.gif]]

Then in the Cat sprite make this script:

[[image:Scratch Screenshot, Gravity Script.png]]

'''Text of the comment block (if you can't read it):'''
This is a basic jumping script. We'll start by breaking it down. The first if statement with the set yVelocity to 0 block in it is there so the cat will not fall through the ground. The next if with the set yVelocity to 15 block in it will function if the cat is on the ground and the up arrow is pressed and will make the cat jump.
Out of that set of ifs the change y by yVelocity will make him fall or rise depending on the velocity variable. And the change yVelocity by -1 is gravity.

Remember that you can change the 15 in the &quot;set [yVelocity] to [15]&quot; in the script to make the cat jump higher.

That covers Y Velocity. Now it is time for X Velocity.

== X Velocity ==
&quot;xVelocity&quot; will help you make movement along the X Axis seem more realistic.
Start by arranging your stage like this:

[[image:Scratch_Screenshot,_Stage2.gif]]

Then in the Cat sprite make the following script:

[[image:Scratch Screenshot, Running Script.png]]

'''Text of the comment block (if you couldn't read it):'''
This is the basic script needed to move a sprite along the X Axis with velocity. maxSpeed can be any number you want depending on how fast you want your sprite to go. The first two if statements will change the xVelocity variable by certain numbers. These numbers can change if you want the sprite to move faster.
The next if-else will make the sprite point in the direction he is moving.
The block: change x by xVelocity will make him move depeding on how fast he is going. The last block is friction and will make the sprite eventually slow to a halt

Now if you combine these two scripts you have perfect jumping and running. I hope this helped answer your questions. If you need any further information post your question and I'll reply as soon as possible.

*[[Radiation Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/General#Neutrons|General Head &amp; Neck]]
*[[Radiation Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/Salivary_gland#Neutron_Therapy|Salivary Glands]]

==Overview==
*Initial use of neutrons for clinical treatment occurred 1936-1943, but resulted in significant late effects
*By 1960's, radiobiology of neutrons was better understood, and a cyclotron was constructed at the Hammersmith Hospital in London. In USA, physics-lab based devices were used for initial pilot trials.
*In 1984, University of Washington commissioned a high-energy neutron generator for clinical beam delivery, with NCI funding 
*Neutrons can be delivered via several modalities
**External beam neutron therapy
**Boron-neutron capture therapy
**Neutron brachytherapy via Californium-252
*Most clinical trials were inconclusive, and enthusiasm about neutrons as a treatment modality waned</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The phenomenon known as “false friends” happens between two languages, like Spanish and English, when there are two words sounding very similar because they come from the same root but their meaning is completely different. There are many “false friends” involving English and Spanish.  Here you have some examples (but you can add more, so as to make up a full list):

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Norwegian uses all 26 letters in English, along with the letters Æ, Ø, and Å. However, the letters c, q, w, x, and z are only used in loanwords.

There are two types of written Norwegian: Bokmål and Nynorsk. In 2005, about 86.3% of native Norwegians use Bokmål, 5.5% use both Bokmål and Nynorsk, and 7.5% only use Nynorsk. This means that about 91.8% of Norwegians use Bokmål, while only 15% use Nynorsk.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|loanword|a word in a language that comes from a word that is not from that language.  For English, café is a loanword, since it was originally from French.}}

==How many people speak this language?==
About 4.7 million, or 4,700,700, people speak Norwegian, making it the 144th highest language in number of speakers.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Norwegian is an official language of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Norway|Norway]] and the Nordic Council. The Nordic Council is a group of countries from Northern Europe. It is similar to the European Union.

==What is the history of this language?==
Norwegian comes from an ancient language called Old Norse. In 782, King Harald Fairhair united Norway. Christianity came to Norway around 1030. Christianity brought with it the Latin alphabet, which is the one used today. Before then, a '''runic''' alphabet was used. In the 800s, Old Norse began to separate into Eastern and Western '''dialects'''. Eventually, Western Norse changed and changed until it became Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian around the year 1300. From 1350 to 1525, Old Norwegian changed more until it turned into Middle and then Modern Norwegian, the kind used today.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|runic|having to do with runes.  Some runic letters that still exist today are the Icelandic letters Þ and Ð.  These letters are ''not'' used in Norwegian, however.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|dialect|a variety of a language.  Standard Østnorsk is the kind of Norwegian taught to people who are learning it as a second language.}}

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Some famous Norwegian writers are Henrik Wergeland, Henrik Ibsen, Knut Hamsun, and Sigrid Unset. Hamsun and Unset even got Nobel Prizes for their works!

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
The Ottoman Turkish language uses a variety of the Persian alphabet made specifically for Ottoman Turkish.  The Persian alphabet itself comes from the Arabic alphabet.  The Ottoman Turkish alphabet is cursive, which means that the letters are connected.  Thus, there can be 4 different forms of just one letter: one for when the letter is at the beginning of a word, one for in the middle of a word, one for at the end, and one for when it's all by itself!  There are 34 letters in all; here is a table of all of them.
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Ottoman Turkish Table}}

==How many people speak this language?==
Since Ottoman Turkish was replaced with Modern Turkish in 1928, very few people speak the original Ottoman Turkish language.
==Where is this language spoken?==
Ottoman Turkish was spoken in the Ottoman Empire, which lasted from 1299 to 1922. That's over 600 years! At its height, the Ottoman Empire stretched from Qatar, to Hungary, to Somalia, to Algeria, covering 3 continents! Since Ottoman Turkish was replaced with modern Turkish it is spoken in very few places.

==What is the history of this language?==
Until the 1500s, a language called Old Ottoman Turkish was spoken. From the 16th century until 1839, a type called Middle Ottoman Turkish thrived. When most people think of this language, they think of this era. From the 1850s to the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, Modern Ottoman Turkish was alive. This type of Ottoman Turkish was influenced by Western culture.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|influenced|affected.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Western culture|Culture coming from Europe.  Culture from Asia is called Eastern culture.}}

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Agah Efendi published the first Turkish newspaper. Ibrahim Muteferrika was an Hungarian Ottoman Turk who created the first Muslim printing press.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Muslim|one who follows the religion of Islam.}}

== The First Political Parties in New Zealand ==

Before the formation of political parties in New Zealand, MPs were all independent, although nearing the end of the nineteenth century, they had grouped themselves into two loose factions, liberalism and conservatism. 

The liberalist group were the first to unite and form the ''Liberal Party'' in the 1890s, which began its rule as the Government in 1891.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Danish uses all 26 letters in English, plus the letters Æ, Ø, and Å. The letters c, q, w, x, and z are only used in words that are not of Danish origin, however.
==How many people speak this language?==
About 6 million people speak Danish, making it the 103rd highest language in number of speakers.
==Where is this language spoken?==
Danish is mostly spoken in Denmark ([[Wikijunior:Europe/Denmark|click here to learn about Denmark]]), Greenland, the Faroe Islands, the [[Wikijunior:Europe/EU|European Union]], and the Nordic Council.

==What is the history of this language?==
Danish ultimately comes from a language called Old Norse. Eventually this language splitted into two languages: Old West Norse, which would turn into Norwegian and Icelandic, and Old East Norse, which turned into Swedish and Danish. Eventually, Old East Norse evolved into the Danish we know today.
==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
The most famous Danish author is probably Hans Christian Andersen. He made stories such as The Little Mermaid and The Ugly Duckling. 

Christiern Pedersen is also known for translating the Bible's Old Testament into Danish.

Søren Kierkegaard a 19th century Danish philosopher and theologian.

|Der er et yndigt land,

det står med brede bøge

nær salten østerstrand

Det bugter sig i bakke, dal,

det hedder gamle Danmark

og det er Frejas sal


Vort gamle Danmark skal bestå,

så længe bøgen spejler

sin top i bølgen blå
|There is a lovely country

with spreading, shady beeches

Near the salty Baltic beach

Its hills and valleys gently roll,

its name is old Denmark,

And it is Freya's hall


Our old Denmark shall remain

as long the beech reflects

it's top in the blue waves

==Availability==
The SVC instruction is available on all models, 360, 370 and z/System.
==Purpose of Instruction==
This instruction is used to allow a program to call the operating system in order to request services.  The operand is the Supervisor Call number, which is in the range 0 to 255 (decimal).  The value of the operand is operating system dependent.  Typically, a supervisor call is made after loading certain machine registers with values. Supervisor Calls may or may not return information.  They may return the information in registers, or in specific fields which were passed in the original call.

In some cases, a supervisor call will never return.  Either the call is invalid and the program is terminated, or the call is in fact the operating system call to terminate the program.  Some operating systems have privileged SVCs which are not available to user programs, and not all operating systems use all SVC values.

==Typical Usage==
Typically a supervisor call is used as part of an Operating System macro.  For example, under OS/VS1 the WTO macro issues an SVC 35.  Some operating systems will provide services to various parts of itself by using a &quot;privileged&quot; supervisor call.  The supervisor call is not technically a privileged instruction, it is that the operating system will not allow a non-privileged program to use that particular supervisor call and will either fault the program or return an error depending on what the supervisor call manager has been programmed to do.

==Operation==
When a supervisor call instruction occurs, the program counter is advanced by two, the PSW is stored in the &quot;Supervisor Call Old PSW Address,&quot; the supervisor call number is stored in the &quot;Interrupt Number address&quot;, and the new PSW is loaded from the &quot;Supervisor Call New PSW address&quot; all of which differ from model to model.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin:0.5em auto; font-size:95%;text-align: center;&quot;

||448-463
|}
&lt;br/&gt;
:'''&lt;big&gt;[1]&lt;/big&gt;''' Bits 5 and 6 of byte 137 are set to 01&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unless the SVC was the result of an [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/EX|EXECUTE]] instruction, then they are set to 10&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; the rest of the bits are cleared.  Byte 139 contains the SVC number; the other bytes are zeroed.

The supervisor call routine has access to the memory and registers of the calling routine, and can use these to retrieve arguments and/or return results.  The registers used differ for each operating system, e.g. OS/VS1, MVS, and VM would usually use registers 1 and 0 and sometimes 14 or 15; the same is true for the [[w:VS/9|VS/9]] operating system on the [[w:Univac 90/60|Univac 90/60]], 90/70 and 90/80 mainframe computers, while Linux on S/390 uses registers 0 through 6 depending on the number of arguments and may use 14 or 15 in some instances.  The register usage for supervisor calls is a ''convention'' established by general usage, not mandated by the hardware.

The supervisor call routine will typically exit by using the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/LPSW|LPSW]] instruction from the address of the Supervisor Call Old PSW address to return to the instruction in the calling program after the SVC instruction. The method the SVC will return information may be through registers or changes in memory which the user pointed to via registers or argument lists in registers.  The results and values are operating-system dependent. 
==Condition Codes==
Condition codes are changed to the value of the condition codes stored in the condition code bits of the PSW stored at the Supervisor Call New PSW address.
==Exceptions and Faults==
The Supervisor Call is a non-privileged instruction, and will not cause a program exception.  The specific SVC number to use for any particular service is assigned by the operating system the program runs under, and if incorrect, the operating system may terminate the program (or transfer control to an exception routine in some cases.)

[[Image:Dudley-Ward_William_Vanity_Fair_1900-03-29.jpg|thumb|right|William Dudley-Ward]]The serene profile of William Dudley-Ward caught my eye in the fall of 1986. His &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; print was posted in a bookstore window near Trinity College, Cambridge, where he had been C.U.B.C. President in 1900. Finding the £40 asking price a bit steep for a student budget, I shrugged and walked on, later to reconsider and start sliding down the collector’s slippery slope. At first content with only a few, I soon bought more prints, then will power gave way and finding the rest became an obsession, and then it occurred to me that obtaining the full official list might not complete the collection.


The problem lay in the cataloguing. Over 2300 prints were published in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; in its lifetime (1868 - 1914), roughly one a week. The editors never published a comprehensive list but did from time to time offer select groups for sale, such as this one August 5, 1908, the date rower R.B. Etherington-Smith appeared:

Unfortunately, the list is incomplete as it omits men such as J.J. Hornby, the Provost of Eton, who rowed for Oxford in 1849. It also omits accomplished oarsmen who happened not to row at “University,” i.e., Oxford or Cambridge. H.E. Searle, “Professional Champion Sculler of the World” in 1889, and B.J. Angle, who won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1878 with Thames R.C., come to mind. Moreover, the list errs by including three men – Crossley, Bowen, and Jordan -- who had no particular connection to rowing, university or otherwise.


Somewhat better are the lists later compiled by various dealers and collectors that classify the prints based on the appearance of the subject in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; and the accompanying biographical notes. One of the more definitive lists, from Clive A. Burden, Inc., comprises sixty-eight categories. “Sports -- Rowing” lists twenty-two entries, consisting mainly of Oxford and Cambridge rowers and coaches from 1889 to 1912, plus Mr. Searle, the lone professional. But the Clive Burden list, and others like it, omits several men whose connection to rowing was at least as significant as those listed, but who were catalogued differently because they appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; for other reasons. J.W. Chitty, for instance, rowed for Oxford in three Boat Races and umpired the event from 1857-71 and 1873-80, but appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; as a chancery judge and thus is catalogued among the 200 or so “Legals.”


So who are the rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;? If one finds &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s list of “University Oarsmen” and the somewhat different Clive Burden list too limiting, the question becomes wholly subjective. A true enthusiast might opt for every man who ever rowed at school, university, or in a club. That would inflate the headcount to over 100, due largely to the number of old Etonians who appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; at some point in their lives. Alternatively, one might raise the bar to admit only those who were genuinely successful on the river. That would cut back the number and improve average quality, but would still be subjective and would knock out one from Clive Burden, Rev. E.J.H. Smith of Pembroke College, Cambridge (&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; , January 28, 1888), whose greatest aquatic accomplishment was as a coach “animating the toils of the fifth boat.” Accordingly, this book takes a middle road, not without faults but at least clear and manageable: anyone who appeared in the magazine mainly in connection with rowing (Rev. Smith makes the cut) or who rowed at Henley or for Oxford or Cambridge Universities (the lesser Etonians do not). The result by my reckoning is fifty-three, of which the original drawings for sixteen reside in the National Portrait Gallery.


[[Image:Mackinnon_Duncan_The_World_1910.jpg|thumb|right|Duncan Mackinnon, O.U.B.C. President for the 1910 Boat Race, by “Spy” (Leslie Ward), for THE WORLD , not for VANITY FAIR]]To be sure, the focus on rowing, and this particular way of focusing on rowing, makes for a strange history. We have great Boat Race and Henley rowers of the era, but not all of the best or only the best. We have most of the “Spy” prints of rowers, but not all as F.I. Pitman, E.G. Williams, and D. Mackinnon appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rather than in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;The World&lt;/span&gt; in the early 1900s. Of the fifty-three, only three managed not to attend Eton, Oxford, or Cambridge, so the selection hardly represents a random sampling of British society. But “men are often known, remembered and immortalized -- especially abroad -- by some idiosyncrasy selected by the capriciousness of time,” observed Leslie Ward in 1915, recalling his long career as “Spy,” &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;most prolific artist. “Looking back to-day it is strange to read in light of great events these miniature biographies of politicians now forgotten, of others who left their party to go over, of statesmen, of judges who sat on important cases and are now only remembered in connection with a trivial poisoner, an impostor in a claim, of careers then unproved but now shining clearly in the light of fame, and of others whose light is extinguished -- all within so short a lapse of time.”


The pages that follow present the fifty-three more or less in sequence of their rowing careers, from the last days of King William IV through the reign of Queen Victoria to the cusp of the 1914-18 war. For brevity only the individual portraits are reprinted, though six of the rowers appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;semiannual group “doubles”: “Birth, Behaviour, and Business” by Théobald Chartran , July 5, 1881 (S.H. Northcote); “The Gladstone Cabinet” also by Chartran, November 27, 1883 (C.W. Dilke); “Tattersall’s, Newmarket” by Liberio Prosperi, December 6, 1887 (E. Boscawen); “In Vanity Fair,” an unsigned composite (November 29, 1890) (A.L. Smith); “Bench and Bar” by “Stuff,” December 5, 1891 (W.B. Brett and A.L. Smith); and “Cycling in Hyde Park” by Hal Hurst, June 11, 1896 (W.H. Grenfell). The chronology bears no relationship to the order in which their prints appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, and thus makes it harder to flip the pages to see the evolution of the graphic and editorial styles, but does cluster contemporaries and facilitates the rowing story. As for the story, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; and the rowers themselves tell nearly all of it. Starting with S.H. Northcote and ending with “Cygnet” Swann, the reader will find for each entry the signature lithograph or two from &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, the biographical note that accompanied it (set off in italics), a supplemental biography to round out his story, and an excerpt from &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; or another source, either about the rower in question or a complimentary theme. The rowers are clustered in groups of seven to sixteen, punctuated by chapter introductions. Photographs, illustrations, and other images are sprinkled liberally throughout, courtesy of Thomas E. Weil, Jr., who has lent most generously from his wonderful collection of rowing ephemera.


Throughout all this my own limited commentary as “an amiable and sympathetic foreigner” aims to “attain the impersonal perspective proper to the true historian,” as T.A. Cook put it. There are three reasons for this approach. First, the magazine was blessed to have Walter Bradford Woodgate provide the rowing coverage in most of the years there was any to speak of. (More about him below.) Second, Woodgate, the other &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; authors, and the rowers themselves provide an authentic period voice, limiting early twenty-first century nostalgia, or anti-nostalgia, from creeping into the mix. Finally, the original sources let one keep one’s head down, a good idea given how prickly rowers can be about their sport. As G.C. Bourne, father of the penultimate &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rower R.C. Bourne, observed over sixty years ago during the religious debate over rowing styles: “There is good reason for this wariness, for the rowing fraternity is a close corporation, jealous of its reputation and inclined to be hypersensitive and hypercritical to a degree which would astonish those who do not belong to it.”</text>

=== “Benjie” (Spy), March 15, 1894 ===

[[Image:Cotton_HB_Vanity_Fair_1894-03-15.jpg|thumb|right]]''The youngest son of the late Lord Justice Cotton, he was born two-and-twenty years ago, went to “Badger” Hale’s House at Eton, and began his aquatic career by steering an Eton Trial Eight to victory.  Then he got promoted to an oar, and rowed in a winning Trial; yet did not row in the Eton Eight.  Three and a-half years ago he went to Magdalen, Oxford; and being an Eton boy who was found able to pull a lively oar, he became bow of the Dark Blue Eight two years ago.  He kept that place last year, and he will again fill it on Saturday; having in the meantime been improved into the smallest President of a University Boat Club on record.  For his College he has twice rowed Head of the River.  He has also won the University Fours and the University Pairs; while at Henley he has helped a Leander crew to win the Grand Challenge, and his College to win the Stewards’ Cup.''

''He is a very muscular, good-looking little fellow of five and a-half feet in height, whose proper weight is ten stone.  He is a rather retiring, yet quite independent, amiable boy who can say nasty things when he likes with effect; and he is strong in his antipathies.  He is reading law for his Final School, and he reads it at odd times; yet he loves his Shakespeare and is a hardened theatre-goer.  He is President of Vincent’s.''

	''They call him “Ben” and “Benjie”; and they say that he confidently expects to show Cambridge the way to Mortlake on Saturday.''


For a five-and-half footer to become a winning oarsman is unusual; to win the Boat Race four times and the Grand twice, remarkable.  Hugh Benjamin Cotton (1872-95) did so, albeit with help from crews that outweighed him at least two stone a man (other than the cox, of course).  Another of Nickall’s “absolute classics”{{ref|Nickalls}}  --  at bow, where he always rowed -- Cotton was the only man in the winning 1895 Oxford boat not to get influenza during race week.  But soon thereafter a “severe attack of inflammation of the lungs” kept him out of Henley and the Oxford summer races, and that fall he succumbed to consumption from a chill caught at Oxford while coaching in the floods, and passed away on October 22.  In response to his death and those of two other Oxford oarsmen a year and a half later, their coach, Rudie Lehmann, mustered the evidence to show that rowing ''per se'' was not the culprit.  More sympathetically and for Cotton alone, Lehmann also penned an elegy, “Frater Ave Atque Vale,” concluding:


''Though lost and dead, you die not here;''&lt;br&gt;
''And, wheresoever men may range''&lt;br&gt;
''Who once at Oxford held you dear''&lt;br&gt;
''And called you friend, you know no change:''&lt;br&gt;
''Still shall we see you stride along,''&lt;br&gt;
''Smiling and resolute and strong.''

''We shall grow old, but you abide''&lt;br&gt;
''In all our hearts as staunch and true''&lt;br&gt;
''And young as when on Thames’s tide''&lt;br&gt;
''You gripped your oar and won your Blue --''&lt;br&gt;
''But hush!  I hear the passing bell,''&lt;br&gt;
''Oh dearest friend, farewell, farewell''{{ref|Frater}}&lt;br&gt;



# {{note|Nickalls}}  G. Nickalls, &lt;u&gt;Life’s a Pudding&lt;/u&gt;, p. 211.
# {{note|Frater}}  R.C. Lehmann, “Frater Ave Atque Vale,” in &lt;u&gt;''Anni Fugaces'':  A Book of Verse with Cambridge Interludes&lt;/u&gt;, p. 20.  The elegy’s title -- “Brother Hail and Farewell” -- comes from the final lines of poem 101 of Catullus, to his dead brother.</text>

      <comment>/* Where is this language spoken? */ Replaced some existing countries with more prevalent Czech-Speaking populations.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Czech uses all 26 letters in English, 15 variants of certain letters, and 1 digraph to make 42 letters in all. Here they are in order:

:A, Á, B, C, Č, D, Ď, E, É, Ě, F, G, H, Ch, I, Í, J, K, L, M, N, Ň, O, Ó, P, Q, R, Ř, S, Š, T, Ť, U, Ú, Ů, V, W, X, Y, Ý, Z, Ž

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|digraph|when two letters are used to write one sound.}}

==How many people speak this language?==
Czech is spoken by 12 million people, making it the 66th most common language in number of speakers.

==Where is this language spoken?==
Czech is an official language in the [[Wikijunior:Europe/EU|European Union]] and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Czech Republic|Czech Republic]]. It is also spoken by immigrants in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[w:Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Germany|Germany]], and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Poland|Poland]]. 

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|immigrant|someone who moves to a country they were not born in.}}

==What is the history of this language?==
Czech comes from a language called Old Slavic. From the second half of the 12th century until the end of the 13th century, a new language evolved from Old Slavic: Early Old Czech. Around 1406, Jan Hus suggested a new way of writing Czech: the kind used today. Near the end of the 1500s, the Bible of Kralice was completed. This book became an example of how to write Czech. From the 1780s to the 1840s, the Czech National Revival occurred. During this time, Czech saw a &quot;golden age&quot; of an increase in number of words, changes to grammar, and the changing of Hus' style of writing Czech. In 1902, Jan Gebauer published rules for Czech writing. Since the end of World War II in 1945, differences in Czech dialects began slowly getting more and more similar.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Karel and Josef Čapek were the creators of the word &quot;robot&quot;. Karel was nominated for a Nobel Prize in 1936.

|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; |This project is a complete survey of Ancient History, listed by country and divided into the categories of Old World, New World, and Miscellaneous. The free nature of this project opens it to modification and change.

Instead of a chronological approach to history, this text assumes a geographical perspective.  However, as it is important to also understand broad patterns within ancient history, each chapter covers a variety of material, though its title may suggest a specific region rather than a time period.
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;'''[[/Introduction/]]'''&lt;/big&gt;

''The study of ancient history covers the period between the origins of human beings' ancestors, and either the fall of Rome and Han-dynasty China, or the rise of Islam.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Geography|'''Chapter 1''' - World Geography]]&lt;/big&gt;

''One of the most difficult part of ancient history to study is that the physical geography of the planet is largely the same.  However, the political boundaries are unfamiliar to many who are learning for the first time.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Human Evolution|'''Chapter 2''' - Human Evolution]]&lt;/big&gt;

''Before there were cities or writing, human beings lived on Earth.  How they lived, and how they got to be human, are matters of intense, passionate debate.  This chapter examines the scientific perspective on the origins of human beings in the deep past, as well as the ways in which humans as a whole advanced between three million years and ten thousand years before the present-day.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Ancient Near East|'''Chapter 3''' - The Ancient Near East]]&lt;/big&gt;

''The Ancient Near East is considered the cradle of civilization. It was the first to practice intensive year-round agriculture; it produced the first writing system, invented the potter's wheel and then the vehicular- and mill wheels, created the first centralized governments, law codes and empires, as well as introducing social stratification, slavery and organized warfare, and it laid the foundation for the fields of astronomy and mathematics.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Egypt|'''Chapter 4''' - Ancient Egypt]]&lt;/big&gt;

''From 5000BCE up till modern times, explore the history of the pyramids.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/China|'''Chapter 5''' - Ancient China]]&lt;/big&gt;

''See how the country of over 1 billion people began.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Indian subcontinent|'''Chapter 6''' - Ancient India]]&lt;/big&gt;

''Giving rise to Hinduism and Buddhism...''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Greece|'''Chapter 7''' - Ancient Greece]]&lt;/big&gt;

''Western civilization today views the culture of ancient Greece as one of its early ancestors.  From the Greeks come ideas about democracy and freedom, theater, literature, science and ethics still considered important in the Western world today. The truth may be more complicated.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Rome|'''Chapter 8''' - Ancient Rome]]&lt;/big&gt;

''From a small village to one of the most powerful empires and through the eventual collapse.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Iran|'''Chapter 9''' - Ancient Iran]]&lt;/big&gt;

''An area of land that was home to many civilizations such as the Persian dynasties of the Seleucids, Sassanids and Parthians. ''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Islam|'''Chapter 10''' - Islam]]&lt;/big&gt;

''Although not a geographical region, Islam is very important in ancient history and deserves its own chapter.  Borrowing from the civilizations that went before, while adding new religious and cultural elements on top of them, Islam sprung from the Arabian peninsula in the early 8th century CE, to create a culture that served as a bridge between China, India, Africa and Europe.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Americas|'''Chapter 11''' - The Ancient Americas]]&lt;/big&gt;

''North and South America were not barren.  In Central America, the Olmecs, Maya, and Aztecs established proud civilizations that endured through successive periods of challenge and change.  The Mound-Builder culture of central North America is just coming to light, while the Inca and other civilizations of South America show an intensive effort to use and manage the landscape.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Africa|'''Chapter 12''' - Ancient Africa]]&lt;/big&gt;

''Though often derided as the &quot;dark continent&quot;, Africa developed several important civilizations of its own, even discounting Egypt.  Mali, Ghana, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe all hold the cradles of ancient civilizations within them.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;[[/Polynesia|'''Chapter 13''' - Ancient Polynesia]]&lt;/big&gt;

''As people spread out across the Pacific to the islands both small and great, they carried with them foods, technology and culture that diversified and changed, even as it continued to unite across thousands of miles of open water.''
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top; padding:5px;&quot; | &lt;big&gt;'''[[/References/]]'''&lt;/big&gt;

''Glossary, Bibliography, Atlas, Gazeteer, selected biographies... Everything necessary to help make your understand of ancient history more complete.''

&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 8:  Concurrency Management'''&lt;/big&gt;


==8.1 Overview==
Concurrency is defined as the ability of multiple processes and threads to access and change the data records at the same time. Lower the contention to access and modify data with more users, better is the concurrency and vice versa. A process that access data prevents other process to change the data. This reduces the concurrency. A process that modifies data prevents other process to access or change the data. This reduces the concurrency.

In general, database systems uses two approaches to manage concurrent data access; pessimistic and optimistic. Conflicts cannot be avoided in both the models, it differs only in when the conflicts are dealt.

==8.1.1 Pessimistic Concurrency==
Pessimistic concurrency systems assume that conflict will occur and it avoids conflicts by acquiring locks on data that is being read or modified, so that no other process can modify that data. In this model, readers block writers and writers block readers.

==8.1.2 Optimistic Concurrency==
Optimistic concurrency systems assume that transactions are unlikely to modify data that another transaction is modifying. This is implemented by using versioning technique. This allows readers to see the state of the data before the modification occurs as the system maintains previous version of the data record before it actually attempts to change it. In this model readers do not block writers and writers do not block readers. However writers will block writes which will lead to conflicts.

==8.2 Concurrency problem==
There are some problems that any concurrency control mechanism must address. There are three ways in which things can go wrong. They are lost update problem, uncommitted dependency and Inconsistent Analysis.  In all three, individual transactions are right, but when they are interleaved it may produce wrong results.

==8.2.1 Lost Update Problem==

&lt;s&gt;TODO- Define this&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s&gt;TODO- Draw diagram&lt;/s&gt;

Transaction-1 reads tuple1 at time t1
Transaction-2 reads tuple1 at time t2
Transaction-1 updates tuple1 at time t3
Transaction-2 updates tuple1 at time t4

Transaction-1 update on tuple1 at time t3 is lost as Transaction-2 overwrites the update made by Transaction-1 on tuple1 without checking whether it has changed.

==8.2.2 Uncommitted dependency==
This occurs when one transaction is allowed to access or update a tuple that has been updated by another transaction but not yet committed by that transaction.

&lt;s&gt;TODO- Draw diagram&lt;/s&gt;

Transaction-1 updates tuple1 at time t1
Transaction-2 reads tuple1 at time t2
Transaction-1 rolls back the transaction at time t3
In the above sequence, Transaction-2 sees an uncommitted change at time t2, which is undone at time t3. Transaction-2 is operating with wrong value seen at time t2. As a result, transaction-2 might produce incorrect result.

If transaction-2 updates instead of reading tuple t1 at t2, the situation is even worse, it will loose its update on tuple t1, once transaction-1 rolls back.

==8.2.3 Inconsistent Analysis==
If one transaction is calculating an aggregate summary function on records, while other transactions are updating some of the records involved in the aggregation, the aggregate function may calculate with some values before they are updated and some values after they are updated.

&lt;s&gt;TODO- draw diagram&lt;/s&gt;

For example, suppose that transaction-1 is calculating the total number of reservations on all the theatres for particular day; meanwhile transaction-2 is reserving 5 seats on that day, then results of transaction-1 will be off by 5 because transaction-1 reads the value of X after 5 seats have been subtracted from it.


==8.3 Locking==
All the above three problems can be solved by using concurrency control technique called locking. The basic idea is to deny access to the data record for all transactions, when a transaction is working on it. 

A lock is a variable associated with a data item that describes the status of the data item. Generally there is one lock for each data item(record) in DBMS. Locks are used to provide synchronous access to the data items by concurrent transactions. There are two types of locks supported by Unix kind of operating systems
*	pthread mutexes
*	semaphores
pthread mutexes work well with multiple threads and semaphores work well with multiple threads as well as multiple process. Pthread mutexes are called binary locks as they have two states (lockState); locked and unlocked. Semaphores can be used as binary locks as well as counting locks. In our case, binary locks will be used to provide synchronized concurrent access to the data items. Two operations, lockItem() and unlockItem() are  used with binary locking. A transaction requests access to data item X by first issuing lockItem(X) operation. If lockState(X) is 1, then the transaction is forced to wait till lockState(X) becomes 0. If it is zero, then lockState(X) is set to 1, and the transaction is allowed to access data item X. When the transaction is through with using the data item, it issues an unlockItem(X) operation, which sets lockState(X) to zero, so that other transactions shall access X.

Data access protocol for locking method is
*	A read transaction will acquire lock on the data before it reads the data.
*       A write transaction will acquire lock on the data before it writes the data.
*	If lock request is denied, then the transaction goes to wait state and tries for the lock periodically until the lock is released by the transaction that acquired it.

In the above locking model, 
*	Readers block readers and writers
*	Writers block readers and writers


Concurrency shall be slightly improved on the above model by making readers not blocking other readers, as it will not lead to any inconsistencies. This shall be achieved by introducing another type of lock, which shall be shared by all readers. These locks are called as Shared Locks. Another type of lock, exclusive locks are obtained by writers to block all readers and writers from accessing the data. The data access protocol for this locking method is
*	A read transaction will acquire Shared Lock on the data before it reads the data.
*	A write transaction will acquire Exclusive Lock on the data before it writes the data.
*	Lock request is denied for read  operation if another transaction has exclusive lock on the data item.
*	Lock request is denied for write operation if another transaction has read or exclusive lock on the data item.
*	If lock request is denied, then the transaction goes to wait state and tries for the lock periodically until the lock is released by the transaction that acquired it.


In the above locking model, 
*	Readers block writers and allow other readers
*	Writers block readers and writers


The above rules shall be summarized as lock compatibility matrix

Shared	Exclusive	No Lock
Shared	Yes	No	Yes
Exclusive	No	No	Yes
No Lock	Yes	Yes	Yes
&lt;s&gt;TODO::Above lock compatibility matrix in image&lt;/s&gt;


Yes -&gt; compatible, no conflict, lock request will be granted.

No-&gt; not compatible, there is a conflict, so lock request should be denied.


Concurrency problems with locking protocol

*	&lt;big&gt;Lost update problem&lt;/big&gt; – transaction-1 waits for exclusive lock forever from time t3 as shared lock is acquired by transaction-1 and transaction-2. Transaction-2 waits for exclusive lock forever from time t4 as shared lock is acquired by transaction-1 and transaction-2. Our lost update problem is solved, but a new problem has occurred. It is called “DeadLock”. We will look into its details later.

*	&lt;big&gt;Uncommitted dependency&lt;/big&gt; -  Transaction-2 waits for lock when it tries to read tuple1 at time t2 as it is exclusively locked by transaction-1. It waits till transaction-1 either commits or rollbacks. Locking avoids uncommitted dependency issue.

*	&lt;big&gt;Inconsistent Analysis&lt;/big&gt; – Transcation-1 waits till transaction-2 releases the exclusive lock on the data record X and then computes the aggregation giving correct results.


==8.3.1 Serializable transactions==
A given set of transactions is considered to be serializable, if it produces the same result, as though these transactions are executed serially one after the other. 
*	Individual transactions are correct as they transform a correct state of the database to another correct state
*	Executing transaction one at a time in any serial order is also correct, as individual transactions are independent of each other.
*	An interleaved execution is correct, if it is equivalent to serial execution or if it is serializable.
	
The concept of serializability was first introduced by Eswaran, Gray proved the two-phase locking protocol, which is briefly described as:
 If all transactions obey the “two-phase locking protocol”, then all possible interleaved schedules are serializable.


==8.3.2 Two Phase Locking Protocol==
After releasing a lock, a transaction must never go on to acquire any more locks. A transaction that obeys this protocol, thus has two phases, a lock acquisition or “Growing” phase and a lock releasing or “Shrinking” phase.

Two phase locking may limit the amount of concurrency that can occur in a schedule. This is because a transaction may not be able to release lock on data item after it is through with it. This is the price for guaranteeing serializability of all schedules without having to check the schedules themselves.

There are number of variations of two phase locking (2PL). The technique we described above is known as 2 phase locking. 

==8.3.2.1 Conservative 2 PL ==
This requires a transaction to lock all the item it accesses before the transaction starts, by declaring read-set and write-set. Read-set of a transaction is the set of all items that the transaction reads, and the write-set is the set of all items that it writes.

If any of the items in read-set or write-set cannot be locked, it waits for it to be released by other transaction and after acquiring all locks at once, it starts the transaction. Conservative 2 phase locking is deadlock free protocol. However, it is difficult to use in practice because of the need to declare the read-set and write-set, which is not possible practically in most of the situations.

Growing phase is before the transaction starts and shrinking phase starts as soon as the transaction ends in case of conservative 2 phase locking.

==8.3.2.2 Strict 2 PL==
The most popular variation of 2-phase locking is strict 2-phase locking.  A transaction does not release any of its exclusive locks till the transaction either commits or rollbacks. This guarantees strict schedules, as no other transactions can read or write an item that is written by this transaction unless it is committed.  	
Growing phase starts as soon as the transaction starts and shrinking on write locks happens during either transaction commits or rollbacks.

==8.3.2.3 Rigorous 2 PL==
This is more restrictive version of strict 2-phase locking protocol. A transaction does not release any of its shared and exclusive locks till the transaction either commits or rollbacks. This is the easiest 2-phase locking to implement, but gives less concurrency for reads.

Growing phase starts as soon as the transaction starts and shrinking happens during either transaction commit or rollback.

==8.3.3 Lock Starvation==
Lock starvation occurs when a transaction cannot proceed for an indefinite period of time while other transactions in the system continue to run normally. This can occur due to unfair lock scheduling algorithms which implements priority based locking. One solution for starvation is to have fair lock waiting scheme, such as first in first out (FIFO) queue.

Starvation can also occur when the deadlock algorithm, selects the same transaction repeatedly for abort, thereby never allowing it to finish. The algorithms shall be modified to use higher priorities for transactions that have been aborted multiple times to avoid this problem.


==8.3.4 Dead Lock==
Deadlock occurs when each transaction in a set of two or more transactions wait for some resource that is locked by some other transaction in the same set. 

For example transaction T1 acquires Resource R1 and transaction T2 acquires resource R2. After this if T1 waits for R2 and T2 waits for R1. Both will never get the lock, and this situation is termed as deadlock.

&lt;s&gt;TODO Diagram with respect to time&lt;/s&gt;

==8.3.4.1 Dead Lock Prevention==
There are many prevention protocols, but most of them are practically not possible in case of DBMS. They are conservative 2 phase locking, ordering data record locking, no waiting, cautious waiting, Wait-die and Wound-wait.

&lt;big&gt;Conservative two-phase locking protocol&lt;/big&gt; is deadlock prevention protocol, in which all locks are acquired before the transaction works on the data records.

&lt;big&gt;Ordering of data record locking&lt;/big&gt; will also prevent deadlocks. A transaction, which works on several data records, should obtain locks in pre-determined order always. This requires the programmer or DBMS aware of chosen order of the data record locks. This is also not practical to implement in database systems. 

&lt;big&gt;No Waiting Algorithm&lt;/big&gt;
If a transaction is unable to obtain a lock, it is immediately aborted and then restarted after a certain time delay without checking whether a deadlock will actually occur or not. This can cause transactions to abort and restart needlessly.
&lt;big&gt;
Cautious Waiting Algorithm&lt;/big&gt;

This is proposed to avoid needless restart in case of no waiting algorithm, If transaction T1 tries to lock an data record R1, but is not able to do so because R1 is locked by some other transaction T2 with a conflicting lock.   If  T2 is not blocked on some other locked data record, then T1 is blocked and allowed to wait; otherwise abort T1.

&lt;big&gt;Wait-Die and Wound-Wait Algorithm&lt;/big&gt;
The other two techniques, wait-die and wound-wait use transaction timestamps as basis to determine what to do in case of deadlocks.
Transaction timestamp in a unique identifier assigned to each transaction. These timestamps are generally running counter which gets incremented for every transaction started. If transaction T1, starts before transaction T2, then TS(T1) &lt; TS(T2)

Suppose that transaction T1 tries to lock data record R1, but is not able to lock because R1 is locked by some other transaction T2 with a conflicting lock. Rules followed by these schemes are as follows

Wait-Die – If TS (T1)  &lt; TS (T2), then T1 is allowed to wait, otherwise abort T1 and restart it later with the same timestamp.
Wound-Wait – If TS (T1)  &lt; TS (T2), then abort T1 and restart it later with same timestamp; otherwise T1 is allowed to wait

In wait-die, older transaction is allowed to wait on younger transaction, whereas a younger transaction requesting lock on record R1 held by an older transaction is aborted and restarted. The wound-wait approach does the opposite; a younger transaction is allowed to wait on an older one, whereas an older transaction requesting lock on record R1 held by an younger transaction preempts the younger transaction by aborting it. Both schemes end up aborting the younger of the two transactions that may be involved in a deadlock.
In wait-die, transactions wait only on younger transactions. In wound-wait, transactions wait only on older transactions. So no cycle is created in both of these schemes avoiding deadlocks.


==8.3.4.2 Dead Lock Detection==
Deadlock detection is more practical approach than the deadlock prevention techniques. This first checks whether deadlock state actually exist in the system before taking any actions. 

A simple way to detect a state of deadlock is for the system to construct and maintain a “wait-for” graph
&lt;s&gt;TODO-Diagram and explanation&lt;/s&gt;

If the system is in a state of deadlock, some of the transactions causing deadlocks must be aborted. Either application or DBMS should select one of the transactions involved in deadlock for rollback to get the system out of deadlock situation. This selection algorithm should consider avoiding transactions that are running for long time and transactions that have performed many updates. The best transactions to be aborted are the SELECT or read only transactions. 

==8.3.4.3 Timeouts==
The simplest solution for handling deadlocks is timeouts. In this method, transactions that wait for longer than the system defined timeout period, are assumed to be in deadlock situation and are aborted.


==8.4. Isolation Levels==
&lt;s&gt;TODO&lt;/s&gt;
==8.5 Lock Granularity==
The size of the data item is often called the data item granularity. Fine granularity refers to small data item sizes, whereas coarse granularity refers to large item sizes. 

Larger the data item size, lower the degree of concurrency. For example if the data item size is a ‘Table’ denoted by Table1, a transaction T1 that needs to lock a record X must lock the whole table Table1 that contains record X because the lock is associated with the whole data item, Table1. If another transaction T2 wants to lock a different record Y of Table1, it is forced to wait till T1 releases the lock on Table1. If the data item size is single record, then transaction T2 would be able to proceed, because it would lock different data item.

Smaller the data item size, more the number of items in the database. Because every item is associated with a lock, the system will have a larger number of active locks. More lock and unlock operations will be performed, causing a higher overhead. In addition, more storage space is required for storing these locks. 

For large transactions, which access many records, coarse granularity should be used and for small transactions, which access small number of records, fine granularity should be used. 

==8.5.1 Granularity Levels in DBMS==
Granularity levels are listed below ordered from Coarse to fine granularity 
*	Database
*	Table
*	Disk Block or Memory Page
*	Record
*	Record Field

Since the best granularity size depends on the given transaction, DBMS should support multiple level so granularity and allows the transaction to pick any level it wants.

==8.5.2 Intent Locks==

Let us take an example database DB1, has one table Table1, having 2 pages P1 and P2. P1 has 10 records R1 to R10, and P2 has 10 records R11 to R20.

&lt;s&gt;TODO::Draw tree structure denoting above.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Scenario 1:&lt;/big&gt;

Transaction T1 wants to update all records in Table1. It will request for exclusive lock on Table1. This is beneficial for T1 than acquiring 20 locks for each data record. Now suppose, another transaction T2 wants to read record R5 from page P1, then T2 would request a shared record level lock on R5. DBMS will now check for the compatibility of the requested lock with already held locks. One way to verify this is to traverse the tree from leaf R5 to root DB1 and check for conflicting locks. 

&lt;big&gt;Scenario 2:&lt;/big&gt;

Transaction T1 wants to read record R5 from page P1, and then T2 would request a shared record level lock on R5. Now suppose, another transaction T2 wants to update all records in Table1, so it will request exclusive lock on Table1. DBMS will now check for the compatibility of the requested lock with already held locks. For this it needs to check all locks at page level and record level to ensure that there are not conflicting locks.

For both the above scenarios, traversal-based lock conflict detection is very inefficient and would defeat the purpose of having multiple granularity locking.

New types of locks are introduced to make the multiple granularity locking efficient. The idea behind intention locks is for a transaction to indicate, along the path from the root to the desired node, what type of lock it will require from one of the node’s descendants. 

There are three types of intension locks.
*	Intention Shared (IS)
*	Intention Exclusive (IX)
*	Shared Intention Exclusive (SIX)

&lt;big&gt;Intention –Shared Locks&lt;/big&gt; 

	Indicates that a shared lock will be requested on some descendant node

&lt;big&gt;Intention –Exclusive Locks&lt;/big&gt; 

	Indicates that a exclusive lock will be requested on some descendant node

&lt;big&gt;Intention –Shared Locks&lt;/big&gt; 

	Indicates that this node is locked in shared mode and exclusive lock will be requested on some descendant node


'''Compatibility Table'''

Mode	IS	IX	S	SIX	X
IS	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No
IX	Yes	Yes	No	No	No
S	Yes	No	Yes	No	No
SIX	Yes	No	No	No	No
X	No	No	No	No	No

&lt;s&gt;TODO::diagram for above lock compatibility table&lt;/s&gt;

'''Locking protocol'''
#	The root of the tree must be locked first
#	A node can be locked by transaction in S or IS mode only if the parent node is already locked by transaction in either IS or IX mode
#	A node can be locked by transaction in X, IX or SIX modes only if the parent of the node already locked by transaction in either IX or SIX modes
#	A transaction can unlock a node, only if none of the children of node are currently locked by transaction.
#	Lock compatibility and 2 phase locking should be adhered.

&lt;s&gt;TODO::Example illustrating above protocol and compatibility table: Refer 445 of Elmasri&lt;/s&gt;

==8.5.2 Lock Escalation==

==8.6 Index and Predicate Locking==

One solution to phantom record problem is to use index locking.

A more general technique, called predicate locking would lock access to all records that satisfy a predicate or where condition. Predicate locks have proved to be difficult to implement effectively.

==8.7 Timestamp based concurrency control &lt;s&gt;(TODO:Rephrase whole section)&lt;/s&gt;==
There is another concurrency control technique based on timestamp ordering, which avoids use of locks. As it avoids locks, deadlocks do not occur in this concurrency control mechanism.

==8.7.1 Timestamps ==
Timestamp is a unique identifier created by DBMS to identify a transaction. Typically, timestamp values are assigned in the order in which the transactions are submitted to the system. Generally it is the transaction start time and referred as TS (T). These unique identifiers shall be implemented using simple counters, which gets incremented when a transaction is started. As is has a finite maximum value, algorithm should take care of resetting it when it reaches maximum.


==8.7.2 Basic Timestamp ordering==
Each data item X, has two timestamps 

*	ReadTS(X) – The read timestamp of data item X; this is the largest timestamp among all the timestamps of the transactions that have successfully read the item X.
*	WriteTS(X) – The write timestamp of data item X; this is the largest timestamp among all the timestamps of the transactions that have successfully modified the item X.

Whenever some transaction T tries to issue readItem(X) or writeItem(X), the algorithm should compare the timestamp of T with ReadTS(X) and WriteTS(X) to ensure that the timestamp order of the transaction execution is not violated.  If this order is violated, then transaction T is aborted and resubmitted to the system as a new transaction with a new timestamp. If T is aborted, then any transaction T1 that may have used a value written by T must also be aborted. Similarly any transaction T2 that may have used a value written by T1 must also be aborted and so on. This effect is known as cascading rollback and is one of the biggest problems associated with this scheme. 

The basic timestamp-ordering algorithm is summarized below

&lt;big&gt;Transaction T issues writeItem(X) operation:&lt;/big&gt;
If readTS(X) &gt; TS(T), or writeTS(T) &gt; TS(T), then abort T, else execute writeItem(X) of T and set writeTS(X) to TS(T)

&lt;big&gt;Transaction T issues readItem(X) operation:&lt;/big&gt;
If writeTS(T) &gt; TS(T), then abort T, else execute readItem(X) of T and set readTS(X) to largest of TS(T) and current readTS(X)

Whenever the basic timestamp ordering algorithm, detects two conflicting operations that occur in the incorrect order, it rejects the later of the two operations by aborting the transaction that issued it. The schedules produced by this algorithm are guaranteed to be conflict serializable, like the 2 phase locking protocol. 

==8.7.3 Strict Timestamp ordering==
Strict Timestamp ordering is a variation of basic timestamp ordering that ensures that the schedules are recoverable and conflict serializable. In this variation, a transaction T, that issues a readItem(X) or writeItem(X) such that TS (T) &gt; writeTS(X) has its read or write operation delayed until the transaction T1 that wrote the value of X has committed or aborted. To implement this algorithm, locking is required. This algorithm does not cause deadlock, since T waits for T1 only if TS(T) &gt; TS(T1).

&lt;s&gt;TODO::refer white paper and add more content&lt;/s&gt;


==8.8 Multi Version concurrency control==

&lt;s&gt;TODO&lt;/s&gt;

==8.9 Optimistic concurrency control==
In both concurrency control techniques, locking and timestamp ordering, certain checks are made before a transaction operates on a data item. In locking, check is done to determine whether the item being accessed is locked. In timestamp ordering, the transaction timestamp is checked against the read and write timestamps of the data item. This imposes an overhead to the transaction execution. 
In optimistic concurrency control techniques, no checking is done while the transaction is executing. In this scheme, updates in the transaction are not applied directly to the data items until the transaction reaches its end. During transaction execution, all updates are applied to local copies of the data items, which are kept on per transaction basis. At the end of the transaction execution, a validation phase checks whether any of the transaction’s updates violate serializability. If it is not violated, then the transaction is committed and the database is updated from the local copies, otherwise the transaction is aborted and then restarted later.
There are three phases in this protocol

*	&lt;big&gt;Read Phase&lt;/big&gt; – A transaction can read values of committed data items from the database. However updates are applied only to local copies of the data items kept in transaction workspace.
*	&lt;big&gt;Validation Phase&lt;/big&gt;  - Checking is performed to ensure that serializability will not be violated if the transaction updates are applied to the database.
*	&lt;big&gt;Write Phase&lt;/big&gt; – Transaction updates are applied to the database if the validation phase says that it is serializable. Otherwise the updates are discarded and the transaction is restarted.
This protocol suits well incase of minimal interference between transaction on data items. If the interference is more, then transactions will be restarted often. This technique is called ‘optimistic’ because they assume that little interference will occur and hence that there is no need to do checking during transaction execution.

&lt;s&gt;TODO::refer white paper and add more content&lt;/s&gt;

==8.10 Architecture for lock manager==
Concurrency control in traditional database systems aims to maintain database consistency. Concurrency control in MMDB is difficult due to the conflicting requirements of satisfying timing constraints and maintaining data consistency.

Recovery in DBMS means recovering the database. That is restoring the database to a state that is known to be consistent after some failure that makes the database inconsistent.

There are many things which can go wrong in a database environment. The following sections discuss about most important failure modes
#Hard Disk Failure 
#Process Failure - software errors
#System Failure - power loss

----

==2.1 Overview==
The database management system (DBMS) is the software that handles storage and retrieval of data. Most of the DBMS present today are relational DBMS. This book concentrates only on relational database management systems. RDBMS has five main components
*	Interface Drivers
*	SQL Engine
*	Transaction Engine
*	Relational Engine
*	Storage Engine


Figure 1 contains DBMS components, Memory layout and disk files associated with relational database management system. From early days of database system evolution, disk is considered to be the backing store for the data to achieve durability. The architecture above applies for disk resident database systems (DRDB). Nowadays there are two different approaches other than DRDBs. They are
*	Main memory databases (MMDB) – data is stored in main memory.
*	Network Databases – data is stored in another host over the network.
Most of the components in the DRDB system architecture above are present in main memory and network databases as well.

[[Image:DRDBArchitecture.gif]]


==2.2 Driver Interfaces==
A user or application program shall initiate either schema modification or content modification. These application requests are broadly classified by SQL as Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Control Language (DCL). DDL deals with schema modifications; DML deals with content modifications; DCL deals with user access and privilege modifications. If the application program is written in C/C++, it shall use ODBC drivers to connect to the DBMS, or if it is written in Java, it shall use JDBC drivers to connect to DBMS. Some vendors provide language specific proprietary interfaces. For example MySQL provides drivers for PHP, Python, etc.

These drivers are built on top of SQL. They provide methods to prepare statements, execute statements, fetch results, etc. 

==2.3 SQL Engine==
This component is responsible for interpreting and executing the SQL query. It comprises three major components

'''Compiler''' – builds a data structure from the SQL statement and then does semantic checking on the query such as whether the table exists, field exists, etc. 

'''Optimizer''' – transforms the initial query plan (data structure created by compiler), into sequence of operations usually pipelined together to achieve fast execution. It refers the metadata (dictionary) and statistical information stored about the data to decide which sequence of operations is likely to be faster and based on that it creates the optimal query plan. Both cost and rule based optimizers are used in case of DRDBs.

'''Execution Engine''' – executes each step in the query plan chosen by optimizer. It interacts with the relational engine to retrieve and store records.

==2.4 Transaction Engine==
Transactions are sequence of operations that read or write database elements, which are grouped together. Transaction should have the following ACID properties

'''Atomicity''': Either all or none of the effect should appear in database after transaction completes.

'''Consistency''': Constraints should always keep the database in consistent state

'''Isolation''': Transaction should run as though no other transaction is running.

'''Durability''': Once the transaction completes, effect of the transaction on the database must never be lost.

All the above properties are explained in detail under the Transaction Chapter.

Transaction engine comprises three major components

'''Concurrency Manager''' – responsible for concurrent synchronized access to data. This is usually implemented using latches and locks. Latches or Mutexes are acquired and released for short duration synchronization and locks are used for that of long duration.

'''Log Manager''' – responsible for atomicity and durability property of transaction. Undo logs make sure that transaction rollback takes the database state to previous consistent state when that transaction started. Redo logs make sure that all committed transactions shall be recovered in case of crash.

'''Recovery Manager'''- responsible for recovering the database from the disk image and redo log files. Most of the databases uses a technique called ‘shadow paging’ to maintain consistent image of memory in disk.

==2.5	Relational Engine==
Relational objects such as Table, Index, and Referential integrity constraints are implemented in this component. 
Some of the main components are

'''Field''' – abstracts column level information including type, length, etc.
Catalog – maintains Meta data information about the relational database objects such as table, index, trigger, field, etc.

'''Table''' – responsible for insert, update, delete, fetch, execute. It interacts with the allocator subsystem of storage engine, which in turn talks to buffer manager to get the job done.

'''Index''' – responsible for insert, update, delete, and scan of index nodes for all index types. Popular index types are hash and tree. Hash index is used for improving the point lookup (predicate with equality on primary key) and tree index is used for improving the range query (predicate with greater or less than operator on key).

'''Expression Engine''' – represents the predicate (WHERE clause of SQL statement) of the data retrieval operation and responsible for evaluating the expressions, which shall include arithmetic, comparison, and logical expressions.

==2.6	Storage Engine==
This component is responsible to store and retrieve data records.  It also provides mechanism to store meta data information and control information such as undo logs, redo logs, lock tables, etc.
Important storage engine components are

'''Buffer manager''' – responsible for loading pages from disk to memory and to manage the buffer pool based on Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm. This also has special purpose allocator for storing control information, which are transient. Buffer pool is the memory space used by buffer manager to cache disk pages associated with records, index information, Meta data information. Some database systems have space limit at individual level and some at global level for buffer pool size.

'''File Manager''' – Database in DRDB is nothing but a physical file at disk. File manager maps disk pages of the file to the memory pages and does the actual disk I/O operations in case of major faults generated by buffer manager module.

'''Process Manager''' – responsible for registering and deregistering database application process and threads and account all the resources (transactions, locks, latches) acquired by them.

==2.7	SELECT Execution Sequence==
This is what happens conceptually, when user issues a SELECT SQL statement,
Fig 2: SQL SELECT Execution Sequence

[[Image:DBMSSelectSequence.gif]]

#	User issues transaction start request (startTrans())
#	DBMS reserves one free slot for the transaction started (allocSlot())
#	DBMS returns to the user.
#	User issues an SELECT SQL request (stmtExecute())
#	DBMS interprets the request and represents it in data structure (parse())
#	DBMS checks whether table and field names exist in database (check())
#	DBMS identifies the optimum way to execute the statement (optimize())
#	DBMS executes the statement by interacting with relational engine (execute())
#	DBMS checks with buffer manager whether the disk page where data is present is already present in memory (isPageInMemory())
#	DBMS interacts with file manager to load the page into memory buffer if not already loaded.( loadPage())
#	DBMS evaluates records which satisfy the predicate (evaluate())
#	DBMS takes lock on the records based on the isolation level of the transaction (lockRecord())
#	DBMS retrieves records and returns to the application (returnRecords)
#	User issues transaction commit (commit())
#	DBMS releases all the locks acquired during the transaction (releaseLocks())
#	DBMS releases the transaction slot allocated for this transaction (freeSlot())
#	DBMS returns to the application


==2.8	INSERT Execution Sequence==

This is what happens conceptually, when user issues INSERT SQL statement,

Fig 3: SQL INSERT Execution Sequence

[[Image:DBMSInsertSequence.gif]]

#	User issues transaction start request (startTrans())
#	DBMS reserves one free slot for the transaction started (allocSlot())
#	DBMS returns to the user.
#	User issues an INSERT SQL request (stmtExecute())
#	DBMS interprets the request and represents it in data structure (parse())
#	DBMS checks whether table and field names exist in database (check())
#	DBMS identifies the optimum way to execute the statement (optimize())
#	DBMS executes the statement by interacting with relational engine (execute())
#	DBMS checks with buffer manager whether the disk page where record needs to be allocated is already present in memory (isPageInMemory())
#	DBMS interacts with file manager to load the page into memory buffer if not already loaded.( loadPage()), not shown in diagram above
#	DBMS creates undo log records for the newly inserted record (createUndoLog())
#	DBMS copies the values from the application buffer to allocated new record (copyValues())
#	DBMS creates redo log records for the newly inserted record (createRedoLog())
#	DBMS takes lock on the allocated record based on the isolation level of the transaction (lockRecord())
#	DBMS checks if indexes are available, if yes it does index node insertion for all indexes on this table. (insertIndexNode())
#	DBMS checks with buffer manager whether the index disk page where index node needs to be allocated is already present in memory (isPageInMemory())
#	DBMS interacts with file manager to load the page into memory buffer if not already loaded.( loadPage()), not shown in diagram above
#	DBMS takes lock on the allocated index node (lockIndexNode())
#	DBMS returns to the application with the number of rows affected (returnRowsAffected)
#	User issues transaction commit (commit())
#	DBMS releases all the locks acquired during the transaction (releaseLocks())
#	DBMS releases the transaction slot allocated for this transaction (freeSlot())
#	DBMS returns to the application

[[Image:Fresnel_lens.svg|thumb|250px|right|1: Cross section of a Fresnel lens 2: Cross section of a conventional lens of equivalent power]]
A '''Fresnel lantern''' is a light which makes use of the Fresnel Lens, named after Augustin-Jean Fresnel. The lens has a stepped appearance, instead of a round, smooth one. This allows the lens to have a much greater curvature than would otherwise be practical.

Theatrical Fresnels are typically made in 8, 6 or 3 inch varieties, referring to the diameter of the lens, with lamps ranging in wattage from 150 W (typically with a 3-inch fresnel) to 2000W (with an 8-inch fresnel). Fresnel lenses can operate close to the light source and are very cheap to produce, so the lanterns tend to be small and cheap.

Unfortunately, Fresnels are not very efficient. The reflector cannot be larger than the lens aperture, and thus all the radiated light that is neither redirected forward by the spherical reflector behind the bulb or emitted directly through the lens is absorbed by the casing as waste heat.

==Uses==
The stepped lens gives the beam a very even spread of light, compared to an ERS, and this makes them useful for color washes or back- or top- lighting. They are best used at a medium throw. The lack of beam control can be combated by the use of barn doors.

Projects included regional reconnaissance to local mapping, diamond drilling and RC-drilling programs, open pit and underground mapping, geochemical sampling and interpretation, and several exploration techniques pertaining to the search for diamonds, PGM, gold, nickel, silver, base metals, industrial minerals, oil &amp; gas, and other magmatic, hydrothermal, porphyritic, VMS and SEDEX ore deposits. Special strengths are related to multilingual geochemical and geological studies, management and organization, geomathematical analysis and modelling, structural studies, database design, exploration studies and writing technical reports. P.Geo. registered in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.

== Provincial Governments in New Zealand ==

[[Image:New Zealand provinces.png|thumb|right|The boundaries of the former New Zealand provinces]]
From 1841 until 1876, provinces had their own Provincial Governments. Originally, there were only three provinces, set up by the Royal Charter:
* New Ulster (North Island north of Patea River) 
* New Munster (North Island south of Patea River, plus the South Island) 
* New Leinster (Stewart Island) 

In 1846, the provinces were reformed. The New Leinster province was removed, and the two remaining provinces were enlarged and seperated from the Colonial Government. The reformed provinces were:

* New Ulster (All of North Island) 
* New Munster (The South Island plus Stewart Island)

The provinces were reformed yet again by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. In this constitution, the old provinces of New Ulster and New Munster were abolished and six new provinces were set up:

* Auckland 
* New Plymouth
* Wellington
* Nelson
* Canterbury
* Otago

Each province had its own legislature that elected its own Speaker and Superintendent. Any male 21 years or older that owned freehold property worth £50 a year could vote. Elections were held every four years.

Four new provinces were introduced between November 1858 and December 1873. Hawkes Bay broke from Wellington, Marlborough from Nelson, Westland from Canterbury, and Southland from Otago.

Not long after they had begun, Provincial Governments were under political debate in the General Assembly. Eventually, under the premiership of Harry Atkinson, the Colonial Government passed the Abolition of Provinces Act 1876 which wiped out the Provincial Governments, replacing them with regions. Provinces finally ceased to exist on the 1st of January 1877.

==Political Policies in the Twentieth Century==
At the turn of the century, the Liberals, New Zealand's first modern political party, were in power as the Government. The Liberals created a 'family farm' economy, by subdividing large estates and buying more Maori land in the North Island. New Zealand gained strong economic ties with Britain, exporting farm produce and other goods. Under Liberal, New Zealand started to form its own identity, and due to this, New Zealand declined to join the Australian Federation of 1901.

The Liberals were defeated in the 1912 election by the Reform Party, and never fully recovered. William Massey, the leader of the Reform Party, had promised state leaseholders they could freehold their land, which proved to be a good promise in winning the election. Under the Reform Party, New Zealand entered World War I, aiding Britain.

New Zealand had prosperous years at the end of the 1920s, and so was hit hard by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Conservative coalition Government failed to get New Zealand out of the Depression, which led to the rise of the Labour Party in 1935.

Under Labour, New Zealand's economy slowly recovered. The Reserve Bank was taken over by the state in 1936, spending on public works increased, and the State Housing Programme began. The Social Security Act 1938 increased the state of welfare dramatically.

With the outbreak of World War II in the 1940s, the New Zealand Government again chose to support Britain with troops. New Zealand also chose to fight in Korea in the early 1950s.

In 1945, Peter Fraser played a signifiant role in the confrence that set up the United Nations, but the Labour Government was losing support. In 1949, the National Party became the Government of New Zealand. In the 1960s, the National Government sent troops to Vietnam to keep on side with the United States, despite protests, but this didn't hinder New Zealand's support of the National Party, and National ruled New Zealand until 1984 with only two exceptions.

New Zealand's culture remained based on Britain's through the 1960s, and the economy was still mainly made up of exporting farm produce to Britain. However, when Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, New Zealand no longer had an assured market for farm products.

After the second oil shock of 1978, the National Government tried to fix the problem with new industrial and energy initiatives and farm subsidies. The economy faltered in the 1980s when the fall of oil prices made these schemes unsound. Inflation and unemployment went up as a result.

The National Government of 1990-99 passed the controversial Employment Contracts Act which opened up the labour market, but diminished the power of trade unions.

In 1996, a new voting system was introduced, Mixed Member Proportional Representation, which allowed minority or coalition Governments to become the norm, but the National and Labour parties still remained dominant.

== Images ==

Also, I wanted to let you know that we have a [[Wikibooks:TeX markup|Math Extension]] so that you can write equations directly into the text of a page, without having to upload pictures for each equation. I think that might be easier for you. Let me know if you have any questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:31, 2 January 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Tables ==

Tables are a little tricky, and at the moment we don't have a good resource available right now to explain it. I'll try to write up a reference about it tonight while I am thinking about it, and I will send you the link when it's prepared. 

Tables in wikitext are very similar to tables in HTML. In fact, if you know it, you can write tables directly in HTML if you are so inclined. To write a wiki-table, you first create a table using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{|&lt;/pre&gt; and &lt;pre&gt;|}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. A row in a table is shown with a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;|-&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and an individual cell is written with a single &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;|&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Here is a quick example:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
{|
|-
| a
| b
|- 
| c
| d
|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Which produces this table:

{|
|-
| a
| b
|- 
| c
| d
|}

If you want to be more fancy, you can add a special tag to the table to make it more &quot;pretty&quot;:


 &lt;nowiki&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| a
| b
|- 
| c
| d
|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Which produces this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| a
| b
|- 
| c
| d
|}

This is just the tip of the iceberg, but I hope it gets you started. Like i said, I'm going to try to write up a good resource for it, and I'll give you a link when I have it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:16, 2 January 2008 (UTC)

:Here is the page i've been working on: [[Wikitext/Tables]]. If you are looking for something more simple, I think you are out of luck. If you upload the raw HTML table you have generated, I can use a bot to convert it into a more compact wikitext format. If you do not know how to do that, you can [[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|email me]] the code and I will try to pick through it for you. I hope this helps. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:33, 2 January 2008 (UTC)

== Re:Donation ==

I love book donations! We have set up an informational page at [[WB:DONATE]]. If you are the author, or if you have the ability to release the book under a particular copyright license, then we can easily accept the donation. I will send you an email, you can reply with the files. I look forward to seeing your books! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:40, 2 January 2008 (UTC)

== Re:No Progress. ==

You're right about the lack of progress, and I want to apologize for the delay. I will focus my attentions on this 100%. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:10, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

:Okay, I have made the conversion, and uploaded much of the text. I need to go back and replace some of the older text to make it look nicer (the new versions, especially the new tables are very nice looking). None of the images from the later chapters have been uploaded nor inserted into the text. I will try to do that as best as I can (you can certainly help out with the image uploading). Proof read things to make sure that the formatting and everything turned out alright. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:57, 7 January 2008 (UTC)


== Copyright problem with [[:Image:BIO1.GIF]] ==
{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:BIO1.GIF]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:BIO1.GIF]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and status. The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Please take the time to read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about what copyright information is required to satisfy our requirements and remember to include this important information for every file that you upload in the future as well. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add this information; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask another Wikibookian at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|help desk]].

See {{UserImages}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:52, 23 January 2008 (UTC)}}

== Image license templates ==

Please go back and tag all your uploads which don't have license templates. I realize that they're all appropriately licensed, but you need to add the template. I recently ran a bot to tag almost 60 of your uploads, but the rest you'll have to clean up yourself, or I will delete them one week after the upload date. If you have questions or concerns about this, please ask on my talk page. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:30, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

== maths markup ==

G'day, I just replaced a couple of images on [[Biogeochemical Selectiveness of Cedars Over Metamorphic Rocks of the Escambray Complex, Sancti Spíritus, Cuba/Vegetation]] with some maths markup. This is generally preferred for formulae on wiki pages, because the rendering is sorted by the wiki per the user's preferences, and is often clearer. You can read about it here: [[m:Help:Displaying a formula]]. If I get a chance, I'll sort out the other images on that page - unless you beat me to it! [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:30, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

:I've actually gone through and updated the remainder of the equation images on this page to be text-based math formulas instead. Take a look at the formatting of these, and double check that all the translations are accurate. Also, make sure that you like the formatting (I think this version is better). There are always improvements that can be made. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:55, 31 January 2008 (UTC)

== The New Zealand Government Today ==
[[Image:Beehive Building &amp; Parliament House.JPG|thumb|right|The New Zealand Parliament House and Beehive Building.]]
New Zealand is currently run by the National Party, under the leadership of John Key. The formal coalition comprises of the National Party and the Maori Party, but the New Zealand First, Act, and United Future parties provide confidence and supply to National in return for their leaders being ministers outside of cabinet.

The leader of the opposition is Phil Goff, who is the leader of the Labour Party. The Proggressive Party and the Green Party are also in opposition of the Government.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've been working my way through the LaTeX Wikibook, and you self-deprecatingly describe your knowledge of typesetting as &quot;feeble&quot;. I worked for a well-known printing house for a few years and would be willing to try to help if you need any assistance.

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

This is a single person's idea that is not part of established knowledge of the subject, transferred to a separate sub-page by [[User:RobinH|RobinH]], after a discussion with that single person at [[Talk:Special Relativity/Simultaneity, time dilation and length contraction]].  This single person has publicized this idea on just about every self-submission web site that xe can find, it seems, in many cases citing ''this very sub-page'' as an authority, or at least as the primary source of the idea.

:{{del}} The ideas in question are way off the mainstream but more importantly they are presented in an obscure way.

This module as been almost unused for some time and recently had some edits, the information it provides is not accurate and it seems not to maintained  by the editors (me included), and so doesn't perform any valid function.  Removal of it would decrease confusion and as it seems not have any impact on its users, probably substituting it by a template that uses a category, users could apply their userspace would provide a better and efficient way on publicizing their active status. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:35, 13 December 2007 (UTC)
:'''Addendum:''' I have attempted to check out why the page was created or its function and why I signed it at the time, it seems that it was part of the newsletter , I think I only received one issue, just after it was announced, so it must be defunct or inactive for a while now.

:{{del}} I would like to expand this VfD to include [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians]] as well (for the same reasons). [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]] was created originally as a delivery list for the newsletter. A bot would read the page, and send a message to every user in the list. However, you are right that we stopped sending the newsletter, and so this page doesnt have any practical use. If/when we decide to start a new newsletter system, I doubt we will be using a manual list. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:09, 14 December 2007 (UTC)

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;font: 2em sans-serif;padding;1em&quot;&gt;System types and collections: Using events and delegates&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==== Using events and delegates ====

'''Exam objectives: '''Control interactions between .NET Framework application components by using events and delegates. 
 
(Refer System namespace) 

Delegate class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.delegate.aspx MSDN]

:Delegates hold pointers to one or more functions and invoke them as needed.

:One common use of delegates is for event handling.  A class that raises an event does not know what objects or methods want to receive the event, so an intermediary or pointer mechanism is needed between the object raising the event and the object(s) receiving the event.  Delegates can be used as function pointers to accomplish this.

:A delegate is a class, but unlike a regular class it has a signature.  In the .Net framework you just declare the delegate and the CLR handles the implementation of the class.

    //delegate declaration
    public delegate void AlarmEventHandler(object sender,EventArgs e);

:The first complete example just declare a delegate type, then declare a variable of that type, assign a functon to it and execute the delegate variable which has the effect of executing the function.
{{dynamic navigation
|title=C# sample
|body=
Simple delegate
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Text;
    //
    namespace DelegateLab01
    {
        // declare the delegate type
        public delegate int IntOperDel(int i);
        //
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Program pgm = new Program();
                // Assign the delegate
                IntOperDel deleg = pgm.Increment;
                // Executing the delegate
                int res = deleg(32);
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;First value: &quot; + res.ToString());
                // Second assign
                deleg = pgm.Decrement;
                // Second execution
                res = deleg(32);
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;First value: &quot; + res.ToString());
                // Wait for finish
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
            // First function to be assigned to the delegate
            public int Increment(int n)
            {
                return n + 1;
            }
            // Second function to be assigned to the delegate
            public int Decrement(int n)
            {
                return n - 1;
            }
        }
    }
}}

:The second delegate example implement the concept of a callback function. A function is called with a delegate as an argument. When it executes the delegate it has no knowledge of exactly what function is executed. Part of its behavior is delegated to the function passed as a parameter (thru the delegate).
{{dynamic navigation
|title=C# sample
|body=
Callback delegate
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Text;
    //
    namespace DelegateLab02
    {
        // declare the delegate type
        public delegate int IntOperDel(int i);
        //
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Program pgm = new Program();
                // Assign the delegate
                IntOperDel deleg = pgm.Increment;
                // Calling a function that will execute de delegate
                // as part of its own logic
                pgm.ExecuteCallBack(deleg);
                // Wait for finish
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
            // Function to be assigned to a delegate
            public int Increment(int n)
            {
                return n + 1;
            }
            // Function called with a delegate as parameter
            public void ExecuteCallBack(IntOperDel deleg)
            {
                int res = deleg(32);
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Result from executing the callback: &quot; + res.ToString());
            }
        }
    }
}}

:The third delegate example uses a delegate member to produce the same pattern as an event. Note that executing the delegate member without assigning at least one function will cause an exception. Also assigning 2 functions with the += operator will execute the 2 functions when the delegate is executed. If the delegate has a return code, the return value of the last executed function will be returned.

{{dynamic navigation
|title=C# sample
|body=
Delegate member
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Text;
    //
    namespace DelegateLab03
    {
        // declare the delegate type
        public delegate void IntOperDel(int i);
        //
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Program pgm = new Program();
                // Use += oper to assign functions to the delegate
                pgm.delMember += pgm.Increment;
                pgm.delMember += pgm.Decrement;
                // Calling some member function that will execute the delegate
                pgm.ExecuteSomething();
                // Wait for finish
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
            // First function to be assigned to a delegate
            public void Increment(int n)
            {
                int res = n + 1;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Inside increment function: &quot; + res.ToString());
            }
            // Second function to be assigned to a delegate
            public void Decrement(int n)
            {
                int res = n - 1;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Inside decrement function: &quot; + res.ToString());
            }
            // Class member of the delegate type
            public IntOperDel delMember;
            // Function called to execute the delegate member (raise the &quot;event&quot;)
            public void ExecuteSomething()
            {
                this.delMember(32);
            }
        }
    }
}}

:The fourth example is the basic example of an event. It is exactly as the third example with the '''event''' keyword added to the member declaration and a test before calling the event because of the exception thrown on an &quot;empty&quot; event. This example shows clearly that an event is nothing more then a multicast delegate.

{{dynamic navigation
|title=C# sample
|body=

    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Text;
    //
    namespace DelegateLab04
    {
        // declare the delegate type
        public delegate void IntOperDel(int i);
        //
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Program pgm = new Program();
                // Use += oper to assign functions to the delegate
                pgm.delMember += pgm.Increment;
                pgm.delMember += pgm.Decrement;
                // Calling some member function that will execute the delegate
                pgm.ExecuteSomething();
                // Wait for finish
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press ENTER to finish&quot;);
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
            // First function to be assigned to a delegate
            public void Increment(int n)
            {
                int res = n + 1;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Inside increment function: &quot; + res.ToString());
            }
            // Second function to be assigned to a delegate
            public void Decrement(int n)
            {
                int res = n - 1;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Inside decrement function: &quot; + res.ToString());
            }
            // Class member event of the delegate type
            public event IntOperDel delMember;
            // Function called to execute the delegate member (raise the &quot;event&quot;)
            public void ExecuteSomething()
            {
                if (this.delMember != null)
                    this.delMember(32);
            }
        }
    }
}}

:Executing the functions associated with an event is called '''raising''' the event.

:The functions associated with the event are called '''event handlers'''

EventArgs class - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.eventargs.aspx MSDN]

:By convention an event uses a delegate that returns void and take 2 arguments:
:*an object of type System.Object that contains a reference to the object that raised the event.
:*an object from a class derived from EventArgs that contains the data passed from the object that raised the event to the event handlers.

:The EventArgs class does not contain any data by itself.

:So an event with no data will use a delegate of the form

 public delegate void ''DelegateTypeName'' (object sender, EventArgs e)

:This simple event example is the same as the last one with the IntEventArgs class that serves for passing the int argument to the event handler and all the parameters changed to follow the calling convention for events.

EventHandler delegates - [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.eventhandler(VS.80).aspx MSDN] and [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/db0etb8x(VS.80).aspx MSDN]

:There are two special delegates defined in the System namespace to help you with the events declarations.

:The first is the EventHandler delegate. It passes no data. An event that passes no data can be declared as:

 public event EventHandler ''EventName''

:without having to declare a custom delegate.

:This is the usual way to declare an event that passes no data.

            public void Increment(object sender, EventArgs e)
            {
                int res = 32 + 1;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Inside increment function: &quot; + res.ToString());
            }
            // Second function to be assigned to the event
            public void Decrement(object sender, EventArgs e)
            {
                int res = 32 - 1;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Inside decrement function: &quot; + res.ToString());
            }

                    this.delMember(this, null);
            }
        }
    }
}}

:The second is the EventHandler&lt;T&gt; generic delegate where T is a type derived from EventArgs

 public event EventHandler&lt;T&gt; ''EventName''

:again no need to declare a custom delegate type.

:This is the usual way to declare an event that passes data to the event handlers.

:Note that in this case you still have to declare the type T derived from EventArgs.

{{closed|'''Delete'''. I count 7 votes to delete, 2 for merge (which implicitly is a &quot;keep&quot;) and no other votes. With the possible exception that ''some'' of the resources in this &quot;book&quot; might be suitable for inclusion in the [[Podcasting]] book, the community is generally in favor of deleting this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:33, 24 December 2007 (UTC)}}
This &quot;book&quot; is a list of podcasts - that's it. That's not a [[WB:WIW|textbook]] by any stretch of the imagination, but is rather the sort of advertising we don't allow. Even if the links aren't advertising, Wikibooks is not for lists anyways - we host ''instructional'' content.

It would be far better for the Podcast book to include a link to http://search.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/search?search=podcast and/or http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Podcasts/ then to merge the list of websites included in these pages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:31, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

*{{del}}, Wikibooks should not be for lists of external websites, so don't merge either. Thanks. [[User:Redrocketboy|Redrocketboy]] ([[User talk:Redrocketboy|talk]]) 23:20, 9 December 2007 (UTC)
:{{del}}. Wikibooks is not a host for lists or directories. A book needs to have &quot;prose&quot; or something like it in order to qualify here as a &quot;book&quot;. As to the issue of merging, we have to ask ourselves whether this directory has intrinsic ''educational'' value, or whether it can be used in an appendix ''usefully'' to support another book. It could certainly be crammed uncomfortably into the [[Podcasting]] book, and we could blindly assume that the list is up to date (useful) and that none of the links in the list represent spam or other uncouth interests. I'm really not willing to make that leap of faith, especially not when it comes to the ever-changing world of internet media distribution. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:35, 12 December 2007 (UTC)
:{{del}}. We seem to have a [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Movie making directory|hitory of deleting]] things like this, and I feel the arguments made for deletion of the MMD page also apply here, namely that there are concerns about becoming outdated.

:{{del}}I just looked over the first page, and I don't see who ''wouldn't'' think it advertising, certainly not a textbook. You might be able to merge the links as resources, but this page itself should be deleted. [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 13:02, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

{{closed|as '''keep'''. I think it's pretty clear that there is consensus to keep here, no sense keeping it open any longer. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 21:29, 28 December 2007 (UTC)}}

The content doesn't belong on Wikibooks. It should go to Wikia or Wikiversity because, even though lots of Lord of the Rings fans want it, it is a fictional language that has no practical uses. Maybe I'd change to pro-quenya if you proved it had uses, but not now. Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 00:02, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

:{{keep}} This is a featured book.  Furthermore, its creator was a professor of linguistics, so the language serves as a good springboard for studying and exploring language in general, just as Linux serves as a good springboard for studying and exploring operating systems.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:45, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
:{{keep}} Agree with Jomegat.  Just because it doesn't have an obvious pratical use, doesn't mean it should be deleted.  For example a lot of the more advanced mathematics books could look to have no practical use to non-mathematicians.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:53, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
:{{keep}} The rationale that has typically been used for this and other conlang books is that this is not original research. There are other resources, books, and websites that cover the topic of quenya. Compare this to the [[Pilingual Primer]], which is completely original research, and for which there were no available resources outside of wikibooks at the time it was nominated for deletion. I will, however, note that a google search for quenya does return both the wikipedia and wikibooks entries on the first page, although there are also many other pages of unknown authority listed as well. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:20, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Strong keep''' - no valid reason to delete was given, and I can find none. Obviously the deletion of [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Pilingual Primer|Pilingual Primer]] is the impetus for this nomination. [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] would do well to read the reasons for deletion, namely that it is [[WB:OR|original research]], and is therefore outside project scope; note that usefulness is '''not''' mentioned in [[WB:WIW]], nor in [[WB:DP]]. This language, while obviously constructed and arguably useless, is ''not'' original research - there is a surprising amount of scholarship (ie found via database search) and writing on the subject. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:55, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
:'''Very Strong Keep''' - This is a constructed language, and is used by linguists who study the works of Tolkien from a linguistic viewpoint.  For crying out loud, Tolkien himself was a linguist professionally, and only wrote fiction as a diversion.  Not only can you use the works of Tolkien as legitimate research sources for the study of this language, you can even go back to the sources that ''he used'' to create the language in the first place, especially considering that Tolkien was a scholar of nordic languages in general.  If this were the only language textbook on Wikibooks, I might be a little more concerned, but I hardly find a discussion of a constructed language to be out of place when other more common cultural languages like [[French]] and [[German]] also also readily available.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 03:07, 25 December 2007 (UTC)
:'''Strong Keep''' For the reasons above.  It's referenced and most certainly suitable for Wikibooks and the Wikibooks Language department. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:14, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

I wanted to thank you for all the grammar/spelling work you are doing on this and related books. Even small fixes are a big help to books like that. I know that when I write, I sometimes make common mistakes like switching &quot;its&quot; and &quot;it's&quot; or &quot;then&quot; and &quot;than&quot;. If you have any comments/suggestions about that book, let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:57, 2 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Charge moves through a circuit, losing potential energy as it goes. This means that the charge travels as an electric current. Voltage is defined as the difference in potential energy per. unit charge, i.e.

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{E}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

where V is voltage (in V), E is the difference in potential energy (in joules) and Q is charge (in coulombs).

There are two electrical properties which are both measured in volts (commonly abbreviated V), and so both are known under the somewhat vague title of 'voltage'. Both are so called because they change the potential energy of the charge.

==Electromotive Force (EMF)==
Keep in mind, that EMF as the name suggests is not an electrical force, it is basically the potential difference across the terminals when the key is open i.e. when no current is drawn from the cell. 
EMF is named so by the scientists who performed faulty experiments and named it so, hence, just a tribute to their contribution to physics it is still called EMF but the definition has changed with time.

==Potential Difference==

As charge travels around a circuit, each coulomb of charge has less potential energy, so the voltage (relative to the power source) decreases. The difference between the voltage at two points in a circuit is known as potential difference, and can be measured with a voltmeter.

===Series Circuits===

In a series circuit, the total voltage (EMF) is divided across the components, as each component causes the voltage to decrease, so each one has a potential difference. The sum of the potential differences across all the components is equal to the potential difference (but batteries have their own 'internal resistances', which complicates things slightly, as we will see).

===Parallel Circuits===

In a parallel circuit, the potential difference across each branch of the circuit is equal to the EMF, as the same 'force' is pushing along each path of the circuit. The number of charge carriers (current) differs, but the 'force' pushing them (voltage) does not.

==Questions==

1. A battery has an EMF of 5V. What is the total potential difference across all the components in the circuit?

2. The voltages (relative to the voltage of the battery) on either side of a resistor are -6V and -5V. What is the potential difference across the resistor?

3. At a given point in a circuit, 5C of charge have 10 kJ of potential energy. What is the voltage at this point?

4. Why do the electrons move to a point 1cm further along the wire?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A battery has an EMF of 5V. What is the total potential difference across all the components in the circuit?'''

They are the same! The voltage decreases across the circuit from the voltage at one end of the battery to the other.

'''2. The voltages (relative to the voltage of the battery) on either side of a resistor are -6V and -5V. What is the potential difference across the resistor?'''

-5 - -6 = -5 + 6 = 1V

'''3. At a given point in a circuit, 5C of charge have 10 kJ of potential energy. What is the voltage at this point?'''

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{10 \times 10^3}{5} = 2\mbox{ kV}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Why do the electrons move to a point 1cm further along the wire?'''

The point further down the wire has a lower voltage (i.e. less energy per. coulomb) - the electrons will be at a lower potential energy at this point, and fall to it, just as objects fall to lower potential energies due to gravity.

A '''Followspot''' is a powerful theater light used to 'follow' actors around the stage. They are operated by a human followspot operator. Most followspots use arc lamps or the more powerful xenon arc lamps to produce a bright, white light. Typically followspots include:

*A powerful lamp
*A manually focused lens
*A manual dimming device
*An &quot;iris&quot; to adjust the size of the spot/angle of the beam
*A color magazine or &quot;boomerang&quot; consisting of several gel frames which can be swung in front of the beam
*Some sort of physical sight to assist in aiming is sometimes added onto the lamp by the operator.

Some followspots also allow gobos to be fitted.
==Uses==
Generally a followspot is used to highlight actors on the stage, but it could also be used to focus the audiences attention on a hand-motion or props.

== Overview ==

'''''Albert Runcorn''''' is a wizard of apparently high rank within the Ministry of Magic. We know very little of his appearance except that he is very tall.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron Weasley]] sneak into the Ministry to attempt to recover the Locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], they each disguise themselves as Ministry employees. Harry ends up in the guise of Albert Runcorn, who is apparently quite senior in the Ministry. A wizard who bumps into him in the Atrium apologizes and rushes away, and the Minister for Magic, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], addresses him familiarly as &quot;Albert.&quot;

At one point, Harry as Runcorn is sharing an elevator with an unnamed wizard who apparently is applauding Runcorn's revelation of the Muggle ancestry of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dirk Cresswell|Dirk Cresswell]], and trying to grease his way into the position that Dirk has been ousted from. Later, in another elevator, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] tells Runcorn that this revelation of Cresswell's background is the sort of thing that will get him into trouble.

== Strengths ==
He seems to be one of the higher ranking Ministry workers under the corrupted Ministry. He is also apparently quite intimidating towards the other workers as seen by their attitudes towards Harry while disguised as Runcorn.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Runcorn is very high in the Ministry and has done things that are underhanded in order to achieve his rank, apparently. There are wizards who are frightened of him, wizards who are smarming up to him to try and catch a ride on his coattails, wizards secure in their ancestry who are coldly furious at his tactics, and the upper echelons who treat him, apparently, as a near equal.

== Analysis ==

We really know almost nothing of Runcorn except via the reactions of other people. It is uncertain whether he is actively in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] camp, or is simply making use of the upheaval to advance his own aims within the Ministry as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] is doing. It's certainly not necessary that he be a Death Eater in order to behave as he is.

Given that we don't know anything about Runcorn from outside, it is interesting how solid the picture we can build of him mentally is, simply through people's reactions to him. This again is one of the strengths of the series: the characterization, even of characters like Runcorn who we see for only a handful of chapters, and then only from the very odd perspective of Harry &quot;wearing his skin&quot;, so to speak, is so precise. Having decided that Harry would have to impersonate a high-ranking Ministry official in order to reach Umbridge's office with only minimal questioning, the author took the time to determine how he would have achieved that rank, and what other Ministry workers would think of him.

Hello Praba tuty, thank you for contributing to Wikibooks. Can you please add all pages of [[Design of Main Memory Database System|your book]] to the [[Wikibooks:Categories#Book Categories|book category]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Design of Main Memory Database System]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;? Thank you, --[[User:Ramac|Ramac]] ([[User talk:Ramac|talk]]) 15:14, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

==[[Interview Questions]]==
The name of this book would seem to indicate it's a book for people seeking a job, but the table of contents and content of the first page would indicate that it's a book covering the C programming language.  The title of the book should be changed to reflect this.  Please let me know what you would like the book to be renamed to so that the title does not confuse readers. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:50, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

I have seen websites that prepare you for and/or provide examples of the type of interview questions that people are likely to see when seeking out specific jobs. &quot;Interview Questions&quot; suggests questions that are likely to be asked in an interview and the answers would be included. I haven't noticed any questions yet, but the book is new. I suggest extending the title to &quot;Interview Questions for C Programmers&quot;, if that is the aim for the book. If the intent is to prepare C programmers in general for an interview without a focus on the questions that are likely to be asked, &quot;Interview Preparation for C Programmers&quot; could be a good title to reflect that. I thought I would provide some ideas for a new name, just in case the book is intended to have more of a focus than a general programming book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:24, 9 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome! ==

Since transiting into a part of the workforce it has been very apparent that as a graduate my level of knowledge is of little use practically in the fields. A long road of hard work up ahead to learn, ponder, reflect, improve, integrate and synthesise. I am taking initative in wikibooks because of such an attractive and enlightening mission in putting learning into a massive community even bigger than university, yet even more personally involved and challenging. I hope to find my part too in this community.

I plan to mainly contribute in the business and law section which are my uni majors in Australia, and hopefully internalise the knowledge. I am also interested in language studies and if there's opportunity or need I may help out in translating things into Chinese.

Compositional data arise naturally in several branches of science, including geology. In geochemistry, for example, these constrained data seem to occur typically, when one normalizes raw data or when one obtains the output from a constrained estimation procedure, such as parts per one, percentages, ppm, ppb, molar concentrations, etc.

Compositional data have proved difficult to handle statistically because of the awkward constraint that the components of each vector must sum to unity. The special property of compositional data (the fact that the determinations on each specimen sum to a constant) means that the variables involved in the study occur in constrained space defined by the simplex, a restricted part of real space. 

Pearson was the first to point out dangers that may befall the analyst who attempts to interpret correlations between Ratios whose numerators and denominators contain common parts. More recently, Aitchison, Pawlowsky-Glahn, S. Thió, and other statisticians have develop the concept of Compositional Data Analysis, pointing out the dangers of misinterpretation of closed data when treated with “normal” statistical methods

It is important for geochemists and geologists in general to be aware that the usual multivariate statistical techniques are not applicable to constrained data. It is also important for us to have access to appropriate techniques as they become available. This is the principal aim of this book.

From a hypothetical model of a copper mineralization associated to a felsic intrusive, with specific relationships between certain elements, I will show how “normal” correlation methods fail to identify some of such embedded relationships and how we can obtain other spurious correlations. From there, I will test the same model after transforming the data using the '''''CRL''''', '''''ARL''''', and '''''IRL''''' transformations with the aid of the ''CoDaPack'' software.

Since I addressed this publication to geologists and geoscientists in general, I have kept to a minimum the mathematical formulae and did not include any theoretical demonstration. The “mathematical curios geologist”, if such category exists, can find all of those in a list of recommended sources in the reference section.

So let us start by introducing the model of mineralization that we will be testing.

Figure 1 shows a very simplistic version of a copper mineralization associated to a zone of fractures within a granodiorite intrusive.

&lt;center&gt;'''Figure 1. Ore deposit model of a copper mineralization associated to a tectonic zone within a granodiorite intrusive.'''&lt;/center&gt;

Table 1 shows the results of a random sampling using existing access to the top of the intrusive.

The initial data respond to the following pre-established conditions:

# Is a close system, meaning that the sum of all the values is equal or very close to 100%
# There are no zero values present (I will deal with zero values in a separate example to avoid complicating the initial model).
# There are no statistical outliers (hurricane values) present.
# There is a big difference between the concentRations of the major oxides with respect to the trace elements.
# As shown in Figs. 2-4, there are embedded positive and significant correlation between Cu and As, Ni and Co, and MgO and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
# Finally, I introduced significant negative correlations between K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CaO (Fig. 5), SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Fig 6), K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Cu (Fig. 7), Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Fig. 8), and Co with Cu (Fig 9).

According to these embedded conditions, any correlation analysis must give us two coefficients (Range Correlation Coefficient or RCC):

;Equation 1: Range Correlation Coefficient type A for the initial data, according to the embedded correlations.

;Equation 2: Range Correlation Coefficient type B for the initial data, according to the embedded correlations.

==Case One==

For this case, I will process the initial dataset as a whole, without differentiating between major and trace elements.
Since we established that there are no statistical outliers and no zero values within the data, the first step was to determine their distribution, using the kurtosis and skewness test as described by Kashdan et al, (1979). As one can see from Table 2, all elements responded to a Normal Distribution Law, except for CaO and Na2O, so the next step was to transform those values into Logarithms before testing their correlations.

'''Table 2. Results of the analysis of kurtosis and skewness.'''

To determine the significance of the obtained correlations, I then proceeded to calculate the critical value of Student using equation 3 (Table 4).

It is a common practice in geology that for n &gt; 30 and a probability of 0.05 (95%), if t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 3, then the correlation is significant. Table 6 shows which correlations are significant from the initial dataset.

===Selecting the proper RCCs===

Since the use of Range Correlation Coefficients (RCC) is not a common practice, I will explain in more detail the methodoLogy for their selection from the significant correlations.
a.	We start by ranging all correlations from the highest positive to the lowest negative correlation.
b.	Start at the bottom of the list and select all the negative significant correlations first to create the initial coefficient.
c.	After the first time you use a correlation pair, every time you get the same element, put a dot on top as shown in equation 4.

;Equation 4: Example of the calculation of the multiplicative factor on a RCC.

[[Image:Equation_4_Exampla_RCC.jpg]]
 
This example means that you had a significant positive correlation between Cu and As and two significant negative correlations between Co and Cu and Co and As.

d.	Once you finish with the negative significant correlations, go back to the top of the list and repeat the same process for the positive correlations.
e.	If it is possible, do combine the obtained coefficients.
f.	If you get a contradictory result, e.g. an element that has “conflicting correlations” with previous elements, take those elements out from the coefficient and start a new one.

You can reduce the size of the obtained RCC by eliminating the less frequent elements and subtracting their influence from the overall coefficient. For example, let us assume that we obtained the RCC represented in equation 5 as follow:

;Equation 5: Hypothetical RCC to demonstrate the reduction process.

[[Image:Equation_5_Hypothetical_RCC.jpg]]
 
If we would like to eliminate the Sc and the L.O.I., we first eliminate the L.O.I. and subtract 2 from every element from equation 5.

;Equation 6: Hypothetical RCC without the L.O.I. component.

[[Image:Equation_6_Hypothetical_RCC.jpg]]
 
Then we would subtract the remaining Sc as shown in equation 7.

;Equation 7: Hypothetical RCC without the remaining Sc.

[[Image:Equation_7_Hypothetical_RCC.jpg]]

===RCC from the initial dataset===

According to Table 5, and using the methodoLogy just described, I obtained the RCC shown in equation 8.

;Equation 8: RCC1 for the initial dataset.

[[Image:Equation_8_RCC1.jpg]]

In addition, because L.O.I. has a conflicting correlation with some elements from RCC1, I created a separated RCC for this case as shown in equation 9.

;Equation 9: RCC 2 for the initial dataset.

[[Image:Equation 9 RCC2.jpg]]

Before we use SURFER v. 8.0 to graphically plot these coefficients over our model of mineralization, let us graphically analyze these coefficients using Grapher v. 7.0, also from the Golden Software suite of programs (www.goldensoftware.com).

 
===Analysis of the RCCs from the initial dataset.===

The objective of the processing of the data should be to obtain a RCC that will be as similar as possible to our theoretical ones represented by equations 1 and specially equation 2. We can see that we obtained all the embedded correlations, but “masked” by the presence of spurious (inexistent) ones. For example:

#There is no correlation whatsoever between Al2O3 and the other elements (Fig. 10)
#Same situation with the Fe2O3 (Fig. 11).
#Same situation with the Sc (Fig 12).
#Same situation with the TiO2 (Fig. 13).
#Same situation with the L.O.I. (Fig. 14).

[[Image:Figures_10_to_14_Absence_correlations.jpg]]

Note however, that if we only choose the most strong correlations (r&gt;0.92), then we get a RCC with just the embedded correlations.

== Case Two ==

A more common way to study this kind of data will be to separate the major oxides from the trace elements and treat them separately. It is often intuitively clear for geologists that when mixing percentages with ppm or ppb, the existing correlation between the trace elements is masked or eliminated by the relationships between the major oxides.
So I proceeded to separate the initial dataset into major oxides and trace elements (Tables 7 and 8 in the file Initial data.xls [worksheet “Processing”], located in the attached CD).

==== Analysis of the RCCs from the major oxides of the initial dataset. ====

As it was the case when we processed the whole dataset, here we obtain a RCC that contains the hypothetical one that we are looking to obtain (equation 1), but it is masked by the presence of other elements, many of them without real correlations between them (equation 10).

==== Analysis of the RCCs from the Trace Elements of the initial dataset. ====
As it was the case when we processed the whole dataset, here we obtain a RCC that contains the hypothetical one that we are looking to obtain (equation 2), but it is masked by the presence of other elements, many of them without real correlations between them (equation 11).

'''Equation 11. RCC 4 for the trace elements of the initial dataset.'''

[[Image:RCC 4 for the trace elements of the initial dataset Equation_11.jpg]]

== Graphical representation of the RCCs ==

Using SURFER v.8 from Golden Software Inc., (you can download the demos from www.goldensoftware.com), I obtained Figures 15 – 18.


[[Image:Graphical representation of the RCCs Figures_15_to_18.jpg]]

RCC1 only maps the southwestern border of the mineralized target in a much-dispersed fan that makes it impossible to use as a targeting tool. This was our best RCC from the analysis of the whole dataset.

The only reason why RCC2 partially covers the ore body is the strong and real correlations between Ni, Co, and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. None of these elements have however, a correlation with L.O.I:, therefore, this is a classic example of the formation of a spurious correlation because we applied correlation analysis to a “closed” dataset.

RCC3 contains one of the embedded correlations (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vs. Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but it also contains several spurious correlations and, since it is a petrographic association, has little to do with the location of the ore body.

Finally, RRC4 is mostly our main embedded correlation, and although it also contains some spurious components (e.g. correlation with Sc), it is not surprising that it maps perfectly the ore body.

== Conclusions and recommendations from the processing of the initial dataset ==

Closed systems do provoke spurious correlations that mask the effectiveness of the established RCC. This is especially true when processing datasets that contain a combination of major oxides and trace elements. In those cases, I recommend to use only the extremely intense correlations.

A more useful solution is to separate major oxides from trace elements, and concentrate again only on the intense correlations. The disadvantage here is that we do not use the combine information of both groups of elements.

Will the transformation of the data be more efficient in the creation of RCCs that will help us target the mineralized zone within the granodiorite intrusive?

= Compositional Data Analysis =

The CoDaPack software (which is included in the attached CD and the user guide is presented in Appendix 1) offers three type of transformation, the Centered Log-Ratio transformation (CRL), the Additive Log-Ratio transformation (ARL), and the Isometric Log-Ratio transformation (IRL). The last two require a column with the residual (100 minus the sum of all the other components).

== Centered Log-Ratio Transformation (CLR) ==

Appendix 1 contains the instructions on how to use the CoDaPack software. Since there are no zero values in our dataset, we can proceed directly to the CLR transformation (see table).

As Table 12 shows, the dataset is now “open”, since the sum of all the components is equal to zero, not 100%.

Once I achieved this transformation, I processed the data following the same steps as with the initial dataset. Tables 13 to 15 show the results of this process.

Using SYSTAT SPSS 10.0 for Windows I constructed a matrix of scatter plots (Fig. 19) to confirm the results from table 15, as well as some individual graphics using Grapher 7.0 which clearly show that all the correlations now are real (Figs. 20 – 23).

Equation 12 shows the RCC determined for the CLR transformed data and equation 13 shows the same RCC, but reduced by eliminating the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the L.O.I.

'''Equation 12. RCC5 for the CLR transformed data.'''

[[Image:RCC5a for the CLR transformed data after reducing the SiO2 and the LOI Equation_13.jpg]]

Fig. 24 shows that RCC5a can effectively target the copper mineralization within the granodiorite intrusive.

'''Figure 24. The RCC5a can effectively target the copper mineralization within the granodiorite intrusive.'''

Now, if we will use only the strongest correlations (r&gt;0.95) then we will obtain RCC6 and RCC7 (equations 14 and 15).

'''Equation 14. RCC 6 for correlations stronger than ±0.95 for the CLR transformed data.'''

'''Equation 15. RCC 7 for correlations stronger than ±0.95 for the CLR transformed data.'''

[[Image:RCC 7 for correlations stronger than ±0.95 for the CLR transformed data Equation_15.jpg]]

As one can see from Fig. 25, RCC 6 is an almost perfect match with the location of the ore body. The RCC 7 (Fig 26) is similar to RCC 3 and represents a petroLogic association.

Equations 16 and 17 shows the RCCs determined for the ALR transformed data. It is interesting to note that all the correlations here are positive.

'''Equation 16. RCC 8 of the ARL transformed data.'''

'''Equation 17. RCC 9 of the ARL transformed data.'''

[[Image:RCC 9 of the ARL transformed data Equation_17.jpg]]

Figures 28 and 29 show the spatial behavior of these RCCs with respect to the location of the ore body. If we combine both RCCs, we obtain equation 18 (Fig. 30).

=== Conclusions and Recommendations from the Compositional Data Analysis ===
One very important effect of “opening” a dataset by using any of these transformations is that we get rid off all spurious correlations. The transformed data do contain unexpected correlations, but they are real.

Another important point is that we do not need to process the data separately (e.g. separating major oxides from trace elements), but can process the whole dataset taking advantage of the information contained in both groups.

From all the RCCs obtained so far, the RCC 8, RCC 9, and especially the RCC9/8 (ALR) were by far the most efficient one for targeting the copper mineralization. 

The CRL transformed data did also provide for useful RCCs, especially if we concentrate in the higher correlations. 

Finally, the IRL transformed data was effective for as long as the geochemist will “interpret” the coefficient and not plot them blindly. For example, a geochemist should know that elements like Pb and Co, usually concentrate bellow the ore body (inframinerals), and therefore while using RCC 13, the investigator should concentrate on the lower values as an indication of the location of the ore body. We have a similar situation with RCC 11. The investigator should know that a common effect of sodic metasomatism would be the lixiviation of MgO and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; therefore, the geochemist should be looking for lower values of the RCC.

In general, I can state that transformed data are more effective for the location of the mineralized targets than the non-transformed dataset, and that the ARL method seems to be the most effective for processing this type of data. However, the geochemist should always use his background knowledge to help to decide the most efficient RCC for the studied area.

I recommend the use of the software CoDaPack for the processing of any type of “closed” dataset.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Research psychology encompasses the study of behavior for use in academic settings, and contains numerous areas. It contains the areas of abnormal psychology, biological psychology, cognitive psychology, comparative psychology, developmental psychology, personality psychology, social psychology and others. All branches of psychology can have a research component to them. Research psychology is contrasted with applied psychology.

Research in psychology is conducted in broad accord with the standards of the scientific method, encompassing both qualitative ethological and quantitative statistical modalities to generate and evaluate explanatory hypotheses with regard to psychological phenomena. Where research ethics and the state of development in a given research domain permits, investigation may be pursued by experimental protocols. Psychology tends to be eclectic, drawing on scientific knowledge from other fields to help explain and understand psychological phenomena. Qualitative psychological research utilizes a broad spectrum of observational methods, including action research, ethography, exploratory statistics, structured interviews, and participant observation, to enable the gathering of rich information unattainable by classical experimentation. Research in humanistic psychology is more typically pursued by ethnographic, historical, and historiographic methods.

The testing of different aspects of psychological function is a significant area of contemporary psychology. Psychometric and statistical methods predominate, including various well-known standardized tests as well as those created ad hoc as the situation or experiment requires.

Academic psychologists may focus purely on research and psychological theory, aiming to further psychological understanding in a particular area, while other psychologists may work in applied psychology to deploy such knowledge for immediate and practical benefit. However, these approaches are not mutually exclusive and most psychologists will be involved in both researching and applying psychology at some point during their career. Clinical psychology, among many of the various disciplines of psychology, aims at developing in practicing psychologists knowledge of and experience with research and experimental methods which they will continue to build up as well as employ as they treat individuals with psychological issues or use psychology to help others.

When an area of interest requires specific training and specialist knowledge, especially in applied areas, psychological associations normally establish a governing body to manage training requirements. Similarly, requirements may be laid down for university degrees in psychology, so that students acquire an adequate knowledge in a number of areas. Additionally, areas of practical psychology, where psychologists offer treatment to others, may require that psychologists be licensed by government regulatory bodies as well.

Quantitative psychology involves the application of statistical analysis to psychological research, and the development of novel statistical approaches for measuring and explaining human behavior. It is a young field (only recently have Ph.D. programs in quantitative psychology been formed), and it is loosely comprised of the subfields psychometrics and mathematical psychology.

Psychometrics is the field of psychology concerned with the theory and technique of psychological measurement, which includes the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits. Measurement of these unobservable phenomena is difficult, and much of the research and accumulated knowledge in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to properly define and quantify such phenomena. Psychometric research typically involves two major research tasks, namely: (i) the construction of instruments and procedures for measurement; and (ii) the development and refinement of theoretical approaches to measurement.

&lt;center&gt;[[Introduction_to_Psychology|Back to Table of Contents]]&lt;/center&gt;

Psychology is a science and therefore, must be approached as such.
This means that the scientific method must be used, especially in designing an experiment.

There are several research methods that psychologists employ:

== Research Designs ==
Although there are many different kinds of research designs in psychology, the general kinds of studies are: descriptive or qualitative, correlational, and experimental.  The method of data collection also varies, with self-report on one end of the spectrum and naturalistic observation on the other.

===Descriptive Studies===
Studies that do not test specific relationships between variables are called descriptive studies.  In this research method, general or specific behaviors or attributes are observed and measured, without respect to each other.  These studies are generally the design of choice for breaking into new areas, as the vast but often inconclusive amount of information collected can be drawn upon for future hypotheses.

An example of such a study would be a researcher inquiring into the quality of mental health institutions.  This would be done by observation or measurements of various criteria, as opposed to relationships between variables.  Alternatively, the study could be conducted without any specific criteria in mind.

===Correlational Study===

This method of statistical analysis shows the relationship between two variables. For example, research has shown that alcohol dependence correlates with depression. That is to say, the more alcohol people consume, the more depressed they become. On the other hand, it could be the other way around as well: the more depressed people become, the more likely they are to consume alcohol. 

The attributes of correlations include strength and direction.  The direction may be positive (both variables both increase or decrease together), negative (one variable increases while the other decreases) or unrelated (a random relationship between variables).  The strength of a correlation ranges from -1 to +1 with a 0 reflecting no relationship between variables. A correlational study serves only to describe/predict behaviour and not to explain it. This is so because a third variable could be shown to cause the occurrence of one of the variables. Furthermore, only experiments can prove causation.

===Experiments===

Experiments are generally the studies that are the most precise and have the most weight to them due to their conclusive power.  They are particularly effective in proving hypotheses about cause and effect relationships between variables.  A hypothesis is a prediction of how one variable relates to another.  There are two types of hypotheses, ''null'' and ''directional''.  The null is a prediction that there will not be any change in the dependent variable when the researcher changes the independent variable.  The directional hypothesis states that the change in the independent variable will induce a change in the dependent variable.  In a true experiment, all variables are held constant except for the independent variable, which is manipulated.  Thus, any changes in the experimental groups can be solely attributed to the action of the independent variable.  This is called being ''objective''.

For instance, in an experiment to test whether music improves people's memories, we would have a sheet of paper with ten unrelated words on it for people to memorize.
The control group would have no music playing in the background while the experimental group would have some music in the background.
Because as researchers we have adhered to the scientific method and held all variables as constant as possible, if the experimental group does report better recollection of words, then we could assume that the music had an effect on memory. 
However, we must be certain to do our best to ensure that any controllable differences between the two groups are eliminated in order to ensure that no confounding variable interferes with the experiment.

There are two main ways to pick, or ''sample'' the subjects in an experiment, ''random'' and ''stratified''.  In a random there are two main ways to pick, or ''sample'' the subjects in an experiment, ''random'' and ''stratified''.  In a random sampling each person has an equal chance at being picked.  This means that if 90% of the population being sampled from are christian than 90% of the sample will be Christian.  If the researcher wanted all religions represented equally he would employ stratified sampling.  For instance, the experiment could be performed only on women, or on mixed groups with equal numbers of each sex in them, to eliminate the possibility of biased results from one gender having better average memory than the other.

Steps must be taken to make sure that there is no ''experimenter bias''.  Two common forms of bias are ''demand characteristics'' and ''expectancy effects.''  If a researcher expects certain results from an experiment and influences the subjects response this is called demand characteristics.  If the experimenter inadvertently interperets the information to be as expected in his hypothesis it is called expectancy effect.  To counteract experimenter bias the subjects can be kept uninformed on the intentions of the experiment, which is called single blind.  If the people collecting the information and the subjects giving it are kept uninformed than it is called a double blind experiment.

The experiment should also be reported so that other researchers can ''repeat'' it.  If an experiment isn't repeatable it will not hold much wieght in the scientific community.  To help an experiment be repeatable the researcher should have the variables be measureable, this is called being ''empirical''.

Wether researching humans or animals the experiment should be ethical.  When humans are the subjects they should be ''informed'' of what the study is, ''consent'' to being in it, be ''debriefed'' afterwards, and their information should also be kept ''confidential''.

===Naturalistic Observation===
Researchers study organisms in their natural environments or habitats without trying to manipulate or control anything.
In this method, the researcher observes the behavior under study in its natural setting while attempting to avoid influencing or controlling it. The observations are done in a naturalistic setting without any preparation or participation of the researcher. Therefore, the behavior is observed in public places, streets, homes, and schools.  Observing people from other cultures response in the same setting is a way to provide information for ''cross-cultural research''.



===Self Report===
This method includes ''tests'', ''questionnaires'', and ''interviews''.  All of which do the same thing, give the subject a stimuli, i.e. the question, and get a response.  The advantage of using these is the ability to inexpensively and rapidly collect vast amounts of data.  This allows a psychologist to compare one person, or a group of peoples results to thousands of others.  The disadvantage is that they are not always telling what the subject's response is but what the subject says is the response (demand characteristics).

==Information Display==

===Statistics===
Once the information is gathered it has to be put into some kind of form, usually numerical.  ''Statistics'' deals with the collection,  analysis, interpretation, and presentation of numerical data.  The goal of statistics is to summarize the data and let ''descriptions'' or ''[[wikt:inference|inferences]] be made''.  Inferences are used when making predictions of the relationships of variables.  Descriptions are concise displays, using ''stastistical symbyls'',of the information in ''frequency distributions, measures of central tendency'', or ''measures of variability''.

====Statistical Symbols====
There are agreed upon standard symbols used in statistical displays.  These symbols can be used by themselves or in equations.

N = number of scores

X = score (or scores)

M = mean

d = difference of a score from the mean

Σ = sum of

D = difference in rank

r or ρ = correlation

SD = standard deviation

====Frequency Distribution====
A frequency distribution is obtained by taking the score and splitting them into subgroups.  The subgroups are then put on either a histogram (bar graph) or a frequency polygram (line graph).  When a frequency distribution has most of the scores on one side of the graph it is considered skewed.  If it has most of the scores in the middle with equal amounts on both sides it is considered symmetrical.

====Measures of Central Tendency====
In measures of central tendency there is one number that is used to represent a group of numbers.  This number is either the [[w:Mean#Arithmetic_mean|mean]], [[w:Median|median]], or the [[w:Mode_%28statistics%29|mode]].

====Measures of Variability====
Variability is concerned with the dispersement of the scores, called ''variability'' i.e. are the scores clustered together or spread out.  ''Range'' and ''standard deviation'' are the measures most commonly used.  To find the range just subtract the number of the lowest score from the number of the highest score.  This can be decieving if most of the scores are bunched together and one of the scores is very far away from it.  In this case standard deviation must be used.  A formula commonly used for standard deviation is SD = the square root of Σd²/N.

===Case Studies===
In the course of treating a patient a psychologist will take records of problems, insights, and techniques that were important in the patients treatment.  When this is done is is called a ''case study'' or a ''clinical case history'' and may be drawn upon by researchers to expose a factor that important for understanding a behavior.


=BASIC CONCEPTS =

* a. independent variable = variable that one manipulates in order to see if it has any effect on the dependent variable (eg. in the example above, the independent variable would be music and its effect on memory)

* b. dependent variable = variable that depends on the effect of the independent variable (eg. in the example above, the dependent variable would be memory and better recollection of words)

* c. double-blind procedure = procedure in which neither the researcher nor the subjects know which group (experimental or control) the subjects are in in order to minimize experimenter cues.

* d. single-blind procedure = procedure in which only the researcher knows which group which kind of subject is in.

* e. experimenter cues - subtle and often unintentional cues that the experimenter makes which implies which group which kind of subject is in. for example, if an experimenter believes that music does indeed improve memory, some cues would be the experimenter's smiling/winking at the experimental group. This smile/wink would imply to the subjects in the experimental group that the researcher is secretly implying that they're in the experimental group.

* f. placebo effect - a treatment works because of the patient's belief that it works and not because it actually does.

== Setup of Darts and Dartboard == 
There are only 2 things that a person needs to play a game of darts: a set of darts, and a dartboard. A set of darts usually consists of three identical darts. A single dart is made up of four sections:

[[Image:Dart Components.svg|250px|right|The components of the dart.]]
*The '''tip''' of the dart is the foremost section of the dart, and holds the dart in the dartboard.
*The '''grip''' of the dart is directly behind the tip and is where a person holds the dart while throwing.
*The '''shaft''' of the dart is directly behind the grip and connects the grip and flight.
*The '''flight''' is in the back of the dart, and keeps the dart moving straight through the air. 


[[Image:Dartboard.svg|thumb|right|300px|The dartboard.]]A normal dartboard is a circle that is divided into 20 scoring sections, has a bullseye, a double-point ring, and has a triple-point ring. This board is usually hung on a wall 7 ft 9.25 in away from the player and at eye level, which is usually a standard 5 ft 8 in high.

      <text xml:space="preserve">After using Moose for a while you will eventually find yourself with an assortment of classes that you wish to reuse. Unfortunately, Moose won't make it all that easy to use those Moose classes from within Moose. Here are some difficult tasks{{ref|difficult}} to do within Moose:

'''In these examples, MooseObj, is a Moose object.
* isa =&gt; ArrayRef[ MooseObj ]
** There is no syntactic sugar to facilitate in creating MooseObj(s).
** Not easily possible to coerce from &lt;code&gt;$self-&gt;MooseObj(  [{constructor_args1}, {constructor_args2}]  )&lt;/code&gt;.

* isa =&gt; 'MooseObj'
** No syntactic Autoboxing of the MooseObj, you can't do the following: &lt;code&gt;$self-&gt;foo-&gt;new( {constructor_args} )&lt;/code&gt;.
** No implicit way to bypass the creation of MooseObj and set its accessors. ''more on this in [[#One-to-one Auto-vivification|One-to-one Auto-vivification]].

== One-to-one Auto-vivification ==

What if you don't care about MooseObj, only the accessors inside? A child object might do no more than function as logical grouping for more accessors, as in the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package Address;
use Moose;

has 'street' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', required =&gt; 1, is =&gt; 'ro' );
has 'city'   =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', required =&gt; 1, is =&gt; 'ro' );
has 'zip'    =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', required =&gt; 1, is =&gt; 'ro' );
has 'state'  =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', required =&gt; 1, is =&gt; 'ro' );
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
package USProfile;
use Moose;

has 'workAddress' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Address', is =&gt; 'ro' );
has 'homeAddress' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Address', is =&gt; 'ro' );
&lt;/source&gt;

Even though Moose very well seeks to [[Programming with Moose/Ideology#Base-type independence|replace and abstract away a lot of perl's base-types]] here in comparison to having an Address hash it makes the job difficult. Here are some of the obvious difficulties:
* You can not skip the step of creating a new &lt;tt&gt;Address&lt;/tt&gt; object
** The syntax &lt;code&gt;$USProfile-&gt;workAddress-&gt;street('1234 FooStreet')&lt;/code&gt;, is not valid
** The syntax &lt;code&gt;$USProfile-&gt;workAddress-&gt;{street} = '1324 FooStreet'&lt;/code&gt; would be (assuming &lt;tt&gt;workAddress&lt;/tt&gt; was a hash.)
* You might wish for the component-class &lt;tt&gt;Address&lt;/tt&gt; to require its child-attributes, but there is no way to later disable those &lt;code&gt;requires=&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, when the class is used as a child of another class.
** The syntax &lt;code&gt;has 'workAddress' =&gt; (  isa =&gt; 'Address', is =&gt; 'ro', default =&gt; sub{Address-&gt;new}  );&lt;/code&gt; is not valid.
** This wouldn't be all that useful in this case because of the like-problem with &lt;code&gt;is=&gt;'ro'&lt;/code&gt;.

==Proposed Solution==
'''THIS SECTION IS BEING RE-WRITTEN'''
Now obviously something nifty should happen to facilitate the creation of email. Any work done here would do a lot to further Moose's application into a Token-based system. Such as XML, where you can easily model, a one level tree in Moose, and then pull that into to another Moose class for a multiple level document. '''The following is pseudo-code that is not implemented.'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $person = USProfile-&gt;new;
## Hack a handles new into the Email code, which calls its own constructor
my $email = $person-&gt;email-&gt;new({  (constructor)  })

## Still permit some sort of construction that suffices the required
## obviously a no-go if you have it embedded in an ArrayRef or HashRef
my $person =&gt; USProfile-&gt;new({state=&gt;'TX', email=&gt;{[moose_args=&gt;]constructor args} }
&lt;/source&gt;

Maybe there needs to be a set of AttributeHelpers for things that inherit from Moose::Object

Another way to accomplish this would be something like (provided by steven)
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
has hash =&gt; (
  is =&gt; &quot;ro&quot;
  , default =&gt; sub { blessed(shift)-&gt;new }
  , lazy =&gt; 1
);

my $h = Hash-&gt;new;
$h-&gt;hash-&gt;hash-&gt;hash;
 print $h-&gt;dump;'
&lt;/source&gt;

There are a few issues with this:
* &lt;code&gt;blessed(shift)-&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; should be the value the &lt;code&gt;isa=&gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead.
* It doesn't accommodate for &lt;code&gt;isa&lt;/code&gt;'s, that have &lt;code&gt;required=&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, there must be some way to autovivify, or send constructor args.

== Footnotes ==
* {{note|difficult}} Difficult '''or overly verbose'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Conductance is a measure of how well an artefact (such as an electrical component, not a material, such as iron) carries an electric current. Resistance is a measure of how well an artefact resists an electric current.

Resistance is measured in Ohms (usually abbreviated using the Greek letter Omega, Ω) and, in formulae, is represented by the letter R. Conductance is measured in Siemens (usually abbreviated S) and, in formulae, is represented by the letter G.

Resistance and conductance are each other's reciprocals, so:

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{G}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G = \frac{1}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Ohm's Law==

Ohm's Law states that the potential difference across an artefact constructed from Ohmic conductors (i.e. conductors that obey Ohm's Law) is equal to the product of the current running through the component and the resistance of the component. As a formula:

V = IR

where V is potential difference (in V), I is current (in A) and R is resistance (in Ω). 

===In terms of Resistance===

This formula can be rearranged to give a formula which can be used to calculate the resistance of an artefact:

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

===In terms of Conductance===

Since conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, we can deduce a formula for conductance (G):

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{G} = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{I}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

===The Relationship between Potential Difference and Current===

From Ohm's Law, we can see that potential difference is directly proportional to current, provided resistance is constant. This is because two variables (let us call them x and y) are considered directly proportional to one another if:

&lt;math&gt; y = kx &lt;/math&gt;

where k is any positive constant. Since we are assuming that resistance is constant, R can equal k, so V=RI states that potential difference is directly proportional to current. As a result, if potential difference is plotted against current on a graph, it will give a straight line with a positive gradient which passes through the origin. The gradient will equal the resistance.

==In Series Circuits==

In a series circuit (for example, a row of resistors connected to each other), the resistances of the resistors add up to give the total resistance. Since conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, the reciprocals of the conductances add up to give the reciprocal of the total conductance. So:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma R = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{1}{G} = \frac{1}{G_1} + \frac{1}{G_2} + ... + \frac{1}{G_n}&lt;/math&gt;

==In Parallel Circuits==

In a parallel circuit, the conductances of the components on each branch add up to give the total conductance. Similar to series circuits, the reciprocals of the total resistances of each branch add up to give the reciprocal of the total resistance of the circuit. So:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma G = G_1 + G_2 + ... + G_n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}&lt;/math&gt;

When considering circuits which are a combination of series and parallel circuits, consider each branch as a separate component, and work out its total resistance or conductance before finishing the process as normal.

==Questions==

1. The potential difference across a resistor is 4V, and the current is 10A. What is the resistance of the resistor?

2. What is the conductance of this resistor?

3. A conductor has a conductance of 2S, and the potential difference across it is 0.5V. How much current is flowing through it?

4. A graph is drawn of potential difference across an Ohmic conductor, and current. For every 3cm across, the graph rises by 2cm. What is the conductance of the conductor?

5. On another graph of potential difference and current, the graph curves so that the gradient increases as current increases. What can you say about the resistor?

6. 3 resistors, wired in series, have resistances of 1kΩ, 5kΩ and 500Ω each. What is the total resistance across all three resistors?

7. 2 conductors, wired in parallel, have conductances of 10S and 5S. What is the total resistance of both branches of the parallel circuit?

8. The circuit above is attached in series to 1 10Ω resistor. What is the total conductance of the circuit now?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. The potential difference across a resistor is 4V, and the current is 10A. What is the resistance of the resistor?'''

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{4}{10} = 0.4\mbox{ }\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. What is the conductance of this resistor?'''

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5\mbox{ S}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. A conductor has a conductance of 2S, and the potential difference across it is 0.5V. How much current is flowing through it?'''

&lt;math&gt; I=GV=2*0.5=1A&lt;/math&gt;

I = 1A

'''4. A graph is drawn of potential difference across an Ohmic conductor, and current. For every 3cm across, the graph rises by 2cm. What is the conductance of the conductor?'''

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Gradient } = \frac{2}{3} = \mbox{ Resistance}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5\mbox{ S}&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. On another graph of potential difference and current, the graph curves so that the gradient increases as current increases. What can you say about the resistor?'''

The resistor is not an Ohmic conductor.

'''6. 3 resistors, wired in series, have resistances of 1kΩ, 5kΩ and 500Ω each. What is the total resistance across all three resistors?'''

ΣR = (1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + (5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + 500 = 6500Ω = 6.5kΩ

'''7. 2 conductors, wired in parallel, have conductances of 10S and 5S. What is the total resistance of both branches of the parallel circuit?'''

&lt;math&gt;G = 10 + 5 = 15\mbox{ S} = \frac{1}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{15} \approx 0.0667\mbox{ }\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

'''8. The circuit above is attached in series to 1 10Ω resistor. What is the total conductance of the circuit now?'''

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma R = 10 + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{151}{15} \mbox{ }\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;G = \frac{15}{151} \approx 0.0993\mbox{ S}&lt;/math&gt;

Creamed spinach makes a nutritious [[Cookbook:sauce|sauce]] that goes well with [[Cookbook:fish|fish]] and [[Cookbook:meat|meat]] dishes. In Swedish cuisine it has traditionally been used with boiled [[Cookbook:potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:fish|fish]] or with chipolata, the Swedish &quot;prince-sausage&quot;.

== Ingredients ==
* 500 g fresh [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]] (or whole frozen spinach leaves)
* 2 dl of [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 1/2 tsp of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1/2 dl of [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]

'''or'''

* 400 g of [[Cookbook:chop|chopped]] spinach, fresh or frozen
* 1 1/2 tbs of [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 dl of [[Cookbook:milk|milk]]
* 1/2 tsp of salt
* black pepper

== Procedure ==

Creamed spinach can be done in two different ways. Either with whole spinach or with chopped spinach.

With '''whole spinach''', first [[Cookbook:boil|boil]] the fresh spinach leaves and the salt in the water for about 5 minutes. If you use frozen spinach, follow the instructions on the box. Note that spinach is high in [[Cookbook:nitrate|nitrites]] which means you may not have to use as much salt as you might think. After boiling for 5 minutes remove the water and let the spinach &quot;dry&quot; for a minute or so. Put the spinach back into the [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pan]] and add the cream. Boil for a few more minutes and add salt and pepper to taste. Instead of cream the spinach can be quickly fried in about 1 tbs of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]].

With '''chopped spinach''', first boil the fresh spinach leaves as above or gently thaw the frozen (chopped) spinach in a little bit of water in a pan. Mix the flour with the chopped spinach in the pan and add the milk. Bring the spinach to the boil and boil gently for 3-5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.

== Variations ==
It is not uncommon to add a dash of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] and/or [[Cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]] to the creamed spinach. The proportions of milk/cream to spinach can be varied to produce anything from a rich green color to something similar to a [[Cookbook:White Sauce|white sauce]] with spinach in it, all according to taste.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North America]]

This recipe for '''Vegetarian Meatballs''' is delicious and easy to prepare. The meatballs don't come out spherical, though; they are more of squished hemispheres, flat on one side. The recipe costs US$5-7 to prepare.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
* 1 package (340 g) Yves Veggie Ground Round. (A similar cooked ground [[w:Meat analogue|meat analogue]], such as [http://thelazyvegetarian.blogspot.com/2005/06/fake-ground-meat.html one of these], should also work.)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tbsp|Tbsp]] hickory smoked barbecue sauce (recommended) OR [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]] OR [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]] OR [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:eggs|eggs]]
* 3 Tbsp [[Cookbook:breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]
* 1/8 [[Cookbook:Tsp|Tsp]] dried [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
* Optional: low-sodium [[Cookbook:soy sauce|soy sauce]] to taste, if desired

== Procedure ==

# Preheat oven to 350°F.
# [[Cookbook:Sauté|Sauté]] onion; pour off oil; put aside.
# In a large bowl, [[Cookbook:beat|beat]] eggs.
# Add Ground Round and break up well with fork.
# Add all remaining ingredients.
# Mix well.
# Line a large 12&quot; x 18&quot; (31 x 45 cm) tray with parchment paper.
# Drop mixture onto the paper in tablespoonfuls. You should get 30-40 meatballs. Don't worry if the mixture falls apart a little on tray.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] at 350°F for 22 minutes.
# Flip meatballs over.
# Bake for an additional 9 minutes.

== Notes ==

* Yes, the total baking time really is 31 minutes. The burgers come out crisp and delicious.

== Commentary on Seed Factories Book ==

* '''Moved from Seed Factories title page discussion:'''  (Originally from user Roleic)

dear Daniel,

your book in progress was well worth the time reading. Thank you for sharing it. It contains many valuable concepts upon which can be built.

'''System Engineering'''

The book is also a nearly pure systems engineering (SE) text book. Of course you are right that SE is a valuable method to tackle some (but by far not all) of the complexity of a Seed Factory. And as you write in your book SE does not do the actual job. It &quot;only&quot; breaks down the enormous undertaking into more manageable tasks, allocates goals for each task such that their results will fit together to perform as the intended system. But of course it leaves each of the actual tasks like technical concepts, design, engineering analysis and detail design to be done; as your book says probably several times over for comparing design options and accommodating system changes. This is the bulk of the work into which most of the ingenuity and effort will have to go.
Your book gave me a better and deeper understanding of creating a Seed Factory. But as of now it still left me unsatisfied about some important points (I am aware that the book is work still in progress):

'''Automation and Efficiency'''

In several places your book claims that the Mature Factory (85% self reproducing) is expected to be more efficient than a traditional industry producing the same products. Your main argument is the high level of automation and hence low level of human labour. Your Mature Factory will be able to reproduce itself every few years (was it 7?). What will the Mature Factory to be reproduced consist of?  A few multi-purpose vehicles (maybe 50?), a few dozen agricultural machines, the workshop with all the machines for reproduction, a few hundred houses or apartments, community utilities. The highest number of repetition of the same item is probably housing and house hold equipment. Most of the machines and plants have either low or single repetition numbers for every reproduction cycle.
To automate this kind of low volume production means heavy investment in design work and complex automation machinery just to produce one copy every 7? years. And don't forget that also the maintenance, repair, disassembly and recycling is intended to be automated too and therefore the automation equipment needs to be reproduced too. And this should really be more efficient than the present industry producing thousands or more copies every year? -*1)- And even they use automation to a much lower level than 85%. Only car industry producing millions of cars per year use a high level of automation (but of course without reproduction of itself).
In my opinion this high level of automation is not needed on Earth in moderate climate zones. (This might be a remainder from lunar projects). People need a task for their health. With the intended level of automation the villagers would need to work just 1 hour per day. What will they do the rest of the day? Experience shows that people without a fulfilling task get lazy, unhappy, aggressive, unhealthy and die earlier. Working to build, maintain and supply the village could be such a fulfilling task. Less automation and more human labour would increase probably the efficiency and definitely the feasibility of the project considerably.

-*1)- Of course it depends on how efficiency is defined. If it is production output per hour of human labour then automation is more efficient. if it is production output per necessary amount of machinery, or per capital invested in machinery, or per hours of development of machinery, or per energy consumption then automation is less efficient.

'''Underestimated Agriculture'''

The main goal of the project is self-supplying (85%) a village (660 people) with what they need for a reasonably comfortable life. To achieve that, infrastructure and consumables are required. The infrastructure (houses, machines, etc.) need only to be built once and then maintained and repaired. The much more important task is the steady provision of consumables like energy, clean water, food in sufficient diversity and quality, clothing etc. The main focus of the book seems to be on the infrastructure and the machinery to reproduce it. Only little is said about the provision of consumables (most about energy). E.g. I miss more details about agriculture and food conservation and storage. This should not be underestimated in terms of technologies, energy consumption, irrigation, fertilizing, crop protection against pests, seed breeding. Putting a few potatoes in the ground each spring will not do the job. There is nothing about producing animal proteins (milk, eggs, meat or equivalent substitutes) which are essential for human health. Of course they are needed in lower quantity than we are presently used to consume in the western world. But nevertheless.

'''Design is the real Challenge'''

Then I miss some attempt to design at least one sample equipment which is able to produce a useful thing AND is reproducible within the village to 85%. To me this seems the core of the real challenge: the '''design''' of the equipment such that it will serve its purpose AND it will be able to be reproduced by a 660-person-village. Reproduction of the present designs of tractors, harvesters or sawmills etc. in the village would by far not be possible because of the high number of different raw materials used, the huge number of different parts created by a large number of different processes provided by suppliers and their suppliers etc. To self-reproduce such a machine you would have to also reproduce a good part of the whole industry of today. This is obviously not possible or reasonable for a 660-person-village. To come closer to the feasibility of reproduction the design of e.g. a tractor has to be changed fundamentally to become much easier to reproduce AND still serve its purpose.
First the number of materials used must be dramatically reduced and limited to those available at the location of the village. Another village with different natural resources might have to use a very different design of such a tractor and its reproduction facilities. Then the number of different parts and manufacturing processes must be dramatically reduced. Then the complexity of the parts and the processes must be reduced. And last but not least the design is required to be able to be automatically produced, assembled, maintained, repaired, disassembled and recycled (why all of this automatically?). This probably means a complete and fundamental redesign not only of the tractor but also of the reproduction facilities (machines) by substituting most established designs and processes with new ones.
This and not the lack of SE is the main reason why humanity has so far never succeeded in creating a system with high let alone full level of self reproduction. System Engineering alone can not perform this. Only a complete redesign by forgetting almost every known design today might be able to achieve the goal. This means also that the products (houses, house-hold equipment etc.) might look very different to what we are used to today. And perhaps if some future villagers knew today how that new habitat would eventually look like then they might decide not to participate in the first place...

Since there has never ever a self-reproducing system been built, I recommend to start much smaller. E.g. just try to plan and develop something as simple as a table spoon for 85% self-reproduction. Yes the spoon is no system but just one part. However, its reproduction machinery which has to reproduce itself as well is already a big challenge. Demonstrate that it can be done within a village of 660 people and 300 hectares of land. Learn from the process and apply the lessons learned to the next more complex product. A part of the spoon machinery can be either reused as is or be generalised for more universal utility. But much new equipment will have to be developed.
Based on just private initiative and funding it might take one or two generations until a Mature Factory supplying a village by 85% can be developed. Only in case of massive investments either by BIG money or by BIG open source volunteer participation it might be done in one or two decades (compare Wikipedia). I would be happy if someone can prove me wrong and it turned out much easier :-)

'''Enough Land for local natural Resources?'''

The book budgets 300 hectares of land for 660 villagers to live on and from. I don't know if this is really sufficient. I have no facts to support or question this budget. But let us think what this land has to provide. Construction material for housing of 660 people. Mining of the most used metals. According to a diagram in the book out of 1000kg of rock 50 grams of iron can be expected to be gained. Hence for 1 kg of iron 20 metric tons of rock need to be processed. If I think of all the iron in that machinery: it will require a LOT of rock and energy. Surface or ground water for drinking, washing, cleaning, crop irrigation. Sufficient area for agriculture of diverse food types. Area for living space. Area for solar energy conversion. Area for wood production. Area for production sites. Storage areas. Agricultural area with oilseeds for bio-diesel, lubricants, soap, hydraulic oil, edible vegetable oil. Agricultural area for live stock fodder. Area for fibre plants for clothing. This looks like needing a more detailed budget with justifications. This alone is not so easy.

I am very thrilled about the thought of systems capable of a high level of self-reproduction. But I also see that the challenges are bigger than what a number of intelligent Systems Engineering Diagrams might make us believe. But that is no reason not to try :-)</text>

== Arabic language ==


=== Literary and Modern Standard Arabic ===
The term &quot;Arabic&quot; may refer to either literary Arabic (''{{Unicode|fuṣḥā}}'') or the many localized varieties of Arabic commonly called &quot;colloquial Arabic.&quot; Arabs consider literary Arabic as the standard language and tend to view everything else as mere dialects. Literary Arabic ({{lang|ar|اللغة العربية الفصحى}} translit: &quot;the most eloquent Arabic language&quot;), refers both to the language of present-day media across North Africa and the Middle East and to the language of the Qur'an. (The expression ''media'' here includes most television and radio, and practically all written matter, including all books, newspapers, magazines, documents of every kind, and reading primers for small children.) &quot;Colloquial&quot; or &quot;dialectal&quot; Arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties derived from Classical Arabic, spoken across North Africa and the Middle East, which constitute the everyday spoken language. These sometimes differ enough to be mutually incomprehensible. These dialects are typically unwritten, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry) exists in many of them. They are often used to varying degrees in informal spoken media, such as soap operas and talk shows. Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages.

The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia, which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language, usually in different social situations. In the case of Arabic, educated Arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their local dialect and their school-taught literary Arabic. This diglossic situation facilitates code switching where a speaker switches back and forth between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. When educated Arabs of different nationalities engage in conversation (for example, a Moroccan speaking with a Lebanese), both switch into Literary Arabic for the sake of communication.  

Like other languages, literary Arabic continues to evolve. Classical Arabic (especially from the pre-Islamic to the Abbasid period, including Qur'anic Arabic) can be distinguished from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) as used today.  Classical Arabic is considered normative; modern authors attempt (with varying degrees of success) to follow the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by Classical grammarians (such as Sibawayh), and to use the vocabulary defined in Classical dictionaries (such as the Lisān al-Arab.)  However, many modern terms would have been mysterious to a Classical author, whether taken from other languages (for example, فيلم ''film'') or coined from existing lexical resources (for example, هاتف ''hātif'' &quot;telephone&quot; = &quot;caller&quot;).  Structural influence from foreign languages or from the colloquials has also affected Modern Standard Arabic: for example, MSA texts sometimes use the format &quot;A, B, C, and D&quot; when listing things, whereas Classical Arabic prefers &quot;A and B and C and D&quot;, and subject-initial sentences may be more common in MSA than in Classical Arabic.  For these reasons, Modern Standard Arabic is generally treated separately in non-Arab sources.

===Influence of Arabic on other languages===
The influence of Arabic has been most profound in Islamic countries. Arabic is a major source of vocabulary for languages as diverse as Berber, English, Kurdish, Persian, Swahili, Urdu, Hindi (only the colloquial variety), Turkish, Malay and Indonesian, as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken. For example the Arabic word for book /kitāb/ is used in all the languages listed, apart from Malay and Indonesian (where it specifically means &quot;religious book&quot;). In addition, Spanish and Portuguese both have large numbers of Arabic loan words. Other languages such as Maltese and Kinubi derive from Arabic, rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammar rules.

The terms borrowed range from religious terminology (like Berber {{Unicode|''taẓallit''}} &quot;prayer&quot; &lt; salat), academic terms (like Uyghur ''mentiq'' &quot;logic&quot;), economic items (like English &quot;sugar&quot;) to placeholders (like Spanish ''fulano'' &quot;so-and-so&quot;) and everyday conjunctions (like Urdu ''lekin'' &quot;but&quot;.) Most Berber varieties (such as Kabyle), along with Swahili, borrow some numbers from Arabic. Most Islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from Arabic, such as ''salat'' 'prayer' and ''imam'' 'prayer leader'.  In languages not directly in contact with the Arab world, Arabic loanwords are often mediated by other languages rather than being transferred directly from Arabic; for example, most Arabic loanwords in Urdu entered through Persian, and many older Arabic loanwords in Hausa were borrowed from Kanuri.

Many words in English and other European languages are derived from Arabic, often through other European languages, especially Spanish and Italian. Among them are commonly-used words like &quot;sugar&quot; (''sukkar''), &quot;cotton&quot; (''{{unicode|quṭn}}'') and &quot;magazine&quot; (''maḫāzin''). English words more recognizably of Arabic origin include &quot;algebra&quot;, &quot;alcohol&quot;, &quot;alchemy&quot;, &quot;alkali&quot; and &quot;zenith.&quot; Some words in common use, such as &quot;intention&quot; and &quot;information&quot;, were originally calques of Arabic philosophical terms.

===Arabic and Islam===
Arabic is the language of the Qur'an. Traditionally, Muslims deem it impossible to translate the Qur'an in a way that would reflect its exact meaning in a different language. Some schools of thought maintain that it should not be translated at all. Arabic is often associated with Islam, but it is also spoken by Arab Christians, Arab Druze, Mizrahi Jews, and Iraqi Mandaeans. 

Most of the world's Muslims do not speak Arabic as their native language but can read the script and recite the words of religious texts.

===History===
Modern Arabic is considered to be part of the Arabo-Canaanite sub-branch of the central group of West Semitic languages. While Arabic is not the oldest of the Semitic languages, it shares many features with the common ancestor for all Semitic languages in the Afro-Asiatic group of languages: Proto-Semitic whose phonological, morphological, and syntactic features have been determined by linguists. Many linguists consider Arabic to be the most Semitic of any modern Semitic languages in terms of how completely it preserves the features of Proto-Semitic.

The earliest Proto-Arabic, or Ancient North Arabian, texts are the Hasaean inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, from the 8th century BC, written not in the modern Arabic alphabet, nor in its Nabataean ancestor, but in variants of the epigraphic South Arabian ''musnad''. These are followed by 6th-century BC Lihyanite texts from southeastern Saudi Arabia and the Thamudic texts found throughout Arabia and the Sinai, and not in reality connected with Thamud. Later come the Safaitic inscriptions beginning in the 1st century BC, and the many Arabic personal names attested in Nabataean inscriptions (which are, however, written in Aramaic). From about the 2nd century BC, a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw (near Sulayyil) reveal a dialect which is no longer considered &quot;Proto-Arabic&quot;, but Pre-Classical Arabic. 

By the fourth century AD, the Arab kingdoms of the Lakhmids in southern Iraq, the Ghassanids in southern Syria the Kindite Kingdom emerged in Central Arabia. Their courts were responsible for some notable examples of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, and for some of the few surviving pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions in the Arabic alphabet.

===Dialects and descendants===
[[Image:Arabic Language.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Areas where Arabic is the predominant language]]

&quot;Colloquial Arabic&quot; is a collective term for the spoken varieties of Arabic used throughout the Arab world, which, as mentioned, differ radically from the literary language. The main dialectal division is between the North African dialects and those of the Middle East, followed by that between sedentary dialects and the much more conservative Bedouin dialects. Speakers of some of these dialects are unable to converse with speakers of another dialect of Arabic; in particular, while Middle Easterners can generally understand one another, they often have trouble understanding North Africans (although the converse is not true, due to the popularity of Middle Eastern&amp;mdash;especially Egyptian&amp;mdash;films and other media).

One factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas, which have typically provided a significant number of new words, and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order; however, a much more significant factor for most dialects is, as among Romance languages, retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi ''aku'', Levantine ''fīh'', and North African ''kayən'' all mean &quot;there is&quot;, and all come from classical Arabic forms (''yakūn'', ''fīhi'', ''kā'in'' respectively), but now sound very different.

The major groups are:
* Egyptian Arabic مصري : Spoken by about 79 million people in Egypt and perhaps the most widely understood variety, due to the popularity of Egyptian-made films and TV shows
* Maghrebi Arabic مغربي (Algerian Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, Tunisian Arabic, Maltese and western Libyan Arabic) The Moroccan and Algerian dialects are each spoken by about 20 million people.
* Levantine Arabic شامي (Western Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, western Jordanian and Cypriot Maronite Arabic)
* Iraqi Arabic عراقي (and Khuzestani Arabic) - with significant differences between the more Arabian-like ''gilit''-dialects of the south and the more conservative ''qeltu''-dialects of the northern cities
* East Arabian Arabic بحريني (Eastern Saudi Arabia, Western Iraq, Eastern Syrian, Jordanian and parts of Oman)
* Gulf Arabic خليجي (Bahrain, Saudi Eastern Province, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Oman)
Other varieties include:
* {{unicode|Ḥassānīya}} حساني (in Mauritania, Mali and western Sahara)
* Sudanese Arabic سوداني (with a dialect continuum into Chad)
* Hijazi Arabic حجازي (western Saudi Arabia)
* Najdi Arabic نجدي (Najd region of central Saudi Arabia)
* Yemeni Arabic يمني (Yemen to southern Saudi Arabia)
* Andalusi Arabic أندلسي (Iberia until 17th century)
* Siculo Arabic صقلي (Sicily, South Italy until 14th century)
* Maltese مالطي, which is spoken on the Mediterranean island of Malta, is the only one to have established itself as a fully separate language, with independent literary norms. Apart from its phonology, Maltese bears considerable similarity to urban varieties of Tunisian Arabic, however in the course of history, the language has adopted numerous loanwords, phonetic and phonological features, and even some grammatical patterns, from Italian, Sicilian, and English. It is also the only Semitic tongue written in the Latin alphabet.

===Sounds===
{{IPA notice}}
The phonemes below reflect the pronunciation of Standard Arabic. There are minor variations from country to country.

====Vowels====
Arabic has three vowels, with long and short forms: ''ā'' {{IPA|[æː]}} (open /a/ as in English ''bad''), ''a'' {{IPA|[æ]}} (open /a/ as in English ''bat''), ''ī'' {{IPA|[iː]}} (/i/ as in English &quot;bead&quot;), ''i'' {{IPA|[i]}} (/i/ as in English &quot;beat&quot;), ''ū'' {{IPA|[uː]}} (/u/ as in English &quot;mood&quot;), ''u'' {{IPA|[u]}} (/u/ as in English &quot;moot&quot;). Depending on context, the short vowels may sound differently. There are also two diphthongs: ''ai'' (''ay'') {{IPA|[ɛ̈ɪ]}}, ''au'' (''aw'') {{IPA|[ɛ̈ʊ]}}. Allophonically, after ''r'' and velarized consonants (see following), the vowel ''a'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, ''ā'' as {{IPA|[ɑː]}}, ''ai'' as {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}} and ''au'' as {{IPA|[ɑʊ]}}.

See [[Arabic alphabet]] for explanations on the IPA phonetic symbols found in this chart.

# {{IPA|[dʒ]}} is pronounced as {{IPA|[ɡ]}} by some speakers. This is especially characteristic of the Egyptian and southern Yemeni dialects. In many parts of North Africa and in the [[Levant]], it is pronounced as {{IPA|[ʒ]}}.
# {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[lˁ]}} only in {{IPA|/ʔalːaːh/}}, the name of God, i.e. Allah, when the word follows ''a'', ''ā'', ''u'' or ''ū'' (after ''i'' or ''ī'' it is unvelarised: ''bismi l-lāh'' {{IPA|/bismilːaːh/}}).
# {{IPA|/ʕ/}} is usually a phonetic approximant.
# In many varieties, {{IPA|/ħ, ʕ/}} are actually epiglottal {{IPA|[ʜ, ʢ]}} (despite what is reported in many earlier works). 
# {{IPA|/x/}} is considered to be an uvular sound ({{IPA|/χ/}}) by some linguists{{Fact|date=May 2007}}.

Arabic has consonants traditionally termed &quot;emphatic&quot; {{IPA|/tˁ, dˁ, sˁ, ðˁ/}} are both velarized {{IPA|[tˠ, dˠ, sˠ, ðˠ]}} and pharyngealised {{IPA|[tˁ, dˁ, sˁ, ðˁ]}}. This simultaneous velarization and pharyngealization is deemed &quot;Retracted Tongue Root&quot; by phonologists.&lt;ref&gt;Thelwall, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In some transcription systems, emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter e.g. {{IPA|/dˁ/}} is written ‹D›; in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it e.g. ‹{{unicode|ḍ}}›.

Vowels and consonants can be (phonologically) short or long. Long (geminate) consonants are normally written doubled in Latin transcription (i.e. bb, dd, etc.), reflecting the presence of the Arabic diacritic mark shaddah, which marks lengthened consonants. Such consonants are held twice as long as short consonants. This consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive: e.g. ''qabala'' &quot;he accepted&quot; and ''qabbala'' &quot;he kissed&quot;.

====Syllable structure====
Arabic has two kinds of syllables: open syllables (CV) and (CVV) - and closed syllables (CVC), (CVVC) and (CVCC). Every syllable begins with a consonant - or else a consonant is borrowed from a previous word through elision – especially in the case of the definite article ''the'', ''[[al-]]'' (used when starting an utterance) or ''_l'' (when following a word), e.g. ''baytu –l mudiir'' “house (of) the director”, which becomes ''bay-tul-mu-diir'' when divided syllabically. By itself, &quot;the director&quot; would be pronounced {{IPA|/al mudiːr/}}.

====Stress====
Although word stress is not phonemically contrastive in Standard Arabic, it does bear a strong relationship to vowel length, though phonemic, and syllable shape, and correct word stress aids intelligibility.  The basic rules are:

*Only the last three syllables may be stressed.
*Given this restriction, the last &quot;Superheavy&quot; syllable (containing a long vowel or followed by two consonants for example) is stressed.
*If there is no such syllable, the pre-final syllable is stressed if 'Heavy'. Otherwise, the first allowable syllable is stressed.
*In Standard Arabic, a final long vowel may not be stressed. (This restriction does not apply to the spoken dialects, where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen.)

For example: ''ki-TAAB'' &quot;book&quot;, ''KAA-tib'' &quot;writer&quot;, ''MAK-tab'' &quot;desk&quot;, ''ma-KAA-tib'' &quot;desks&quot;, ''MAK-ta-ba'' &quot;library&quot;, ''KA-ta-buu'' (MSA) &quot;they wrote&quot; = ''KA-ta-bu'' (dialect), ''ka-ta-BUU-hu'' (MSA) &quot;they wrote it&quot; = ''ka-ta-BUU'' (dialect), ''ka-TA-ba-taa'' (MSA) &quot;they (dual, fem) wrote&quot;, ''ka-TAB-tu'' (MSA) &quot;I wrote&quot; = ''ka-TABT'' (dialect).  Doubled consonants count as two consonants: ''ma-JAL-la'' &quot;magazine&quot;, ''ma-HALL'' &quot;palace&quot;.

Some dialects have different stress rules.  In the Cairo (Egyptian Arabic) dialect, for example, a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word, hence ''mad-RA-sa'' &quot;school&quot;, ''qaa-HI-ra'' &quot;Cairo&quot;.  In the Arabic of Sana, stress is often retracted: ''BAY-tayn'' &quot;two houses&quot;, ''MAA-sat-hum'' &quot;their table&quot;, ''ma-KAA-tiib'' &quot;desks&quot;, ''ZAA-rat-hiin'' &quot;sometimes&quot;, ''mad-RA-sat-hum'' &quot;their school&quot;. (In this dialect, only syllables with long vowels or diphthongs are considered heavy; in a two-syllable word, the final syllable can be stressed only if the preceding syllable is light; and in longer words, the final syllable cannot be stressed.)

====Dialectal variations====
In some dialects, there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above. For example, non-Arabic {{IPA|[v]}} is used in the Maghrebi dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names. Semitic {{IPA|[p]}} became {{IPA|[f]}} extremely early on in Arabic before it was written down; a few modern Arabic dialects, such as Iraqi (influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[w:Turkish Language|Turkish]]) distinguish between {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}}. 

Interdental fricatives ({{IPA|[θ]}} and {{IPA|[ð]}}) are rendered as stops {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} in some dialects (such as Levantine, Egyptian, and much of the Maghreb); some of these dialects render them as {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language. Early in the expansion of Arabic, the separate emphatic phonemes {{IPA|[dˁ]}} and {{IPA|[ðˁ]}} coalesced into a single phoneme, becoming one or the other. Predictably, dialects without inter-dental fricatives use {{IPA|[dˁ]}} exclusively, while those with such fricatives use {{IPA|[ðˁ]}}. Again, in &quot;learned&quot; words from the Standard language, {{IPA|[ðˁ]}} is rendered as {{IPA|[zˁ]}} (in the Middle East) or {{IPA|[dˁ]}} (in North Africa) in dialects without inter-dental fricatives. 

Another key distinguishing mark of Arabic dialects is how they render the original velar and uvular stops {{IPA|/q/}}, {{IPA|/ʤ/}} (Proto-Semitic /g/), and {{IPA|/k/}}:

*/q/ retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as Yemen, Morocco, and urban areas of the Maghreb. But it is rendered as a voiced velar stop {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in Gulf Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, Upper Egypt, much of the Maghreb, and less urban parts of the Levant (e.g. Jordan); as a voiced uvular constrictive {{IPA|[ʁ]}} in Sudanese Arabic; and as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in several prestige dialects, such as those spoken in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus.  Some traditionally Christian villages in rural areas of the Levant render the sound as {{IPA|[k]}}, as do Shia Bahrainis.  In some Gulf dialects, it is palatalized to {{IPA|[ʤ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}.  Many dialects with a modified pronunciation for /q/ maintain the /q/ pronunciation in certain words (often with religious or educational overtones) borrowed from the Classical language.

*{{IPA|/ʤ/}} retains its pronunciation in Iraq and much of the Arabian Peninsula, but is pronounced /g/ in Cairo and parts of Yemen, {{IPA|/ʒ/}} in Morocco and the Levant, and /j/ in some words in much of Gulf Arabic.

*{{IPA|/k/}} usually retains its original pronunciation, but is palatalized to {{IPA|/ʧ/}} in many words in Palestine, Iraq and much of the Arabian Peninsula.  Often a distinction is made between the suffixes /-ak/ (you, masc.) and /-ik/ (you, fem.), which become {{IPA|/-ak/}} and {{IPA|/-iʧ/}}, respectively.  In Sana Arabic, /-ik/ is pronounced {{IPA|/-iʃ/}}.

===Grammar===
Nouns in Literary Arabic have three grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive [also used when the noun is governed by a preposition]); three numbers (singular, dual and plural); two genders (masculine and feminine); and three &quot;states&quot; (indefinite, definite, and construct). The cases of singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) are indicated by suffixed short vowels (/-u/ for nominative, /-a/ for accusative, /-i/ for genitive). The feminine singular is often marked by /-at/, which is reduced to /-ah/ or /-a/ before a pause. Plural is indicated either through endings (the sound plural) or internal modification (the broken plural). Definite nouns include all proper nouns, all nouns in &quot;construct state&quot; and all nouns which are prefixed by the definite article /al-/. Indefinite singular nouns (other than those that end in long ā) add a final /-n/ to the case-marking vowels, giving /-un/, /-an/ or /-in/ (which is also referred to as nunation or tanwīn).

Verbs in Literary Arabic are marked for person (first, second, or third), gender, and number. They are conjugated in two major paradigms (termed perfective and imperfective, or past and non-past); two voices (active and passive); and five moods in the imperfective (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, jussive and energetic). There are also two participles (active and passive) and a verbal noun, but no infinitive. As indicated by the differing terms for the two tense systems, there is some disagreement over whether the distinction between the two systems should be most accurately characterized as tense, aspect or a combination of the two. The perfective aspect is constructed using fused suffixes that combine person, number and gender in a single morpheme, while the imperfective aspect is constructed using a combination of prefixes (primarily encoding person) and suffixes (primarily encoding gender and number). The moods other than imperative are primarily marked by suffixes (/u/ for indicative, /a/ for subjunctive, no ending for jussive, /an/ for energetic). The imperative has the endings of the jussive but lacks any prefixes. The passive is marked through internal vowel changes. Plural forms for the verb are only used when the subject is not mentioned, or is preceding it, and the feminine singular is used for all non-human plurals.

Adjectives in Literary Arabic are marked for case, number, gender and state, as for nouns. However, the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective, which takes the /-ah/ or /-at/ suffix.

Pronouns in Literary Arabic are marked for person, number and gender. There are two varieties, independent pronouns and enclitics. Enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb, noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns. The first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs (/-ni/) and for nouns or prepositions (/-ī/ after consonants, /-ya/ after vowels).

Nouns, verbs, pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects. However, non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular. Furthermore, a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun. Numerals between three and ten show &quot;chiasmic&quot; agreement, in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice-versa.

The spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual (it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances). They have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative, but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes (most often /bi-/ for indicative vs. unmarked subjunctive). They have also mostly lost the indefinite &quot;nunation&quot; and the internal passive. Modern Standard Arabic maintains the grammatical distinctions of Literary Arabic except that the energetic mood is almost never used; in addition, Modern Standard Arabic sometimes drop the final short vowels that indicate case and mood.

As in many other Semitic languages, Arabic verb formation is based on a (usually) triconsonantal root, which is not a word in itself but contains the semantic core. The consonants '''{{ArabDIN|k-t-b}}''', for example, indicate 'write', '''{{ArabDIN|q-r-ʾ}}''' indicate 'read', '''{{ArabDIN|ʾ-k-l}}''' indicate 'eat', etc.  Words are formed by supplying the root with a vowel structure and with affixes. (Traditionally, Arabic grammarians have used the root '''{{ArabDIN|f-ʿ-l}}''' 'do' as a template to discuss word formation.) From any particular root, up to fifteen different verbs can be formed, each with its own template; these are referred to by Western scholars as &quot;form I&quot;, &quot;form II&quot;, ... up through &quot;form XV&quot;.  These forms, and their associated participles and verbal nouns, are the primary means of forming vocabulary in Arabic. Forms XI to XV are extremely rare.

===Writing system===
The Arabic alphabet derives from the Aramaic script (through Syriac and then Nabatean), to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of Coptic or Cyrillic script to Greek script. Traditionally, there were several differences between the Western (North African) and Middle Eastern version of the alphabet—in particular, the fa and qaf had a dot underneath and a single dot above respectively in the Maghreb, and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals). However, the old Maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the Maghreb itself, and remains in use mainly in the Quranic schools (zaouias) of West Africa. Arabic, like all other Semitic languages (except for the Latin-written Maltese, and the languages with the Ge'ez script), is written from right to left. There are several styles of script, notably Naskh which is used in print and by computers, and Ruq'ah which is commonly used in handwriting

====Calligraphy====
After the definitive fixing of the Arabic script around 786, by Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi, many styles were developed, both for the writing down of the Qur'an and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.

Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the Western world, and is still considered by Arabs as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem. Being cursive by nature, unlike the Latin alphabet, Arabic script is used to write down a verse of the Qur'an, a Hadith, or simply a proverb, in a spectacular composition. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. Two of the current masters of the genre are Hassan Massoudy and [http://arabworld.nitle.org/gallery.php?module_id=7 Khaled Al Saa’i].

====Transliteration====
There are a number of different standards of Arabic transliteration: methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the Latin alphabet. There are multiple conflicting motivations for transliteration. Scholarly systems are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of Arabic, generally supplying making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the Arabic alphabet. These systems are heavily reliant on diacritical marks such as &quot;š&quot; for sound equivalently written sh in English. In some cases, the sh or kh sounds can be represented by italicizing or underlining them -- that way, they can be distinguished from separate s and h sounds or k and h sounds, respectively. (Compare gashouse to gash.) At first sight, this may be difficult to recognize. Less scientific systems often use digraphs (like sh and kh), which are usually more simple to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems. Such systems may be intended to help readers who are neither Arabic speakers nor linguists to intuitively pronounce Arabic names and phrases. An example of such a system is the Bahá'í orthography. A third type of transliteration seeks to represent an equivalent of the Arabic spelling with Latin letters, for use by Arabic speakers when Arabic writing is not available (for example, when using an ASCII communication device). An example is the system used by the US military, Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System or SATTS, which represents each Arabic letter with a unique symbol in the ASCII range to provide a one-to-one mapping from Arabic to ASCII and back. This system, while facilitating typing on English keyboards, presents its own ambiguities and disadvantages. During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the Arab world, such as personal computers, the World Wide Web, email, Bulletin board systems, IRC, instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the Latin alphabet only, and some of them still do not have the Arabic alphabet as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script, sometime known as IM Arabic.

To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral &quot;3&quot; may be used to represent the Arabic letter &quot;ع&quot;, ''ayn''. There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it Arabic Chat Alphabet. Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the &quot;emphatic&quot; counterparts of certain consonants. For instance, using capitalization, the letter &quot;د&quot;, or ''daal'', may be represented by '''d'''. Its emphatic counterpart, &quot;ض&quot;, may be written as '''D'''.

===Language-standards regulators===
Academy of the Arabic Language is the name of a number of language-regulation bodies formed in Arab countries. The most active are in Damascus and Cairo. They review language development, monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries. They also publish old and historical Arabic manuscripts.

===Studying Arabic===
Arabic language interests millions of non-Arabic speakers to learn it to different levels, mainly because it is the language of their holy book, the Quran, and all Islamic terms are Arabic. Arabic has been taught in many elementary and secondary schools especially in Muslim schools worldwide. Many universities in the world today have classes for studying Arabic as a Foreign Language, as part of their foreign languages, Middle Eastern studies, religious studies, area studies departments, and even standalone Arabic language departments. Many Arabic language schools exist today to assist in gaining Arabic language skills outside academic education. Most of the Arabic language schools are located in the Arab world and some Muslim world countries. Software and books with tapes are also important part of Arabic learning, as many of Arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or Arabic language school classes available. Radio series of Arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stations. A number of websites on the Internet provide online classes for all levels as a distance education means.

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

It would be great to see this book take off. Unfortunately I don't know enough about the subject to really contribute. On-line resources seem to be scarce as well. I found this snippet when looking through the history, it's not much but at least it contains some info on grammar. Perhaps it could be molded into something for a lesson 2?

==Grammar/sentence structure==
===Statements===
#&quot;......者......也&quot; or permutations of such:
#:&quot;...... ......也&quot; eg. 夫战勇气也 (《曹刿论战》)
#:&quot;......者......&quot; or
#:&quot;...... ......者也&quot; eg. 城北徐公齐国之美丽者也 (《邹忌讽齐王》)
#:This is the archetypal Classical Chinese sentence.
#&quot;......x......&quot; where x is any one of 乃、则、即、为、诚、非、是 etc:
#:use of 是 became increasingly common after the Han Dynasty
#Nothing. eg. 刘备天下枭雄 (by 鲁肃)

It's not so hard to find sources of classical Chinese texts on-line, but I haven't seen many grammatical explanations. Links are welcome. 
[[User:Arne Brasseur|Arne Brasseur]] ([[User talk:Arne Brasseur|talk]]) 15:31, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

==== Doubts ====
In &quot;......者......也&quot;, 者 is actually either a marker of nominalisation or a or a particle to emphasise what comes before it.

As far as I understand, in usual sentences it is not required to use 者 unless before it a verbal phrase comes or unless it's necessary to underline the subject (sometimes not a subject at all, as in 今者).

&quot;......者......&quot; -- are there really many of these? I guess it's not a nominal sentence (A is B), but a sentence where B is used in the function of verb 'to behave like ...'. Am I mistaken?

Hello Rudolf0100.  I've just been looking through what you have got in your book so far, and I am not sure whether it is appropriate content for wikibooks.  Wikibooks is a place for textbooks, see [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks]] for more details.  Your book appears to be a fictional fairy tale / original work and, as such, not appropriate content.  If you feel that you book does belong here then perhaps you need a explanation of why on [[Talk:Tree of the Truth|the discussion page]] to explain what the book is about.  Thanks --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 20:08, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello!

Where to put the text when it is not suitable for wikibooks?

Wikisource?

Why in HUMANITIES/RELIGION there is a book called UTOPIA?

Compared to this, I thought Wikibooks is the right place!?

Thanks for your feedback!

Rudolf

:Utopia appears to be a book about Utopianism (a topic which I am familiar with) and the book appears to be the start of a text book about the subject.  Tree of Truth is not a subject I have come across and I didn't feel that the introduction made it clear that it was a textbook about an existing subject, but instead felt more like it was original work.  Wikiversity might be a more appropriate place if this is original work.  If you could give a brief expanation of what the book is, it might help to work out if it belongs here.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 21:48, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello!
I am definitely not the right person to discuss the strategy of the content of wiki books. My feeling was that UTOPIA is also a new text. If you advice to move the &quot;Tree of the Truth&quot; to Wiki source - it's fine with me. Pls. advice me finally.

I just check some chapters in Wikisource...
&lt;u&gt;Adding value to source texts&lt;/u&gt;
Although Wikisource is not a place for editors to contribute new and original works, there are several ways to make original contributions by adding value to existing publications. Entirely new compositions written by contributors are not appropriate here, though they may have a place at other Wikimedia projects such as Wikibooks.

My target is to collect a many as possible translations of the base story and to motivate other wikians to contribute continuing stories. The main goal shall be clear: by gaining respect of each others religious behaviour there should be no reason for fundamentelism. This is a new text, not published so far. 


Thanks.
Rudolf 07th January 2008

== Re:[[Tree of the Truth]] ==

Hello Rudolf0100, how are you? I got your message, and I think that I can answer some questions for you.  
#To properly categorize a book by subject, you can use the {{tlx|subject}} template. I'll do this for your book, and you can view the code to see how i did it for future reference. 
#Generally, setting up a book as one large page is not a good idea. Splitting a book up into many pages makes it easer to download, navigate, and edit. However, you can use a &quot;print version&quot; to display the whole book as a single page as well. 
#I can find [[Tree of the Truth]] by search. When you search, it's sensitive to spelling and capitalization. Make sure you type it in exactly the way it is supposed to be, and it should show up. 
#Again, make sure you type in the name correctly before pressing &quot;'''Go'''&quot;. 
I hope these answer your questions. I suggest, if you still feel lost, that you check out the book [[Using Wikibooks]]. That book is designed to answer a lot of common questions from new users. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:28, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello Whiteknight,
thanks for your help!

#Subject - thanks that you added the subject. But how can I find the book in the HUMANITIES/Religion section when I don't know that there is this book. e.g. I found the book UTOPIA as I saw it there. How can I make the &quot;Tree of the Truth&quot; visible? 
#I'll try to find out the format/code how to breack down in many pages. If you may send me a referenc to a book in which it is made ideally, pls. do not hesitate and send to me. 
#thanks it works, I failed in capitalizing ...Truth/truth.
#finally, I have to find out, if this new book is at the right wiki - as I got some feedback from user AdRiley, that it might be not...

Thanks, 
Rudolf

:Your book is currently visible at [[Subject:Religion]] and at [[Subject:Humanities]]. Since it's the newest book, it's at the top of the list. As to breaking a book down into pages, you can see an example of a book that I've created recently at [[x86 Disassembly]]. Another example that I helped another person do is [[WHSGUCDA]]. You can also look for ideas amongst the [[WB:FB|featured books]]. I'll look over your book to ensure that it is in the proper place. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:33, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for your hints. I'll care for the reformating using referenced pages when it is clear, that the &quot;Tree of the Truth&quot; will stay in Wikibooks.
Do you have an idea, how to achieve the right adjustment of the FARSI text?

Rudolf

:I tried a solution with some CSS formatting. Let me know if this is correct. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:01, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello, 
This looks very okay now, I am requesting a final check from the translator as well. But looks definitely nicer now.

==Move to Wikijunior namespace==

Hello Rudolf.  After talking with Whiteknight, I have moved your book into the Wikijunior namespace [[Wikijunior:Tree of the Truth| here]].  Wikijunior is part of wikibooks for books aimed at children and I think your book sits more suitable there.  I hope that is ok with you?  Please don't take my comments as a critisism of your book in any way.  Quite the opposite in fact, I think it looks a very interesting project and as such I wanted to make sure that it was in the right place from the start.  I will be watching it develop with interest.  Out of curiosity how are you doing all of the transaltions?  Do you speak all of those languages yourself?  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:56, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello AdRiley!

First of all - no problem to find my book in Wikijunior. You have the overview better then me and you know the concept better then me.

To your question if I speek all these languages: no unfortunately not. But I have a nice international network which is helping me. I got commitments for more than 20 translations but I stopped waiting after I got 10+. I hope the others will come too. 

But never the less, there are my additional questions:

# If I check via BROWSE/Books by title/T - &quot;I do not get Tree of the Truth&quot; listed - What I have to add that it is listed there as well?
# Is it also somehow possible to get the book linked via HUMANITIES/RELIGION/'other books' or 'see also'?
# What chance has a junior to find the book by accident?
# Might it be reasonable to set up in Wikijuniour a bookshelf for bedtime stories?

Thanks for your feedback!

Rudolf

:Hello Rudolf.  I like what you have done with the layout. Answers to your questions below:

# You have to add the tag &lt;nowiki&gt;{{alphabetical|T}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the front page.  I have done this for your book so it should appear under by title/T.
# Yes.  Be Bold! Just edit the page where you think the link should appear and add it yourself.
# Hmmm, a bit of a tricky one that.  To be honest I am not sure, I guess they would have to be browsing the wikijunior pages and see it there.  I think there migh be some statistics on number of page hits somewhere which might be of interest to you.
# I think this would need some more discussion with the community.  I will see what Whiteknight thinks as he has more experience around here than me.

Let me know if I can help you with anything else. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 21:42, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello Ad!
thanks for your help, probably, I am too shy as I did not think that it's allowed to change the registries as well - no I did! (point 2 above!)!
Now the book is complete for the first run. I informed about my community and supporters. 
Yes, definitely the statistics on hits would be of interest. How to get those?

I am very exited, how it goes on. 

Greetings, --[[User:Rudolf0100|Rudolf]] ([[User talk:Rudolf0100|talk]]) 07:24, 10 January 2008 (UTC)





== PDF version ==

There's no need to have a wiki page to hold a PDF version. There is a template you can put on the front page/TOC of the book that links to the file; that's all that's needed. If you have questions, feel free to ask me. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:24, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

Hi Mike!
May I kindly ask you to lead me to an example book or copy below what I have to do!?

Currently I have copied some text from an other book on the front page - but this is not enough I assume...
Pls. advise! Thanks a lot!

Hi Mike!
I feel somehow lost! I tried to figure out how to set up a printable version and a PDF, but I failed so far in some details. I checked the hints in '''Wikibooks:Print versions''' and I set up the print version by copying some comparable printing version pages. May I kindly ask you to check the page ''Tree of the Truth/Print version'' and see what is missing. Why is the text of my pages not populated? As well I uploaded a PDF file named ''Tree of the truth.pdf'', but how it is to be linked to '''{{tl|PDF version}}'''?
Thanks for help.
--[[User:Rudolf0100|Rudolf]] ([[User talk:Rudolf0100|talk]]) 16:42, 30 January 2008 (UTC)
:I fixed the transclusions at [[Wikijunior:Tree of the Truth/Print version]]; everything looks in order now. The template allows you to specify the filename to link to. You'll want it {{tlx|PDF version|Tree of the Truth}}.

Hi Mike!
'''Thanks for your help.''' With your hints, I fixed as well the remaining structuring issues and now the print version is okay from the content point of view. There is one formating issue left: '''How to print a CRLF - pagebreack?''' Where is it possible to find a summary of formating options/parameters?

As well I succeeded in linking the PDF file. 
BUT, there is still an error message telling a time-out problem when loading the PDF.

&lt;pre&gt;
RTL to RTL Peephole Optimizers
------------------------------

   The `define_peephole2' definition tells the compiler how to
substitute one sequence of instructions for another sequence, what
additional scratch registers may be needed and what their lifetimes
must be.

     (define_peephole2
       [INSN-PATTERN-1
        INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       &quot;CONDITION&quot;
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       &quot;PREPARATION-STATEMENTS&quot;)

   The definition is almost identical to `define_split' (Note: Insn
Splitting) except that the pattern to match is not a single
instruction, but a sequence of instructions.

   It is possible to request additional scratch registers for use in the
output template.  If appropriate registers are not free, the pattern
will simply not match.

   Scratch registers are requested with a `match_scratch' pattern at
the top level of the input pattern.  The allocated register (initially)
will be dead at the point requested within the original sequence.  If
the scratch is used at more than a single point, a `match_dup' pattern
at the top level of the input pattern marks the last position in the
input sequence at which the register must be available.

   Here is an example from the IA-32 machine description:

     (define_peephole2
       [(match_scratch:SI 2 &quot;r&quot;)
        (parallel [(set (match_operand:SI 0 &quot;register_operand&quot; &quot;&quot;)
                        (match_operator:SI 3 &quot;arith_or_logical_operator&quot;
                          [(match_dup 0)
                           (match_operand:SI 1 &quot;memory_operand&quot; &quot;&quot;)]))
                   (clobber (reg:CC 17))])]
       &quot;! optimize_size &amp;&amp; ! TARGET_READ_MODIFY&quot;
       [(set (match_dup 2) (match_dup 1))
        (parallel [(set (match_dup 0)
                        (match_op_dup 3 [(match_dup 0) (match_dup 2)]))
                   (clobber (reg:CC 17))])]
       &quot;&quot;)

This pattern tries to split a load from its use in the hopes that we'll
be able to schedule around the memory load latency.  It allocates a
single `SImode' register of class `GENERAL_REGS' (`&quot;r&quot;') that needs to
be live only at the point just before the arithmetic.

   A real example requiring extended scratch lifetimes is harder to
come by, so here's a silly made-up example:

     (define_peephole2
       [(match_scratch:SI 4 &quot;r&quot;)
        (set (match_operand:SI 0 &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;) (match_operand:SI 1 &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;))
        (set (match_operand:SI 2 &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;) (match_dup 1))
        (match_dup 4)
        (set (match_operand:SI 3 &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;) (match_dup 1))]
       &quot;/* determine 1 does not overlap 0 and 2 */&quot;
       [(set (match_dup 4) (match_dup 1))
        (set (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4))
        (set (match_dup 2) (match_dup 4))]
        (set (match_dup 3) (match_dup 4))]
       &quot;&quot;)

If we had not added the `(match_dup 4)' in the middle of the input
sequence, it might have been the case that the register we chose at the
beginning of the sequence is killed by the first or second `set'.
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Page Structure ==
I find the separation of &quot;Declaring access types&quot; and &quot;Using access types&quot; unfortunate. I think explaining in 8 subchapters how to define access types and only then in the next chapter explain how to create objects and how to dereference does not make understanding easy.

But before incorporating chapter 2 in chapter 1, I want to know what others think about this.

2010-01-08 CKWG

== .all not explained ==
The page uses .all and has a discussion of its advantages and disadvantages, but nowhere says what it actually means or does. For a &quot;tutorial&quot; stle wikibook page it would be helpful to explain .all or link to an explanation. (I'm a newbie, so I can't do it myself. I came here looking to solve a problem, and .all would have been the answer, but the explanation wasn't here).

== access all vs. access ==
Reordered access all vs. access. See Randy Brukardt in CLA:

&gt; &gt; type Class_Access is access all Class'Class;

&gt; Do you need that &quot;all&quot;? Because because the &quot;all&quot; does not come for free -
&gt; there are some penalties.

Say what? The only penalty in using &quot;all&quot; is that a few very dubious
constructs are illegal (they're legal for pool-specific types in order to
maintain Ada 83 compatibility. Indeed, for Janus/Ada, it actually makes the
code better (because we generate code that checks that pool-specific access
values belong to their pool when they are dereferenced; for obvious reasons
we can't do that for &quot;all&quot; or for user-defined pools).

It also makes your code better as it allows you to avoid using allocators at
all.

Of course the very best solution is to avoid the access type altogether,
which you may be able to do by using one of the containers libraries.

&gt; Read:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming/Types/access#Access_vs._...

The claim that additional checks may be needed on the deference of an
&quot;access all&quot; is completely bogus; Janus/Ada always does *less* run-time
checking for &quot;access all&quot; than &quot;access&quot;. While it's probably true that for
most compilers that it is the same, I can't think of any reason that it
would be more -- at least not on typical machines. (There might be
additional checks required because of the designated type, but those would
be the same for access and access all.) One could imagine a super-safe Ada
system that did extra checks to prevent problems with
Unchecked_Deallocation, but that would not have any cost for dereferencing.

The argument about safety is certainly true, but it may be misleading:
Unchecked_Deallocation is always dangerous if misused. It is just as easy to
deallocate a pool-specific object twice, and just as dangerous as
deallocating a stack object. The advantage of &quot;access all&quot; is that you may
not need to use Unchecked_Deallocation at all.

Moral: if you have (or may have) a valid reason to store an 'Access or
'Unchecked_Access into an access type, then use &quot;access all&quot; and don't worry
about it. If not, the mantra of &quot;least privilege&quot; suggests that the &quot;all&quot;
should be left out (don't enable capabilities that you are not going to
use), but it is hardly the level of concern that it should cause someone to
complain about it's use in an example program.

OTOH, the advice about avoiding access altogether for parameters, and
especially anonymous access, is spot-on.

::Randy.

== &quot;may not&quot; ==

Under http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming/Types/access#Pool_access the following sentence is found: &quot;It may not point to a stack or library level (static) object or an object in a different storage pool.&quot;

How should someone interpret &quot;may not&quot;? Given that context, is it the same like &quot;must not&quot;?

:It should say &quot;cannot&quot; since these access types can only point to objects reserved from their corresponding storage pool. This is a constraint imposed by the language on these types. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 22:05, 1 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Stress==

Stress is a measure of the internal force an object is experiencing per unit cross sectional area. Hence, the formula for calculating stress is the same as the formula for calculating pressure:  

&lt;math&gt; \sigma = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where σ is stress (in Newtons per square metre or, equivalently, Pascals). F is force (in Newtons, commonly abbreviated N), and A is the cross sectional area of the sample.

===Tensile Strength===

The (ultimate) tensile strength is the level of stress at which a material will fracture. Tensile strength is also known as fracture stress. If a material fractures by 'crack propagation' (i.e., it shatters), the material is brittle.

===Yield Stress===
On a stress strain graph beyond the yield point(or elastic limit)the material will no longer return to its original length. This means it has become permanently deformed.
Therefore the yield stress is the level of stress at which a material will deform permanently. This is also known as yield strength.

with mathematical form ax+by=c

==Strain==

Stresses cause strain. Putting pressure on an object causes it to stretch. Strain is a measure of how much an object is being stretched. The formula for strain is:

&lt;math&gt;\ \epsilon = \frac{\Delta l}{l_0} = \frac{l - l_0}{l_0} = \frac{l}{l_0} - 1&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt; is the original length of a bar being stretched, and l is its length after it has been stretched. Δl is the extension of the bar, the difference between these two lengths.

==Young's Modulus==

Young's Modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a material. It states how much a material will stretch (i.e., how much strain it will undergo) as a result of a given amount of stress. The formula for calculating it is:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

The values for stress and strain must be taken at as low a stress level as possible, provided a difference in the length of the sample can be measured. Strain is unitless so Young's Modulus has the same units as stress, i.e. N/m² or Pa.

==Stress-Strain Graphs==

[[Image:Stress v strain A36 2.png|thumb|right|300px|Stress–strain curve for low-carbon steel. ]]

Stress (σ) can be graphed against strain (ε). The toughness of a material (i.e., how much it resists stress, in J m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) is equal to the area under the curve, between the y-axis and the fracture point. Graphs such as the one on the right show how stress affects a material. This image shows the stress-strain graph for low-carbon steel. It has three main features:

===Elastic Region===

In this region (between the origin and point 2), the ratio of stress to strain (Young's modulus) is constant, meaning that the material is obeying Hooke's law, which states that a material is elastic (it will return to its original shape) if force is directly proportional to extension of the material

===Hooke's Law===

Hooke's law of elasticity is an approximation that states that the Force (load) is in direct proportion with the extension of a material as long as this load does not exceed the elastic limit. Materials for which Hooke's law is a useful approximation are known as linear-elastic

:&lt;math&gt;F = -kx\,&lt;/math&gt;

The relation is often denoted

:&lt;math&gt;F \propto x&lt;/math&gt;

The work done to stretch a wire or the Elastic Potential Energy is equal to the area of the triangle on a Tension/Extension graph, but can also be expressed as 

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}kx^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Plastic Region===

In this region (between points 2 and 3), the rate at which extension is increasing is going up, and the material has passed the elastic limit. It will no longer return to its original shape. After point 1, the amount of stress decreases due to 'necking', so the cross-sectional area is going down. The material will 'give' and extend more under less force.

===Fracture Point===

At point 3, the material has been fractured.

===Other Typical Graphs===

In a brittle material, such as glass or ceramics, the stress-strain graph will have an extremely short elastic region, and then will fracture. There is no plastic region on the stress-strain graph of a brittle material.

==Questions==

# 10N of force are exerted on a wire with cross-sectional area 0.5mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. How much stress is being exerted on the wire?
# Another wire has a tensile strength of 70MPa, and breaks under 100N of force. What is the cross-sectional area of the wire just before breaking?
# What is the strain on a Twix bar (original length 10cm) if it is now 12cm long?
# What is this strain, expressed as a percentage?
# 50N are applied to a wire with a radius of 1mm. The wire was 0.7m long, but is now 0.75m long. What is the Young's Modulus for the material the wire is made of?
# Glass, a brittle material, fractures at a strain of 0.004 and a stress of 240 MPa. Sketch the stress-strain graph for glass.
# (Extra nasty question which you won't ever get in an exam) What is the toughness of glass?
# Wire has a tensile strength of 0.95Mpa, and breaks under 25N of force. what is the cross-sectional area of the wire before and after breaking?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. 10N of force are exerted on a wire with cross-sectional area 0.5mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. How much stress is being exerted on the wire?'''

0.5mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 x (10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{10N}{0.5 \times 10^{-6} m^{2}} = 20 \ 000 \ 000 \mbox{ Pa} = 20\mbox{ MPa}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. Another wire has a tensile strength of 70MPa, and breaks under 100N of force. What is the cross-sectional area of the wire just before breaking?'''

&lt;math&gt;70 \times 10^6 = \frac{100}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{100}{70 \times 10^6} \approx 1.43 \times 10^{-6}\mbox{ m}^2 = 1.43\mbox{ } \mu \mbox{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. What is the strain on a Twix bar (original length 10cm) if it is now 12cm long?'''

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{12 - 10}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. What is this strain, expressed as a percentage?'''

0.2 x 100 = 20%

'''5. 50N are applied to a wire with a radius of 1mm. The wire was 0.7m long, but is now 0.75m long. What is the Young's Modulus for the material the wire is made of?'''

&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{(\frac{50}{\pi \times (1 \times 10^-3)^2})}{(\frac{0.75 - 0.7}{0.7})} \approx \frac{16000000}{0.0714} \approx 224000000\mbox{ Pa} = 224\mbox{ MPa}&lt;/math&gt;

'''6. Glass, a brittle material, fractures at a strain of 0.004 and a stress of 240 MPa. Sketch the stress-strain graph for glass.'''

[[Image:Stress-strain_glass.svg]]

'''7. (Extra nasty question which you won't ever get in an exam) What is the toughness of glass?'''

Toughness equals the area under the above graph. Since glass is brittle, we can assume that the gradient of the graph is constant, and, since the graph passes through the origin, it is a triangle. So:

&lt;math&gt;A_{triangle} = \frac{\mbox{base } \times \mbox{ height}}{2} = \mbox{ Toughness } = \frac{\mbox{strain } \times \mbox{ stress}}{2} = \frac{0.004 \times 240 \times 10^6}{2} = 480000 \mbox{ Jm}^{-3} = 480 \mbox{ kJm}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Metal_ions_sea.svg|right|thumb|200px|Metals are constructed from positive ions in a sea of electrons. This explains many of their properties.]]

There are several physical properties of metals you need to know about:

===Electrical Conductivity===

Metals consist of positive metal ions in a 'soup' or 'sea' of free (delocalized) electrons. This means that the electrons are free to move through the metal, conducting an electric current.

===Stiffness===

The electrostatic forces of attraction between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged ions holds the ions together, making metals stiff.

===Ductility===

Since there are no permanent bonds between the ions, they can move about and slide past each other. This makes metals ductile.

===Toughness===

Metals are tough for the same reason as they are ductile: the positive ions can slide past each other while still remaining together. So, instead of breaking apart, they change shape, resulting in increased toughness. This effect is called plasticity.

===Elasticity===

When a metal is stretched, it can return to its original shape because the sea of electrons which bonds the ions together can be stretched as well.

===Brittle===

The opposite of tough: a material is likely to crack or shatter upon impact or force. It will snap cleanly due to defects and cracks.

===Malleability===
Metals are maleable because their atoms are aranged in flat planes that can slide past each other.

===Transformation===

Diffusive transformation: occur when the planes of atoms in the material move past each other due to the stresses on the object. This transformation is permanent and cannot be recovered from due to energy being absorbed by the structure

Diffusionless transformation: occurs where the bonds between the atoms stretch, allowing the material to deform elastically. An example would be rubber or a shape memory metal/alloy (often referred to as SMA) such as a nickel-titanium alloy. In the shape memory alloy the transformation occurs via the change of phase of the internal structure from martensitic to deformed martensitic, which allows the SMA to have a high percentage strain (up to 8% for some SMA's in comparison to approximately 0.5% for steel). If the material is then heated above a certain temperature the deformed martensite will form austenite, which returns to twinned martensite after cooling.

==Questions==

1. Would you expect a metal to have more or less conductivity than a semiconductor? Why?

2. How can the stress-strain graph for a metal be explained in terms of ions in a sea of electrons?

3. As a metal heats up, what happens to its conductivity? Why?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. Would you expect a metal to have more or less conductivity than a semiconductor? Why?'''

A metal has more conductivity than a semiconductor because a metal has more ions than a semiconductor, and hence more free (delocalized) electrons.

'''2. How can the stress-strain graph for a metal be explained in terms of ions in a sea of electrons?'''

In the elastic region, the ions are held together by the charge between them and the electrons, and they can move apart when under stress. Then, once the ions are too far apart, the bonds aren't strong enough to pull them back together, so the metal entends under the stress. Eventually, the bonds cannot maintain the structural integrity of the metal any more, so the metal 'necks' in one place, and then the metal fractures.

'''3. As a metal heats up, what happens to its conductivity? Why?'''

As a metal heats up, both ions and electrons vibrate more. This means that the collision rate between ions and electrons goes up, so it is harder for electrons to travel through the metal. So, as a metal heats up, its conductivity goes down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Batteries, just like other components in an electric circuit, have a resistance. This resistance is known as internal resistance. This means that applying Ohm's law (V = IR) to circuits is more complex than simply feeding the correct values for V, I or R into the formula.

The existence of internal resistance is indicated by measuring the potential difference across a battery. This is always less than the EMF of the battery. This is because of the internal resistance of the battery. This idea gives us the following formula:

[[Image:Internal_resistance.svg|right]]

PD across battery = EMF of battery - voltage to be accounted for

Let us replace these values with letters to give the simpler formula:

V&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt; = E - V&lt;sub&gt;internal&lt;/sub&gt;

Since V = IR:

V&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt; = E - IR&lt;sub&gt;internal&lt;/sub&gt;

You may also need to use the following formula to work out the external potential difference, if you are not given it:

V&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt; = IΣR&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt;

You should also remember the effects of using [[A-level_Physics_%28Advancing_Physics%29/Resistance_and_Conductance|resistors]] in both series and parallel circuits.

==Questions==

1. A 9V battery is short-circuited. The potential difference across the battery is found to be 8V, and the current is 5A. What is the internal resistance of the battery?

2. What is the EMF of the battery in the following circuit?

[[Image:Internal_resistance_q2.svg]]

3. What is the internal resistance of the battery in the following circuit?

[[Cookbook:Rhubarb|Rhubarb]] fool is a traditional dessert in Swedish cuisine. Its sweet and sour taste makes it a perfect summer dessert, to be served after a heavy meal.

== Ingredients ==
500 g of fresh or frozen [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]]
* 4 dl of [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 1 dl of [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (To reduce the amount of Carbohydrates in the recipe consider use an artificial sweetener) 
* 3 tbs of [[w:en:Potato starch|Potato starch]]
* [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]], or a Milk and [[Cookbook:Cream|Cream]] mix, for serving

== Procedure ==
#Rinse the rhubarb and cut it into smaller pieces, about 1-3 cm in length. If the rhubarb is coarse or of low quality, it may be necessary to peel it first. Bring the water and sugar to a boil. 
#Add the rhubarb and boil until soft, about 3-5 min. Meanwhile, mix the starch with a bit of water until it dissolves.
#When the rhubarb is soft, whisk or stir vigorously to make sure all the rhubarb pieces breaks up into strings. ''There should be no whole pieces left'', if necessary boil some more. 
#Remove the rhubarb from the heat. Add the dissolved starch to the rhubarb while stirring. Keep stirring and bring the rhubarb to a boil once again. 
#Pour the rhubarb fool into serving bowls and sprinkle some sugar on top to prevent skin from forming. Leave to cool off and then refrigerate.

Serve at room temperature or chilled, with milk.

Note: if using artificial sweetener then add that ingredient late. Unlike sugar it does not need to be disolved in hot water.

== Notes and Variations ==
Depending on the type of rhubarb and whether it is peeled or not the color of the rhubarb fool can vary from pale yellow to clear red. The potato starch can be substituted for [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A 9V battery is short-circuited. The potential difference across the battery is found to be 8V, and the current is 5A. What is the internal resistance of the battery?'''

8 = 9 - 5R&lt;sub&gt;internal&lt;/sub&gt;

5R&lt;sub&gt;internal&lt;/sub&gt; = 1

R&lt;sub&gt;internal&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2Ω

[[Image:Internal_resistance_q2.svg|right]]

'''2. What is the EMF of the battery in the following circuit?'''

&lt;math&gt;\sum R_{\mathrm{external}} = \left( \frac{1}{8 + 4} + \frac{1}{4} \right)^{-1} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{-1} = 3 \mbox{ }\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

V&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 x 3 = 15 V

15 = E - (5 x 10)

E = 50 + 15 = 65 V

[[Image:Internal_resistance_q3.svg|right]]

'''3. What is the internal resistance of the battery in the following circuit?'''

&lt;math&gt;\sum R_{\mathrm{external}} = \left( \frac{1}{2 + 4} + \frac{1}{3 + 6 + 1} \right)^{-1} = \left( \frac{4}{15} \right)^{-1} = 3.75 \mbox{ }\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

V&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.5 x 3.75 = 28.125

Which actually makes this question impossible because the current is too high for the resistance supplied to the circuit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Making New Friends&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To simplify creation of friend functions for a class template.

=== Motivation ===
Friend functions are often used to provide some auxiliary additional interfaces for a class. For example, insertion (&lt;&lt;), extraction (&gt;&gt;) operators and overloaded arithmetic operators are often friends. Declaring friend functions of a class template is a little more complicated compared to declaring a friend function for a non-template class. There are four kinds of relationships between classes and their friends when templates are involved:

* One-to-many: A non-template function may be a friend to all template class instantiations.
* Many-to-one: All instantiations of a template function may be friends to a regular non-template class.
* One-to-one: A template function instantiated with one set of template arguments may be a friend to one template class instantiated with the same set of template arguments. This is also the relationship between a regular non-template class and a regular non-template friend function.
* Many-to-many: All instantiations of a template function may be a friend to all instantiations of the template class. 

The one-to-one relationship is of interest here because setting that up in C++ requires additional syntax. An example follows.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename T&gt;
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T&amp; t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp;, const Foo&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
};

template&lt;typename T&gt;
ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; os, const Foo&lt;T&gt;&amp; b) {
   return os &lt;&lt; b.value;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example is no good for us because the inserter is not a template but it still uses a template argument (T). This is a problem since it’s not a member function. The operator&lt;&lt;( ) must be a template so that distinct specialization for each T can be created.

Solution here is to declare a insertion operator template outside the class before friend declaration and adorn the friend declaration with &lt;&gt;. It indicates that a template declared earlier should be made friend.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Forward declarations
template&lt;class T&gt; class Foo;
template&lt;class T&gt; ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp;,
                                      const Foo&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
template&lt;class T&gt;
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T&amp; t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; &lt;&gt;(ostream&amp;, const Foo&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
};

template&lt;class T&gt;
ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; os, const Foo&lt;T&gt;&amp; b)
{
   return os &lt;&lt; b.value;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

A disadvantage of the above solution is that it is quite verbose.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Dan Saks suggested another approach to overcome the verbosity of the above solution. His solution is known as &quot;Making New Friends&quot; idiom. The idea is to define the friend function inside the class template as shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename T&gt;
class Foo {
   T value;
public:
   Foo(const T&amp; t) { value = t; }
   friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; os, const Foo&lt;T&gt;&amp; b)
   {
      return os &lt;&lt; b.value;
   }
}; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Such a friend function is not a template, but the template acts as a factory for &quot;making&quot; new friends. A new non-template function is created for each specialization of Foo.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is the link to the Dr. Hoffman site needed? I think at most it can be in a reference tag, not linked blatantly and disruptively in the body of the text. Besides, this is common information, so I don't know that it really needs attribution.

The first step says something about water coming out of the throat?! Should be the other nostril, shouldn't it? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:85.218.27.187|85.218.27.187]] ([[User talk:85.218.27.187|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/85.218.27.187|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

== external site contradicts  ==

The link to the external site says one should close off one nostril when expelling water from the nose while the wikipedia article says it is not to be done.


Also... the repeated use of the word isotonic regarding saline solution seems wrong.  Probably isosmotic was intended.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Multi-statement Macro&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To write a multi-statement (multi-line) macro.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
Sometimes it is useful to group two or more statements into a macro and call them like a function call. Usually, an inline function should be the first preference but things such as debug macros are almost invariably macros rather than function calls. Grouping multiple statments into one macro in a naive way could lead to compilation errors, which are not obvious at first look. For example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#define MACRO(X,Y) { statement1; statement2; }
&lt;/source&gt;

would fail in an if statement if a semi-colon is appended at the end.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
if (cond)
   MACRO(10,20); // Compiler error here because of the semi-colon.
else
   statement3;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above statement expands to 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
if (cond)
   { statement1; statement2; }; // Compiler error here because of the semi-colon.
else
   statement3;
&lt;/source&gt;

giving a compiler error. Therefore, people came up with a widely used idiom for multi-statement macros, which is based on a do-while loop.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Here is an example of the multi-statement macro idiom.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#define MACRO(arg1, arg2) do {  \
  /* declarations, if any */    \
  statement1;                   \
  statement2;                   \
  /* ... */                     \
  } while(0)	/* (no trailing ; ) */
&lt;/source&gt;

When the caller appends a semicolon, this expansion becomes a single statement regardless of the context. Optimizing compilers usually remove any dead tests, such as while(0). This idiom is not useful when macro is used as a parameter to a function call. Moreover, this idiom allows return statement.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
func(MACRO(10,20)); // Syntax error here.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Known Uses ===
ACE_NEW_RETURN, ACE_NEW_NORETURN macros in Adaptive Communication Environement (ACE).
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#define ACE_NEW_RETURN(POINTER,CONSTRUCTOR,RET_VAL) \
      do { POINTER = new (ACE_nothrow) CONSTRUCTOR; \
      if (POINTER == 0) { errno = ENOMEM; return RET_VAL; } \
    } while (0)
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Boolean expressions is jargon.

Sometimes you want to compare two values, to find out if they are the same or different. The result of a comparison is true or false. Expressions which return true or false are called Boolean expressions.</text>

Welcome my page.  You probably got here by accident. :)

'''AtholM''' is a contraction of my real name, Athol Mullen.

For more information about me, see [[w:User:AtholM|my user page]] on the English language wikipedia.

I also contribute photographs to wikipedia commons, and have a [[commons:User:AtholM/Gallery|gallery of images]] there.

== VIN ==

I split material from [[w:Vehicle identification number]] into several modules - the history of the version from which all are derived exists at [[Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN codes)/Overview]]; does the history need to be duplicated in all modules derived from that material? (generally this isn't needed for an article split on Wikipedia, but I'm not familiar with Wikibooks policy). [[User:Random832|Random832]] ([[User talk:Random832|talk]]) 06:58, 22 December 2007 (UTC)
:If I understand you correctly, then the current state of affairs is fine. As long as there is some indication in the edit history for each page that the content added came from some other page, then the history is intact.

== Double Redirect ==

Hello Mike, I'm new here and my first edit was to fix a double-redirect. The page ([[Javascript/List of Contributers]]) was not removed from the list (as has been the case on all other wikis with which I have had experience), but marked out. Is there some mistake I have made? Thanks for your help, [[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]] 18:37, 22 December 2007 (UTC)

== AWB ==

Hi Mike, I [[User talk:Whiteknight#Categorizing uncategorized pages|asked WKnight]] if there are tools available that could help an eventual cleanup of the uncategorized pages (since I did the categories). In his [[User_talk:Jacques_Bergeron#Re:Categorizing_uncategorized_pages|answer]] he pointed me to [[w:WP:AWB|AWB]] saying that you were a regular user of that tool. Before I take a detailed look at the tool I have a couple of questions for you if you have a minute:
:Are you effectively using that tool?
:Does it work?
:Do we need special permission to use it at wikibooks (there is at wikipedia)?
:Do you think it could help in the uncategorized pages cleanup?
&lt;br&gt;Reagrds, --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 14:07, 23 December 2007 (UTC)
::I'm not sure how useful it would be for categorizing uncategorized pages - [[m:pywikipediabot|pywikipediabot]] would be more useful (I also have that). That process obviously can't be fully-auto, since the program can't decide how to categorize pages, but it is fairly straightforward. I'm fairly busy over the holidays, but come January, I can invest some time into categorization if you like. If you want to do it, go for it. No programming required, but it's bit more involved to get up and running. If you do it yourself, just remember that unless you have a bot account, you can't go full-speed (you're of course welcome to [[WB:RFA|ask]] for a bot flag on a secondary account). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:30, 23 December 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Warn.js ==

I'll see what I can do about the watchlist thing. The problem is that the code is part of a reusable library, so if i change the library it is going to affect all the rest of the scripts that rely on it (which is quite a lot at this point). If i set it to not watch the page, then scripts that I use on my talk page (for instance) will cause my talk page to be removed from my watchlist. 

The likely solution will be for me to create an entirely new function with specifiable options (such as watch page, minor edit, etc) and then slowly transition all scripts over to use this new function. I'll get to work on it this evening when I get back home, and I'll let you know how it progresses.  --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:02, 8 January 2008 (UTC)

:Wrote a long thing, then realize I misread you. Yes, changing (or not) the watched status of a page would need to be a parameter, which isn't the case now. Thanks a ton. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:05, 8 January 2008 (UTC)

:Okay, i completely rewrote a few functions, and updated the library. The script now uses your default values for page watching and minor edits. These will be the same as what you have set in the preferences. So, if you have &quot;watch pages I edit&quot; or &quot;watch pages I create&quot; enabled in the preferences, that's what will happen with the script. Same with the minor edits thing (&quot;mark all edits minor by default&quot;). 
:Do me a favor, I want to get some people to test this script out so that I know I didnt mess it up worse. Also, give me some feedback about whether you want me to change the default behavior (mark them all as minor by default, don't ever watch them by default, etc). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:08, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
::Excellent! There was one missing comma (literally) that I poked darklama to find and fix. I think it'd be best to never watch those edits; it's just a welcome/warn. If there's some special case (like you're expecting a reply to a vandal warning or whatever) then you can watch the page separately for those special cases. As well, those are definitely minor edits, so that should be on. Great work though. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:27, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

I was hoping the only policy would be &quot;admin discretion, and they're responsible for their own rights changes&quot; - I'm trying to keep this as minimalist as possible.

== Explanation of New Category ==

Hi, Mike.lifeguard!  I've seen your name all over but have never chatted with you.  Thanks for being a great admin.  Anyway, I am a GA at Old Dominion Univ. in Virginia, and for the past couple years, our students have taken part in the creation of their own textbook [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education|Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]].  Now, times have changed, so we've decided to create a new book--the one you found.  When I categorized all the modules in the old book, [[User:SBJohnny]] told me that it would be ok for me to categorize every module with the book's title.  If you'd like me to try something else this time, I'll be happy to, but I thought I'd better explain.  

By the way, if you have any suggestions for me, I'd sure appreciate it!  Thanks, and keep in touch if you have time.

[[User:PbakerODU|Pete]] ([[User talk:PbakerODU|talk]]) 23:12, 11 January 2008 (UTC)
:Didn't notice the category matched the title - that's perfect. Normally when pages are created with no content I'll tag it with {{tlx|query}}, but I recognized your username from that previous project. As long as those page aren't mistakes I'll go back and patrol them. Thanks for the note. If you need help, this is one place. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:14, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

== Cover for New Book ==

Hi, I am working to find a nice cover photo for my new book from the Commons.  As you probably remember, my ignorance caused me to misrepresent the license of an Asian Fan Dance photo last semester, and I wonder if you can remind me again about this policy.  I would like to save a copy of a Commons image on my local machine, and then edit in text including the book's title and contributors.  After this is done, I would like to upload the image to the Commons again and use it as the cover photo.  What type of license should I attach to this modified version of the image?  I surely appreciate your help.  Wikibooks is a great community, and I definitely don't want to abuse it.

[[User:PbakerODU|Pete]] ([[User talk:PbakerODU|talk]]) 15:27, 12 January 2008 (UTC)
:I'm not an expert, but I think it'll be the same license that the original image had. You might ask on [[commons:Commons:Help desk]] - folks at Commons deal only with images, so they really know their stuff. See [[commons:Commons:Licensing]] for an example(!) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:04, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

I have that option enabled but it doesn't work any more (I don't see the tabs). I use Firefox, if that's helpful. [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 21:47, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

== Re:warn.js ==

I did a few tests this morning, and I have to admit that i'm not getting any errors on this script. Do me a favor and clear your cache, just to make sure that your browser is using the most recent version of the script. You say that you get the error, but that the script still posts messages? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:00, 13 January 2008 (UTC)
:Done and still getting it. It's an error after everything important has happened. The user gets warned/welcomed; this doesn't affect function, but it's strange. I wouldn't have noticed anything except that firebug tells me 1 error, and then the message &amp; code I quoted before. I suppose no fix is really necessary. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:17, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

Hey Mike, could you figure out what's going on here?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition of divisibility==
An integer b is divisible by an integer a, not zero, if there exists an integer x such that b = ax and we write &lt;math&gt; a|b &lt;/math&gt;. In case b is not divisible by a, we write &lt;math&gt; a \nmid b&lt;/math&gt;. For example &lt;math&gt; 3|6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 4 \nmid 6&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt; a | b&lt;/math&gt; and 0 &lt; a &lt; b then a is called a proper divisor of b. The notation &lt;math&gt; a^k || b&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate that &lt;math&gt; a^k | b&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt; a^{k+1} \nmid b&lt;/math&gt;. For example &lt;math&gt; 3||6&lt;/math&gt;.

==Basic properties==
# &lt;math&gt; a|b&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; a|bc&lt;/math&gt; for any integer c.
# &lt;math&gt; a|b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b|c&lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt; a|c&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt; a|b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a|c&lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt; a|(bx + cy)&lt;/math&gt; for any integers x and y.
# &lt;math&gt; a|b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b|a&lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt; a=\pm b&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt; a|b&lt;/math&gt;, a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0, imply &lt;math&gt;a \le b&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt; m \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; a|b&lt;/math&gt; implies and is implied by &lt;math&gt; ma|mb&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'':
# Clearly if &lt;math&gt; a | b&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; x such that b = ax. Then bc = a(xc) = ay and so &lt;math&gt; a | bc&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt; a | b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b | c&lt;/math&gt; imply that m,n exist such that b = am and c = bn. Then clearly c = bn = (am)n = ap and so &lt;math&gt; a | c&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt; a | b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a | c&lt;/math&gt; imply existence of m,n such that b = am and c = an so that bx + cy = amx + any = az and so &lt;math&gt; a | bx + cy&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt; a | b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b | a&lt;/math&gt; imply that m,n exist such that b = am and a = bn. Then a  = bn = amn and so mn = 1. The only choice for m and n is to be simultaneously 1 or -1. In either case we have the result.
# b = ax for some x &gt; 0 as otherwise a and b would have opposite signs. So b = (a + a + ...) x times &lt;math&gt; \ge &lt;/math&gt; a.
# &lt;math&gt; a | b&lt;/math&gt; implies b = ax for some x which imples mb = amx i.e. &lt;math&gt; ma | mb&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely &lt;math&gt; ma | mb&lt;/math&gt; implies mb = max from which b = ax and so &lt;math&gt; a | b&lt;/math&gt; follows.

''Remarks'':
* Properties 2 and 3 can be extended by the principle of mathematical induction to any finite set. That is, &lt;math&gt; a_1 | a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; a_2 | a_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; a_3 | a_4 \cdots a_{k-1} | a_k&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; a_1 | a_k&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt; a | b_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; a | b_2 \cdots a | b_n&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; a | \sum_{j=1}^n b_jx _j&lt;/math&gt; for any integers &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt;.
* Property 4 uses the fact that the only units in the set of integers are 1 and -1. (A unit in a ring is an element which possesses a multiplicative inverse.)

==The division algorithm==

Specifically, the division algorithm states that given two integers ''a'' and ''d'', with ''d'' ≠ 0 

There exist unique integers ''q'' and ''r'' such that ''a'' = ''qd'' + ''r'' and 0 ≤ ''r'' &lt; | ''d'' |, where | ''d'' | denotes the absolute value of ''d''. 

''Note:''
The integer 
* ''q'' is called the '''quotient''' 
* ''r'' is called the '''remainder''' 
* ''d'' is called the '''divisor'''
* ''a'' is called the '''dividend'''

''Proof'':
The proof consists of two parts &amp;mdash; first, the proof of the existence of ''q'' and ''r'', and secondly, the proof of the uniqueness of ''q'' and ''r''.

Let us first consider existence.

Consider the set

:&lt;math&gt;S = \left\{a - nd : n \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

We claim that ''S'' contains at least one nonnegative integer. There are two cases to consider.

*If ''d'' &lt; 0, then &amp;minus;''d'' &gt; 0, and by the Archimedean property, there is a nonnegative integer ''n'' such that (&amp;minus;''d'')''n'' ≥ &amp;minus;''a'', i.e. ''a'' &amp;minus; ''dn'' ≥ 0.
*If ''d'' &gt; 0, then again by the Archimedean property, there is a nonnegative integer ''n'' such that ''dn'' ≥ &amp;minus;''a'', i.e. ''a'' &amp;minus; ''d''(&amp;minus;''n'') = ''a'' + ''dn'' ≥ 0.

In either case, we have shown that ''S'' contains a nonnegative integer. This means we can apply the well-ordering principle, and deduce that ''S'' contains a ''least'' nonnegative integer ''r''. If we now let ''q'' = (''a'' &amp;minus; ''r'')/''d'', then ''q'' and ''r'' are integers and ''a'' = ''qd'' + ''r''.

It only remains to show that 0 ≤ ''r'' &lt; |''d''|. The first inequality holds because of the choice of ''r'' as a ''nonnegative'' integer. To show the last (strict) inequality, suppose that ''r'' ≥ |''d''|. Since ''d'' ≠ 0, ''r'' &gt; 0, and again ''d'' &gt; 0 or ''d'' &lt; 0.

*If ''d'' &gt; 0, then ''r'' ≥ ''d'' implies ''a''-''qd'' ≥ ''d''.  This implies that ''a''-''qd''-''d'' ≥0, further implying that ''a''-(''q''+1)''d'' ≥ 0.  Therefore, ''a''-(''q''+1)''d'' is in ''S'' and, since ''a''-(''q''+1)''d''=''r''-''d'' with ''d''&gt;0 we know ''a''-(''q''+1)''d''&lt;''r'', contradicting the assumption that ''r'' was the least nonnegative element of ''S''.

*If ''d''&lt;0 then ''r'' ≥ -''d'' implying that ''a''-''qd'' ≥ -''d''.  This implies that ''a''-''qd''+''d'' ≥0, further implying that ''a''-(''q''-1)''d'' ≥ 0.  Therefore, ''a''-(''q''-1)''d'' is in ''S'' and, since ''a''-(''q''-1)''d''=''r''+''d'' with ''d''&lt;0 we know ''a''-(''q''-1)''d''&lt;''r'', contradicting the assumption that ''r'' was the least nonnegative element of ''S''.

In either case, we have shown that ''r'' &gt; 0 was not really the least nonnegative integer in ''S'', after all. This is a contradiction, and so we must have ''r'' &lt; |''d''|. This completes the proof of the existence of ''q'' and ''r''.

Now let us consider uniqueness.

Suppose there exists ''q'', ''q' '', ''r'', ''r' '' with 0 ≤ ''r'', ''r' '' &lt; ''|d|'' such that ''a'' = ''dq'' + ''r'' and ''a'' = ''dq' '' + ''r' ''. Without loss of generality we may assume that ''q'' ≤ ''q' ''.
&lt;p&gt;
Subtracting the two equations yields: ''d''(''q' ''- ''q'') = (''r'' - ''r' ''). 
&lt;p&gt;
If ''d'' &gt; 0 then ''r' '' ≤ ''r'' and ''r'' &lt; ''d'' ≤ ''d''+''r' '', and so (''r''-''r' '') &lt; ''d''. Similarly, if ''d'' &lt; 0 then ''r'' ≤ ''r' ''        and ''r' ''&lt; -''d'' ≤ -''d''+''r'', and so -(''r''- ''r' '') &lt; -''d''.  Combining these yields |''r''- ''r' ''| &lt; |''d''|. 
&lt;p&gt;
The original equation implies that |''d''| divides |''r''- ''r' ''|; therefore  either |''d''| ≤ |''r''- '''r' ''| (if |''r''- ''r' ''| &gt; 0 so that |''d''| is also &gt; 0 and property 5 of Basic Properties above holds), or |''r''- ''r' ''|=0. Because we just established that |''r''-''r' ''| &lt; |''d''|, we may conclude that the first possibility cannot hold. Thus, ''r''=''r' ''. 
&lt;p&gt;
Substituting this into the original two equations quickly yields ''dq'' = ''dq' '' and, since we assumed ''d'' is not 0, it must be the case that ''q'' = ''q' '' proving uniqueness.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Remarks'':
* The name division algorithm is something of a misnomer, as it is a theorem, not an algorithm, i.e. a well-defined procedure for achieving a specific task.
* There is nothing particularly special about the set of remainders {0, 1, ..., |''d''| &amp;minus; 1}. We could use any set of |''d''| integers, such that every integer is congruent to one of the integers in the set. This particular set of remainders is very convenient, but it is not the only choice.

'''Honey Gingerbread''' is a simple and easy to prepare honey cake. It may be decorated if desired.

== Ingredients ==

*500g [[cookbook:Flour|smooth flour]]
*125g [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
*190g [[cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
*1 tablespoon [[cookbook:honey|honey]]
*3 [[cookbook:egg|eggs]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*4 [[Cookbook:clove|clove]]

You may need some molds to shape the cakes.

=== Decoration (optional) ===

*1 [[cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]
*150g or more powdered sugar

== Procedure ==

#Combine all ingredients in a bowl except one egg and mix until a smooth dough is obtained.
#Put the last egg in a cup or small bowl and mix it.
#Divide the dough into five or six portions. Take one portion and roll it flat, about 3mm thick. Molds are useful for shaping - cut some nice forms and put them on a baking tin.
#When the tin is full, take the mixed egg and glaze top of every cake.
#[[cookbook:Baking|Bake]] at 180°C for a few minutes, until the cakes have a light brown colour.
#Repeat with other dough portions.

=== Decorating (optional) ===

If you wish to decorate the cakes you will need additional time - perhaps hours if the decoration is complex.

#Mix the egg white and sugar. You may need to add more sugar if the mixture is not firm enough.
#If you do not have accessories needed to &quot;paint&quot; on cakes you can use a plastic bag - just cut off a corner of the bag to make a small hole, about 1mm in diameter. Put the icing mixture in the bag, seal or roll closed the top opening, and squeeze the icing out of the small hole.
#&quot;Paint&quot; or ice the cakes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is ''Archaeology''?==
[[Image:Archeology.jpg|50px|right]]

In a nutshell, Archaeology is the science of finding and examining the things (artifacts or artefacts) which we find there and concluding something about the people and their civilizations who created these objects previously existed in that place. These artefacts can be found both on land and under the sea, and can range from spears made from mammoth bones to an entire city.

Archaeology exists because the wind and dust covers and exposes ancient relics by turns called erosion and stratification. Plants grow in the dust and fix these things more or less in the place that they were discarded. Sometimes, people simply destroy old buildings in order to build new things in the same place, and archaeological sites are routinely exposed in modern cities when new roads or drains are required. 

Some of these 'city site' remains can be quite recent, whilst others date from the time when people first settled into agricultural routines and built the first towns and cities, which we think may have occurred about 50,000 years ago, when the remains of clothes, furniture fence-posts and fixed house foundations appear alongside earlier tools and weapons.

==Dating archaeological 'finds'==

We can discover when things got buried by a number of simple techniques: mainly by noticing the pattern of strata in the earth, and comparing that with growth-rings in trees that are buried nearby. As trees grow, they form rings, which are bigger in 'good' years and smaller in worse conditions. By comparing the size and nature of growth rings in trees of different ages we can build up a sort of 'historical calendar' of good and bad years. 

Some other plants prosper in times that trees put down broad rings, others do better in the 'thin-ring' years. By comparing the seeds and plant debris in successive sedimentary layers, we can make an informed guess about when any particular layer was laid down, and thus the age of things buried within it. This science is called Dendrology (from Greek δένδρον, dendron, &quot;tree&quot;; and -λογία, -logia, to know). 

Sometimes archaeologists are lucky, and find a scrap of pottery or art-work which will confirm or dispute their age assessment. This is often because similar pieces should appear in strata of similar ages.

More recently archaeology has advanced by the use of carbon dating. A naturally occurring radioisotope carbon-14 (14C) is formed in carbon-rich materials, and disintegrates slowly over time. By analyzing the rate of decay, it is possible to estimate the age of ash, plant and animal remains up to about 60,000 years old. By good luck, this seems to be about the time of the earliest truly human activity. 

==True or False?==
However, archaeology is an art, as much as science! When sea-fossils were first found in mountains, they were thought to be 'figured stones' placed there by God for man's delight, rather than detritus from some ancient sea-bed, as now seems more probable. The truth is, we really do not know for sure. Scientists use the '''balance of probability''' that one conclusion is more likely to be right than several other, competing ideas. 

That is why scientific researchers today always try to separate their observations from the methods and equipment they used to make measurements, and from their conclusions, so that later generations, with a better understanding, can review their evidence and improve our collective understanding of the past. 

That is why, at school, in science, we are taught to use the five steps of scientific investigation. Let's use the Ma Wan Men as an example. First, we must '''observe''' the things around us - or the geographical environment, in this case. Ma Wan is a harbour, so people may fish there easily. Then we set a '''hypothesis''', e.g. that a New Stone Age culture lived there. This is very probable as a neolithic culture had been found in nearby Sham Wan as well as in the Mainland.

Next, we must conduct an '''experiment''' to figure out whether our hypothesis is correct. However, we must, of course, find te artefacts before we can experiment! So the archaeologists used different tools to unearth tombs, pottery and other artefacts. They figure out that the finds may date back to 4000BC.* Then they think about the rock carvings that they found nearby. Perhaps people might go there for religious rituals, then go fishing! Then, if they go fishing, they might date back to at least the Middle Stone Age. Then they see traces of houses. Yes! It had got to be the old stone age. This process is called the 'recording' and 'analising' of data in science, and is a bit like the DBQs you face and fear in your history tests.

Finally, the archaeologists draw a '''conclusion''' that Ma Wan had been populated by an ancient people that was related to the Baiyue tribe (The one that Qin Shihuangdi conquered after conquering the states of Han, Zhao, Wei, Chu, Yan, and Qi. He built the Linqu for the soldiers so that they can fight, remember?)

Always remember! '''Science contains NO absolute truth NOR ANY incontrovertible wisdom.''' Rather it is a perpetual discussion and review between informed people with different experiences, from which  '''balance of probability''' our collective human understanding will, we hope, improve!

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Though 4000BC is the time when the Metal Age started, remember that some places, such as Hong Kong, did not start their Metal Ages till 1500BC.

== Ancient History ==

I saw you editing the Introduction page earlier. Do you have any desire to work on the project? I'm currently in the process of gathering interested editors. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 00:36, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
:Yes, I will certainly help you out. I will join. I may just not be as active on it as I am with astronomy. --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:46, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Deletion type stuff ==

Saw a speedy you tagged.  Don't disagree but there &quot;sort of&quot; is content so I'll leave it for someone else for now I think.  This project really does do things a little differently in some ways....:)  One template that is useful &amp; does get used is {{tl|qr-em}} - may be handy for you.  The pace here is a little slower than some places we know!  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:46, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
:Ok, thanks for the advice, I'll take things a wee bit slower. - &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:04, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
::I wouldn't worry about it - I never did! - just saying how it is.  The work you are doing is good too - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:22, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== &quot;better image&quot; ==

That template is used in lots of places, and shouldn't be changed without need. Unless there's agreement of more than just you to change it, please don't. I [[WB:AGF|respect]] that you're trying to better the project, but that icon just doesn't fit in with the others; that's why we didn't use it. Also, it's used in {{tlx|Info}} - one icon per template for clarity. This note may seem abrupt - it's late here; forgive me. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:21, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

:No, not abrupt at all, I understand. I just thought that the image was more fitting; I don't really care either way. Thanks, --- &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:32, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

== Naming ==

I'm pretty sure that [[Astronomy/Core of the Black Hole: The Theory of the Naked Singularity]] should be named [[Astronomy/Core of the Black Hole/The Theory of the Naked Singularity]] as the &quot;:&quot; is almost only used as a mainspace designator.

:Right, I see, I will rename, but to &quot;The theory of the naked singularity, because its not a subchapter of &quot;Core of the black hole&quot;.

== Traveled / travelled ==

I noticed that you edited [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)/Kinematics]], and replaced a load of 'travelled's with 'traveled'. Since this textbook is for a UK exam specification, should these be left as the British English spelling 'travelled', or should all pages on the English wikibooks be in US English? (There isn't a British English wikibooks.) --[[User:Sjlegg|Sjlegg]] ([[User talk:Sjlegg|talk]]) 13:12, 19 April 2008 (UTC)
:I am unsure of protocol here... I think it can be interchangeable. I think travelled would be better, as it happens, informed as I am that it is for the UK. - &lt;strong&gt;[[User:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:Silver&quot;&gt;Anonymous Dissident&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User_talk:Anonymous Dissident|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:10, 26 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book provides an annotated set of caricatures from the British weekly &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (1868 - 1914), who were featured as rowers or who had a connection with rowing though featured on some other basis.  They are listed chronologically by their rowing years, not by the date they happened to appear in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.  As noted in the Introduction, the initial set by Wiki author Wat Bradford are of fifty-nine men who rowed in the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race or at the Henley regatta, or appeared mainly in connection with rowing, but Wiki contributors are welcome to add others who have a rowing connection (such as Thomas Brock); please just be clear what it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cotton, Hugh Benjamin == 

=== “Benjie” (Spy), March 15, 1894 ===
[[Image:Cotton_HB_Vanity_Fair_1894-03-15.jpg|thumb|right]]
''The youngest son of the late Lord Justice Cotton, he was born two-and-twenty years ago, went to “Badger” Hale’s House at Eton, and began his aquatic career by steering an Eton Trial Eight to victory.  Then he got promoted to an oar, and rowed in a winning Trial; yet did not row in the Eton Eight.  Three and a-half years ago he went to Magdalen, Oxford; and being an Eton boy who was found able to pull a lively oar, he became bow of the Dark Blue Eight two years ago.  He kept that place last year, and he will again fill it on Saturday; having in the meantime been improved into the smallest President of a University Boat Club on record.  For his College he has twice rowed Head of the River.  He has also won the University Fours and the University Pairs; while at Henley he has helped a Leander crew to win the Grand Challenge, and his College to win the Stewards’ Cup.''

''He is a very muscular, good-looking little fellow of five and a-half feet in height, whose proper weight is ten stone.  He is a rather retiring, yet quite independent, amiable boy who can say nasty things when he likes with effect; and he is strong in his antipathies.  He is reading law for his Final School, and he reads it at odd times; yet he loves his Shakespeare and is a hardened theatre-goer.  He is President of Vincent’s.''

''They call him “Ben” and “Benjie”; and they say that he confidently expects to show Cambridge the way to Mortlake on Saturday.''

For a five-and-half footer to become a winning oarsman is unusual; to win the Boat Race four times and the Grand twice, remarkable.  Hugh Benjamin Cotton (1872-95) did so, albeit with help from crews that outweighed him at least two stone a man (other than the cox, of course).  Another of Nickall’s “absolute classics”{{ref|Nickalls}}  --  at bow, where he always rowed -- Cotton was the only man in the winning 1895 Oxford boat not to get influenza during race week.  But soon thereafter a “severe attack of inflammation of the lungs” kept him out of Henley and the Oxford summer races, and that fall he succumbed to consumption from a chill caught at Oxford while coaching in the floods, and passed away on October 22.  In response to his death and those of two other Oxford oarsmen a year and a half later, their coach, Rudie Lehmann, mustered the evidence to show that rowing ''per se'' was not the culprit.  More sympathetically and for Cotton alone, Lehmann also penned an elegy, “Frater Ave Atque Vale,” concluding:

[[Image:Coaching_in_floods_at_Oxford_ILN_1872.jpg|thumb|right|325px|“The Oxford and Cambridge Boat-Race:  Practising on the Isis during the Floods,” ''Illustrated London News'', 1872]]
:''Though lost and dead, you die not here;''&lt;br&gt;
:''And, wheresoever men may range''&lt;br&gt;
:''Who once at Oxford held you dear''&lt;br&gt;
:''And called you friend, you know no change:''&lt;br&gt;
:''Still shall we see you stride along,''&lt;br&gt;
:''Smiling and resolute and strong.''


:''We shall grow old, but you abide''&lt;br&gt;
:''In all our hearts as staunch and true''&lt;br&gt;
:''And young as when on Thames’s tide''&lt;br&gt;
:''You gripped your oar and won your Blue --''&lt;br&gt;
:''But hush!  I hear the passing bell,''&lt;br&gt;
:''Oh dearest friend, farewell, farewell''{{ref|Frater}} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

=== The 1893 Boat Race:  Oxford’s Health ===
For the 1893 Boat Race, O.U.B.C. President  W.A.L. Fletcher needed a No. 7.  He gave one man a long trial, only to find him physically unfit and forbidden to row by the doctors.  When he filled the hole with C.M. Pitman, his preferred stroke, new medical problems sprouted:  Vivian Nickalls went ill and Fletcher himself got a strain.  Training suffered, which showed in the race as W.B. Woodgate noted in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (March 25, 1893):

[[Image:Oxford_college_rowing_in_the_floods_c1900.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Oxford in the floods, c. 1900]]
''The rowing of Oxford was very good in style.  The men did not seem to last so well as their style would presuppose.   Some of them had been seedy, and work had been shut off; no long rows for fourteen days.  The effect of this was that some of them, especially those who had not been invalids, were decidedly gross and overweight, making them short of wind.  Nos. 3 and 4, for instance, had put on flesh like prize cattle, and seemed to be blowing badly.  No blame to them; healthy men naturally put on flesh when work is light, and in an eight some often get too little work, while others get too much.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction by Wiki Author Wat Bradford == 
[[Image:Dudley-Ward_William_Vanity_Fair_1900-03-29.jpg|thumb|right|William Dudley-Ward]]
The serene profile of William Dudley-Ward caught my eye in the fall of 1986. His &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; print was posted in a bookstore window near Trinity College, Cambridge, where he had been C.U.B.C. President in 1900. Finding the £40 asking price a bit steep for a student budget, I shrugged and walked on, later to reconsider and start sliding down the collector’s slippery slope. At first content with only a few, I soon bought more prints, then will power gave way and finding the rest became an obsession, and then it occurred to me that obtaining the full official list might not complete the collection.

The problem lay in the cataloguing. Over 2300 prints were published in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; in its lifetime (1868 - 1914), roughly one a week. The editors never published a comprehensive list but did from time to time offer select groups for sale, such as this one August 5, 1908, the date rower R.B. Etherington-Smith appeared:

The following

_________________________


Unfortunately, the list is incomplete as it omits men such as J.J. Hornby, the Provost of Eton, who rowed for Oxford in 1849. It also omits accomplished oarsmen who happened not to row at “University,” i.e., Oxford or Cambridge. H.E. Searle, “Professional Champion Sculler of the World” in 1889, and B.J. Angle, who won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1878 with Thames R.C., come to mind. Moreover, the list stretches by including three men – Crossley, Bowen, and Jordan -- who may have rowed for their college but not their university.

Somewhat better are the lists later compiled by various dealers and collectors that classify the prints based on the appearance of the subject in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; and the accompanying biographical notes. One of the more definitive lists, from Clive A. Burden, Inc., comprises sixty-eight categories. “Sports -- Rowing” lists twenty-two entries, consisting mainly of Oxford and Cambridge rowers and coaches from 1889 to 1912, plus Mr. Searle, the lone professional. But the Clive Burden list, and others like it, omits several men whose connection to rowing was at least as significant as those listed, but who were catalogued differently because they appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; for other reasons. J.W. Chitty, for instance, rowed for Oxford in three Boat Races and umpired the event from 1857-71 and 1873-80, but appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; as a chancery judge and thus is catalogued among the 200 or so “Legals.”

So who are the rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;? If one finds &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s list of “University Oarsmen” and the somewhat different Clive Burden list too limiting, the question becomes subjective.  One might opt for every man who ever rowed at school, university, or in a club.  That would inflate the headcount, due largely to the number of old Etonians who appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; at some point in their lives.  Or one might raise the bar to admit only those who were genuinely successful on the river.  That would cut back the number and improve average quality, but would still be subjective and would knock out one from Clive Burden, Rev. E.J.H. Smith of Pembroke College, Cambridge (&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, January 28, 1888), whose greatest aquatic accomplishment was as a coach “animating the toils of the fifth boat.”  I have taken a middle path, not without faults but at least clear and manageable: anyone who appeared in the magazine mainly in connection with rowing (Rev. Smith makes the cut) or who rowed at Henley or for Oxford or Cambridge Universities (the lesser Etonians do not).  The result by my reckoning is fifty-eight.  Other Wiki authors may of course choose more expansive criteria and add more here accordingly; on such basis Thomas Brock appears, a sculptor and member of the Kensingon Rowing Club.

[[Image:Mackinnon_Duncan_The_World_1910.jpg|thumb|right|Duncan Mackinnon, O.U.B.C. President for the 1910 Boat Race, by “Spy” (Leslie Ward), for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;The World&lt;/span&gt;, not for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;]]To be sure, the focus on rowing, and this particular way of focusing on rowing, makes for a strange history.  We have great Boat Race and Henley rowers of the era, but not all of the best or only the best.  We have most of the “Spy” prints of rowers, but not all as F.I. Pitman, E.G. Williams, and D. Mackinnon appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rather than in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;The World&lt;/span&gt; in the early 1900s.  Of the fifty-three, only three managed not to attend Eton, Oxford, or Cambridge, so the selection hardly represents a random sampling of British society.  But “men are often known, remembered and immortalized -- especially abroad -- by some idiosyncrasy selected by the capriciousness of time,” observed Leslie Ward in 1915, recalling his long career as “Spy,” &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;'s most prolific artist.{{ref|Ward1}} “Looking back to-day it is strange to read in light of great events these miniature biographies of politicians now forgotten, of others who left their party to go over, of statesmen, of judges who sat on important cases and are now only remembered in connection with a trivial poisoner, an impostor in a claim, of careers then unproved but now shining clearly in the light of fame, and of others whose light is extinguished -- all within so short a lapse of time.”{{ref|Ward2}}

This book presents the rowers in sequence of their rowing careers, from the last days of King William IV through the reign of Queen Victoria to the cusp of the 1914-18 war.  As a nod to brevity only the individual portraits are reprinted, though six of the rowers appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; semiannual group “doubles”: “” by Théobald Chartran , July 5, 1881 (S.H. Northcote); “The Gladstone Cabinet” also by Chartran, November 27, 1883 (C.W. Dilke); “Tattersall’s, Newmarket” by Liberio Prosperi, December 6, 1887 (E. Boscawen); “In Vanity Fair,” an unsigned composite (November 29, 1890) (A.L. Smith); “Bench and Bar” by “Stuff,” December 5, 1891 (W.B. Brett and A.L. Smith); and “Cycling in Hyde Park” by Hal Hurst, June 11, 1896 (W.H. Grenfell).  The chronology bears no relationship to the order in which their prints appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, and thus makes it harder to see the evolution of the graphic and editorial styles, but does cluster contemporaries and facilitates the rowing story.  As for the story, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; and the rowers themselves tell nearly all of it. Starting with S.H. Northcote and ending with “Cygnet” Swann, the reader will find for each entry the signature lithograph or two from &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, the biographical note that accompanied it (set off in italics), a supplemental biography to round out his story, and an excerpt from &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; or another source, either about the rower in question or a complimentary theme.  The sequence is punctuated by the occasional chapter introduction to summarise rowing-related developments for the period mentioned.  Photographs, illustrations, and other images out of copyright are sprinkled in.

Throughout all this, my own limited commentary as “an amiable and sympathetic foreigner” aims to “attain the impersonal perspective proper to the true historian,” as T.A. Cook put it.{{ref|Cook}}  There are three reasons for this approach.  First, the magazine was blessed to have Walter Bradford Woodgate provide the rowing coverage in most of the years there was any to speak of.  Second, Woodgate, the other &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; authors, and the rowers themselves provide an authentic period voice, limiting early twenty-first century nostalgia, or anti-nostalgia, from creeping into the mix.  Finally, the original sources let one keep one’s head down, a good idea given how prickly rowers can be about their sport.  As G.C. Bourne, father of the penultimate &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rower R.C. Bourne, observed over sixty years ago during the religious debate over rowing styles:  “There is good reason for this wariness, for the rowing fraternity is a close corporation, jealous of its reputation and inclined to be hypersensitive and hypercritical to a degree which would astonish those who do not belong to it.”{{ref|Bourne}}

Lastly, I would single out for thanks Tom Weil, one of the world's leading historians of rowing and collector of rowing memorabilia, for his encouragement and support, and would commend to anyone interested in rowing history beyond this slice from &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; the external links below through which, among other avenues, Tom has shared his knowledge and love for the sport; Paul Mainds, Michael Rowe, and their colleagues at the River &amp; Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, for their curatorship and promotion of rowing history, including a 2006 exhibition of the rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;; Chris Dodd, rowing historian extraordinaire, who in his capacity as editor of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Rowing &amp; Regatta&lt;/span&gt;, the magazine of the Amateur Rowing Association, brought the exhibition to the attention of a broader public; and John Bateman of Auriol Kensington R.C., a fellow compulsive, who politely pointed out six &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rowers who had managed to slip through the initial net.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dudley-Ward, William == 

=== “C.U.B.C.” (Spy), April 2, 1903 ===
[[Image:Dudley-Ward_William_Vanity_Fair_1900-03-29.jpg|thumb|right]]''William Dudley Ward is only twenty-three years old, but his grandfather, on his mother’s side, was the late Lord Esher; who, before he was Master of the Rolls, was No. 7 in a winning Cambridge Eight.  So there was rowing blood in him when he went to Mr. Ainger’s House at Eton; and he fostered it by rowing in the Eton Eights of 1895 and 1896:  winning the Ladies’ Plate on both occasions.  At School he was Captain of the Boats, and a member of “Pop”; while he got his football colours at the wall game.  Then he became a freshman at Trinity, Cambridge, and rowed No. 7 in the Eight which lost the race of ‘97.  So he was made President of the C.U.B.C.; and fetched Fletcher of Oxford to coach his ‘98 crew:  in which he rowed in spite of the doctors.  He survived, and last year (the doctors having removed their embargo) he helped to beat Oxford for the first time in ten years.  Now he again presides over the Light Blues, and again rows at No. 7 in an Eight which, according to the experts, have Saturday’s race at their mercy.  Yet he has won nothing at Henley since he left Eton, nor has he rowed Head of the River, nor has he won the Fours at Cambridge:  though he has won the Pairs twice.  His hair is red, his complexion is pink, and he is smooth and plump and pleasing.  His views on punctuality are not ascetic; as a correspondent he is not hasty, and as a keeper of engagements he is casual.  Nevertheless, he hopes to take his degree in the summer.''

''He has been called “Duddie,” “The Terra Cotta Baby,” and “The Cheaper”; but he is generally known as “Dudley.”''

When [[w:William_Dudley_Ward|William Dudley-Ward]] (1877-1946) went up to Cambridge in 1896, the university had lost the Boat Race six times running.  They lost again in 1897 at the hands of “the finest Oxford crew that has ever rowed,” in the judgment of the Official Centenary History, which “won as they liked” by two and a half lengths.”{{ref|Drinkwater1}}  “At this dark hour the C.U.B.C. elected as President its No. 7, freshman Dudley-Ward, another of Nickalls’ “absolute classics.”{{ref|Nickalls}}   It was an unprecedented promotion designed to give him “the maximum of time in which to pull Cambridge rowing together and unite or silence the warring factions,”  a college captain later recalled.{{ref|Beith1}}  That autumn Dudley-Ward brought over W.A.L. Fletcher to coach, proceeded to remove one or two old Blues, and

''then called a meeting of college boat captains in the Goldie Boathouse under the chairmanship of R.C. Lehmann, who had been brought down to see fair play.  It was certainly a dramatic occasion.  Dudley Ward straightly accused certain persons of deliberately obstructing his efforts to select the most representative and best possible crew.  The opposition could only bluster, and Dudley Ward won a complete victory, and in due course Cambridge won the boat race for the first time in 10 years.{{ref|Beith2}}'' 

“Due course” meant two years later (1899), for in 1898 illness kept Dudley-Ward out of the race (VANITY FAIR was wrong about his participation) and, more significantly, a gale flooded the Cambridge boat, which would have sunk but for bladders stowed beneath the seats, allowing Oxford to ease home by about a quarter-mile.  With better weather in 1899, Cambridge won by three and a quarter lengths and in 1900, with Dudley-Ward again President and Gold gone from Oxford, by twenty.  “[The Cambridge 1900] crew and the Oxford one of 1897 stand in a class by themselves,” judged the Official Centenary History, so “it was unfortunate that Oxford brought to Putney one of the poorest that ever came from the Isis.”{{ref|Drinkwater2}}   So do fortunes change.

Dudley-Ward took his degree in 1903, having won the Goblets once (1902), the Grand twice (1902-03), and the Stewards’ three times (1901-03).  He reportedly “had a liking for the fleshpots and was known, on occasions, to turn up for training still dressed in white tie and tails.”{{ref|Burnell}}   From 1906 to 1922 he was Liberal M.P. for Southhampton, Treasurer for His Majesty’s household from 1909 to 1912, and Vice-Chamberlain from 1917 to 1922.  During the 1914-18 war he was a Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve.  On retirement from politics he divided his time between England and Canada, dying in Calgary in 1946 after an operation.

=== The 1899 Boat Race ===

Woodgate’s account in VANITY FAIR (March 30, 1899):

[[Image:CUBC_practicing_1899.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Cambridge practicing]]''The winning crew of Saturday’s Inter-’Varsity Boat Race will be shrined among crews such as Goldie’s 1870 crew, the Oxonians of 1875 and 1878, and other cracks, as being much above the average for speed and style.  The merit of their style is due to the coaching which they received, and especially to that of Mr. Fletcher, the Oxonian, on whom fell the brunt of the tuition from the hour when Trial Eight preparation commenced in the autumn.  They had undeniably the best of the stations, being to windward and on the inside of the river’s curve for the first two and a-half miles of the course.  The wind blew stiffly, and made the leeward station a great drawback.  If the stations had been reversed the handicap would have produced a pretty race; but on their form as displayed Cambridge should in the end have pulled through the disadvantage.''

''The best man in the two boats was Etherington-Smith, the Cantab President, whose father was in “Jack” Forster’s winning Grand Challenge crew of 1863.  The Cantab No. 6, another very fine oar, is son of the No. 3 of Cambridge at Putney in 1862.  The father of C.J.D. Goldie was even more celebrated in aquatic history, as most readers know; and the father of Gibbon, the Cantab stroke, a “dry bob” at Oxford, was notorious for showing season after season the most heart-breaking defence at cricket that ever tried the patience and temper of bowlers, and taking all the edge off their deliveries by the time that freer hitters came in.  Such repetition of athletic merit to the several generations in fifty per cent. of a crew is an interesting statistic.  It reminds one of Horace (Odes IV., 4):''

:: Fortes creantur fortibus ac bovis,
:: Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum
:: Virtus.{{ref|Horace}}

''The Oxford crew did by no means disgrace themselves against such high-class adversaries:  they kept together and in stroke all through a hard, stern chase in stormy water.  If all of them had copied the body action of their stroke, and had swung back and rowed it well out as he and No. 6 did, they would have been many lengths faster.  Their salient failing was want of length of swing-back in the middle of the boat.''

''The steering of both coxswains was much above the average; both are Etonians, and by no means novices at rudder-lines, which explains their mutual merit on the first occasion that either has performed in a Putney race.''

''The boats used were two good ones.  Oxford cannot have much excuse on this score, good though the Cantab ship was.  A resumé of the speech Lord Justice Smith (in the chair at the dinner on the 25th) has appeared in sundry dailies, and has rather misrepresented his remarks on boat-building.  What he said in effect was this:  “It is well known that if a builder does his utmost to produce two or three actually alike boats, nevertheless one will generally be much the faster.  Hence, never trust too much to obtaining an exact replica of any favourite vessel.  I hear that Cambridge had a prima donna of a boat this year.  If so, I would advise keeping her in lavender at Putney for another race, and spare her the concussion of being carted to Cambridge and back for next year, and of meantime being strained round the sharp corners of the Cam course.”  This advice of the Lord Justice will be endorsed by every oarsman who has experience in the vicissitudes of boat-building.''

''The Lord Justice also preached from the chair a friendly, paternal, and hard-hitting homily against the recent cabals in Cantab aquatic circles, which disorganised the C.U.B.C. of late, until Fletcher arrived as dictator to reorganise.  Fortunately those cabals have now been quenched, and it is to be hoped that after this latest brilliant example of what a united C.U.B.C. can achieve, we shall hear no more of them.  Fletcher will now lay down his bâton at Cambridge and place his services and nerve at the disposal of his own University.''

== [[The Rowers of Vanity Fair]] ==

I just wanted to check what this is. Is it an [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts|Annotated text]]? Or is it the [[WB:SOURCE|source text]]? Also, are you sure it is a [[WB:WIW|textbook]]? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:57, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

Mike, it's annotated text and images constituting a specialty history book.  The structure is:  (a) the original image (caricature / portrait) from Vanity Fair (1868 - 1914), (b) the corresponding biography that appeared in Vanity Fair alongside the text (shown here in italics adjacent to the image), (c) supplemental text by me (or other Wiki folks who emerge) to round out the biography, (d) additional text and images from Vanity Fair or another historic source, in either case related to the person or time period involved, and (e) chapter introductions, in the sense of providing an overview (from a rowing history vantage) of developments over a particular time period (e.g. 1839 - 1854, 1855 - 1872).  Hope this helps. [[User:Wat_Bradford|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Wat Bradford&lt;/font&gt;]]
:Sounds good; keep it up. You may have noticed on [[Special:Watchlist]] a notice about a proposal regarding rollbacker and patroller rights; you may want to weigh in, as you've been a good editor that's appeared on RC and newpages quite a bit. Your input is welcome if you care to comment. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:19, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

You missed a license tag for [[:Image:Muttlebury SD Vanity Fair 1890-03-22.jpg]] :) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:41, 13 January 2008 (UTC) &lt;br&gt;
Mike, thanks for the catch.  Think it's fixed now.  [[User:Wat Bradford|Wat Bradford]] ([[User talk:Wat Bradford|talk]]) 08:01, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

==Antipodean connection==
In the early 1890s Warre organised the donation of the Oxford and Cambridge Cup for Eight Oared races between Australian Universities. Both Melbourne and Adelaide University Boat Club captains were old Etonians. Is it appropriate to mention it in this wiki-book  [[The Rowers of Vanity Fair]]? [[Special:Contributions/58.160.169.189|58.160.169.189]] ([[User talk:58.160.169.189|talk]])[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ozdaren Daren]

Daren, apologies for being so late in replying. You're welcome to add this connection if you'd like.  If it's explained in Melbourne and/or Adelaide rowing web sites or Wikis, then the connection can be made by adding it as an external site reference to the Warre entry in [[The Rowers of Vanity Fair]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Northcote, Stafford Henry ''(Earl of Iddesleigh)'' == 

=== “He Does His Duty to His Party, and Is Fortunate if It Happens to Be Also His Duty to His Country” (Ape), October 8, 1870 ===

[[Image:Northcote_SH_Vanity_Fair_1870-10-08.jpg|thumb|right]]''Sir Stafford Northcote is a somewhat colourless politician, of whom all that there is to be said is that he does his duty to his party, and is fortunate if it happens to be also his duty to his country.  He is among the favoured ones who have been called to the blessed regions of the Ministry, and thereby has acquired a title to be taken into them again if ever these are again opened to the Conservative party, of whom he is a respectable and reputable member.  Diligent especially, and not unsuccessful in the making of local speeches on abstruse subjects during the slack season of the year, he perseveringly keeps before the public the fact that there are still a collection of opinions capable of being called Conservative, and still statesmen capable of seriously adopting and recommending them.''

Stafford Henry Northcote (1818-87) went up to Eton in 1831 where “he was somewhat idle, and, according to his tutor, ‘had a disposition too inclined to sacrifice itself to the solicitations of others,’ until a strong remonstrance produced steadiness of purpose.”{{ref|DNB}}   He rowed in the Adelaide (one of the Upper Boats) in 1834-35 and bow in the 1835 Eight.  He then went up to Balliol College, Oxford, earning a first in classics in 1839 and rowing No. 2 for the Oxford Etonians the same year at the first Henley Regatta.

After qualifying as a barrister, Northcote became private secretary to W.E. Gladstone, the then Tory president of the Board of Trade.  From Gladstone’s slipstream, Northcote moved up the party ranks, serving as secretary to the Great Exhibition of 1851, co-authoring a report on civil service reform, and ultimately building a leadership role as an M.P. for various constituencies more or less from 1855 onward.   In 1859 Gladstone left the Conservatives to co-found the Liberal Party.  Northcote remained Conservative.  Thus when the 1880 election returned a Liberal majority and installed Gladstone as Prime Minister, Northcote became a leader of the opposition tasked with keeping his former mentor in check.  This proved difficult, and he was unable to prevent some of his  more strident colleagues from forming a de facto “Fourth Party.”  VANITY FAIR bewailed their inability to unite, laying blame in the July 5, 1881 Summer Number double print, entitled “Birth, Behavior and Business,” with the Conservative front bench and with Northcote, Lord John Manners, and Sir Richard Cross in particular:

''Her Majesty’s Opposition in the House of Commons fails only in two respects:  in want of leaders and want of followers.  There are leaders, but they scarcely lead; there are followers, but they barely follow; and this lamentable result ensues, that a revolutionary Government is left to work its wicked will without being contained or controlled, or even being adequately criticised, by those whose business it is to keep such a Government in order.''

''Yet on the front Opposition Bench there are men of mark.  They are not however men of energy, and they disclose a marked want of appreciation of the new order of things, and a profound disinclination to adopt new methods of dealing with it.  An overweening caution and an exaggerated respect for the rules of the game are their chief characteristics; and one of their chief troubles is the audacity of some of their followers below the gangway, who are so much more offensive to them than their opponents, that it will be one of their difficulties in returning to office to consider what will be done with Sir Drummond Wolf and Lord Randolph Churchill.''

. . . .		

''Sir Stafford Northcote is a man of deportment.  He is of good family and of good name -- eminently reputable and very diligent.  But he had the misfortune to begin life as a permanent official, and his mind has remained permanent and official ever since.  Moreover, he started in politics as Private Secretary to Mr. Gladstone when that gentleman was President of the Board of Trade in the Tory Government.  This has been the great disturbing element of Sir Stafford’s life.  He has never recovered from the personal awe he then contracted for Mr. Gladstone, or for the hierarchical respect for Ministers and heads of departments, and he has never yet been able to conceive that he himself is their equal.  This, added to the inherent good nature which belongs to him, has always made him take an exaggerated view of the decorum which should mark the proceedings of the house of Commons.  The result is, that he often offends his followers by official deference to the Government, and generally seems to direct his conduct rather to obtain the approbation of permanent officials than the hearty support of Conservative Members.  Recently, indeed, he has roused himself to an intermittent sense of his position; but this awakening, having come late in life, is apt to show itself at the wrong times; so that he is often brisk when he should be quiet, and quiet when he should be brisk.  Nevertheless he is a man of integrity, of sixty-three years of age, and of very considerable information.  In the result he obtains cheers from his opponents, which seem to please him more than those of his own Party.  He has a certain vigour and much dexterity.  He is very well-read; but, though a fluent and easy speaker, he is not gifted with any oratorical power.''

When Gladstone’s government collapsed in 1885 and were replaced by the Conservatives, Northcote became First Lord of the Treasury and was raised to the peerage as Earl of Iddesleigh and Viscount St. Cyres.  He died in 1887, in the ante-room of the Prime Minister’s house in Downing Street.  “He seemed,” recalled Gladstone, “to be a man incapable of resenting an injury:  a man in whom it was the fixed habit of thought to put himself wholly out of view when he had before him the attainment of great public objects.”{{ref|Gladstone}}   But Viscount Wolseley (“the very model of a modern Major-General” to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan), on reviewing Northcote’s posthumous biography, declared he “was so essentially my opposite (so much about him of the tomcat that cared neither to fight nor make love) that I never met him without thanking God, like the Pharisee, I was not as he was.  He would have made an admirable chief clerk in a bank.”{{ref|Wolseley}}

=== The 1836 Eton v. Westminster Boat Race ===
S.H. Northcote never rowed for Eton against Westminster.  In his day, the races between the schools were few and far between, and 1835, when he rowed bow in the Eton eight, was an off year.  Just as well for him perhaps, for the professional watermen who steered the crews took full advantage of the permissive rules on “fouling” to transform those early races, into no-holds naval battles.  Here is an account of the 1836 contest:

[[Image:Eton_v_Westminster_rowing_1836-05-12.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Eton v. Westminster, Staines Bridge, May 12, 1836]]''This race took place at Staines on Thursday, May 12.  The distance rowed was from Staines Bridge to Penton Hook and back -- about four miles altogether.  Lord Orford and Captain Ackers, of the Blues, were appointed Umpires.  About four o’clock the Etonians appeared in rowing trim in the Victory, a new boat built by Archer, of Bishop’s Walk, Lambeth.  The young gentlemen of Westminster came to Staines in a new eight, called the Fairy Queen, built of fir, expressly for the occasion, by Noulton and Maynard, the well-known watermen, the former taking the lines for his patrons.  It was evident, even at a cursory glance, that the Etonians had the decided superiority in weight and strength, and betting was in their favour.  Westminster won the choice of station, and they took the south pier of Staines Bridge.  Previous to starting, it was agreed upon that no fouling should take place until half a mile of the distance had been rowed.  On going away from the bridge the Westminsters went in advance, which position they kept for about a quarter of a mile, Eton pressing them closely.  Noulton had by this time steered the Fairy Queen over to the course the Etonians were pursuing, and he bored them so closely in shore that they were obliged either to foul the Westminsters or go into the bank.  A foul consequently took place, which lasted five or six minutes, ending in the discomfiture of the Fairy Queen, who had her rudder struck off, an oar broken, and was turned completely around.  The Etonians went away with a cheer, but the Umpires, considering that an infringement of the agreement had taken place, called them back to a fresh start, which they immediately complied with.  At six o’clock they started from the bridge a second time, with an understanding that each boat should keep its own side of the water for half a mile.  The Fairy Queen again took the lead, which she held for about three-quarters of a mile, when the Etonians came upon them, and some smart fouling was the result.  Eton at length cleared, and showed the way down the stream.  In rounding the distance boat they were close together, and immediately after doubling the station punt the Westminsters caught them on the starboard quarter, which nearly put the Victory into the bank stern up.  The Etonians, however, shortly cleared themselves from this awkward situation, and once more went in advance; and notwithstanding they were occasionally bumped by the Fairy Queen in working up against the stream, they maintained the lead, ultimately winning by several boat’s lengths.  The match proved a treat throughout, by the spirited and gallant manner in which it was contested by both parties.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Brett, William Baliol (''Lord Esher'') == 

=== “Popular Judgment” (Ape), January 1, 1876 ===

[[Image:Brett_WB_Vanity_Fair_1876-01-01.jpg|thumb|right]]''Eight and fifty years ago the Reverend Joseph Brett, of Chelsea, was blessed with a son, whom in due time he sent through Westminster and Oxford to Lincoln’s Inn.  The young Barrister plodded with considerable success along the dustier ways of the Law.  He did not make the reputation of a great light, neither did he display great powers of advocacy, but his opinion on matters relating to Maritime and Insurance Law was held to be worth having.  If not marked as a rising man, he was accounted intelligent; moreover, he married and professed himself a Conservative; yet when, well over his fortieth year, he “took silk,” there seemed but little chance of great promotion for him.  He addressed himself, however, to the political avenues, and twice failed to represent Rochdale, and that, of course, gave him a claim to the gratitude of his Party.  In 1866, however, Helston returned him to Parliament, and although he achieved no great distinction there as a statesman, he attracted Mr. Disraeli’s attention, so that when eighteen months later much legal patronage fell in, and it became necessary to cast about for Conservative lawyers, he was made Solicitor-General.  Six months after this he renounced the Parliamentary career by accepting a puisne judgeship, and he had barely settled himself in the seat of justice when from that serene haven he beheld the crushing defeat of his former Party at a general election.''

''As a Judge Sir William has shown himself strong, ready, and always able to take a firm grasp of any case before him in all of its aspects.  He relies entirely upon himself, forms and adheres very strongly to his own opinion, and seeks always to be final, complete, and sufficient in the decision of the Court over which he presides.  Yet he is not insensible to the spirit of the times, and his and the popular judgment of a case are often found to coincide.  It will be remembered of him that he tried the gas stokers and sentenced Colonel Baker; but he is able, frank, urbane, good-natured, well with Society, and an intimate friend of the Chancellor; and under circumstances he may become Chief-Justice.''

[[w:William_Brett%2C_1st_Viscount_Esher|William Baliol Brett]] (1815-99) was indeed “sent through” Westminster and Lincoln’s Inn, but not Oxford.  He was a Caius man, an accomplished boxer, known there as “Bella Brett” for his silk waistcoats. He rowed three years for the C.U.B.C:  against Leander in 1837 and 1838, when that club was still based in London, and against Oxford in 1839 for the third Boat Race (the first for the newly-formed O.U.B.C.).  He also won the Grand at Henley in 1841 as stroke for the “Cambridge Subscription Rooms,” a London-based private club for Cantabs.

Though &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; mistook Oxford for Cambridge in Brett’s background and omitted his rowing exploits entirely, it did fairly well project his later career.  Within months of his 1876 appearance in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, Brett was elevated to the court of appeals (the Appellate Jurisdiction Act of 1876 having opened the slot at a convenient time) and in 1883 became Master of the Rolls.  He became Baron Esher of Surrey in 1885 and on retirement in 1897 was made Viscount Esher, the highest dignity for judicial service since the time of Coke attained by any judge other than a chancellor.  He died May 24, 1899, two months after his grandson and fellow rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, William Dudley-Ward, rowed No. 7 in the Cambridge crew that ended a nine-year run by Oxford in the Boat Race.

=== The 1838 Cambridge v. Leander Boat Race ===
[[Image:Brett_WB_1836.jpg|thumb|right]]
Oxford won the first Boat Race, held at Henley in 1829.  Cambridge won the second in 1836, from Westminster to Putney.  In 1837, Oxford challenged designating Henley as the venue; Cambridge, with W.B. Brett in the crew, countered-offered London; but the parties were unable to agree and no race occurred.  Cambridge then challenged Leander, at the time the leading London amateur club, to a Westminster to Putney race with “gentlemen” steerers and no fouling permitted.  Leander accepted on condition they could use their favored waterman steerer, James Parish.  Cambridge agreed and located a London waterman of their own, William Noulton, who had steered for Westminster in 1836.  In the event Cambridge came from behind to win by seven seconds in a clean race.  The next year, Leander challenged and the race went off on the same terms, but with much fouling on both sides and Leander first past the post.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Bell's Life&lt;/span&gt;, the sporting paper, reported that “[t]he judgment displayed, more particularly by the Leander, in the art of fouling, and the science and tact show by both coxswains, were really beyond conception.”  However, due to the fouling the umpire declared the race no contest, so Brett wrote on behalf of his crew to Leander requesting a re-row.  Leander declined, stating they rejected the umpire’s decision and viewed themselves the winner.  This launched a lively correspondence that led nowhere, other than  that “this unfortunate result must have strengthened the University men in their determination to keep clear of professionals,” in R.C. Lehmann’s account.{{ref|Lehmann}}   Here is one of Brett’s entries, bringing his undergraduate legal acumen to bear:

''Sir, -- In answer to your letter I can only state to you a few facts connected with the late race.  Upon receipt of your challenge to “row the Cambridge crew upon as late a date as they could possibly name,” they appointed for that purpose the 14th June, which day was accepted by you.  Upon their arrival in London, you stated that many of your crew wished to attend the Ascot races on that day; that you consequently could not row then, and would not row afterwards.  They, considering this match not as one rowed for any large stakes, but merely entered into from a spirit of honorable competition, in which either party would rather give than accept an advantage, did, notwithstanding their great want of practice in London, yield in all things to your wishes.''

''Upon starting for the match we were at first, as in the former year, left behind; but on coming up to you at the Horseferry we most unexpectedly found ourselves against a barge on one side and your boat on the other, fully proving that Parish had closed upon us, and not left us room to proceed on our proper course.  Noulton, upon this, was anxious to proceed also to waterman’s practice, and so endeavour to break the rudder of your boat.  We, however, thinking that there might have been some accident in the case, insisted upon backing water, and yielding the Middlesex side of the river to you.  This we did, gave you a considerable start, pulled up to you on the Surrey side, and were again crossed.  We still insisted upon Noulton yielding to you; but at the Red House, finding all hope of being allowed to pass useless, and convinced that you were sanctioning your steerer’s conduct, we told him to run into you, and there broke your oar, etc.  We now asked the Umpire whether the race was fair or foul, and upon his answering that it was foul we put up our oars to claim the match.''

''Our own boat was, at this time, half full of water; but seeing that you had procured a new oar, and had rowed away about 200 yards, we again started after you, and pulled up to you in less than half a mile.  After Chelsea Bridge we again left you, and actually crossed and recrossed the river, to try whether or not you would allow us to pass.  Being again crossed within ten yards of Wandsworth Meadows, the wrong side of the river, we gave you a last start, and ran into you as you passed through Putney Bridge.''

''Knowing all these circumstances in our own boat, and having felt the tremendous labour of starting a heavy eight-oared boat some seven or eight times in one day, which your crew had not to do, we cannot but feel greatly astonished at your claim to “have won the match,” or at your affecting to doubt which is the superior crew.''

''As far as the technical claim is concerned, we have never heard that an Umpire’s decision could be disputed; and knowing of no other authority to which two rival crews could refer their claims, we feel it, of course, perfectly useless to enter into any further correspondence.''

''I remain, Sir, your obedient servant (for the Cambridge crew), WM. BALIOL BRETT.{{ref|Brett}}''

In 1839, the newly-formed O.U.B.C. challenged the C.U.B.C. to a third University Boat Race.  It was Westminster to Putney, in the Easter vacation, with gentleman steerers, no fouling permitted.  “Cambridge still had the better organisation and more material from which to choose; besides, their style had been much improved during the past two years by their Leander matches, and by the coaching which they had in the meantime received from Noulton and other London watermen,” reported the 1929 Official Centenary History.  “The race was as hollow as it well could be:  from start to finish Oxford were never in it, and Cambridge won in a common canter by upwards of a minute and a half, in 31 min. 0 sec.”{{ref|Drinkwater}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Boscawen, Evelyn (''Viscount Falmouth'') == 

=== “Never Bets” (Spy), September 1, 1877 ===

[[Image:Boscawen_E_Vanity_Fair_1877-09-01.jpg|thumb|right]]''The Boscawens are a fine old Cornish family which has for centuries furnished to the State distinguished soldiers, sailors, and statesmen, and Lord Falmouth was born with the stuff in him to make him a credit to his ancestry, even had he been restricted to that commoner’s career to which he seemed born eight-and-fifty years ago.  At Eton he was a noted “wet-bob” and won the “pulling sweeps,” and while at Christ Church he continued his rowing, and was chiefly instrumental in founding the Henley Regatta.  He next read Law at the Middle Temple, married Lady Le Despencer, a maiden baroness in her own right, and turned his attention to his favourite pursuit of agriculture.  In this he was very successful, and when, in 1852, he succeeded to the title, on the death of his cousin, he removed his breeding-stock to Tregothnan and still further increased his successes.  His cattle and flocks became renowned throughout England, he has won prizes with them at almost every meeting in the country; and this very year his bull, “the only Jones,” swept the board at Bath as the best bull of any breed there.''


	''Lord Falmouth is, however, even better known as a breeder and runner of racehorses, and in this also his energy and judgment have made him pre-eminent; while the fact that he has for nearly thirty years won races without losing a friend shows him to be possessed of some very rare qualities.  When he first appeared on the Turf it was under the assumed name of “Mr. Valentine,” and as such he won the Thousand Guineas in 1862 with “Hurricane,” and the Oaks of the following year with “Queen Bertha,” an occasion on which he wagered and lost the only sixpence he has ever betted.  Throwing off his alias, he now transferred his horses to Newmarket, to which he has ever since remained faithful.  He won the Derby with “Kingcraft” in 1870, and again this year with “Silvio”; both these horses having, strangely enough, run third for the Two Thousand Guineas previous to the Derby, behind the horses whom they subsequently defeated.  Many other victories than these he has achieved, but he eschews handicaps, avoids overworking his two-year-olds, and altogether declines to race on a Sunday, thereby depriving himself of all chance of winning any of the great French races.''


	''Lord Falmouth is remarkable as being the one remaining representative of that original idea of horse-racing, which was to pit one man’s success against another’s in breeding horses; for all the racers which have carried his colours have been bred by himself.  Moreover, he has kept his name as a gentleman should, but as few can upon the Turf, untarnished by so much as a whisper of suspicion; and he never bets.''


	''With the qualities of patience, judgment, honesty, and perseverance which he has displayed in these pursuits, he might have made himself foremost and trusted as a leader of men in public affairs; and it is to be regretted that he has never taken an active part in politics, which cry aloud for men of his stamp.  As a landlord, however, he has made himself to be loved and trusted, and it was and still is a wonder to the world why he was not, twenty years ago, made Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall.''



	Evelyn Boscawen (1819-89) rowed in the 1837 Eton eight that lost to Westminster.  According to The Eton Boating Book, “It was the first time the Westminsters ever beat the Etonians.  This was almost the last time the King [William IV] appeared in public, and the Eton boys believed that their defeat was the immediate cause of the King’s illness.”{{ref|Eton}}   At Oxford, Boscawen rowed No. 6 for the Oxford Etonians (with S.H. Northcote at No. 2) in the Grand Challenge Cup in 1839 and 1840.  This apparently was the basis for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s assertion of his being “chiefly instrumental in founding the Henley Regatta,” though in later years he was a steward as well.{{ref|Burnell}} 


	After Oxford, Boscawen became a non-practising barrister, a gentleman farmer, and a peer, who grossed more than £300,000 over his life from horse racing.  From 1872 to 1883 he never won less than  £10,000 per year, with £38,000 in 1878 the most ever won by a single owner.  As for the sixpence:  he bet his trainer’s wife that his mare Queen Bertha would not win the 1863 Oaks; on winning the race and losing the bet, then-Lord Falmouth made good by presenting the coin as a brooch set in diamonds.  Besides the caricature featured here, Lord Falmouth also appeared in a group of turf and racing figures in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s  December 6, 1887 Winter Number, entitled “Tattersall’s, Newmarket.”


=== Gambling and Aquatic Nobbling ===


Like the turf, the Boat Race was a favorite for Victorian gambling.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 1, 1871):


[[Image:Henley_Regatta-Watermen's_Wager_1841.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Henley Regatta wagering poster, 1841]]''We have seen the last of the practice of the eights, and almost as soon as this number of the FAIR sees publicity we shall have seen also the race and its result.  We never remember a greater excitement than on the present occasion, and never such an infusion of the gambling element as is now unfortunately introduced as a leading feature in the entertainment.  City speculators plunge as greedily on light and dark blue as on cotton or indigo; and having never seen either crew in their lives, nor having even succeeded in feathering a scull, gravely tell you that it is a “real good thing” this way or that; that they know on the “very best authority” that A and B in the Oxford boat can’t stay, or C and D of the Cantabs are lamentably over-trained.  As for the “ring,” they quote the odds as formally as prices for the Chester Cup and Derby, and only lament that there is no such luck as a possibility of “squaring” it -- judging charitably University probity by their own.''


[[Image:Mystery_of_the_Boat_House_Tip-Top_Weekly_1906-04-28.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&quot;Barely was the shell placed in the water, when, with a muffled report, a sudden geyser shot upward, drenching the boys. A ragged hole was torn in the bottom of the boat.&quot;]]''This gambling is a serious evil; without raising the abstract question of morality, it puts University men on thorns, lest unscrupulous speculators, finding that they cannot buy or square the crews, should attempt to “nobble” them as a last resource.  We more than suspect that this sort of game has been planned, though futilely, before now.  We remember how in ‘67, when Oxford were hot favourites, ugly rumours came to our ears from private sources as to whereabouts in the course a boat was provided to run into Oxford, should they be leading.  Forewarned, the presidents were forearmed, and though at the expected place a suspicious-looking craft shot erratically into the track, both boats were wide off shore, Cambridge the nearer of the two, and mischief, if intended, was averted.  This year Cambridge are public favourites, and the ring are “fielding” at the odds.  If any attack is planned, it will be against the light blue, but we sincerely trust that the guard of police at the boat-houses, and in police boats during the race, will suffice to overawe any such villainy.''


Forty years later, “Cambrioleur” told an apocryphal tale in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (March 27, 1912) of an inside job in one of the Cambridge college May races:


''Centuries ago there was a misguided youth at St. Abbs Hall, the son of an American commission agent, who determined to turn an honest penny out of the boat -racing.  Under the guidance of friends, who, I fear, judged his leg to be suitable for elongation, he opened a book on the Mays.  As soon as the college was aware of this the entire eight, with their cox, came to him secretly by night, one at a time, and asked him what odds he would give against them staying head of the river.  He started with cox at evens, but before he had got to bow he was giving three to one.  They all invested half-a-crown against their boat.  The thing seemed a dead cert. for him after that.  When the rest of the college rolled up to back their boat he cheerfully gave them five to one.  He booked nearly a hundred bets in sovereigns on those terms.  Of course, the boat stayed head -- in fact, it did the course in record time, and the precocious layer found that he had to balance nine half-crowns against five hundred sovereigns.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Waddington, William Henry == 

=== “France at the Congress” (T.), September 28, 1878 ===

[[Image:Waddington_WH_Vanity_Fair_1878-09-28.jpg|thumb|right]]''Not very long ago an Englishman settled himself in France with a view to trade.  M. Waddington is one of the descendants of this emigrant.  He was educated in England, has English notions and an English aspect, but he entirely declines to be considered English, and glories in the name of Frenchman.  Born two-and-fifty years ago, he has devoted a great part of his life and abilities to the study of old coins and of ancient history, for the sake of which he made a voyage into Greece and Asia Minor.  He has also taken a considerable part in politics, and when a National Assembly was hastily called together in 1871 in order to raise the ransom and get rid of the Germans, he was elected for the Aisne.  He adopted himself into the Right Centre, gained much confidence from many men, and at length, partly by merit and partly by accident, became the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French Republic.  He is an excellent man of business and a steady politician, and being somewhat tiresome and professorial in his utterances, he is held to be one of the few statesmen who are to be trusted.  He represented France at the Congress of Berlin.''


	[[w:William_Henry_Waddington|William Henry Waddington]] (1826-94) went to school at Dr. Arnold’s Rugby, and then to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he rowed for Second Trinity in the Grand, Ladies’, Stewards’, and Visitors’ in 1849.  Waddington also rowed No. 6 in the first of the two 1849 Boat Races, the only year in which the race occurred twice, in a  Cambridge crew consisting entirely of Trinity men.


	After university Waddington returned to France to become a naturalized citizen like his father, spending the 1850s as an archaeologist specializing in Asia Minor.  In the 1860s he turned to politics and, after two unsuccessful attempts for the chamber of deputies, was elected in 1871, then to the senate in 1876, and became Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1877.  His performance from that last position, at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, was rewarded with the appearance in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.


[[Image:Waddington.jpg|thumb|right]]In 1879, newly-elected President Jules Grévy chose Waddington to become Premier, not for his success at Berlin but because the alternative, Léon Gambetta, posed too much a political threat.  Waddington took the job but retained his Foreign Affairs post, focusing his efforts on Egypt and the Balkans.  He was forced to resign in December 1879 when Jules Ferry, a member of his cabinet, created sufficient controversy by introducing measures drastically to reduce the influence of the Catholic church on education.  Waddington was ambassador to Great Britain from 1883 to 1893, and died in Paris on January 13, 1894, a week after losing his Senate seat in the election.


	As a Rugby alumnus, Cambridge rowing blue, and senior French official, Waddington played a significant albeit indirect role in launching the modern Olympic games, first held in Athens in 1896.  He knew Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who became the first President of the modern Olympics and is generally viewed as the father of the movement.  Through him, Waddington encouraged French crews to enter the 1891 Henley Regatta.{{ref|Cleaver}}   Waddington may also have caused de Coubertin’s visit to Rugby, feeding the notion of international exchange through sport.  Thus one senses Waddington’s handiwork in the Baron’s maiden speech on point, at the November 25, 1892 meeting of the Athletic Sports Union at the Sorbonne:  “Let us export oarsmen, runners, fencers; there is the free trade of the future -- and on the day when it shall take its place among the customs of Europe, the cause of peace will have received a new and powerful support.”{{ref|Baron}}

=== The Thames Conservancy ===


In the early days of the Boat Race, umpires did their duty from boats powered by watermen.  With the advent of steamers, watermen were retired from service but river traffic multiplied, causing occasional interference.  The Thames Conservancy, formed that year to address such problems as pollution, which by 1857 had made the metropolitan river “the largest navigable sewer in the world,” was given the further power in 1868 to clear the course for racing.{{ref|various}}   As with most regulation, this made the situation both better and worse:  better, because the Conservancy prevented steamers from washing the crews as happened to A.L. Smith in 1859; worse, because it did not always act in complete harmony with the wishes of the university boat clubs.  W.B. Woodgate laid out his views in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 2, 1870):


[[File:1870 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Boat Race, 1870]]''Whatever may have been in previous years the good offices of the Thames Conservancy in securing a free course for University boat-races, their good deeds are now more than nullified by the officious dictation of which they have this year been guilty toward the Presidents of the two U.B.C.’s.  Taking advantage of their autocracy upon the Thames, they have not only put a restriction upon the steamers that limits them to a lower number than has ever been known and sanctioned at any previous Oxford and Cambridge race, but they have gone the length of ordering steamers at the expense of the Universities, at the very time that they dictate who shall and who shall not be allowed on board the same.''


	''Steamers can never be said to benefit the rowing of a University boat per se.  An umpire could be carried in a twelve-oar, or in a small steam-launch, such as the Ariel, thus avoiding all possibility of draw and “suck” from the paddles of accompanying passenger steamers.  But the Universities have never grudged to their own members, who have an interest in, and who supply the funds for, the race, the privilege of accompanying the crews at a respectful distance; nor have they debarred the public from a similar enjoyment within due limits.  It is for them to say how many steamers they wish to follow the race; and, so long as these steamers are compatible with safety, the Conservancy have no moral right to deny them.  In the Harvard race there were only two steamers, because Harvardians in England were few, and it might have been said that a preponderance of Oxonians in extra steamers was unfair, and inflicting a “suck” upon both boats, for the accommodation of the friends of one side only.''


	''But, that race being past and gone, there is no reason why the limit of steamers should not be, as in former years, subject to the approval of the Universities.  If they do not object, it can matter little to the Conservancy, unless the latter plead that steamboats are reckless, and may collide and cause a catastrophe.  There is some slight ground for this argument, for, though last year all steamers but one behaved themselves, there was one evildoer, and that one the steamer which conveyed the magnates themselves of the Conservancy, and who, not content with jostling the umpire against Barnes Bridge, to the alarm of the umpire’s cargo, steamed ahead of him, and shut him out of all view of the finale of the race.''


	''However, allowing that the Conservancy are autocratic to decide in the question of safety, and to assume that other steamers will very probably behave as badly as they themselves did last year, at least it would seem fair that if steamers are to incommode the race, they should do so for the benefit only of those concerned in the match, and not for mere outsiders, who have no part nor interest in it or its result.  But though there are some forty captains of college boat-clubs, and some two dozen resident oarsmen who have been tried for the very race in question, and who may be said more than any others to represent the interests of the rest of the Universities, they are one and all summarily ejected from the steamers by the Conservancy, and their places assigned to the public -- i.e., to their representatives, the Press.''


	''The race is strictly a private one; it is only the public who choose to make it one of public interest, and often to create a nuisance by the extent of their unsolicited zeal.  But though none would be more willing than the Presidents to offer, as a piece of courtesy, a certain proportionate share of the accommodation at their disposal to the press, that is no reason why they should be compelled, without choice in the matter, to receive any audience which the Conservancy choose to thrust upon them, to the exclusion of their own friends and allies, who help to pay the piper, but are not suffered to call the tune.''


Woodgate returned to the subject a week later (April 9, 1870), hoping to leverage widespread following of the Boat Race, with which he was never too comfortable, into a populist revolt against the Thames Conservancy:


''The Universities are chartered and reputed “seats of learning,” yet during the current term their main association, in the eyes of the British public, has been simply that of muscular Christianity.  The University intelligence which has found most favour in the eyes of the country cousins, parents, and guardians, has been not the councils of the “Hebdomadal,” or resolutions of Convocation, but training reports from the banks of the Cam or Isis; and for one enthusiastic and right-minded reader who can tell the names of the Senior Wrangler or Ireland Scholar of the term, there are hundreds with whom the names Goldie and Darbishire have been household words.''


	''Like sheep to a gap, the British populace pours, in greater numbers year after year, to swelter on Hammersmith Bridge; to herd in masses on the tow path, regardless of the rising tide which threatens to infringe the rights of the Great Unwashed; or to pay ten shillings a-head for nose room and three minutes’ glimpse from a garret window at Chiswick or Barnes.''


	''And what they go out into the desert for to see, the wisest of them can hardly tell.  Personal interest they have none, unless they have bets upon the race; personal comfort, under the circumstances just described, the most sanguine would hardly hope to find; even the picnic, which is the redeeming point of a Derby-day saturnalia, cannot well exist between Putney and Mortlake, from sheer want of elbow-room.  However, they come, and they go, and they seem to enjoy themselves; and trade of all sorts, of rail, of road, of haberdashers, carpenters, et hoc genus omne, undoubtedly reaps the benefit of a private sport that national eccentricity has usurped almost as a public property; and the lesson to be read, therefore, is that if the public wish to continue to reap this benefit, and enjoy this festival as heretofore, they must raise their vox populii to support the Universities in enjoying in their turns their due rights, and in resisting the dictatorial and impertinent encroachments of the Thames Conservancy.''


	''Their conduct was fully dilated upon last week in our FAIR, and since it still remains in statu quo, or rather has now added the deed to previously announced will, there is no need to say more of them than that if they in their hypocrisy still profess goodwill towards University boat-racing, the University Boat Clubs may rightly pray to be saved from their friends.''

=== “The Head” (Spy), January 31, 1901 ===

[[Image:Hornby_JJ_Vanity_Fair_1901-01-31.jpg|thumb|right]]''Third son of Admiral Sir Phipps Hornby and brother of the late Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby, he was born at Winwick four-and-seventy years ago; and he is still vigourous testimony to the wholesomeness of the English Public School.  So well did Dr. Hawtrey lay in the foundation of his knowledge at Eton that he is now its Provost:  after a course of Balliol, which made him a First Class-man.  He played cricket and rowed in the ‘Varsity Eight with the late Lord Justice Chitty and with Bishop Patterson; and he is still a member of the Alpine Club.  Having been elected a Fellow of B.N.C., he went to Durham as Principal of Bishop Cosin’s Hall:  yet returned to B.N.C. to lecture the Classics into younger athletes; and was made Senior Proctor.  Then he went to Winchester as Second Master; whence he was chosen Head Master of our biggest Public School just three-and-thirty years ago.  Since then he has been improved into a Queen’s Chaplain, a Doctor of Civil Law, and (in the nature of things) into the Provost of Eton and Chairman of its Governing Body:  whose health is so good as to preclude any idea of his retiring.  Yet he is really a very retiring man who keeps himself very much to himself, although he has courteous manners and a charming smile.''


	''He was always athletic, and even now he is an excellent dancer and a very fine skater, whose bag of skates is almost as well known as himself.  He can preach an admirable sermon, and he is almost unrivalled in the art of after-dinner speaking:  his oratory being no less witty than it is eloquent.  He can also tell a good story; and it is told of himself that he has not unsympathetically urged a boy who was to undergo punishment to bear it.  As a schoolmaster he was fortunate; for during his term of Head Mastership Eton flourished as exceedingly as even the inventor of its motto could have wished:  the standard of work being higher than it had ever been before.  Altogether he is identified with Eton as a good fellow no less than as a wholesome gentleman.''


	''He taught Eton the art of self-government.''


	John James Hornby (1826-1909), unlike most of the other thirty-one Etonian rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, did not row at school; he was a cricketer.  But he picked it up well on arrival at Balliol in 1845, for he rowed bow for Oxford in the second Boat Race of 1849 (which Oxford won on a foul by bumping Cambridge when Cambridge were in Oxford’s water), and was No. 3 in the O.U.B.C. crews that won the Grand in 1850 and 1851, there being no tideway Boat Race either year.  In 1850, having become a Fellow of Brasenose, he won the University Pairs and Fours, and the Goblets (with J.W. Chitty) at Henley.  In 1851 he rowed again for B.N.C. in the Ladies’, Stewards’, and Visitors’, and went Head of the River at Oxford in 1852. 


	Hornby might not have become headmaster of Eton in 1868, at age forty-one, but for the work of S.H. Northcote.  In 1862, Northcote joined the royal commission on the administration of the public schools.  On release of the commission report in 1864, Northcote argued that Parliament could deal not with studies or management, but with endowments, the constitution of governing bodies, and the removal of restrictions, among them the generations-old tradition that the Eton headmaster hale from King’s College, Cambridge.  By 1868, that restriction was gone and the headmastership increased in independent authority, which Hornby was the first to exercise:  hence he “taught Eton the art of self-government.”  He kept a progressive rather than radical hand on the reins, but did not shirk from corporal punishment.  Guy Nickalls, at Eton in the early 1880s, recalled:  “In spite of the swishings I got, I liked the headmaster, Hornby, the perfectly mannered and sonorously-voiced old English gentleman.  Handsome, alert, witty, a great athlete in his day, a good judge of wine, and the finest after-dinner speaker I ever listened to, with a charm of manner I have never forgotten.”{{ref|Nickalls}} 


	Hornby retired to the dignified and less arduous post of provost in 1884, succeeded by the more famous Etonian and Balliol oarsman, Edmond Warre.  It was a tip to Hornby’s former responsibilities that &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; capitioned his 1901 lithograph, “The Head.”  He remained provost until his death in 1909, to be succeeded again by Warre. 


=== The War of the Ribbons ===


As the first mass spectator sport, rowing became hard news.{{ref|Wigglesworth}}   By the 1860s newspapers followed the crews for weeks before the race, and the public showed its enthusiasm by thronging the banks to watch their favorite crew in practice and wear its color ribbon.  In some places, such as the unnamed school Ralph Dundas attended, the light blue and dark mixed badly, oil and vinegar, as he recalled for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (March 24, 1910):


[[Image:Oxford_college_jerseys_1_of 6.jpg|right|400px|]][[Image:Oxford_college_jerseys_2_of 6.jpg|right|400px|]] [[Image:Oxford_college_jerseys_3_of 6.jpg|right|400px|]] [[Image:Oxford_college_jerseys_4_of 6.jpg|right|400px|]] [[Image:Oxford_college_jerseys_5_of 6.jpg|right|400px|]] [[Image:Oxford_college_jerseys_6_of_6.jpg|95px|right|]]  ''When I hear grown-up people discussing the University Boat Race I smile sadly and hold my peace.  They may say what they like about the latest Oxford trial, or the average weight per man of the Cambridge crew, but deep in my heart there stays the conviction that they are making a ludicrous mistake in speaking about the Boat Race at all.  Once I knew all about it, and even now I think I could put them right if I wished.  But what is the use of arguing with persons who, under the absurd pretext of fairness, pretend to find praiseworthy features in both crews?  Even the smallest boy knew better than that in the days when the Boat Race was really important.  I will not say that there did not exist weaklings even then, who wobbled between Oxford and Cambridge in an endeavour to propitiate both factions.  But they usually suffered the fate of wobblers by having to join one side or the other, while still incurring the scorn of both.''


	''The Boat Race dawned upon us each year as a strange and bewildering element in our social relationships.  We would part one night on normal terms, and the morrow would find us wearing strange favours, and regarding our friends of yesterday with open and passionate dislike.  For the sake of a morsel of coloured ribbon old friendships would be shattered and brother would greet brother with ingenious expressions of contempt.  There was no moderate course in the matter.   A boy was either vehemently Cambridge or intolerably Oxford, and it would have been easier to account for the colour of his hair than to explain how he arrived at his choice of a University.  Some blind instinct, some subtle influence felt, perhaps, in the dim far-off nursery days may have determined this weighty choice; but the whole problem was touched with the mystery that inspired the great classical and modern snowball fights, when little boys would pound each other almost into a state of unconsciousness for the sake of a theory of education.  Our interest in the Boat Race as a boat race was small, and quite untroubled by any knowledge of the respective merits of the crews.  But we wore their colours in our buttonholes, and the effect of these badges on our lives was anarchic.  We saw blue.''


	''It was my fate to drift, fatally and immutably Cambridge, into a school that had a crushing Oxford majority.  In these circumstances, the light-blue ribbon became, for the small and devoted band that upheld the Cambridge tradition of valour, the cause of endless but never conclusive defeats, the symbol of a splendid martyrdom.  Try as we might, we found ourselves always in a minority, and, to add to our bitterness, these years of luckless warfare coincided with a series of Cambridge defeats, and we knew ourselves the supporters of a forlorn and discredited cause.  And yet, Fate having decreed that we should be Cambridge, we did not falter before our hopeless task of convincing the majority that it was made of baser stuff than we.  We would arrive in the morning with our colours stitched to our coats, and when, overwhelmed by numbers, we lost our dear favours we would retire to a place apart, repair the loss from a secret store of ribbon, and dash once more into the fray.  The others might be Oxford when they had a mind to, but we were Cambridge -- Cambridge all the time.''


	''Our contests were always fierce, but only once so far as I remember did they become really venomous.  Some ingenious Cambridge mind had hit on the idea of protecting his badge with a secret battery of pins, and there ensued a series of real and desperate fights that threatened our clan with physical extinction.  The trouble passed as suddenly as it had arisen; a mysterious rumour went round the clans that pins were bad form; there was a lull while Cambridge treated their black eyes, and Oxford put sticking plaster on their torn fingers.  Pleasanter to remember is the famous retort of L_____, an utterance so finely dramatic that even to-day I cannot recall it without a thrill.  Caught apart from his comrades, he was surrounded by the Oxford rabble, and robbed of his colours.  “You aren’t Cambridge now,” said one of his assailants, mockingly.  “Ah, but the sky is Cambridge!” he replied, and indeed it was.  We had our little victories to dull the edge of our defeats.''


	''And yet, probably, we of Cambridge were not altogether sorry when the Boat Race was over, and the business might be forgotten for another eleven months, for we had but little rest while the war of the ribbons was in the air.  If we sought to take quiet walk round the quad, the chance was that a boy, too small perhaps to keep a favour even for a minute, but with a light-blue heart, would run up with tidings of some comrade hardly beset in the cloisters, and the battle must be begun again.  These contests were sometimes the cause of temporary friendships, for in the course of the tumult one would find oneself indebted to a year-long enemy for the timely discomfiture of one’s opponent, who in his turn might be, normally, one’s bosom companion.  For no tie was sacred enough to overcome this vernal madness of the Blues.  If a fellow was base enough to be Oxford his presence in the world was unnecessary, his society tabooed.  And, as I have said, even brothers would bang each others’ heads for the beauty of the Idea.''


''Then came a day when age and responsibility changed our views on a good many things, and the Boat Race was not spared.  Forgetful of the old triumphs and the old despairs, we preferred to treat ourselves and life in more sober terms, while smiling tolerantly at the little boys playing their rough games beneath our feet.  Leaning forward with hands eager to clutch our manhood, we would not for worlds have compromised our new position by taking an interest in such childish trifles as coloured ribbons.  So the game went on without us, and the measure of our loss is the measure of the loss of the earth when the spring melts into summer.''


	''To-day I hear persons discussing the Boat Race in railway carriages, and in face of their dispassionate judgments I ask myself whether they can ever have sung for it and fought for it, and, let it be added, wept for it, as I have done.  In truth, I suppose they have; for boys do not differ widely in these essential things.  But these people do not fight; they do not even wear the ribbon!  While it is open to a man to ignore the Boat Race altogether, I cannot understand his approaching the contest in so miserable a spirit.''

Stars, by astronomical definition, are massive luminous balls of plasma. They exist in numbers too large to comprehend, and most are believed to be accompanied by a system of planets. The planet [[General Astronomy/Earth|Earth]] is part of the [[General Astronomy/The Sun|Sun]]'s solar system of 8 planets, the Sun being the nearest star to Earth. The Sun provides most of Earth's energy, and is critical to the survival of all forms of life on the planet. 

Over the history of mankind, human views of the stars have differed greatly. Historically, the stars have existed as major figments in the mythological canon of many cultures, and were seen as objects of mystery and speculation. The Sun in particular has been the object of great cultural, religious and theoretical importance and speculation and has, more specifically, been a central point of debate in arguments relating to the topography and geography of the solar system itself.

The stars have also been great use. Seafarers and fisherman have historically used the patterns of the stars on the night sky as a vast and accurate kind of map. Many civilizations tracked their movements and channeled their findings into calendars, which in turn would determine agricultural practices.

In recent centuries, scientific views of the stars have become much more advanced, following the invention and continual advancement of the telescope, and the discovery of various techniques and ways to assess the various properties of a star.

In the following topic regarding stars, we explore several key aspects of stars, their properties, the continual advancement of our knowledge of these heavenly bodies, and what their place is in the [[General Astronomy/The Big Picture|universe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Editors, Authors, and Artists of VANITY FAIR ==
&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; ran from 1868 to 1914, but by no means was the same magazine at the beginning, the middle, and the end.  A succession of editors, authors, and artists, competition from imitators and other journals, changing tastes, advances in photography and publishing technology -- the whole sweep of a near half-century -- all left their stamp.  As this general history has been well-written elsewhere,{{ref|various}}  a slimmer version will suffice here with special attention to those aspects specific to rowing.  A sample issue -- July 20, 1889, when Guy Nickalls appeared -- is reproduced in full as an appendix.

[[Image:Thomas_Gibson_Bowles00.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Tommy,&quot; Vanity Fair, October 19, 1905]][[w:Thomas_Gibson_Bowles|Thomas Gibson Bowles]] (1842-1922) created, owned, and for the most part edited &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; for its first twenty years.  The illegitimate child of a Liberal M.P., Bowles grew up in his father’s household witnessing a parade of literary and society figures at dinner parties and other functions.  He attended neither a famous public school nor university but at nineteen got a minor position with the Board of Trade, of which his father was then President.  From that perch he dabbled in journalism and amateur theater, wrote plays and contributed to satirical society magazines, and made friends with emerging journalists, lawyers, politicians, military officers, and actors.  Eight years later, in 1868, Bowles chucked the Board of Trade to launch &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; as a weekly for the “hupper suckles” encoded with “the passwords of Society.”{{ref|Journalist}}   To T.H.S. Escott, an historian of Fleet Street writing in 1911, Bowles “not only brought in the society journal as an institution:  he invented its very name”; &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; became “the real parent of all subsequent growths in that department of journalism at a date when it seemed as fashionable to run a weekly sheet for one’s friends as to endow a theatre for one’s mistress.”{{ref|Escott}}   Leslie Ward, who contributed portraits to the magazine for nearly forty years, thought Bowles “the best editor the paper ever had.  He had the gift of the right word in the right place; and it may be remarked that a dislike of Dickens prevented any quotations from that well-known author from entering the pages.”{{ref|Ward1}}   Likewise novelist and playwright Max Pemberton, who began his career at &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; in 1885 after rowing at Caius, considered Bowles “a very martinet when a man’s style of writing was to be judged.”{{ref|Pemberton}} 

Among Bowles’ initial contributors and compatriots was '''Walter Bradford Woodgate''' (1840-1920).  Woodgate went up to to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1858 where he lingered well into the 1860s, mainly on the river.  He won the University Pairs three times, the Sculls twice, rowed in the Boat Race twice (1862 and 1863, winning both), won the Grand Challenge Cup in 1865, the Stewards’ Challenge Cup in 1862, the Diamond Sculls in 1864, the Goblets in 1861-63, 1866, and 1868, and the Wingfield Sculls in 1862, 1864, and 1867.  By entering for the Diamonds in 1866 under a false name, and for having his coxswain jump overboard at the start of the 1868 Stewards’ to lighten his Brasenose four, Woodgate caused the adoption of Henley Regatta rules specifically prohibiting such conduct.  When coxswains were dropped from the Stewards’ in 1873, “he won his moral victory,” the Rowing Almanack later recalled.  “Nothing but defeating a railway in an action at law could have given him so much pleasure.”{{ref|Almanac}} 

[[Image:W.B._Woodgate_1921.jpg|thumb|right|W.B. Woodgate, Rowing Almanac, 1921]]Woodgate’s major non-aquatic accomplishment at Oxford was the founding in 1863 of Vincent’s Club (named for the landlord who rented the rooms), in reaction against the Union Society.  The Union at the time barred smoking and drinking and, in Woodgate’s view, “went through the farce of socially ‘vetting’ every candidate, and after all, passing all sorts and conditions of men as ‘sound,’ despite notorious antecedents.”{{ref|Woodgate1}}   So he and his friends made Vincent’s selective (“a magic number -- 100 -- to give prestige”) and offered beer, tea, and coffee, all for free lest the proctors intervene were drinks “for sale.”{{ref|Woodgate2}}    An immediate success, Vincent’s climbed straight to the top of the undergraduate social heap.  Among its later presidents were &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rowers Bankes, Nickalls, and Cotton.

A lifelong bachelor, Woodgate was called to the bar in 1872.  He practiced for forty years but took neither the law nor anything else save rowing too seriously.  He helped coach numerous Oxford crews and was president of Kingston R.C.  He wrote Oars and Sculls, and How to Use Them (1874), Boating (1888, for the Badminton Library set), Reminiscences of an Old Sportsman (1909), plus a few non-rowing works.  He contributed to &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;The Field&lt;/span&gt; for half a century, frequently “produc[ing] the leading article in a curious but flexible English, which was quite unmistakable.”{{ref|Almanac2}}   Woodgate’s writing attests to his clerical family background, classical Greek and Latin schooling, years of lawyering, and an unsuppressable urge to storytell, laced with legalisms and couplets from Horace.  He could, wrote T.A. Cook, who rowed for Oxford in 1889 with &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s Guy Nickalls, “write anything from a curate’s sermon to a leading article on the Torts of Landlords or a racy description of a prize fight and a sculling match.”{{ref|Cook}}   Take, for instance, his recollection of “screwing up” dons at University College, Oxford, in the 1860s:

''I have referred to the comparatively good feeling that existed in my time between B.N.C. dons and undergraduates, as compared to the cat and dog situation in some colleges.  At University Coll., for instance, “screwing up” was almost a terminal feature.  The technical procedure there was to screw up the oak [door] of an unpopular don with coffin nails, and then to file off the heads (in the small hours).  At chapel-time the next morning the victim (say, Lee Warner) would be heard yelling from his window for the porter, saying, “My door is fast.  I cannot open it.  What am I to do?”  The porter would stolidly reply, from below:  “Mr. Chavasse, sir, usually sends for X-----” (a local carpenter and coffin maker, who drove rather a lucrative trade in thus releasing from durance vile those dons on whom the undergraduate Vehmgericht had passed sentence).  Lee Warner obtained common room inquiry on this outrage to himself, and announced, in terrorem, that he would resign his tutorship, if the malefactors did not give in their names.  Old Dr. Plumptre, the Head, took him at his word, and clenched the resignation irrevocably so long as he lived.  He ascribed college disorder to failure of tact in dons and tried to weed duffers.{{ref|Woodgate3}}'' 

Woodgate contributed most and the best of the rowing articles to &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; from roughly 1870 to 1873 and from 1890 to 1907, using the pen name “Wat Bradford” in the ‘70s.  (Hence the inspiration for the pen name of a Wiki contributor to this 21st century compilation of the rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.)  In the intervening years, from 1874 through 1889, rowing was either ignored in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, given passing reference as an honorable chapter in the biographies of eminent men, or, with respect to Henley, discussed for who was there and how splendid were the parties.  As a weekly, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; could not compete with the sports coverage in the daily papers and thus, in those lean years without Woodgate, hardly tried.  In the 1886 Boat Race, for example, Cambridge was down by open water at Barnes Bridge but went on to win by two-thirds of a length, an unprecedented comeback.  “Never in the whole history of the Boatrace has there been a contest more thrilling to watch or more sensational in its result,” judged the Boat Race 1929 Official Centenary History.{{ref|Drinkwater}}  Yet &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s anonymous columnist simply reported (April 10, 1886):  “As I anticipated, Cambridge won the Boat Race, after one of the finest races ever seen.  But as everyone has had enough of the reporters’ gush, I will say no more about it.”  

[[Image:Pellegrinibydegas.jpg|thumb|right|Carlo Pellegrini, by Edgar Degas]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; owed its early and enduring success to its first caricaturist,[[w:Carlo_Pellegrini|Carlo Pellegrini]] (1839-89).  A native of Capua, Pellegrini left Italy for England in 1864 and spent the remaining half of his life there.  Cultivating a reputation as a bohemian bon vivant who claimed Medici lineage and to have fought with Garibaldi, Pellegrini established himself in London society as a pet and the caricaturist of the Prince of Wales’ set.  On meeting Bowles at a dinner party, Pellegrini reportedly said:  “Your paper is very bad:  I shall draw pictures for you and make you rich.”{{ref|Pemberton2}}  Whether the introduction was apocryphal or not, Bowles did engage Pellegrini to produce “some Pictorial Wares of an entirely novel character,”{{ref|VF}}  starting with Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli in the January 30, 1869 issue.  This famous thirteenth issue, which proved so popular that it went into three editions with the third selling for twice the price of the original, introduced caricature and chromolithography to the magazine as well as to the general London press.  It inaugurated between editor and artist “the same successful conjunction that in opera bouffe was presented by the co-operation of W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan.”{{ref|Escott2}}  From 1869 to until his death in 1889 Pellegrini contributed 332 more caricatures under the pen-name “Ape,” including the first two of our rowers, Stafford Henry Northcote (October 8, 1870) and William Baliol Brett (January 1, 1876).

What marked the work of Pellegrini, according to David Low, was his “the study of individual particularity, involving the mental as well as the ocular vision”; his caricatures “were maximum likenesses, that is to say they represented not only what he saw but also what he knew.”{{ref|Low}}  In this respect Pellegrini followed the French portraits chargés of Daumier and Gill, but he replaced their satiric bite with the Neopolitan good humour of Delfico, who himself eventually supplied some caricatures to &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.  When the Daily News complained that Pellegrini’s early work lacked an essential “comic” element and tended to “phantasmagoric extravagance,” “grimness,” and “grotesqueness,” Bowles denied the charge, explaining that the “original and genuine purpose” of caricature was “to charge and exaggerate” reality:  “There are grim faces made more grim, grotesque figures made more grotesque, and dull people made duller by the genius of our talented collaborator ‘Ape’; but there is nothing that has been treated with a set purpose to make it something that it was not already in a lesser degree.”{{ref|VF2}}   Pellegrini set the artistic trademark for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, and while most of his successors attempted to emulate it to varying degrees, none came close save perhaps for Max Beerbohm, who unfortunately drew no rowers.

[[Image:James_Tissot_Self_Portrait_%281865%29.jpg|thumb|right|Tissot, self-portrait, c 1865]]Among the first to substitute for Pellegrini during one of his self-imposed sabbaticals was [[w:James_Tissot|James Joseph Jacques Tissot]] (1836-1902).  Raised in Nantes, Tissot moved to Paris at age nineteen where he became a successful painter, a friend of Degas and Manet.  Bowles met Tissot there in the late 1860s and bought his series of European “Sovereigns” that &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; carried in late 1869 under the name “Coïdé.”  They met again in 1870 while Bowles covered the siege of Paris for the Morning Post.  With the collapse of the Paris Commune, Tissot fled in May 1871 to London where Bowles provided him with housing, an effective entree to London society, and some early commissions.  Those included his single rower for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, a sinister rendering of the young Radical M.P. Charles Wentworth Dilke (November 25, 1871).  With such aid and his own social and business acumen, deploying his versatile academic brush to suit demand, Tissot rejuvenated his career, at least with the purchasing public if not always with the critics.  Three years after Tissot’s arrival in England, French critic Edmond de Goncourt recorded in his journal:  “Today, Duplessis told me that Tissot, that plagiarist painter, has had the greatest success in England.  Was it not his idea, this ingenious exploiter of English idiocy, to have a studio with a waiting room where, at all times, there is iced champagne at the disposal of visitors, and around the studio, a garden where, all day long, one can see a footman in silk stockings brushing and shining the shrubbery leaves?”{{ref|Goncourt}}   Tissot produced thirty-nine portraits for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; from 1871 to 1873, ultimately sixty-two in total.

[[w:Leslie_Ward|Leslie Ward]] (1851-1922), better known as “Spy,” contributed 1325 portraits to &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; from 1873 to 1911, amounting to over half the magazine’s total and including forty-one prints of forty rowers (doing H.L.B. McCalmont twice, once in 1889 and again in 1896).  It might be thought a fitting career for a London-born Etonian whose parents were both accomplished painters, but in fact did not occur without a good dose of ambition and luck.  His father, E.M. Ward, a member of the Royal Academy, opposed an artistic career and to deflect young Leslie’s talents to a more reliable livelihood, apprenticed him to a prominent architect, Sydney Smirke (responsible among other things for the neoclassical United Oxford and Cambridge Club on Pall Mall).  Ward bore it for a year but Smirke then decided to retire and the ensuing need in 1871 to find some substitute gave Ward the chance to precipitate what he later called “a rousing scene”{{ref|Ward2}}  with his father.  With the mediation of some artist friends, drawing and painting won over architecture.  Right away, Ward was keen to be published in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;:  “[W]hen I saw the first numbers of Vanity Fair I was greatly taken with Pellegrini’s caricatures, and, having a book of drawings of similar character, had thought that if only I could get one drawing in Vanity Fair I should die happy.”{{ref|Ward3}}   The chance arose two years later when Pellegrini was off duty leaving Bowles with inadequate substitutes.  John Millais, a friend of Bowles and Ward but who never contributed to &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, selected a sketch from Ward’s portfolio and suggested that Ward redraw it to appropriate size, which he did and Bowles accepted.  But it was unsigned, so Bowles referred Ward to a dictionary to find inspiration for a pen-name for future work.   He opened it to “spy,” defined as “to observe secretly, or to discover at a distance or in concealment.”  “Just the thing,” said Bowles, and Ward used it faithfully from that point onward.{{ref|Ward4}}   Thus while Ward’s “orthodox art training . . . left him with a somewhat harder and less elastic equipment than his master [Pellegrini],”{{ref|Low2}}  his perseverance to become a society artist earned him Bowles’ confidence and eventually the majority of the available commissions.

Ward was neither a rower nor a close follower of the sport.  “I am always interested in the chances of the rival [Boat Race] crews; still, my interest was nothing out of the common,” he recalled in his 1915 memoirs.{{ref|Ward5}}   Yet “amongst my pleasantest recollections,” he added, “are those of the university-rowing men with whom I came in close contact, for in every way possible they extended their hospitality to me, and I shall always remember with pleasure my visits to Oxford and Cambridge especially during the rowing season.”{{ref|Ward6}}   This hospitality may have included patiently posing, for although Ward did indeed “spy” many of his subjects, others, particularly in the post-Bowles years, were selected by mutual consent which facilitated the lengthy study Ward needed to be able to complete a sketch.  Recalling an anonymous undergraduate in training for the Boat Race, Ward observed:  “I have found men of this rowing calibre usually wonderful sitters, being perfectly fit; this particular young man was in excellent form, so much so that he completely outstood me and said when I, at last, begged him leave to have a rest:  ‘Why I can go on standing all day without fatigue!’”{{ref|Ward7}} 

Over time, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; published the work of more than fifty other artists.  [[w:Theobald_Chartran|Théobald Chartran]] (1849-1907), a graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts and winner of the grand prix de Rome, published sixty-eight portraits in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; from 1878 to 1884, including rower W.H. Waddington.  Belgian sculptor '''François Verheyden''' (1806-99) contributed six caricatures in 1883 in connection with the ''Belt v. Lawes'' libel case with which &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; was intimately linked, including that of defendant C.B. Lawes (May 12, 1883), the Cambridge stroke of 1865.  [[w:Francis_Gould|Francis Carruthers Gould]] (1844-1925), better known for the highly inventive political cartoons that earned him a knighthood from the Liberals after the 1906 election, drew seven caricatures for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, among them that of B.J. Angle (April 5, 1890) who was, as Gould had been, a stockbroker.  '''Henry Charles Sepping Wright''' (1850-1937), a barrister “stuff gownsman” who caught fellow lawyers and judges in court, published his works under the sobriquet “Stuff” and contributed Mr. Justice Denman (November 19, 1892).  Other artists, known only by pseudonym, include “Ape Junior” (who drew R.C. Bourne, March 29, 1911), “ELF” (R.H. Forster, July 6, 1910), “Hay” (E.J.H. Smith, January 28, 1888), “Owl” (R. McKenna, April 23, 1913), “Ray” (Lord Cheylesmore, July 17, 1912), and “WH” (S.E. Swann, April 3, 1912, J. C. Carter, July 3, 1912, and F.V. Brooks, September 18, 1912).

No rowers featured as such in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; during the twenty years Bowles owned and ran it, other than Reverend Smith of Pembroke College, Cambridge, who as mentioned above was known to coach the college fifth Lent boat.  Bowles did depict a few non-rowing sportsmen (such as cricketer W.G. Grace and jockey Fred Archer) and eleven of our rowers in their then-current capacities as politician, judge, or what have you.  To show rowers ''qua'' rowers fell to Bowles’ successors, starting with '''Arthur Evans''' and '''Arthur George Witherby''' as owner and editor respectively.  Evans, the former City Editor for Bowles, reportedly used the perch mainly to manipulate the stocks in which he was interested.{{ref|Pemberton3}}  Witherby, whom Ward described as “a good sort and keen sportsman,”{{ref|Ward8}} contributed eight drawings himself under the pen-name “W.A.G.,” including that of Montague Shearman (July 4, 1895), an ex-rower better known and featured as co-founder of the Amateur Athletic Association.  On Witherby’s watch &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; began carrying one or two rowers per year, starting with Nickalls and Searle in 1889, and welcomed Woodgate back into the fold for annual commentary on the Boat Race and Henley.  Cricketers, jockeys, golfers, polo and tennis players -- all manner of Victorian sportsmen -- also began appearing frequently, though whether this reflected Witherby’s personal taste or his readers’ is hard to say.  It may also have been due to the arrival of Bertram Fletcher Robinson, a Cambridge rugby Blue who got his journalistic start covering the sport in the early 1890s for Rudy Lehmann’s &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Granta&lt;/span&gt;.  Robinson eventually left &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;The World&lt;/span&gt; and died in 1907, at thirty-six.{{ref|Rice}} 

As the increased rowing coverage coincided with Oxford’s 1890-98 run in the Boat Race, the featured rowers tended toward darker blue, which drew the following letter to the editor:

''Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool, 20th March, 1894.''

''DEAR VANITY,-- Guess I’m just going to ask you a civil question.  How the deuce is it that at Boat Race time you invariably show the full-length carcase of a Dark Blue oarsman?  If the idea is to give a tip for the winner, well, it is excusable -- especially when it is considered that Oxford have won for the last few years consecutively.  But, on the other hand, if your intention is merely to let the public see the outward and visible form on paper of one of the chief actors in the event -- well, hang it, surely the other side might have a show now and again.  The Cantabs are surely just as “highly respectable” as their whilom opponents, and, to put it mildly, they are quite as popular.  Now, Sir, I’m neither a Cantonian nor an Oxab -- nor a ‘Varsity man of any kind at all.  But I do imagine that as there are two sides to every question so there are two crews in every University Boat Race.''

''Dear Vanity, do be Fair, and oblige yours amphibiously,''

:::''PEREGRINE PICKLE''

To which &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; replied:

''[A] “civil question” demands a civil answer; wherefore I refer “Peregrine Pickle” to “Spy’s” cartoon to-day [of C.T. Fogg-Elliot of C.U.B.C.]  I fancy that I was not much to blame for putting Mr. Cotton a week in front of Mr. Fogg-Elliot.  As for other Cambridge oars, they have not been excluded from the Vanity Fair gallery.  Mr. Muttlebury’s presentment was the last given, two or three years back.  When Vanity Fair was a Saturday paper, it generally gave one President on the day of the race.  As a Thursday paper it has for the first time this year given two Presidents; one on each side of the race.  Wherefore my amphibious correspondent is, or should be, already “obliged.”''

''But, were he less amphibious, he might have seen that Mr. Fogg-Elliot’s picture was announced for this week in last week’s &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.''

By this time &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; had lost a good deal of its cachet, both relative to the growing competition and absolutely due to the departure of Bowles and his coterie.  Evans and Witherby reacted by adding girth to the product and appealing, with a touch of indignation, to readers’ brand loyalty.  “Here,” touted the June 28, 1890 issue, “for the first time in the history of this Journal, is a volume of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; which contains more than 570 pages.  The half-yearly volume, of which the present are the concluding pages, is, it may be noted, larger by some 200 pages than most of its predecessors have been.”  The growth reflects “the increased support which has been accorded to it by its readers,” despite competition that generally “has grown more than ever keen, . . . so keenly so, indeed, that in many cases the competition of our rivals has developed into the most barefaced piracy and the most false originality.”  Yet even though the magazine “has never lacked imitators, and of late years its distinctive features have been more or less generally copied by the whole of the daily Press,” &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s “‘little band of Pilgrims’ enjoyed from the outset “consistent triumph over the difficulties which they started to defy, and which they have ever since, it may be said without vanity, triumphantly overcome.”

Evans eventually sold out to '''Oliver Fry''', “a journalist of the old school, a man of education,” who ultimately was unable to make a financial go of it.  “There is no place for such weeklies nowadays, for there is no longer any governing class, only wandering bands of financiers,” [[w:Edgar_Jepson|Edgar Jepson]], Fry’s successor as editor, recalled in 1936.{{ref|Jepson}}   Fry in turn sold out in 1907 to [[w:Frank_Harris|Frank Harris]], a colorful character in the twilight of his career who milked the franchise.  Harris’ autobiography tells nothing of his views on rowing and rowers while he owned &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, but does recall how he covered the Boat Race for the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Evening News&lt;/span&gt; in the 1880s:

''In my first year in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Evening News&lt;/span&gt; I learned and practiced nearly every journalistic trick.  When the annual boat race between Oxford and Cambridge was about to be decided, I found out that the experts usually know which crew would win.  Of course sometimes they are mistaken, but very rarely, and this year they all agreed it was a foregone conclusion for Oxford.  Accordingly, on the great morning I had fifty thousand papers printed with ‘Oxford won’ in big letters under the latest preliminary reports of the training, etc.  As soon as the telephone message came through that Oxford had won, I let the boys out and this start enabled me to sell all the fifty thousand papers.  I did the same thing with race after race on the turf and soon it began to be known that the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Evening News&lt;/span&gt; had the earliest news of the races.{{ref|Harris1}}'' 
	
When Harris bought &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; he promptly ran off to New York to trade its influence on the British stock-buying public in exchange for Wall Street investment in the magazine.  The Americans declined the offer, but Harris’ absence gave Jepson six months at the helm as interim editor.  He made the most of it:

''It is foolish to try to edit a paper without a fixed policy, and since it was the function of a club-land weekly to keep politics pure and politicians up to their work and deal faithfully with all kinds of rogues, I made it my policy to run as near to the law of libel as I possibly could all the time, and I stuck to it.  About an open rogue there was no need to bother:  I libelled him with exact truthfulness; he fired in a writ -- as a pledge of good faith I suppose; the matter ended.  But to tell the truth about a less open rogue without landing the paper with a doubtful and expensive libel action was a very different matter.''

''But I had, in the office itself, an accomplished solicitor, a cousin of the Duchess of Manchester, who knew everything about the law of libel that was to be known, and he was very helpful.  But sometimes, when I was dealing with astute roguery of jobbery, it would take me two hours to say in ten lines exactly what I wished to say about it, before the solicitor would warrant the paragraph not to produce a libel action, and I could safely do the rogue good.  I learnt that you could say very nearly anything, if you said it carefully.''

''It was enjoyable, and it proved to be the right policy, for the circulation of the paper, which had been sinking for years, rose and went on rising:  people do so enjoy observing others done good to.{{ref|Jepson2}}'' 

Curiously, neither Jepson nor Harris used &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s caricatures in support of this near-libelous editorial policy; the very point of caricature being, after all, to land that sort of truthful punch.  “If the celebrities wrote their own biographies,” Jepson recalled, “well and good:  I was saved trouble.  If they did not, I lunched with them and listened to the histories of their lives, such simple lives, and wrote the biography myself.”{{ref|Jepson3}}  [[Image:Allinson_TR_Vanity_Fair_1911-10-04.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Allinson, &quot;Wholemeal Bread,&quot; Vanity Fair, October 4, 1911]]Reading the March 13, 1907 biography of Duggie Stuart (“a great athlete . . . an oarsman of demoniac swiftness and skill”), one suspects it falls in the former category.  But according to Jepson Harris went one better, auctioning the slots outright:  “If you wished to be celebrated, you paid him fifty pounds for the drawing of your cartoon in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, and there you were -- certified famous.”{{ref|Jepson4}}  R.H. Forster (July 6, 1910) and R.C. Bourne (March 29, 1911) featured in this period.  So did R.B. Etherington-Smith (August 5, 1908), but he appeared immediately after captaining Leander to victory at the London (Henley) Olympics, which lessens the chance his biography was self-selected.

Jepson complained that Harris “frittered away the circulation, and the paper died, deeply in debt,” adding that his “habit of bleeding the papers he had to do with, of any money that came in, paralyzed them, and exploitation was his ''metier''.”{{ref|Jepson5}}   Maybe cheapness to authors explains the coincidence of Woodgate’s departure with Harris’ arrival.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; was hardly a business when Harris sold out to its last owner, [[w:Thomas_Allinson|Dr. Thomas Allinson]], in late 1911.  Unlike Harris, Allinson was no newspaper man; his interests lay in nutrition and hygiene, publishing such works as “The Advantages of Wholemeal Bread.”  Under his administration the writing in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; suffered – witness every biography after 1911 – hardly the “light, epigrammatic, pungent, and excessively neat” stuff on which Bowles made the magazine’s reputation over forty years earlier.{{ref|Journalist2}}  In early 1914, Allinson folded the remnants into &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Hearth and Home&lt;/span&gt;, bringing the institution to a close.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book shows how to code different algorithms for drawing sets in dynamical plane : [[w:Julia_set|Julia]], [[w:Filled Julia set|Filled-in Julia]] or [[w:Fatou set|Fatou]] sets for [[w:complex quadratic polynomial|complex quadratic polynomial]].
It is divided in 2 parts :
* description of various algorithms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultrafractal.com/help/index.html?/help/coloring/workingwithcoloring.html Standard coloring algorithms  from Ultra Fractal]&lt;/ref&gt;
* descriptions of technics for visualisation of various sets in dynamic plane

[[File:DistanceToFixed.png|right|thumb|Various types of dynamics needs various algorithms]]


='''Algorithms'''=



==Methods based on speed of attraction ==

Here color is proportional to speed of attraction ( convergence to attractor). These methods are used in Fatou set. 

===Basin of attraction to infinity =  exterior of filled-in Julia set and The Divergence Scheme  = Escape Time Method ( ETM ) ===
First read [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp|definitions]]

Here one computes ''forward iterations'' of a complex point ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'':

&lt;math&gt;Z_{n+1} = Z_n^2 + C &lt;/math&gt;

Here is function which computes the ''last iteration'', that is the first iteration that lands in the target set ( for example leaves a circle around the origin with a given ''escape radius'' ER ) for the iteration of the [[w:complex quadratic polynomial|complex quadratic polynomial]] above.
It is a iteration ( integer) for which (abs(Z)&gt;ER).
It can also be improved &lt;ref&gt;[http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2011/08/13/faster-fractals-through-algebra/ Faster Fractals Through Algebra by Bruce Dawson ( author of Fractal eXtreme)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C version''' ( here ER2=ER*ER) using double floating point numbers ( without complex type numbers) :

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
 int GiveLastIteration(double Zx, double Zy, double Cx, double Cy, int IterationMax, int ER2)
 {
  double Zx2, Zy2; /* Zx2=Zx*Zx;  Zy2=Zy*Zy  */
  int i=0;
  Zx2=Zx*Zx;
  Zy2=Zy*Zy;
  while (i&lt;IterationMax &amp;&amp; (Zx2+Zy2&lt;ER2) ) /* ER2=ER*ER */
  {
   Zy=2*Zx*Zy + Cy;
   Zx=Zx2-Zy2 +Cx;
   Zx2=Zx*Zx;
   Zy2=Zy*Zy;
   i+=1;
  }
  return i;

====Boolean Escape time====


Algorithm:
for every point z of dynamical plane (z-plane) compute iteration number ( last iteration) for which magnitude of z is greater than escape radius.
If last_iteration=max_iteration then point is in filled-in Julia set, else it is in its complement (attractive basin of infinity ). Here one has 2 options, so it is named  boolean algorithm.


 if (LastIteration==IterationMax)
    then color=BLACK;   /* bounded orbits = Filled-in Julia set */
    else color=WHITE;  /* unbounded orbits = exterior of Filled-in Julia set  */

In theory this method is for drawing [[w:Filled Julia set|Filled-in Julia set ]] and its complement ( exterior), but when c is [[w:Misiurewicz point|Misiurewicz point]] ( [[w:Filled Julia set|Filled-in Julia set ]] has no interior) this method draws nothing. For example  for c=i . It means that it is good for drawing interior of [[w:Filled Julia set|Filled-in Julia set ]].

====Integer escape time =  Level Sets of the Basin of Attraction of Infinity = [[w:Level Sets Method|Level Sets Method]]= LSM/J====
[[Image:Data.png|right|thumb|level sets of escape time for C=0 and 0.9&lt;Z&lt;1.5]]
Escape time measures time of escaping to infinity ( infinity is superattracting point for polynomials). Time is measured in steps ( iterations = i) needed
to escape from circle of given radius ( ER= Escape Radius).

One can see few things:
*this is [[w:Continuous function |  discontinuous function]]
*i is iMax for z in [[w:Filled Julia set| Filled-in Julia set]]
*i=0 for x0&gt;ER
*this is [[w:nonlinear| nonlinear function]]


Level sets here are sets of points with the same escape time. 
Here is algorithm of choosing color in black &amp; white version. 

   if (LastIteration==IterationMax)
    then color=BLACK;   /* bounded orbits = Filled-in Julia set */
    else   /* unbounded orbits = exterior of Filled-in Julia set  */
         if ((LastIteration%2)==0) /* odd number */
            then color=BLACK; 
            else color=WHITE;
====Normalized iteration count (real escape time or fractional iteration) ====
[[Image:Et.png|right|thumb|Escape time for C=0 and 0.5&lt;Z&lt;2.5]]

Math formula :

: &lt;math&gt;\nu(z)=\lim\limits_{i\to\infty}( i-\log_2\log_2|z_i|)\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Maxima version :

 GiveNormalizedIteration(z,c,E_R,i_Max):=
 /* */
 block(
  [i:0,r],
  while abs(z)&lt;E_R and i&lt;i_Max
    do (z:z*z + c,i:i+1),
  r:i-log2(log2(cabs(z))),
  return(float(r))
 )$


In Maxima log(x) is a natural (base e) logarithm of x. To compute log2 use :

 log2(x) := log(x) / log(2);

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Binary decomposition====

Here color of pixel ( exterior of Julia set) is proportional to sign of imaginary part of last iteration . 

Main loop is the same as in escape time.

In other words target set is decompositioned in 2 parts ( binary decomposition) :

&lt;math&gt;T_b+=\{z: abs(z_n) &gt; ER ~~\mbox{and}~~  im(z_n)&gt;0 \} \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_b-=\{z: abs(z_n) &gt; ER ~~\mbox{and}~~  im(z_n)&lt;=0 \} \,&lt;/math&gt; 


Algorithm in pseudocode ( Im(Zn) = Zy ) :
 
 if (LastIteration==IterationMax)
    then color=BLACK;   /* bounded orbits = Filled-in Julia set */
    else   /* unbounded orbits = exterior of Filled-in Julia set  */
         if (Zy&gt;0) /* Zy=Im(Z) */
            then color=BLACK; 
            else color=WHITE;

====Modified decomposition ====

Here exterior of Julia set is decompositioned into radial level sets. 

It is because main loop is without bailout test and number of iterations ( iteration max) is constant.

It creates radial level sets. See also video by bryceguy72&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHUTwPI4ICI Video :  Julia Set Morphing with Magnetic Field lines by bryceguy72 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

  for (Iteration=0;Iteration&lt;8;Iteration++)
 /* modified loop without checking of abs(zn) and low iteration max */
    {
    Zy=2*Zx*Zy + Cy;
    Zx=Zx2-Zy2 +Cx;
    Zx2=Zx*Zx;
    Zy2=Zy*Zy;
   };

==BSM/J==

This algorithm is used when dynamical plane consist of two of more basins of attraction. For example for c=0. 

It is not appropiate when interior of filled Julia set is empty, for example for c=i.

Description of algorithm :
* for every pixel of dynamical plane &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; do :
** compute 4 corners ( vertices)  of pixel &lt;math&gt;z_{lt} , z_{rt} , z_{rb} , z_{lb} &lt;/math&gt; ( where lt denotes left top, rb denotes right bottom, ... )
** check to which basin corner belongs ( standard escape time and bailout test ) 
** if corners do not belong to the same basin mark it as Julia set

* program in Pascal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firebaugh.com/FDA/Courses/CS.320/Week.11/Ch11b.www/Ch11b.html Pascal program fo BSM/J by Morris W. Firebaugh]&lt;/ref&gt;
* via convolution with a kernel &lt;ref&gt; [http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/papers/BoundaryScanPP.pdf Boundary scanning and complex dynamics by Mark McClure]&lt;/ref&gt;

* exterior
* interior

File:Demj6.png| c = 0.255
File:Julia dem c=-0.1+0.651.png|c=-0.1+0.651
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&quot; For distance estimate it has been proved that the computed value differs from the true distance at most by a factor of 4. &quot; (Wolf Jung)


Math formula :

&lt;math&gt;distance(z_0, K_c, n) = 2 * |z_n| * \frac{log|z_n| }{ |z'_n| }\,&lt;/math&gt;
 
where :


&lt;math&gt;z'_n\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[w:Complex_quadratic_polynomial| first derivative with respect to c]].  


This [[w:derivative|derivative]] can be found by [[w:Iterated function|iteration]] starting with 

: &lt;math&gt;z'_0 = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and then :

&lt;math&gt;z'_n= 2*z_{n-1}*z'_{n-1}\,&lt;/math&gt;





====How to use distance ==== 


One can use distance for colouring  :
* only Julia set ( boundary of filled Julia set)
* boundary and exterior of filled Julia set. 


Here is first example :

 if (LastIteration==IterationMax) 
     then { /*  interior of Julia set, distance = 0 , color black */ }
     else /* exterior or boundary of Filled-in Julia set  */
          {  double distance=give_distance(Z0,C,IterationMax);
             if (distance&lt;distanceMax)
                 then { /*  Julia set : color = white */ }
                 else  { /*  exterior of Julia set : color = black */}
          }

Here is second example &lt;ref&gt;[[Pictures_of_Julia_and_Mandelbrot_Sets/Computer_programs| Pictures of Julia and Mandelbrot sets  by Gert Buschmann]]&lt;/ref&gt;

 if (LastIteration==IterationMax) or distance &lt; distanceMax then ... // interior by ETM/J and boundary by DEM/J
 else .... // exterior by real escape time

====Zoom====

DistanceMax is smaller than pixel size. During zooming pixel size is decreasing and DistanceMax should also be decreased to obtain good picture. 
It can be made by using formula :

&lt;math&gt;DistanceMax = \frac{PixelSize}{n} \,&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;n \le  1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

One can start with n=1 and increase n if picture is not good. Check also iMax !!

DistanceMax may also be proportional to zoom factor &lt;math&gt;mag\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pictures_of_Julia_and_Mandelbrot_Sets/Computer_programs|Pictures of Julia and Mandelbrot sets by Gert Buschmann]]&lt;/ref&gt; :

&lt;math&gt;DistanceMax = \sqrt{\frac {thick}{1000 * mag}}&lt;/math&gt;

where thick is image width ( in  world units) and mag is a zoom factor.

==Convergence ==
In this algorithm distances between 2 points of the same orbit are checked

=== average discrete velocity of orbit ===
[[File:Golden Mean Quadratic Siegel Disc Speed.png|right|thumb|average discrete velocity of orbit - code and description]]
It is used in case of :
* [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/parabolic|parabolic dynamic]]
* [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/siegel|eliptic dynamic ( Siegel disc )]]

===Cauchy Convergence Algorithm (CCA)===
This algorithm is [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Georg-Johann/Mathematik#Visualising_Julia_sets described] by User:Georg-Johann. Here is also [http://www.bugman123.com/Fractals/index.html Matemathics code by Paul Nylander]

== Normality ==

[[w:normal family |Normality]]
In this algorithm distances between points of 2 orbits are checked



===Checking [[w:equicontinuity|equicontinuity]]  by  Michael Becker===  
&quot;Iteration is equicontinuous on [[w:Fatou set|the Fatou set]] and not on [[w:Julia set|the Julia set]]&quot;. (Wolf Jung) &lt;ref&gt;Alan F. Beardon, S. Axler, F.W. Gehring, K.A. Ribet : Iteration of Rational Functions: Complex Analytic Dynamical Systems. Springer, 2000; ISBN 0387951512, 9780387951515; page 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph H. Silverman : The arithmetic of dynamical systems. Springer, 2007. ISBN 0387699031, 9780387699035; page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Becker compares the distance of two close points under iteration on Riemann sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:de:Benutzer:Georg-Johann/Mathematik | Visualising Julia sets by Georg-Johann]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

This method can be used to draw not only Julia sets for polynomials  ( where infinity is always superattracting fixed point) but it can be also  applied  to other functions ( maps), for which infinity is not an attracting fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijon.de/mathe/julia/some_julia_sets_1_en.html Julia sets by Michael Becker]. See the metric d(z,w)&lt;/ref&gt;



=== using Marty's criterion by Wolf Jung ===
Wolf Jung  is using &quot;an alternative method of checking normality, which is based on Marty's criterion:  |f'| / (1 + |f|^2)  must be bounded for all 
iterates.&quot; It is implemented in mndlbrot::marty function ( see src code of [http://mndynamics.com/indexp.html program Mandel] ver 5.3 ).
It uses one point of dynamic plane.






== Koenigs coordinate ==

[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Koenigs_coordinate|Koenigs coordinate]] are used in the basin of attraction of finite attracting (not superattracting) point (cycle).

='''Optimisation'''=
==Distance ==
You don't need a square root to compare distances. &lt;ref&gt;[[Algorithms/Distance_approximations|Algorithms : Distance_approximations in wikibooks]]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Symmetry==

Julia sets can have many symmetries &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/MSet/Julia.htm The Julia sets symmetry by Evgeny Demidov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/38236/symmetries-of-the-julia-sets-for-z2c mathoverflow : symmetries-of-the-julia-sets-for-z2c]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quadratic Julia set has allways rotational symmetry ( 180 degrees) :
 colour(x,y) = colour(-x,-y)

when c is on real axis ( cy = 0) Julia set is also reflection symmetric :&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgoodwin.net/julia/juliajewels.html htJulia Jewels: An Exploration of Julia Sets by Michael McGoodwin (March 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

 colour(x,y) = colour(x,-y)

Algorithm :
* compute half image
* rotate and add the other half
* write image to file &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.ch/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27749-julia-sets julia sets in Matlab by Jonas Lundgren   ]&lt;/ref&gt;

='''Sets'''=

==Target set==

[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set#Target_set|Target set]] or trap 

One can divide it according to : 
* attractors ( finite or infinite)
* dynamics ( hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptic )

===For infinite attractor - hyperbolic case ===

Target set &lt;math&gt;T\,&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary set on dynamical plane containing [[w:Point_at_infinity|infinity]] and not containing points of Filled-in Fatou sets. 

For escape time algorithms target set determines the shape of level sets and curves. It does not do it for other methods.

====Exterior of circle ====
This is typical target set. It is exterior of circle with center at [[w:Origin (mathematics)| origin]] &lt;math&gt;z = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; and radius =ER :


&lt;math&gt;T_{ER}=\{z:abs(z) &gt; ER \} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Radius is named escape radius ( ER ) or bailout value.
Radius should  be greater than 2. 
====Exterior of square ====

Here target set is exterior of [[w:square|square]] of side length &lt;math&gt;s\, &lt;/math&gt;  centered at [[w:origin|origin]] 

&lt;math&gt;T_s=\{z: abs(re(z)) &gt; s  ~~\mbox{or}~~  abs(im(z))&gt;s \} \,&lt;/math&gt;

=== For finite attractors ===

==Julia sets==
&quot;Most programs for computing Julia sets work well when the underlying dynamics is
hyperbolic but experience an exponential slowdown in the parabolic case.&quot; ( Mark Braverman )&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwmayr.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/konferenzen/ACA2007/braverman.pdf Mark Braverman : On efficient computation of parabolic Julia sets]
&lt;/ref&gt;

* when Julia set is a set of points that do not escape to infinity under iteration of the quadratic map ( = filled Julia set has no interior = dendrt)
** IIM/J
** DEM/J
** checking normality
*  when Julia set is a  boundary between 2 basin of attraction ( = filled Julia set has no empty interior) : 
** boundary scaning &lt;ref&gt;[http://gamma.pu.ru/user/diffjournal/eng_ref_2002_vol2_e_pet.htm.jsave.html ALGORITHM OF COMPUTER MODELLING OF JULIA SET IN CASE OF PARABOLIC FIXED POINT N.B.Ampilova, E.Petrenko ]&lt;/ref&gt;
** edge detection

==Fatou set==

Interior of filled Julia set can be coloured :
* speed of attraction ( integer value = the number of iterations used to guess if a point is in the set ) which is coverted to colour ( or shade of gray ) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devmaster.net/forums/showthread.php?t=4448 Ray Tracing Quaternion Julia Sets on the GPU  by Keenan Crane]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Interface Class&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
* To separate an interface of a class from its implementation.
* Invoke implementation of an abstraction/class using runtime polymorphism.
=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
Separating an interface of a class from its implementation is fundamental to good quality object oriented software design/programming. For object oriented programming, the principal mechanism of separation is the Interface Class. However C++ (when compared to, say, Java) provides no exclusive mechanism for expressing such a separation. In Java, '''interface''' keyword is used to specify only the public methods that are supported by an abstraction. C++ does not have such a keyword but its functionality can be expressed closely using the Interface Class idiom. The idea is to express only the public methods of an abstraction and provide no implementation of any of them. Also, lack of implementation means no instances of the interface class should be allowed.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
An interface class contains only a virtual destructor and pure virtual functions, thus providing a construct similar to the interface constructs of other languages (e.g. Java). An interface class is a class that specifies the polymorphic interface i.e. pure virtual function declarations into a base class. The programmer using a class hierarchy can then do so via a base class that communicates only the interface of classes in the hierarchy.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class shape   // An interface class
{
  public:
    virtual ~shape();
    virtual void move_x(int x) = 0;
    virtual void move_y(int y) = 0;
    virtual void draw() = 0;
//...
};

class line : public shape
{
  public:
    virtual ~line();
    virtual void move_x(int x); // implements move_x
    virtual void move_y(int y); // implements move_y
    virtual void draw(); // implements draw
  private:
    point end_point_1, end_point_2;
//...
};

int main (void)
{
  std::vector&lt;shape *&gt; shapes;
  //  Fill up shapes vector somehow.
  for (vector&lt;shape *&gt;::iterator iter (shapes.begin());
       iter != shapes.end();
       ++iter)
  {
    (*iter)-&gt;draw();
  }
  //  Clean up shapes vector. (Normally we would use something like boost::shared_ptr to automate cleanup,
  //  this is for illustration only)
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Every interface class should have a virtual destructor. Virtual destructor makes sure that when a shape is deleted polymorphically,  correct destructor of the derived class is invoked. Otherwise there is a good chance of resource leak. Benefit of expressing design using interface classes are many:
* New shape abstractions can be added without changing the code that depends only on shape interface. For example, Square can inherit  from shape and implement the interface methods in its own way. The function main() needs no changes at all.
* Separation of interface from implementation prevents recompilation of parts of the program that depend only on the interface classes.
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that implementation classes should not depend on each other. Instead, they should depend on common abstraction represented using an interface class. DIP reduces coupling in a object-oriented system.

=== Known Uses ===
Nearly all good object-oriented software in C++!

== [[mw:Extension:Gadgets]] ==

I was poking around, and found this extension. This could be a very useful toy for enabling easy access to custom js/css. I can certainly think of a few js tools that users might find useful, but should be opt-in. This is also a more secure (though less versatile) method than having users put code in their monobook - the code is identical for all users, but comes from the Mediawiki namespace, so only admins can access it (and therefore the code would be trustworthy).

The extension isn't perfect, and WK can attest. It works best with monobook and not with cologne blue, and can do some funky things with custom skins. Any user with a custom skin can probably find a workaround though, and most people stick with monobook.

This also has the side-effect of allowing quick enable/disable of certain gadgets (ie you don't have to make tons of edits to your monobook to enable/disable something repeatedly. Many users don't realize they can have custom js, and among those who do, many can't code. This allows them easy access to secure code.

Although it's not perfect, I think it would be a good idea, if only to make these toys less frustrating but more secure. Keep in mind that you can still have custom .js, so it's an option, but not a requirement.

A few ideas (for more, take a look at de.wp &amp; fr.wp):
*The parts of TW that work out of the box here (morebits.js and twinklefluff.js at a minimum)
*Purge tab
*Edit top section tab or link
*Six tabs (page/edit/hist talk/edit/hist)
*Popups
*Turn on/off those ''untagged'' and ''unlicensed'' tabs (can be opt-in since the template we notify uploaders with has the same links)
*Easy opt-in for the Google hit counter WK's taking care of
*Some neat admin tools (a modified version of VoAs stuff, autosdel, twinkledelimages...)
*I'm sure you can come up with more

== Human Physiology Wikibook: PDF file corrupted ==

Hello,

This is my first visit to the Wikibooks project. I apologize if I am posting this message in the wrong forum.

I tried several times to download the PDF version of your featured Wikibook &quot;Human Physiology&quot;.
I received the error message (paraphrase), &quot; File is corrupt, unable to correct&quot;. I was unable to download this PDF file.

I am using an older computer (Windows 98) and an older version of Acrobat: Acrobat Reader 5.
I hope this is not the problem.

Human Physiology is an excellent book. I read portions in the HTML format. However, I prefer the PDF format. I hope that this book will become available in this format.

Wikibooks is a noble project. I wish you much success in your endeavor.

Sincerely,
AL DOM
:The download worked for me; your software may be to blame. Try updating to the newest Acrobat version. I don't think the Windows version matters in this case. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:31, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== New &quot;protection&quot; option ==

Really a &quot;heads up&quot; in case folk don't know but with the new software version comes the ability to protect uncreated pages.  At this point my views are somewhat mixed ([[commons:Commons:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Protecting_non-existent_pages|here too]]).  I feel that protecting spambot pages would be quicker that way but I rather like the fact that there is a &quot;record&quot; available for other cascade protected pages at [[WB:SALT]].

:Did a few recent bot pages so folks can see the effect ([[Special:Protectedtitles]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== 1839 - 1854:  New Traditions ===

 
	By the yardstick of Boat Race or Henley Regatta participation, 1839 marks the earliest contest for the rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; for it was then that William Baliol Brett first rowed for the Cambridge in the Boat Race.  (He rowed for the C.U.B.C. in 1837 and 1838 as well, but against Leander rather than Oxford as no university race took place those years.)  To put him and the first few rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; in context, it helps to take a backward glance at “watermen” and “gentlemen.”


[[Image:Thames_waterman_soliciting_passers-by_c_1825.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Thames waterman soliciting passers-by, c 1825]]Water tradesmen carried people and goods in the days before motor vehicles and  railways.  They prospered in the Thames Valley and became so numerous that Henry VIII began regulating their fares in 1514 and Parliament incorporated their guild, the Company of Watermen and Lightermen, in 1555.  Among the duties of the Company were, according to Guy Nickalls:


''to draw up a scale of legal fares; to control in every manner the men who plied for hire on the river; to apprentice them; to see that they were capable of handling boats with safety to the passengers when they took up their freedom; to arm them, to ensure that their passengers were not murdered, assaulted or robbed; to issue licenses to lightermen; to renew licenses triennially to freemen; and generally to act the shepherd over a somewhat turbulent flock.''{{ref|Cook}}


[[Image:Liddy_Doggett_Coat_and_Badge_ILN_1842-08-06.jpg|thumb|right|Liddy, the Winner of Doggett's Coat and Badge, ''Illustrated London News'', August 6, 1842]]In short, watermen were the regulated taxi and lorry drivers of pre-industrial Britain, with certain tariff and police powers as well.  It was among their ranks that the longest-running rowing event, [[w:Doggett%27s_Coat_and_Badge|Doggett’s Coat and Badge]], was established in London.  Named for the actor and the prize he bequeathed, the race first occurred on August 1, 1715, the anniversary of the accession of George I.  (Handel’s Water Music dates to nearly the same time, composed at the request of George I for a concert on board barges rowed by watermen.){{ref|Handel}}  Doggett’s Coat and Badge is still run annually from London Bridge to Chelsea, though the demise of professional watermen has necessitated some loosening of the entry criteria.{{ref|Cleaver}} 

	
	Gentlemen employed watermen and owned most of the goods they carried.  In eighteenth century London, the growth of commerce created new rich merchants and financiers and attracted some landed aristocracy to town from around the country.  This broad class of wealthy gentlemen, who built the theatres, gardens, and clubs of Georgian society, loved to gamble and by sponsoring wager matches among local watermen both were entertained and had the opportunity for betting.  Some took to the water themselves, rowing with watermen on a recreational basis and relying on them for boat rental, boat-building, accommodation, and instruction.  Such recreational rowing gave rise to the first gentlemen’s boat clubs, the Monarch Boat Club founded at Eton College in 1793 and the Isis Club at Westminster School a few years later, both named for the boats involved.  (The school clubs were not formed until 1816 and 1813, respectively.)  At Westminster a succession of headmasters discouraged rowing as it had led to a number of drownings, and in 1788 the use of watermen in all schoolboy crews was ordered as a safeguard.  By then, recreational rowing had taken hold at Oxford and Cambridge, particularly as six-oared picnic transport, introduced by Eton and Westminster alumni.  But gentlemen did not race, with or without watermen, as it was thought manual and demeaning and, at Eton and Westminster, because of the close association of professional wager matches to gambling and drinking.{{ref|Wigglesworth2}} 


	In the early nineteenth century, gentlemen rowers began to distance themselves from watermen.  The trend started at Eton, Westminster, and Oxbridge and spread gradually throughout the country.  Eton dispensed with a waterman at coxswain starting in 1837; the Boat Race and Henley Regatta followed suit in 1839; and professional trainers and coaches were likewise marginalized over the next decade.{{ref|Wigglesworth3}}    This weaning was not without occasional intellectual challenge:  when Oxford bought a radically new boat for the 1857 Boat Race, designed and built by a professional, Matthew Taylor, the O.U.B.C. had him “steer[] us during our training, not to instruct Oxford in the art of rowing, but to show us the proper way to send his boat along as quickly as possible.”{{ref|OUBC}} 


[[Image:Berkley's_Black_Eyed_Maid_1827-09-20.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&quot;Berkley's Black-Eyed Maid,&quot; 1827]]	Also in the early nineteenth century, gentlemen began to rethink their self-imposed ban on racing.  At Oxbridge, picnickers returning from a day out began vying with one another to be first back to the boatyard, the competition eventually giving birth to the college “bumping” races at Oxford around 1815 and at Cambridge in 1827.  Other gentlemen crews began competing in wager matches, such as the 1826 “Grand Amateur Rowing Match for 200 sovereigns, for gentlemen picked from the various crack clubs on the river” in London.  This event encouraged the staging of the first “away” match by an Oxford crew, from Christ Church College, against a composite eight from the Leander and Arrow clubs for the same purse.  The Londoners won, as they did in 1831 when an Oxford University crew challenged Leander, also for 200 sovereigns.{{ref|Drinkwater1}} 


	Against this background Charles Wordsworth, nephew of the poet and son of the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, orchestrated the first Boat Race in 1829.  He later recalled it as only one of many “trifling and insignificant” sporting events he had helped organise at college.  Living in Cambridge and studying at Oxford, he used his Harrow contacts to promote an inter-university cricket match in 1827, the success of which prompted him to suggest to his Cambridge friends the possibility of a boat race.  They challenged and Oxford accepted, with Henley-on-Thames the agreed venue.  Neither the Cam nor the Isis were wide or straight enough and the tidal Thames in London was considered too choppy to provide fair racing conditions.  Henley offered a one mile straight course, wide enough to allow side-by-side racing with no blade clashes or fouling.  Oxford won.  There was no purse for the contestants but undoubtedly plenty of gambling.{{ref|Drinkwater2}} 


	In 1830 Cambridge challenged again, but the plans were dropped due to a cholera epidemic.  The second match ultimately went off in 1836, this time in London from Westminster to Putney for a purse of four hundred pounds that Cambridge took home.  The event became more or less annualized from 1839 onwards, without a purse, and in 1842 became designated a “race” rather than a “match” to reinforce the shift away from watermen, purses, and fouling.{{ref|Wigglesworth4}} 


	A similar shift occurred at the Henley Regatta, founded in 1839.  Initially it consisted of just two events:  a Town Challenge Cup for watermen, with a £30 purse, and a Grand Challenge Cup for amateur gentlemen, no purse.  Admission to the “Grand” was limited to eight-oared crews from “the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, or London, the Schools of Eton and Westminster, the Officers of the two Brigades of Household Troops, or Members of a Club established at least one year previous to the time of entering” (i.e., Leander Club), with no watermen coxswains or fouling permitted.  The regatta soon swelled with additional events for amateurs:  the Stewards’ Challenge Cup for coxed fours (1841, it went coxless in 1873), the Diamond Challenge Sculls for single sculls (1844), the Silver Wherries for pair oars (1845, later renamed the Silver Goblets and Nickalls’ Challenge Cup), the Ladies’ Challenge Plate for eights (1845), the Visitors’ Challenge Cup for coxed fours (1847, it went coxless in 1874), the Wyfold Cup for coxed fours (1855, it too went coxless in 1874), and the Thames Challenge Cup for eights (1868).  The regatta became Royal in 1851 under the patronage of Prince Albert.  The one event for watermen, the Town Challenge Cup, was dropped in 1884.{{ref|Dodd}}

::''A few weeks ago the King expressed to Baron Kilmanseck His desire to have a concert on the river, by subscription, similar to the masquerades this winter which the King never failed to attend. . . .  The necessary orders were given and the entertainment took place the day before yesterday [July 17, 1717].  About eight in the evening the King repaired to his barge, into which were admitted the Duchess of Bolton, Countess Godolphin, Mad. de Kilmanseck, Mrs. Were and the Earl of Orkney, the Gentleman of the Bedchamber in Waiting.  Next to the King’s barge was that of the musicians, about 50 in number, who played on all kinds of instruments, to wit trumpets, horns, hautboys, bassoons, German flutes, French flutes, violins and basses; but there were no singers.  The music had been composed specially by the famous Handel, a native of Halle, and His Majesty’s principal Court Composer.  His Majesty approved of it so greatly that he caused it to be repeated three times in all, although each performance lasted an hour -- namely twice before and once after supper.  The [weather in the] evening was all that could be desired for the festivity, the number of barges and above all of boats filled with people desirous of hearing was beyond counting.  In order to make this entertainment the more exquisite, Mad. de Kilmanseck had arranged a choice supper in the late Lord Ranelagh’s villa at Chelsea on the river where the King went at one in the morning.  He left at three o’clock and returned to St. James’ about half past four.''

=== “He Was an Ornament on the Bench” (Stuff), November 19, 1892 ===

[[Image:Denman_G_Vanity_Fair_1892-11-19.jpg|thumb|right]]''The fourth son of that able defender of Queen Caroline of Brunswick, who (after the King’s death) was rewarded by a Peerage and a chance of illuminating the King’s Bench which he availed himself of for nearly twenty years as its Chief Justice, he has owed much of his success to his father and to his father’s name, and something of it to himself.  Born three-and-seventy years ago, he grew into an intellectually and physically well-favoured boy, who at Repton Grammar School and at Trinity, Cambridge, made friends, cultivated his mind, and won pots so thoroughly that half a century back he had figured as a Senior Classic and as a Cambridge University oar.  Then his College improved him into a Fellow; and, soon after he was called to the Bar, his grateful University retained him as one of her Counsel, though she refused to be represented by him in Parliament, preferring a Tory.  Handsome, persuasive, painstaking, and not without tact, he presently became quite a proper person for the conduct of arbitration cases; and having now become well known in the way that successful barristers get themselves known, he was chosen to share with Lord Palmerston the divided honour of representing Tiverton in the House of Commons.  There he tended legislatively to assimilate civil with criminal evidence, and helped to abolish religious belief as a qualification for witnesses; which thing he did almost silently, for he was no great speaker in the House.  But he voted always -- except once -- with his Party, until at last, twenty years ago, being the son of a great lawyer, a docile Liberal, and a cautious man, he voted himself onto the Bench, on which he was for so long an ornament.''


''	For he made a dignified and imposing Judge, besides being the best-looking man on the Bench.  Moreover, he worked hard, scarcely ever lost his temper, and was generally full of grace.  Yet, if he be judged by the records of the Court of Appeal, he will not be looked back to as one of the greatest of English lawyers; for he was quite free from subtlety, so that it often took a long time to get the facts of any complicated case into his head.  He has also shown himself as weak a Judge as he was an amiable; as when he over-indulged Mrs. Weldon at the time that lady was active upon the law-path.  But he was a good Judge with a jury, whom he was well able at once to enlighten and to keep in hand; neither flying over their heads nor losing their respect.  He has now retired full of years and full of honour; and the whole Bar wishes him well in the private obscurity to which he has just descended from the Bench.''


	''He is known as a very honourable, courteous, and kindly-mannered man, who was generally popular with the Bar, although he sometimes allowed arguments before him to wax over-long.  He always dressed carefully and suitably, but he did not like to see sketches done in Court even by briefless barristers who had time to spare for such lightsome work; and though he never caught Mr. Lockwood in the flagrant crime, his vials of judicial wrath were once grievously poured out upon the head of a less careful stuff-gownsman whom he detected in the act of transferring a witness’s features to paper.  He plays upon the violin; he has translated Gray’s “Elegy” into Greek, and he has attempted to convert a book of the Iliad into Latin elegiacs.''


''	He looked a model Judge.  But he was never quite so good a Judge as he looked.''


	George Denman (1819-96) rowed No. 7 for Cambridge in the Boat Races of 1841 and 1842.  He won the Colquhoun Sculls in 1842, stroked his college boat to the head of the Cam, and rowed in the Grand from 1840 to 1843 for Trinity, the Cambridge Subscription Rooms, C.U.B.C., and Trinity again.  His 1843 Trinity crew lost to the full O.U.B.C. eight that went on to win the event by two lengths with only seven oarsmen, their stroke having gone ill and no substitutions permitted.  In an 1886 profile, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; wrote:  “Even now his Lordship regards with affection various trophies carried off in his more youthful days from Henley; and all this added much to his popularity, as such things always do.”{{ref|VF}} 


	Regarding Denman’s professional life:  he dedicated his 1871 translation of Gray’s “Elegy” into Greek to Sir Alexander Cockburn, the Lord Chief Justice -- and in the following year was appointed to the court of common pleas.  In 1873 Denman dedicated his translation of Pope’s “Iliad” into Latin to W.E. Gladstone, the Prime Minister -- and in 1875 became a justice of the common pleas division of the high court.  In 1881 he provided an English translation of H. Kynaston’s Latin hexameters for the fiftieth anniversary of the Boat Race -- and the same year became a judge on the queen’s bench division.


=== The 1841 Boat Race ===

[[File:1841 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The 1841 Boat Race]]
Denman’s own account:


''The Oxford and Cambridge Boatrace was to come off on Easter Tuesday, and during the whole of the Lent Term a crew, of which I was seven, was in practice.  The race in 1840 had been a very close affair, won by Cambridge after an apparently losing race up to Battersea Reach.  Several old oars remained in each boat. The new ones in ours were, W. Croker, Caius (9th Wrangler in 1839), my brother Lewis, Magdalene (two), Ritchie, Trinity (three), Cobbold, Peterhouse (five) and myself (seven); our steerer, too, was new, J. Croker, brother of our bow and 8th Wrangler in 1840.  Vialls, our stroke, and Somers-Cocks of Brasenose, the Oxford stroke, both Westminster men, had each rowed stroke in 1840.  The coxswains were new to the river and it seemed a very open affair.  The race in those days was from Westminster Bridge to Putney Bridge, 5¾ miles; about half an hour’s work with an average tide.  There were no police arrangements for keeping the course clear and it was often a ticklish work for the coxswains to decide whether to go ahead or astern of a train of barges catering across the river.  There was no practising at Ely in those days, nor any coaching from the banks, but, before coming to Town, the crew used to row at its best pace from the town-lock to Baitsbite, coached by the steerer, and the time occupied was, on an average, from nineteen to twenty-one minutes, according to the wind and stream prevailing at the time.''


	''When the time came for moving to London, our captain, C.M. Vialls, the old Westminster, determined to drive us up to London.  He was a capital whip who often drove the mail.  A good drag was hired, and we had a fine day and enjoyed the drive immensely.  Arrived in London, the majority of the crew took up its quarters at Ginger’s Hotel (which stood about where the booking-office of the District Railway for the Westminster Bridge Station now stands), but I and my brother ‘trained’ at home at my father’s house in Portland Place.  Our training was probably less rigid than that of the present day; but it was pretty strict, and our kind mother made no difficulty about it as far as diet was concerned.  The Broad Walk, which runs across the Regent’s Park above Portland Place towards the Zoological Gardens, was then just being made, and a part of our training was to run to the end of that walk and back before breakfast.  Then, in the course of the day, sooner or later, according to the tide, we walked to Searle’s boathouse (where St. Thomas’s Hospital now stands) and prepared to race to Putney against a crew of Cambridge Subscription Rooms (sometimes supplemented by a waterman or two), and this we did daily with two days’ exception until the day before the race, giving the other crew a long start of 200 or 300 yards and judging of our performance by the distance we had covered before we passed them, which generally occurred before half the course had been chased.''


	''The race, as I have said, was to be rowed on Easter Tuesday (April 13).  On the Good Friday the crew did not row together; but my brother Lewis and I took a wherry and paddled up the river with the intention of rowing to Richmond and back for exercise.  About 300 yards below Kew Bridge I, rowing bow and steering, or rather directing the steering (for we had no rudder), saw a boat ahead with a man’s face toward me about 100 yards off.   I took this to be a boat rowing in the same direction as we were; but in a few seconds I was undeceived by a tremendous blow on the shoulder, and the sight of a wherry’s sharp-pointed bow appearing close to my left ear.  The wherry was full of rough holiday-makers who rowed on triumphantly as our boat filled with water and gradually sank to the bottom not far from the shore, so that my brother got hold of the painter and pulled me and boat to the towing-path, and after he had bestowed his benediction on the enemy and emptied the boat, we again embarked and I tried to row.  It was in vain.  The pain was too great, and I felt quite sick from the attempt.  Happily at that moment we spied a four-oar, manned by some others of our crew, and it was arranged that I should go back as steerer of that boat and one of them take my place; and so I got back, in time, to Portland Place.  But what was to be done?  We did not dare to send for the doctor from fear that he might forbid me to row on Tuesday.  It was necessary to keep my mother and sisters in the dark for the same reason.  Happily the junior footman (George Pearman) was a man who seemed to know everything.  So we took him into counsel.  He had been a barber, and we had a notion that he might therefore possess some knowledge of surgery.  After gravely considering the case and inspecting the bruised shoulder, he advised us to allow him to fetch just one leech, which he very skillfully applied.   It was about the size of the two lower joints of a little finger when it began its meal, and nearly as large as a lemon when it rolled off satisfied.  George’s prescription was a complete success; for, though I was obliged to abstain from rowing on the next day and could not have practised on the following day, even if it had not been Sunday, I took my oar again on Monday, when we practised starts and had a few short rows, and on the following day was in my place, and felt no inconvenience from the accident, and we won the race by the unusually long interval of 1 minute and 5 seconds (about 360 yards).''


''	I may as well add that in the following year (1842) after a hard race and with a decidedly inferior stroke and three changes, all for the worse, in the crew, we were beaten by 13 seconds.  So that my career was a fair sample of the general result of the University match (six of one and half a dozen of the other).{{ref|Denman}}''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chitty, Joseph William == 

=== “The Umpire” (Spy), March 28, 1885 ===

[[Image:Chitty_JW_Vanity_Fair_1885-03-28.jpg|thumb|right]]''Ever since these isles were peopled, some Chitty or other has been always writing or editing books about English Law.  The present Judge of this distinguished name is not the offspring of Chitty’s Statutes or of Chitty on Contracts, but of Chitty’s Archbold -- that is to say, he is second son of the late Mr. Thomas Chitty, who was a very eminent and popular Special Pleader in his day.''

''Born seven-and-fifty years ago, young Joseph William was sent to Eton to do sums and learn his Latin grammar; and then, having proceeded to Balliol College, Oxford, by the aid of diligence and good ability he took a First Class in Classics in 1851, afterwards being elected a Fellow of Exeter, and becoming Vinerian Scholar in 1852.  Of course he next went in for Law; in 1856 was called to the Bar at Lincoln’s Inn (of which he was made a Bencher nineteen years later), took silk in 1874, grew to be the Leader in the Rolls Court, and carried on an enormous practice.  Strange to say, he omitted to pose as a legal author.  Presently he drifted into politics, and in 1880 he sat as a liberal M.P. for corrupt Oxford, in which posture he might possibly have remained, had he not, in September, 1881, been appointed a Judge of the Chancery Division in the room of Sir George Jessel, who was moved on to the Court of Appeal.''

''Like his father, Sir Joseph has always been a favourite with his fellow-men; and, being of a robust frame, he from time to time distinguished himself in various athletic exercises.  He rowed for his University, he took much interest in the Inns of Court Volunteers (of which he was a Major), and for many years he officiated as the Umpire at the Oxford and Cambridge Boat-Race.  When raised to the dignity of the Bench, however, he put away umpiring and lawn-tennis and similar childish things.  In Court he is agreeable, although his voice is very penetrating; but business progresses rather slowly there -- they say because he wants to talk quite as much as the Counsel appearing before him; wherefore they irreverently call him “Mr. Justice Chatty.”  The son of a lawyer, he married the daughter of a Judge.''

[[w:Joseph_William_Chitty|Joseph William Chitty]] (1828-99) followed J.J. Hornby two years closely behind:  a cricketer at Eton, then a rower (and cricketer) for Oxford at Balliol College.  He won the University Pairs in 1849-50 and the University Fours in 1850, rowed in the Boat Race in 1849 (both times) and 1852 and for O.U.B.C. in the Grand in 1850-51, there being no Easter Boat Race those years.  He also rowed for Balliol in the Goblets 1849-51 (with Hornby in 1850).  He was president of the O.U.B.C. for six months before the 1852 Boat Race, and umpired the event for 1857-73 and 1875-81, chairing the 1881 Boat Race jubilee dinner.

On stroking Oxford to victory in 1852 he cemented the term “Chitty’s crew” as the acme of rowing perfection (at least for clinker-built boats, and perhaps for some time after as well), which W.B. Woodgate recalled in his memoirs:

''I once saw, as a child, the great Joe Chitty row -- in a four (in practice for Henley, 1854).  He used when racing to row a terrific pace of stroke; so did his contemporary and fellow blue, R. Greenall, stroke of Brasenose.  Fifty-two to the minute was debited to them in the year of that date (1852)!  I fancy that the oars of the brief period of keeled outrigged racing eights were shorter than those of the epochs preceding and succeeding -- of “tub” and “keelless” respectively.  Those 66 feet long “parallelogram” eights had less “beam” than the Matt Taylor build which displaced them after 1856, and reduced in-board leverage tended to diminish proportions out-board.  Hence the pace of strokes in those times.{{ref|Woodgate}}'' 

Chitty became a lord justice of appeal in 1897 but died of influenza February 15, 1899, a month before Cambridge ended Oxford’s nine-year run in the Boat Race.  To him is credited the legal epigram:  “Truth will sometimes leak out even through an affidavit.”

=== The Four Secrets of Chitty’s Success ===
In 1886, “Davus” surveyed twenty-two “Judges of England” for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, including three rowers:  William Baliol Brett (then Baron Esher, Master of the Rolls), George Denman, and, reprinted here, Sir Joseph Chitty (July 10, 1886):

''This Judge comes of a book-making family, but, deserting precedent, he has not given his own name to any legal work.  Possibly this is well for his reputation, for the Honourable Sir Joseph is not a very great lawyer, and he often makes mistakes.  The son of Mr. Thomas Chitty of the Inner Temple, he was, as a matter of course, sent to the Bar.  There were no  examinations in those days, for competition, in the modern sense, was almost unknown; and Master Joseph kept his terms, and was duly “called” in 1856, at the rather advanced age of twenty-eight.  Since then he has got on well; but the fact that his much more able father, who was a very eminent lawyer and a very popular man, attained no higher position in his profession than that of a Special Pleader, while his less able son, in an age of infinitely keener competition, has been able to rise to the Bench, would seem to show that the latter has, to some extent, to thank friendly influence for the proud position he now occupies.  Not that Mr. Justice Chitty is wanting in brains.  His education at Eton and Balliol sufficed to get him a first class in classics at Oxford, which is quite equivalent to a second class in these later times, and which is a certificate of a fair amount of scholarship.  But he has given little proof of the family intellect beyond this, though on the river and in the cricket-field he has shown himself a robust athlete.''

''A man who has rowed in four University races may be said to have given the highest proof of what the Americans call “co-ordinated musculature”; and were that a qualification for the seat of judgment, Mr. Justice Chitty would not be easily surpassed as a Judge.  But that is not the case, and it may fairly be said that Sir Joseph is a better judge of a boat-race than of an intricate law case, just as he is far more highly appreciated in the first-named capacity than he is in the second.''

''But it would be unfair to attribute all Mr. Justice Chitty’s success in life to external pushing.  A great deal of it is, no doubt; but not all.  Four things combined to help Sir Joseph along the path to fame and the Bench, and one of these is not external to himself.  Let us take this last first.  Mr. Chitty entered upon his career with a name which in itself must have been an income to any owner who was not quite a stupid man.  Such a name would probably always ensure a fair start.  Every barrister knows that an honoured legal name is admired of solicitors.  There is at the Bar a young man who has not yet (or till recently had not) opened his mouth in a Court of Law, except perhaps to say a few formal words.  His professional income since his call -- only a very few years ago -- has averaged one thousand pounds.  He is the son of a very eminent legal authority, and his name is his fortune.  Probably Sir Joseph’s name was not worth so much as this to him, but it gave him a great advantage over his compeers.''

''Next, Sir Joseph had a legal birthright from his father, the Special Pleader, which was not to be despised.  A barrister in good practice can put work in the way of another in hundred different ways.  He generally does so if that other is his son.''

''Thirdly, Mr. Chitty married well.  It is a great thing for a barrister to be a Judge’s son.  The next best thing is to be a Judge’s son-in-law.  Mr. Chitty became one in good time.  Four years after his call to the Bar, just at the beginning of his career, he married a daughter of the late Lord Chief Baron Pollock, and he is probably one of that all too small number of men who after nearly thirty years of married life, have never regretted the step.  It is of course impossible to estimate the exact influence exerted upon his life by any man’s marriage; but it should never be forgotten how much the late Lord Beaconsfield used to attribute to a woman’s work on behalf of the man in whose career she was interested.''

''Lastly, Mr. Chitty was ever aided by his powers of ingratiating himself.  Three such guides to the Bench must of course be effective of much; and in the case of a man like Mr. Chitty, who always knew how to ingratiate himself, their assistance was probably even greater than might have been expected.  Here is the great secret of Mr. Justice Chitty’s success.  He has always known how to make himself popular.  As an Eton “wet-bob” he was popular amongst his fellows; at Oxford, where athletic prominence is always more or less productive of hero-worship, he made many friends; and, later, in keeping up his connection with things athletic, he acted with wisdom.  At the Bar he still retained his popularity, and he is now, as a man, thoroughly popular alike with the profession and the public.  All his life, moreover, he has been eminently a social man.  He knew how valuable was social influence, and, what is more, he knew how to excite the interest of others in himself.''

''Mr. Joseph Chitty did not take “silk” until after twenty years’ practice as a “stuff” gownsman.  When he did take it, his already large practice increased.  He became the leader in the Rolls Court presided over by the late Sir George Jessel, between whom and Mr. Chitty there existed a sincere friendship; and there every day he used to take his seat before a huge pile of briefs, which he proceeded to discuss with what outsiders called real ability, and really not without intelligence.  He was a poor advocate.  In a Common Law Court he would have been an inferior counsel; but he could state a case well enough, and little else was necessary in Sir George Jessel’s Court.  That consummate Judge only wanted the points of a case to be laid before him.  He would then pronounce an impromptu judgment as aptly worded as it was conclusive.''

''After five years of this work, Mr. Chitty went into Parliament.  He chose Oxford for his constituency, where his name was remembered.  In the Corn Exchange he was greeted with shouts of “Well rowed, Chitty.”  He made a few second-rate harangues, and was returned.  A year later he was made a Judge, his brief Parliamentary career being unrelieved by any attempt at oratorical or other brilliance.  But he had served his Party.''

''As a Judge there is nothing brilliant about Mr. Justice Chitty.  Irreverent juniors sometimes go so far as to speak of him as “an old woman.”  They would not do this if he commanded all the respect that is due to a Judge of the High Court.  Sir Joseph has the reputation of being a hard worker, and doubtless he has worked hard enough in his time.  Now however, in his judicial capacity, all that is changed, and although he does not shirk work, and sits longer than some other Judges, yet his Court is not famous for the speed of its business.  Sir Joseph is a good-humoured Judge, and on very friendly terms with some of his old colleagues who practise before him.  So there is a great deal of unnecessary talking done in his Court, which is certainly not so much the fault of the eminent counsel referred to, whose time is money, as of the Judge, whose income is fixed.  It has been said of Sir Joseph that he wants to do all the talking, and that counsel are a superfluity in his Court.  But this is not so; for, being a weak Judge, he is always open to argument, and before no other Judge are plausible arguments so useful.  Still, his nickname of “Mr. Justice Chatty” has been well earned.  Hardly ever is a counsel allowed to speak before him for two minutes altogether uninterrupted by some question, which, however relevant it may be, puts the speaker out and is wasteful of time.  A good counsel can always state his case better by himself, if allowed a fair hearing.  With Messrs. Romer, Ince, and MacNaghten, Mr. Justice Chitty forms quite a little family party, and it is quite refreshing to hear one or more of this trio offering suggestions to the Judge as to how he should proceed in cases in which they are not retained at all.  This is commonly done in Sir Joseph’s Court, and, however valuable to his Lordship such assistance may be, it does not add to his judicial dignity.  It will be gathered that it is quite possible for a clever counsel to turn this Judge round to his way of thinking, even when he has mentally decided (rightly) to give judgment against him.  So there are many appeals against Mr. Justice Chitty’s decisions.  In his favour however it may be said that Sir Joseph has a powerful voice, which is by no means an unmixed curse.  He can always be heard.  Some Judges cannot.''

''I have said that Mr. Justice Chitty is very popular, and I have given reasons for the fact.  But there is one strong reason as yet unnoticed.  When a counsel wins a case, he often gets judgment without costs, these being in the discretion of the presiding Judge.  But this particular Judge does not exercise this discretion.  He always allows everybody the fullest possible costs.  Counsel and solicitors like this.  It does not add much sorrow to the defeat, but it does add great joy to the victory.  Everyone likes to get his costs.  This is rather cheaply earned popularity, but it is not clear that his Lordship is so mild in the matter of costs merely for the sake of gratifying litigants.  He may have other reasons; but the fact remains as I have stated.''

''Quite recently, Mr. Justice Chitty has eclipsed the record in the matter of judicial jokes.  Some plaster fell from the ceiling of the Court in which his Lordship was sitting, whereupon, without looking up, he remarked,'' “[[w:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_justitia_ruat_caelum|Fiat Justitia, ruat caelum]].”   ''This was apt.  It was a great opportunity, it is true, but credit is due his Lordship for his promptness in seizing it.  A good judicial joke is pardonable; but there are so very few of them.  Mr. Justice Chitty always wears two wigs in Court, which must be rather trying in the present hot weather.  I have heard it stated that he was born without hair or teeth, as to the latter part of which statement I believe it may be relied upon.  He certainly wears false hair and false teeth now, and has done so all the years I have known him.  He is said never to have possessed any of his own on or in his head; but this is a secret.''

''If Mr. Justice Chitty’s decisions were a good deal sounder, and if they were arrived at with considerably more speed, Sir Joseph might be a good Judge.  In other words, without committing any startling improprieties, he is commonplace in his rank.  But his faults are negative faults.  He is a very respectable man of moderate legal attainments.	&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Davus&lt;/span&gt;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Peel, Arthur Wellesley (''Viscount Peel'') == 

=== “The Speaker” (Spy), July 2, 1887 ===

[[Image:Peel_AW_Vanity_Fair_1887-07-02.jpg|thumb|right]]''It is nearly eight{{ref|sic}}  years since the celebrated Tory who emancipated the Roman Catholics, passed the Bank Charter Act, repealed the Corn Laws, and gave a name to a Party, first entered Parliament; and the name of Peel is still illustrious.  For the celebrated statesman’s eldest son is Sir Robert Peel, and his youngest son is Speaker of the House of Commons.''

''Mr. Peel was born eight-and-fifty years ago, went to Eton and to Oxford, married and had many children, and, announcing himself, according to the amended family traditions of that time, as Liberal, he, at the age of four-and-thirty, stood for Coventry, where he was defeated.  But at six-and-thirty he was returned for Warwick, for which he has since sat; and in February, 1884, he was elected Speaker of the House of Commons, an office which he still holds.''

''Although Mr. Speaker Peel cannot be considered so conspicuous a success as Lord Eversley or some others who have filled the Chair, he is a very good and, in some respects, a very admirable Speaker.  He speaks himself perhaps too often, too readily, and too much at length; but he has a high sense of what is due to the House; and if his tone and manner are sometimes a shade too peremptory, and his weight too invariably thrown on the side of the Government of the day, of whatever Party that Government might be, it must be remembered that an entirely new position of dictatorship over the House and of protectorate over the Ministry has within the last few years been created for the Speaker; and that he who was once the Servant of the House has now been made its Master -- under the Ministerial Concert.  Moreover, it is also to be remembered that the older and sounder traditions of the House of Commons were founded upon the assumption that it was an assembly of gentlemen, and that in these days the Speaker has to deal with men who are in no sense gentle, and that he often has to wrestle with vulgarity and defiance.''

''Mr. Speaker Peel is scrupulously, even nervously, impartial, even towards those Irish Members who regard and treat him as their natural enemy.  He is very, very dignified; he has a most imposing and austere presence; and he possesses a sonorous voice and a Jove-like aspect.  With the officials of the House he is popular, and in private life is a most amiable, high-minded, honourable gentleman, with all the sound tastes and honest learning of a highly-cultivated country squire.''

''His legs are beautiful; and it is suspected that he would, without serious displeasure, see Mr. Tim Healy hanged, drawn, and quartered.''

[[w:Arthur_Peel%2C_1st_Viscount_Peel|Arthur Wellesley Peel]] (1829-1912) took the Eton and Balliol path of Northcote, Hornby, and Chitty, but his sole rowing accomplishment was to row for his college in the Visitors’ in 1851.  His crew apparently would have rowed in the Stewards’ as well, but had to scratch because the Master of Balliol detained them too long to make the race.  In this respect Peel was unfortunate to have preceded Edmond Warre at Balliol by half a dozen years, for Warre, who compiled a stunning record in both academics and rowing, cleared the path for future river aspirants by convincing Benjamin Jowett, the new Master, of the social and moral value of rowing in college life.{{ref|Warre}} 

Peel’s appearance in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; followed three months’ performance of a delicate political balance rooted in the question of Irish home rule.  Leslie Ward’s caricature captures the essence:  gravity and power in the aquiline profile, the massive wig, and the long dark robe, upturned to suggest some unseen minion carrying the trailing edge, but with a daintiness of touch, the fine hands fingering white gloves and the slender feet tip-toeing as if on hot coals.  In 1882 the House of Commons gave the Speaker the power to determine when closure should be applied, in response to the obstructionist tactics of the growing number of Irish members.  In 1885 Peel became the first to use it.  The power was adjusted in 1887 to provide a more even distribution between the speaker and members, but in practice Peel remained responsible for driving day to day business.  On retiring in 1895, he was created Viscount Peel of Sandy, chaired a royal commission on liquor licensing (pro-temperance, but not teetotaling), and was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery and British Museum, among other charitable work.

=== University Sports, Part I:  Brutal Athletes and Effeminate Fops ===
“Sport is being made too much of with men rowing until there comes upon us a fear that they are killing themselves or they are nothing,” wrote Anthony Trollope in 1868.{{ref|Trollope}}   &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;'s opinion (October 18, 1873) may well have come from W.B. Woodgate, ever the sympathetic recruiter, but this cannot be confirmed:

''At this season men returning to Oxford or Cambridge are thinking of the race which is to come off next Easter at Putney, and are electing the Presidents of their respective boat-clubs, on whom no small share of the responsibility for victory or defeat next Easter will fall.  The ardent freshman is embarking upon his aquatic career in blissful ignorance of the pains that are before him, while Paterfamilias is chuckling at the thought of the honours young hopeful is to achieve in the Schools or Tripos.  Of late years rowing has been made very much of both at the Universities and elsewhere.  So violently has it been paraded before the eyes of Paterfamilias, who sends his sons to the University to develop their intellect and not their muscle, that he has begun to think that all this is too much of a good thing, and that young men are being taught to take the shadow for the reality.  Hence arises much misunderstanding, and good men are lost to the University boat in consequence.''

''In the first place a word on the question of health.  Dr. Skey says that constitutions are ruined by rowing.  Some have been no doubt, but very few.  Excessive rowing will doubtless strain the strongest frame; and there are many constitutions whose owners ought to know better than to strain them at all.  But those who have personal experience are almost unanimous in saying that a man of fair average strength may row the hardest race and the longest course that has ever been rowed without the smallest injury to health or constitution.  And in a book lately published by Dr. Morgan, himself a physician and an “oar,” it is proved to demonstration that a vast deal of actual good is done to men at Oxford and Cambridge by the rowing they do there.  As things go at present boys at school row as hard and as much as men at college, and seem none the worse for it.  Whether it is prudent to distress boys to the extreme limit appears to be doubtful.  At all events it is a point on which those who have charge of boys ought to be quite decided.''

''Of all the amusements of University men rowing is the one most calculated to affect a man’s character.  Not that sitting at the end of an oar is likely to do so, but the life and habits which are inseparable from rowing are worth considering.  At the University the life of a rowing man is different to that of other men.  Besides keeping different hours, eating different food, and such small matters, he is to some extent shut out from the society of his own choice, and tied down to that of eight men whom he may know or not, like or not, and who are chosen haphazard, at all events as to their social capacities.  And to these men he is tied sometimes for weeks, and is continually with them.  He can no more get away from them than a passenger on board an Australian clipper can get away from his fellow-passengers.  It is in his relations with these compulsory messmates that his character may be improved or otherwise.''

''The undergraduates at Oxford have been said by high authority to consist of brutal athletes and effeminate fops -- a saying worthy of Mr. Disraeli; but surely it is not true.  Is it supposed that mind and body cannot be developed at the same time -- that while the intellectual forcing process is going on the physical energies must be suppressed?  It was Plato who started this theory; but training in his days was a very different matter to ours.  After sitting there is a relief in standing, so after reading sharp physical exertion is refreshing.''

''Now there are rowing men and rowing men.  There are some -- they are few -- who make rowing the sole end and aim of their University career:  there are others, and they are many, to whom rowing is at once exercise and relaxation.  Of those who row and do nothing else not much need be said:  at all events we may be sure of this much, that if they did not row they would be at something worse.''

''The effeminate fop element is a much more dangerous one, and includes a vast number of those called “loafers.”  Surely it were better to row than to loaf?''

''There is a process much associated with rowing called “going out of training,” and it is one which has done much to bring the rowing man’s life into disrepute.  It seems to be supposed that a month or two’s training produces a violent thirst after dissipation, and that the moment of a boat’s passing the winning-post is the signal for a violent reaction from the constraint of training and a strange desire to do everything that training forbids.  Now there is no connection in the nature of things between going out of training and making a beast of oneself.   Nor is there any mysterious power in beefsteaks to demoralise a man or produce the effects popularly ascribed to them.  On the contrary, “bump suppers” and the festivities consequent upon a race are celebrated chiefly by that numerous and festive community who never miss an opportunity for the consumption of vast quantities of bad champagne.  At such times rowing men are not better and no worse than others -- the festive soul is festive and the sober man is sober then.  As a rule the organised debauch which goes by the name of a bump supper is more of a bore to the rowing man than to anyone else, for the reason that his lungs and digestion are not yet acclimatised to an atmosphere of smoke and an alderman’s dinner.   On such occasions he has even been known to sigh for his accustomed chop and glass of port.''

. . . .

''It is too well-known a fact to require more than a passing notice that many of the most distinguished oars of the present and past times are men who have taken the highest honours.  Of such Warre of Balliol is perhaps the best known type; of the aquatic world he is now'' facile princeps.{{ref|facile}}   ''It would be an endless and invidious task to count up all such men; in the Oxford crews alone of the last ten years about one-quarter are honour-men.  Intellectual ability will always obtain its proper share of respect among men -- sometimes it is worshipped to an extravagant extent; but among boys the case is different.  More reason why any occupation which throws Past and Class men together must be for the advantage of both.  The benefit is mutual.  The reading men would miss half the point of University life without rowing or some such common ground of interest and association with their fellows, and rowing would most assuredly suffer from the absence of the intellectual element in their crews, and that in more ways than one.  The late successes of Oxford were to be directly traced to the times when she had men for presidents of her boat-club who were of the sort who take high honours in the schools.  The presidencies of such men leave their mark and bear fruit for years.''

''Muscular Christianity may be cried down, and brutal athletes may be abused; but this much is certain, that it will be an evil day for the Universities and for the rowing men who go there when rowing is no more.  Only let there be reason and moderation; keep out the penny-a-liners if possible, and don’t let us hear so much of “aquatic Derbies” and such claptrap.  There is an unnatural, exaggerated tone about the Putney race which looks dangerous.  The British public goes mad sometimes; unfortunately for the objects of its madness, they are always the first to suffer.  Albert the Good, exhibitions, volunteers, the ring, and now it seems the turf, have all been victims.  Let us take care that rowing keeps clear of the infection.''  “Sit modus in rebus,”{{ref|rebus}} ''and don’t let us have our hobby overridden.  The fuss that is made every year about the sixteen young men who row against each other at Putney is enough to turn their heads.  There has been a vast deal more talk than necessary about University races of later years; you would think the very cab-drivers were Oxford or Cambridge men from the amount of blue ribbon they brandish about on the day of the race.  What do the cabbies care about rowing?  For the matter of that, what do the half-million people who line the river banks from Putney to Mortlake care about the race?  They scarcely know one boat from the other, if they see them at all; many never do see them at all, and perhaps don’t care to.  We had rather see a score or two of old University men cheering on their crews than half-a-million of the British public screaming at the boats.  Well is it for rowing that the Putney race comes but once a-year.  Once let the thing be overdone, a reaction will set in, public opinion will go round with a swing, and then good-bye to rowing and all the good it does.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Macnaghten, Edward == 

=== “He Succeeded Lord Blackburn” (Spy), October 31, 1895 ===

[[Image:Macnaghten_E_Vanity_Fair_1895-10-31.jpg|thumb|right]]''He is Edward Macnaghten of Runkerry, in County Antrim; and he traces back his lineage to one of the three clans that were descended from the old Maomors of Moray, who were Sovereigns among the Picts.  In the twelfth century these Macnaghtens became the Thanes of Loch Tay; and in the sixteenth century, one of them, “Shane Dhu,” having gone to Ireland as Secretary of the first Earl of Antrim, they settled there.  This particular Macnaghten (who is brother of Sir Francis Macnaghten, Bart.) was born five-and-sixty years ago; and, preferring Trinity, Cambridge, before Trinity, Dublin, came to England and was made a graduate and a Fellow of that foundation; since which time he has found life in England profitable.  He got called to the Bar, and married the daughter of the late Baron Martin; took silk and went into Parliament for his own County (Antrim); changed his seat on redistribution for North Antrim; and sat for that Division until eight years ago, when he succeeded Lord Blackburn as a life Peer and a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.''

''He is one of those happy men who have never had to work hard; and his face shows it.  At Cambridge he rowed in the Eight; and as a silk he practised before Mr. Justice Chitty, who had rowed in the Oxford Eight.  He has always been well off, and he became the husband of the Judge’s daughter.  Nevertheless he is a sound lawyer who has been heard to attribute his success at the Bar to the glassy eye of the old frequenter of the Court, which fixed itself upon him when he first rose, and put him on his mettle.  Though he had a perfectly safe seat, it seemed ridiculous that he should be created a Law Lord when he had never been on the Bench, upon which was sitting such a man as the late Lord Bowen, who ought to have gone up before him; nevertheless his elevation was no job, but quite an unexceptionable appointment; and he has not discredited his high office.''

''He is a good, cheerful fellow, an excellent host, and a kindly-hearted man.''

[[w:Edward_Macnaghten%2C_Baron_Macnaghten|Edward Macnaghten]] (1830-1913) arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1850 from three years at Trinity College, Dublin, and promptly made his mark in both rowing and sculling.  He won the Colquhoun Sculls, University Pairs, and Visitors’ Challenge Cup in 1851, the Diamonds in 1852, the Ladies’ in 1853-54, and the Grand in 1854, all under the colors of First Trinity or the C.U.B.C.  “[T]he ovation which he received from Oxford and Cambridge alike” for winning the Diamonds “was said to be ''sui generis''.”{{ref|Almanac1}}   A lightweight, he stroked Cambridge at 10 stone 6 lbs. against Oxford in the 1853 Grand, there being no Easter Boat Race that year.  The Henley course then in use had a bend, and Cambridge on the outside were unable to push their lead at the Point enough to take Oxford’s water, who at the corner pushed back to win by eighteen inches.  Macnaghten’s rowing contemporaries said he “was the most tearing and staying man of his weight, and that a crew of twelve-stone Macnaghtens could have ‘licked creation.’”{{ref|Almanac2}}   He later coached Cambridge on several occasions.

Macnaghten reportedly “[took] to the law rather because he could find nothing else to do than for any other reason,” but became an engaged and gifted practitioner.{{ref|DNB1}}   In the House of Commons he focused on legal and Irish subjects, although it does not appear he was among the Irish members who especially vexed Speaker Peel.  His 1886 speech on the pending home rule bill “long and excellent, abounding  in happy quotations and equally happy sarcasms.”{{ref|DNB2}}   Still, given his Irish antecedents and sympathies on the one hand, and his demonstrated legal talent on the other, perhaps his elevation to the bench was the prudent course for the Government. In any case the appointment proved no mistake, for

''he possessed in happy combination the gifts of listening with patience and deciding without doubt, after bringing to bear his great range of unobtruded learning and a clear practical appreciation of business and character.  Others in his time were as erudite and his equals in acumen, but it was remarkable that both bench and bar fell into the way of citing a sentence or two of Macnaghten and accepting it without discussion as an authoritative statement of the law.{{ref|DNB3}}'' 

He chaired the Council of Legal Education from 1895 until his death in 1913.

=== Sporting Judges ===
As an ex-Blue and accomplished jurist, perhaps Macnaghten was the sort of “luminary imbued with sporting principles” that Woodgate found in one Judge McConnell, K.C., chairman of the North London Sessions:

''Once I was instructed in some petty prosecution before him.  It seemed likely to come on that day.  An inspector of police, who knew that I had been guilty of the river in my youth, approached me and sounded me whether it would be possible to let the case stand over to the morrow; because a young policeman engaged in it was stroking a police four, and the police regatta was going on that day at Hammersmith.  I at once entered McConnell’s Court, and made application for adjournment, boldly telling the true reason for the request.  McConnell at once said:  “Any application from you on an aquatic matter has every claim on the Bench” -- and at once made the order.''

''Off went the young stroke, as happy as a sandboy.  Next day, when I attended for the trial we heard that he had won two races, thanks to McConnell’s sporting good-fellowship.''

''Another time, on the morning of a Tuesday of a Henley regatta, I put in an appearance in McConnell’s Court, hoping to finish what I had in hand before lunch, and to catch a train to the river.  To save time in changing clothes I had donned a Leander Club dark serge coat and waistcoat, with the club gilt buttons, thinking it would pass muster sufficiently under the folds of a gown.''

''McConnell divined the costume and situation as he nodded to me from the Bench.  He dropped a pencil line by an usher:  “Dear W., your attire is more aquatic than forensic:  you had better catch the first train for Henley.  I will see that your interests are duly looked after here!”{{ref|Woodgate}}''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 1855 - 1871:  Dr. Warre and Fixed-Seat Orthodoxy ==


In 1855, the Royal Chester Rowing Club won the Wyfolds and Stewards’ in a “carvel” four – that is, a “shell” boat with a perfectly smooth hull and an interior keel, as opposed to a “clinker-built” of overlapping planks on an exterior keel.  To put to rest any lingering doubts about the superiority of the new design, the next year they returned in a carvel eight to win the Grand and Ladies’.  Carvel boats immediately became the standard for gentlemen amateurs, and a Balliol undergraduate named Edmond Warre became their archbishop in the new religion of how to row them.  “Rowing” itself became an accepted term for the new “scientific oarsmanship,” having formerly been associated with “rowdy” but now used to distinguish racing from recreational branch of “aquatics,” which now went under the banner “boating.”{{ref|Wigglesworth1}}   


The Royal Chester boat had roots in the modified fishing cobles or “gigs” in which Cornish pilots raced out to incoming ships.  Though clinker-built, to withstand the surf and stony beaches, these gigs were relatively light with a high bow and low gunwales and stern.  Exeter College, Oxford brought one from Plymouth for the 1824 university bumping races, and the Cornish influence spread to boatyards in London, Oxford, and Cambridge.  Having no outrigger, an oarsman sat flush against the gunwale opposite his oar for maximum leverage, on a fixed seat, and used long “fish-tail” sweep oars with narrow blades.  With this design, speed went to the crew with the strongest groin, back and arm muscles, who could best strike a rhythm of steep forward and backward “swing” from the waist to “catch” the greatest arc of water.


[[Image:Scullers_with_outriggers_1851.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Scullers with outriggers, no sliding seats, 1851]]These southern clinker-built boats of the early nineteenth century, while considerably heavier than modern shells, had a significant weight advantage over their northern counterparts that remained basically designed for trade.  The northerners compensated by innovating with outriggers, oars, and eventually boat design as well.  While the concept of outriggers – moving the fulcrum away from the gunwale to increase leverage -- had been known for years, it was not until 1828 that relatively sophisticated wooden ones were first fitted to a boat and, somewhat later, that an iron version was introduced, both by Tyneside boatbuilders.  Since an outrigged boat provided better leverage than the off-set positions of an unrigged “cutter,” the northerners redesigned the boat itself to put the crew in line and thereby narrow and lighten it, adding length to provide the necessary “state room” for body swing and arm pull.  Chitty’s crew rowed in this new “parallelogram” design in the early 1850s.  In addition, [[w:Harry_Clasper|Harry Clasper]] of Newcastle, the most famous of the Tyneside builders, developed the first modern oars with a shorter loom and wider blade than the fish-tail style, to provide a better grip on the water.  With outrigged boats and “Clasper’s sculls,” crews so equipped adapted their technique to row a stroke “peculiar to themselves.”


[[Image:Matt_Taylor_1855.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Matt Taylor with the Royal Chester IV, 1855]]Such was the southern judgment on the style of Clasper’s own crew at the 1844 Thames Regatta, an event that brought north and south together from 1843 to 1850.  Losing in 1844 to Robert Coombes’ London crew which had the benefit of the Cornish tradition of lighter construction, Clasper returned to Newcastle determined to make his own boats ligher and faster yet.  He ended up replacing the heavy, overlapping planking of clinker-built boats with lighter planks set side by side, moving the keel inside to make the hull perfectly smooth, and reducing the width from three and a half feet to two.  With this new “carvel” design he returned to the Thames  Regatta in 1845 and won convincingly.  The Boat Race crews adopted outriggers the next year, and carvel-built boats became popular, though it was another nine years before the Royal Chester victories at Henley fully swayed the gentlemen amateur establishment.  Royal Chester got their boat from Matthew Taylor, a professional shipwright from Ouseburn on Tyne.  In 1857 Taylor supplied Oxford with a winning boat, twelve feet shorter and with the beam farther forward than a keeled parallelogram design.  Edmond Warre, who rowed No. 6 for Oxford in 1857, was so impressed that a few years later he retained Taylor as boatbuilder for Eton.  In 1901 Warre sought to emulate Taylor’s 1857 design in a boat he commissioned for the winning Oxford crew in which his son, F.W. Warre, was president.{{ref|various}} 


[[File:Great Western Railway schedule for the Henley Regatta.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Great Western Railway schedule for the Henley Regatta, July 5, 1893]]Apart from the advent of carvel boats, outriggers, and Clasper sculls, railways were another technical development that marked the rowing landscape from roughly 1850 onward, though with more subtle effect.  Before railways, a club could compete against any of its neighbors within rowing distance but had hardly any contact with oarsmen elsewhere.  As rail systems expanded throughout the country, starting in the 1840s and virtually complete thirty years later, oarsmen and spectators could travel farther afield.  The Great Western Railway linked Paddington to Twyford in 1843 and added a branch line to Henley in 1857.  The size and number of regattas increased noticeably during the 1870s.  The Prince of Wales began to attend the Henley Regatta, drawing a whole social set along from London; in 1906, the G.W.R. carried 31,000 to the regatta.  In addition, as railways fostered suburban development, they indirectly gave rise to new clubs that emerged to service the new communities, such as London R.C. at Putney (1856), Kingston R.C. (1858), Twickenham R.C. (1860), Molesey R.C. (1866), and Staines R.C. (1866).{{ref|various2}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Afghanistan has a wide varying landscape allowing for many different crops. Afghan food is largely based upon the nation's chief crops: cereals like wheat, maize, barley and rice . Accompanying these staples are dairy products (yogurt, whey), various nuts, and native vegetables, and fresh and dried fruits; Afghanistan is well known for its grapes. Afghanistan's culinary specialties reflect its ethnic and geographic diversity and has similarities with neighboring Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Pakistan

===Kabul influence on Afghan cuisine===

Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, is a multi-ethnic city and has always been so. As the seat of government for the Pashtun Afghan kings, food was an important part of royal life. Chefs were commissioned from all over the empire and places afar. They are credited for creating a myriad of dishes, blending different styles and in the process creating the best examples of true Afghan cooking. Their creations include exotic kormas, palaos, sumptious rice dishes, desserts, and other creative items. These royal chefs passed down their art to aristocrat denizens of Kabul, they in turn to others. Several attempts were made to record the arts of the royal chefs. Two such publications have been published. The first one, published in Afghanistan in the early 1900s recorded the ingredients and cooking styles of Afghanistan's monarchy. The second, called Aushpazi, by Wali Zikria, published in the United States in English, during the early 1990s, was essentially the cookbook of one of Afghanistan's royal houses.

===Table spread===
[[Image:Afghani dinner.jpg|thumb|180px|Afghan dinner]]
Known as the destarkhan or sofrah, the table spread is an important expression of culture in Afghanistan.  Regardless of economic status, creating an adequate destarkhan is important to any family, especially when having guests. A large cloth will most likely be spread over a traditional rug in the living area or on a formal dining table.  Most likely a young member of the family will present a &quot;aftabah wa lagan&quot;, a copper basin and elaborate pot filled with water for the household to wash their hands in.  He or she will go around the destarkhan to each member, pour water over the hands. Soap is provided, as is a drying cloth.  The destarkhan is then dutifully filled with breads, accompaniments, relishes, appetizers, main courses, salads, rice, and fruits. Arrangement of foods is important when having guests; they must have easy access to the specialty foods.  Young children are taught how to spread a good destarkhan and will be busy helping their parents.

==Breads and accompaniment==
[[Image:Afghan bread.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Afghani bread]]
There are mainly three types of Afghan  bread
*[[Cookbook:Naan|Naan]] - Literally &quot;bread&quot;. Thin, long and oval shaped, its mainly a white/whole wheat blend. Topped with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, [[Cookbook:Nigella|nigella]] seeds, or some combination of these.  Upon request, customers may be able to get all white flour and helping of oil, which makes it rich and delicious.  
*Obi Non - Uzbek-style bread. Shaped like a disc and thicker than naan.  Usually made with white flour.
*Lavash - Very thin bread. Similar to the Lavash elsewhere.  Usually used as plating for meats and stews.
*Torshi - Various pickled fruits (i.e., peaches) and vegetables (eggplant, garlic, lemon) mixed with vinegar and spices.  
*Chatney - Pepper sauces.  Usually made with vinegar, fresh cilantro, chili peppers, and sometimes tomato paste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Warre, Edmond == 

=== “The Head” (Spy), June 20, 1885 ===
[[Image:Warre_E_Vanity_Fair_1885-06-20.jpg|thumb|right]]''The Warres are an old Somersetshire family, and Edmond Warre was born eight-and-forty years ago.  He was educated at Eton, where he distinguished himself by availing himself of the opportunities which that place affords for instruction.  He then went to Balliol College, where he further distinguished himself, and finally became a Fellow of All Souls.  At twenty-three he returned to Eton as an Assistant-Master of that Seminary.''

''Dr. Warre was known in his youth as a lover of athletic excercises.  He rowed in the University Eight in the years 1857 and 1858.  He became the President of the Oxford University Boat Club in 1859, and he took a principal share in the raising of the Oxford University Corps of Volunteers, of which he was the first Captain.  On his return to Eton he also took an active part in raising the Eton Corps of Volunteers, in which he became first Captain, then a Major, and of which he was finally made Honorary Colonel.''

''Dr. Warre is a very able and a very energetic man; and from his advent to the position of “Head” Eton may expect many reforms.  He is not deterred by the labour of entering into details.  He is firm in his intention to make Eton a place for teaching knowledge as well as manners, and he has set his face against the extravagance which has too long distinguished the School.  He has also contrived to render birching so odious that it has become rare and discreditable, instead of being frequent and honourable; and he has a determination and energy and a love for and devotion to Eton which should bear good fruit.''

Edmond Warre (1837-1920) achieved greater combined academic and athletic success at Eton and Balliol College than his &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; predecessors at those places -- S.H. Northcote, J.J. Hornby, J.W. Chitty, and A.W. Peel.  At Eton he won the School Pulling for coxed pairs.  At Oxford, he went Head of the River with Balliol in 1855 and 1859, won the University Sculls and Pairs in 1855-56, the University Fours in 1856 and 1858, and was O.U.B.C. president in 1858 (not 1859).  He rowed for Balliol or the O.U.B.C. in various combinations of the Diamonds, Goblets, Ladies’, and Grand from 1855 through 1859, as well as the tideway Boat Races of 1857-58.  In 1856 he declined to row in the University eight because of his academic demands, and finished his course with firsts in both classics and moderations and in 1859 became a fellow of All Souls’.  He founded the Oxford volunteer rifle corps and later co-founded the National Rifle Association.

[[Image:Edmond_Warre_c1855.jpg|thumb|right|Edmond Warre, c. 1855]]Warre’s career began by accident.  He had been leaning toward the bar or army, but returned to Eton at the request of his former tutor who had fallen ill.  Accepting a mastership in 1861, Warre gave up his Oxford post, married, and, writing to his sister that “I feel education is my work in life and the one in which I shall show God’s work to this generation,” did just that for the next forty-odd years, all at Eton.  From the start his ability, care, and Oxford reputation drew talented students.  One of the first, Sir William Anson, recalled:  “We all thought it creditable to work, a new idea to most of us.”  Of the twenty-one he sent to university in 1864 three became fellows of colleges, and in the 1890s all three of the Indian governors and two governors-general were Warre graduates.  Warre became a deacon and priest in 1867, the year J.J. Hornby became headmaster, and loyally supported him for the next seventeen years.

In 1884, on Hornby’s ascent to semi-retirement as provost, Warre advanced to headmaster and brought his energy and academic standards to bear on the whole Eton student body.  Guy Nickalls was a near-casualty:  “I cannot think the teaching was good [under Hornby].  If you got through ‘Trials’ at the end of term you moved up automatically; thus it was that I attained the First Hundred, and rose to be ‘up to’ Ainger in the second division.  Unluckily for me, Warre’s ideas of competitive scholarship were different from Hornby’s, and my chances of getting into the sixth form quickly vanished.  Under the new régime I began to descend again very quickly, and it was only my timely transfer to Oxford in 1886 that prevented me from becoming a Lower boy again.”{{ref|Nickalls1}}   By the mid-1890s Warre began to decline physically.  He resigned in 1905, was recalled to the provostship in 1909, retired again in 1918, and died two years later.

As coach Warre was the oracle of “orthodox” fixed-seat rowing, imprinting the Etonian style on generations of disciples, including fourteen &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rowers,  who carried it with them to Oxbridge and beyond.{{ref|list}}  S.D. Muttlebury recalled practicing in a stationary gig without footstraps, with Warre laying his hand on Muttle’s foot during the recovery and saying:  “Your feet ''look'' right, but you are still trying to pull up with your great toe.”  “I thought it a fad then,” wrote Muttlebury, “but I am convinced that it is one of the most important points in rowing.”{{ref|Fletcher}}   From 1860 to 1884, when Warre became headmaster and passed the coaching baton to S.A. Donaldson (Eton ‘72 and later Master of Magdalene, Cambridge), Warre “was practically alone on the towpath”{{ref|EBB}}  and turned out a succession of eights for Henley starting in 1861, all trained more or less identically, all more or less successful.{{ref|Bourne1}}  At Henley in 1866, of the twenty-eight medals awarded for fours and eights, twenty-seven went to nineteen Etonians, seventeen of whom had been or were then students of Warre.{{ref|Burnelll}}  

The advent of sliding seats in Oxbridge rowing after 1872 and resulting changes in the physics of rowing -- of style -- caused a religious schism.  Detractors such as Guy Nickalls said Warre never fully adapted:  “Warre was nothing if not a stickler for form, the arched back (inwards) and the slide held until the swing was almost completed, alone appealed to him. . . . [He] never liked my rowing -- I think merely because I understood the use of a slide (and he did not).”{{ref|Nickalls2}}   Defenders, such as G.C. Bourne, said Warre did understand:

''[I]t has been suggested of late years that Dr. Warre cared only for straight backs and neat form.  That is a travesty of the truth.  He preferred, and rightly preferred, polished oarsmanship, because, in his experience, it was more commonly than not associated with a sharp catch of the water at the beginning of the stroke.  But he was much too good a judge of rowing to prefer a formal straight-backed oarsman without any catch to a rougher one who had a catch.  What he cared for more than anything else was the catch at the beginning.  Given that, he would overlook many defects in style.  It has been said that he never appreciated or understood the use of the slide.  The truth is, I believe, that he understood it a great deal better than either the Metropolitan or University oarsmen of the period of which I am writing [c. 1878-81].  He disliked the Metropolitan style because it involved too exclusive use of the legs.  The remarkable Canadian sculler, Edward Hanlan, had only recently arrived in England, and the secret of his pace, the perfect combination of slide and body work, was not yet fully understood.  The Metropolitan oarsmen were already using 16-in. slides, and even the best of them “shot” their slides.  This Dr. Warre would not tolerate, but he avoided falling into the opposite extreme of “holding the slide”.  His maxim, often repeated, was “work comes from the stretcher”, and he clearly perceived that, if the sharp catch at the beginning of the stroke is truly taken from the stretcher, the slide must move back to a certain extent.  But he insisted on a sharp lift of the body contemporaneously with the movement of the slide, and therefore in practice taught what is the accepted rule to-day, that at the beginning of the stroke slide and swing go back together, but the swing goes much faster than the slide.  He never taught us to hold our slides, of that I am positive, and the proof is that every Eton oarsman of those days, when he arrived at Oxford, was told that he was sliding too soon and only too often lost all true stretcher work in his attempt to conform to the prevailing fashion of holding the slide.{{ref|Bourne2}}''

== On the Grammar of Rowing== 
At the encouragement of H.G. Gold, Warre returned to the O.U.B.C. in 1907 and 1909 to deliver three lectures on rowing, fifty years after his racing career there ended.  His return coincided, and not coincidentally, with a stale patch in Oxford rowing and an assault on Oxford Etonian hegemony, from both Cambridge (in the so-called “sculling” style of Duggie Stuart) and abroad (notably in the Belgians’ 1906 and 1907 victories in the Grand, the first foreign wins in that event).  Accordingly, Warre directed his first two lectures to the “Accidence” of rowing, starting in 1907 with the fundamentals of fixed-seat rowing.  “If [a novice] learns correctly the art of rowing on the fixed seat there is nothing he will have to unlearn, though he may have some more things to learn, in order to row correctly on a slide.”  In 1909, with Oxford since having lost two more Boat Races to Duggie Stuart and looking like it would soon lose another, Warre addressed “Accidence, Part II, The Slide,” conceding its mechanical advantages but subordinating them to fixed-seat fundamentals.  He warned his fellow Oxonians:  “[I]f you sanction the continuance of coaching based upon false conceptions, if the cult of the slide is allowed to obscure the ideal of first-class oarsmanship, then defeat after defeat will be ensued and deserved, even if victory sometimes occur owing to the inferiority of a rival crew.”  Two months later, Oxford had won on orthodox lines with R.C. Bourne at stroke and Warre returned to the University Barge in better spirits to deliver his final lecture, on coaching (“Syntax”).  Despite the changes in boats, fittings, and oars, he concluded “the art of rowing is still the same, full of manly endeavour, full of self-sacrifice, full of delight, and if in any way, by these Lectures, I shall have contributed to its flourishing here and elsewhere, it will be a pleasure to me to think that I have been able, through your kindness, to repay in some small degree the debt that I owe to it as a pastime in the days gone by.”  The published lectures, collectively entitled “On the Grammar of Rowing,” included as an appendix the following “Notes on the Stroke”:

[[Image:8340000LA_-_Manly_exercises_how_to_row.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Fixed-seats, no outriggers]]''The moment the oar touches the body, drop the hands smartly straight down, then turn the wrists sharply and at once shoot out the hands in a straight line to the front, inclining the body forward from the thigh joints and simultaneously bring up the slide, regulating the time by the swing forward of the body according to the stroke.  Let the chest and stomach come well forward, the shoulders be kept back; the inside arm be straightened, the inside wrist a little raised, the oar grasped in the hands, but not pressed upon more than is necessary to maintain the blade in its proper straight line as it goes back and without constricting the muscles of the arms as they go forward; the head kept up, the eyes fixed on the outside shoulder of the man before you.  As the body and arms come forward to their full extent, the wrists having been quickly turned, the hands must be raised sharply, and the blade of the oar brought to its full depth at once.  At that moment, without the loss of a thousandth part of a second, the whole weight of the body must be thrown on to the oar and the stretcher, by the body springing back, so that the oar may catch hold of the water sharply, and be driven through it by a force unwavering and uniform.  As soon as the oar has got hold of the water, and the beginning of the stroke has been effected as described, continuing the movement of the body and the simultaneous use of the muscles of the legs, keep up the pressure of the beginning, uniform through the backward motion of the body.  At the beginning of the stroke let the arms be straight.  The elbows should not then be bent.  When the body reaches the perpendicular, let the elbows be bent and dropped close past the sides to the rear -- the shoulders dropping and disclosing the chest to the front; the back, if anything, curved inwards rather than outwards but not strained in any way.  The body, in fact, should assume natural upright sitting posture, with the shoulders well thrown back.  In this position the oar should come to it and the feather commence.''

''N.B.-- It is important to remember that the body should never stop still.  In its motion backwards and forwards it should imitate the pendulum of a clock.  When it has ceased to go forward it has begun to go back.''

''There are, it will appear, from consideration of the above directions, about 27 distinct points, articuli as it were of the stroke.  No one should attempt to coach a crew without striving to obtain a practical insight into their nature and order of succession.''

''Let the Coach also remember that, in teaching men to row, his object should be to economize their strength by using properly their weight.  Their weight is always in the boat along with them; their strength, if misapplied, very soon evaporates.''

Welcome to the '''Tools for Healthy Living''' wikibook. In this book we will share practical tools and tips for living a healthy life. This is not written by a medical doctor or a nutritional expert, but rather an ordinary consumer like most of us.

A copyvio. Not really sure if this needs discussing but i've posted here to be sure.

:People please don't address copyvios on the VfD (at least not on the single base of copyright violation), if you wish to address a copyvio you have to do a proper job at it...
:''Copyright UNESCO 2001. Adapted from Tools for Writers. Used with Permission.''
:Indicates the owner of the rights (any author/editor has the copyright of any significant edit/original creation) and clearly states '''Used with Permission''' you should address it by contacting the contributor (the one that added that information) or the copyright holder (UNESCO).
:Since copyvio isn't open for a vote (if found to be in violation of Wikibooks copyright policies it should be deleted) no voting is needed, if you wish for help to check it out the VfD is not the best place to ask for it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:10, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

:I have also checked the content (on the PDF) it seems that the [[User:Kmill56]] was converting the PDF into the Wikibooks format. All of his edits were done in the same day 27 September 2007 and he hasn't replied to the posts on his talk page (all from [[User:Urbane]]) on the same day). The copyvio notice was added in 5 October 2007.

:The content if directly copied from the PDF would be best fit for Wikisource anyway. If based on this a VfD discussion has some merit. 

:Since the content is proper for Wikibooks/Wikisource. It should be beneficial to us (Wikibooks) project to contact the UNESCO ( [http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal/processing/forms/contact/en/form.php  Web mail] - [http://www.unesco.org/cgi-bin/webworld/portalsforum/gforum.cgi Forum]) (even as a PR action to call attention to our existence).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:39, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

:I apologize as I am new to all of this. I am a student at Virginia Tech who has permission from one of the authors Edward Fox. This is a project in which he is involved in through a class project. For now I have placed copyright info on the page saying I have permission from Dr. Fox. Please let me know what else I will need to do to keep this page alive as it is a project that will be maintained for hopefully some time. --[[User:Kmill56]]

::I'll reply here and post a notice also on you talk page... 
::Since the work states that the copyrighted belongs to the [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=29008&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO]. It fallows that even if Dr. Fox was one of the authors the complete rights of the work were given to UNESCO. You will need UNESCO [[Wikibooks:Boilerplate_request_for_permission|permission]] for yourself or directly to Wikibooks (see [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]), to license it under the [[GFDL]] (and give credits to it as the rights owner), you are free also to indicate each original contributing author including Dr. Fox and yourself (if you did/do add significative content to it), if you are only changing the medium (from PDF to Wikibooks) you will not be able to claim authorship (if it is relevant see exception about translations on the GFDL). As it stands and by your reply and available information, you don't have permission from UNESCO but only from one of the original authors so the work as it stands sadly falls under the definition of a copyrights violation and the Wikibooks community will have to act on it. (in about a week, if no permission to use the material is obtained)

::Another point is if the book is right for Wikibooks. If the original was published and you have no intentions to extend it and do get the permission, the proper place for such work would be [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikisource].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:04, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

:::Panic, please don't push people around. If Urbane wants to address it here, he's welcome to. Copyright violations are often tricky to determine, and this is one such case. Indeed, you've made a mistake: &quot;Used with permission&quot; refers to  ''Tools for Writers'', which was adapted in some way as a basis for this document - '''not''' that the .pdf file is used with permission here.
:::Nevertheless, your advice is valid; [[User:Kmill56|Kmill56]] should try to get permission to add it here. If such permission is not forthcoming, then it should be deleted (by marking it as a copyvio, and after 7 days, deleting it). If permission is given, then we should decide whether it should stay here, or transwiki to Wikisource. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:49, 5 October 2007 (UTC)

::::I would have preferred addressing this on one of our talk pages. It was not my intention to push or force anything on anyone, my rational is simple and fallows our previous conversation on the copyvio topic.

::::Marking a work only due to copyvio as a target for VfD by a non contributing user (expecialy if he is an administrator) can be seen as passing the buck, as someone else pointed out previously. Doing so on VfD will easily enable a deletion.

::::Since copyvios shouldn't be open for a VfD vote (per policy) the only other motive would be to clear any doubts  for the deletion action (it will then be expected that people that don't have a deep knowledge on a particular work or invested interest on a specific topic to think that the indication of a copyvio was at least addressed with the users contributing to it without useful reply, and simply vote delete, this is common and verifiable in previous events). Even in this case it would be better to tag the work as a copyvio and address it on the proper place (the book's talk page) as indicated by the copyvio tag, if it fails to provide a permission then the work should be deleted, per policy).

::::The only mention of using the VfD for copyvios is on the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] and it is intended for use by the content owner so to call attention to the general community for that fact and to enable for the verification of the claim (it could also be done on the book talk page but that would have a high probability of generating conflict or be ignored as not everyone would be aware of the discussion) so it seems a good idea to make it possible on this instance.

::::If a Wikibookian is unsure of a copyvio (but thinks it is probable) and willing to act on it he should make some effort to verify it or call attention to the fact to the proper administrative forum (so those that are willing and able be called to address it deeply).

::::If he is sure of the violation just tag it as a copyvio and provide the known facts on the tag field. This will have the same effect but be cleaner and clearer.

::::Can you provide any other instance for a book to be tagged for VfD only because of a presumable copyvio skipping the use of the proper tag and any attempt to contact either the Wikibookian(s) responsible or the presumable owner of the material. ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:40, 6 October 2007 (UTC)

:::::Thank you for notifying me of what needs to be done.  I will be meeting with Dr. Fox on Monday at which time I will coordinate with him and contact UNESCO to get permission.  I will do everything in my power to try and get permission from UNESCO within 7 days. --[[User:Kmill56]]

::::::If you need some more time please notify us, since we (Wikibooks community) are acting preemptively on the copyvio as is our policy so to avoid problems (By default only the copyright holder can enforce his rights). If you need any help feel free to request it, even on the staff lounge. The request for permission can be requested by anyone or you may feel the need for more people to actively participate on the effort.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:12, 6 October 2007 (UTC)

:Please do try and get permission Kmill56 as it is a good book, it would be a shame to see it go. And Panic, i tagged the book as a vfd as i have not outright handled a copyvio on my own before. I wasn't trying to pass the buck, honest, I simply wanted to get other's involved in the process and i thought that tagging it as a vfd would be the most effective way of doing this. [[User:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urbane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:21, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

::Sorry if it was to hash of a wording (to get it into context you must read the discussion above on another thread about the same subject), it was not my own wording, but I agree that it could be perceived as such if the nominator is not the same that closes the subject of a copyvio (by examining it as deep as one can).
::Nominating a work for VfD with a copyvio indication as I said just above can only aggravate matters by bringing it to public attention, before addressing with the involved parties. We must keep in mind that a copyvio can be seen as half a step to an accusation of plagiarism/abuse, not pleasant for the target if the contributor is really working on good faith, that is a default expectation we must have about every Wikibookian.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:02, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

:::I disagree with the notion that a copyvio cannot be addressed on the VfD page. It may not be optimal, but copyvios do need to be deleted. To that effect, a positive outcome on a copyvio suspicion is in no way different from a positive VfD discussion. If we agree that it's a copyvio, it's analogous to agreeing that it's not fit for inclusion on wikibooks. Giving proper exposure to a potential copyvio ensures that we get as much verification about it as is possible. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:06, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

::::I gave examples to instances it would be proper to discuss a copyvio on the VfD. I strongly  agree with you that the VfD is not the best place to do it (especially on a first instance). It also is a good idea to keep this kind of discussions with the book (on the talk page) this will help prevent people voting on a copyvios (copyvio shouldn't be voted, but verified, a vote shouldn't be interpreted as verification nor the nomination for VfD but in fact most people  do interpret it as such). We shouldn't even mix discussions. The copyvio should supersede any discussion about the acceptability of the content, since if it is verified the content is deleted, no need for discussion. It will also help deciding if the transwiki option is viable and preserve the discussion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:23, 8 October 2007 (UTC)

:::::Technically, we do not &quot;vote&quot;. You should know that from your frequent dealings with policy pages. We do not &quot;vote&quot; whether it is a copyvio or not, we discuss the topic and come to a conclusion on it. If we find that it is a copyvio, we delete it. Copyvios are serious business, and they are likely to get more attention from people if we discuss them here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:52, 14 October 2007 (UTC)

::::::Well I know you know I know the distinction :). I don't see a point in calling attention to a technicality. You may call it a simple discussion but it seems clear to all that discussions on VfD does result on a &quot;pool of opinions&quot; as specified and formalized by the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] text &quot;will then appear in Category:Votes for deletion. At this time, the voting process begins.&quot;, as for the case that it would be more productive to address it here I point to you the last 2 votes you made on this page relating to presumed copyvios it is clear that it enables the deletion of content bypassing the proper addressing of the real question of copyvio leading to a bandwagon fallacy.
::::::If you remember the &quot;discussion&quot; regarding the C++ Programming that took place supposedly addressing a  copyvio problem (but in fact was addressing a private discussion on rights, authors and licenses we had been having), we can establish that only my intervention (as contributor to the book) and your cool mind and proper action to address the copyvio saved the book from deletion. In fact if the same problem was addressed in the book talk page, things would have been kept in perspective and reduced the noise level from the start and would easily been addressed without having people that were outside of the &quot;loop&quot; to commit to the deletion because of unverified claims. Had both of us staid outside or unwilling to participate the result would probably had been of no service to the community. By marking a work for VfD based on a copyvio alone we are making things harder and costly to contributing Wikibookians.
::::::If we take this discussion as example has anyone attempted on his own to get the proper authorization  to use the work (that seems to have an high probability to be granted), or are we all now waiting for the contributing Wikibookian to solve things for all our benefit of keeping the content...
::::::Everyone has an opinion but not everyone is wiling to make the effort to translate it into actions. The VfD promotes the expression of opinions but doesn't request or expects that people commit to actions as required by the copyvio tag.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:40, 14 October 2007 (UTC) 

[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Comment}}}''' - I have sent an email to the author requesting an update on the licensing issue. I propose that we wait to hear back for a few days, and if neither an update nor appropriate licensing is forthcoming, that the book be [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''deleted''', per policy. If, at a later date, a licensing arrangement is made, then the content could be undeleted. As it stands, the book is a copyvio, and we've extended the 1 week grace period already.

:{{del}}. Wikibooks is not a host for lists or directories. A book needs to have &quot;prose&quot; or something like it in order to qualify here as a &quot;book&quot;. As to the issue of merging, we have to ask ourselves whether this directory has intrinsic ''educational'' value, or whether it can be used in an appendix ''usefully'' to support another book. It could certainly be crammed uncomfortably into the [[Podcasting]] book, and we could blindly assume that the list is up to date (useful) and that none of the links in the list represent spam or other uncouth interests. I'm really not willing to make that leap of faith, especially not when it comes to the ever-changing world of internet media distribution. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:35, 12 December 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Capability Query&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
To check at runtime whether an object supports an interface
=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
Separating interface from implementation is a good object oriented software design practice. In C++, the [[More C++ Idioms/Interface Class|Interface Class]] idiom is used to separate interface from implementation and invoke the public methods of any abstraction using runtime polymorphism. Extending the example in the interface class idiom, a concrete class may implement multiple interfaces as shown below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Shape { // An interface class
   public:
    virtual ~Shape();
    virtual void draw() const = 0;
    //...
};
class Rollable { // One more interface class
  public:
    virtual ~Rollable();
    virtual void roll() = 0;
};
class Circle : public Shape, public Rollable { // circles roll - concrete class
    //...
    void draw() const;
    void roll();
    //...
};
class Square : public Shape { // squares don't roll - concrete class
    //...
    void draw() const;
    //...
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Now if we are given a container of pointers to abstract Rollable class, we can simply invoke the roll function on every pointer, as described in the interface class idiom.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
std::vector&lt;Rollable *&gt; rollables;
//  Fill up rollables vector somehow.
for (vector&lt;Rollable *&gt;::iterator iter (rollables.begin());
     iter != rollables.end();
     ++iter)
{
  iter-&gt;roll();
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Sometimes it is not possible to know in advance whether or not an object implements a particular interface. Such a situation commonly arises if an object inherits from multiple interface classes. To discover the presence or absence of the interface at runtime, capability query is used.

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
In C++, a capability query is typically expressed as a &lt;code&gt;dynamic_cast&lt;/code&gt; between unrelated types .

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
Shape *s = getSomeShape();
if (Rollable *roller = dynamic_cast&lt;Rollable *&gt;(s))
  roller-&gt;roll();
&lt;/source&gt;

This use of &lt;code&gt;dynamic_cast&lt;/code&gt; is often called a '''cross-cast,''' because it attempts a conversion across a hierarchy, rather than up or down a hierarchy. In our example hierarchy of shapes and rollables, &lt;code&gt;dynamic_cast&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Rollable&lt;/code&gt; will succeed only for &lt;code&gt;Circle&lt;/code&gt; and not for &lt;code&gt;Square&lt;/code&gt; as the later one does not inherit from &lt;code&gt;Rollable&lt;/code&gt; interface class.

Excessive use of capability queries is often an indication of bad object-oriented design.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WHSGUCDA}}
Factor analysis is a statistical data reduction technique used to explain variability among observed random variables in terms of fewer unobserved random variables called '''factors'''. It is useful to reduce the number of variables, by combining two or more variables into a single factor, thus “simplifying” the original dataset.

Factor analysis (FA) is especially useful in geochemistry when one has a known target or some other way to understand the meaning of the obtained associations. When failing this, the geologist is usually forced to “plot and see”, and then to select the FA that he believes is the most useful for the studied area.

I processed both the initial dataset and the three transformed versions using SYSTAT SSPS 10.0 for Windows, but you can use any other statistical program capable of factor analysis.

== Factor Analysis for the Initial Dataset ==

Figure 36 shows the plot for the initial dataset, while table 24 shows the principal components defined by the software.

Figures 37 – 39 show the effectiveness of these FA as a targeting tool for our ore body.


[[Image:Effectiveness of these FA as a targeting tool for our ore body Figures_37_to_39.jpg]]


=== Conclusions and recommendations on the use of FA for the initial dataset ===
For as long as we have a known target to test the obtained FA, this method offers better results than the RCC. It also allows for the combined studied of all the elements together. 

FA1 and FA2 do contain the embedded correlations I introduced in the initial dataset, thus their effectiveness, especially FA 1, in mapping the location of the ore body.

The next question will be: '''''Will the transformed data be any more effective in helping us locate our target?'''''

== CRL transformed data ==

Figure 40 shows the scree plot for the CLR transformed dataset, while table 25 shows the principal components defined by SYSTAT.

Although table 26 shows two components, I will analyze only the second, which is a coefficient as shown in equation 29.

'''Equation 29. FA7 for the ALR transformed dataset.'''

This factor contains the embedded relationship from the initial dataset, but because of the presence of other elements, its usefulness as a targeting tool is more limited, as shown in Figure 45.

=== Conclusions and Recommendations on the Use of FA for the Transformed Datasets ===
As I mentioned earlier, for FA to be most useful, one needs to have a known target to calibrate it. The factor analysis applied to the CLR transformed data gave us three factors, but only one (FA5) was useful for targeting the ore body.

The factor analysis of the ALR transformed data (Factor 7) was good in general, but the best factors were obtained from the ILR transformed data, specially Factor 9 that not only gave the exact location of the ore body, but also its internal structure. Another efficient factor was FA11, but it definitively required calibration based on a known target.

So answering the question from page 41, yes, the factor analysis of the IRL transformed data will be more effective than the factor analysis of the raw data as a tool for locating the ore deposit.

There is almost not a case in exploration geology, where the studied data does not includes below detection limits and/or zero values, and since most of the geological data responds to lognormal distributions, these “zero data” represent a mathematical challenge for the processing.

The method that I am proposing takes into consideration the well-known relationships between some elements. For example, in copper porphide deposits there is always a significant direct correlation between the copper values and the molybdenum ones. However, while copper will always be above the limit of detection, many of the molybdenum values will be “rounded zeros”. In such a case, I will take the lower quartile of the real molybdenum values and establish a regression equation with copper, and then I will estimate the “rounded” zero values of molybdenum by their corresponding copper values.

One can apply this method to any type of data, provided we establish first their correlation dependency.

One of the main advantages of this method is that we do not obtain a fixed value for the “rounded zeros”, but one that depends on the value of the other variable.


== Are there any zeros in the house? ==
We need to start by recognizing that there are zero values in geology. For example the amount of quartz in a syenite is zero, since quartz cannot co-exists with nepheline (Trusova and Chernov, 1982). In binomial distributions, like for example the drilling of an ore body, you either will intersect the ore body (1) or not (0). Another common zero is a North azimuth, however we can always change that zero for the value of 360°. These are the “Essential Zeros” (Aitchison, 2003) or “Real zeros”. They are not a problem for as long as their population does not respond to a lognormal distribution, since you cannot take the logarithm of a zero. 

Then in geology, especially in geochemistry, we also have “Rounded Zeros”. In some cases, laboratories report below detection limit (b.d.l.) as zeros or non-existent, while in most cases they just put the b.d.l. as the value for that parameter. These b.d.l. values are a similar problem to the “Rounded Zeros”. Let us illustrate with the example proposed in Table 28.


'''Table 28. CLR transformed data for the used example. The original b.d.l. value was 0.5 ppm of Mo.'''

The ternary diagram on Fig. 51 shows these results.

[[Image:Ternary diagram of the studied data Figure_51.jpg]]

'''Figure 51. Ternary diagram of the studied data. To the left the CLR transformed data, to the right the same data after being centered using CoDaPack software,'''

It is clear that even centering does not solve the “problem” of the b.l.d. data, which remain grouped along the AB axis.

== Zero, zero… What shall I do with you? ==

Geologists, even those that are not knowledgeable of compositional data analysis, have being dealing with this problem for quite some time (Kashdan ''et al''., 1979). One of the most frequently use technique is amalgamation (Aitchison, 1986). Amalgamation, e.g. adding Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, as total alkalis is a solution, but sometimes we need to differentiate between a sodic and a potassic alteration, and therefore amalgamation is not an option. 

Pre-classification into groups is another solution, but it requires a good knowledge of the distribution of the data and the geochemical characteristics of the groups that is not always available. 

Considering the zero values equal to the limit of detection of the used equipment, or substituting it by some other constant (e.g. half the limit of detection) will generate spurious distributions, especially in ternary diagrams as we show in Fig. 51. 

Same situation will occur if we replace the zero values by a very small amount (Bacon-Shone, 2003) using non-parametric or parametric techniques (imputation). Even if we add the same small value to all of the analyzed parameters, we will get the same spurious distribution.


== How do I deal with spurious distributions? ==
The method that I am proposing takes into consideration the existence of well-known relationships between some elements. For example, in copper porphide deposits, there is always a clear dependency between the copper values and the molybdenum ones (Fig. 52), but while copper will always be above the limit of detection, many of the molybdenum values will include b.d.l. values (“Rounded Zeros”).


[[Image:As in all Cu porphide deposits, there is a strong correlation between Cu and Mo values Figure_52.jpg]]

'''Figure 52. As in all Cu porphide deposits, there is a strong correlation between Cu and Mo values. We can use such correlation to estimate the values b.d.l. for Mo.'''


In this case, I will take the lower quartile of the real molybdenum values (Table 29) and establish a regression equation with copper, and then we will estimate the “Rounded Zero” values of molybdenum by those estimated from their corresponding copper values (Table 30).

Therefore, according to Table 30, we could use regression equation (34) in order to estimate the b.d.l. values for Mo.

'''Equation 34. Regression equation for Mo.'''

[[Image:Molybdenum line fit plot showing a good correlation with the predicted values (in pink) Figure_53.jpg]]

Fig. 53 shows that the obtained results are close to the predicted line.


So, did we get ride of the spurious effect?

As Fig. 54 clearly shows, only one value of Mo was really close to zero, while the rest has now a value that is a geological reflection of the geochemical characteristics of the data.


[[Image:The ternary diagram of the left clearly shows that only one sample has low value of Mo Figure_54.jpg]]

'''Figure 54. The ternary diagram of the left clearly shows that only one sample has low value of Mo. The ternary diagram to the right compares the original data in red with the new estimated values of Mo in green.'''

&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusions and Recommendations'''&lt;/big&gt;

The treatment of “closed” dataset by normal statistical methods does create spurious correlations that lower the effectiveness of the obtained results. While there are ways to minimize this problem, like processing major oxides independently from trace elements, or using only the strongest correlations into the composition of the RCCs, I believe that the transformation of the initial dataset presents a better solution for the processing and interpretation of geological data.

For the estimation of the most efficient RCC, I propose the use of the ARL transformation, although the CLR is also effective.

When a target for the testing of the effectiveness of our coefficient is available, then we should use the factor analysis preferentially. I recommend the use of the IRL transformation to define the most effective combination of factors.

Finally, I introduced here a method for dealing with zero values. This method’s main advantage is that we do not obtain a fixed value for the “Rounded Zeros”, but one that depends on the real value of the other variable. The proposed method depends on the geological characteristics of the data, and therefore is less biased or random than other methods. It also presents a viable alternative to amalgamation and an effective way to deal with “Essential Zeros” in a population.

The sequence of the method is as follows:

# We transform the data using CoDaPack or other similar software.
# We select the lower quartile of real data for the element with the b.d.l. values.
# Within this dataset, we test the relationship between the elements with the b.d.l. values with one (or more) element without b.d.l. values. In most cases, these elements will correspond with well-established geological relationship like between Pb and Zn on polymetallic deposits, or between Au and Pb in hydrothermal deposits, or between Cu and Mo in porphyritic deposits, as in the case I presented here.
# We establish the regression equation.
# We then substitute the b.d.l. values by those estimated with the obtained equation of regression.

We can apply this method to any type of data, provided we establish first their correlation dependency. I would also like to see this method included as an option for dealing with zeros in the next version of CoDaPack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Black Hole Milkyway.jpg|right|thumb|250px|In this chapter, we will explore the nature of the Black Hole, how they come to be, and the  history of the theories behind them.]]
A black hole is an object that has a gravitational field so powerful that nothing, not even radiation or [[Astronomy/Properties of Light and other Electromagnetic Radiation|light]], can escape. The event horizon  is the name given to the figurative surface, within which the gravitational force becomes irresistible. Escape velocity at that surface is equal to the speed of light hence not even light can escape, hence it is rendered invisible. In this way, black holes are undetectable, except by the trail of destruction they leave behind them, or their interaction with proximate objects.

The theory behind black holes designates that, when a certain amount of mass is present in an infinitely small region of space (referred to as a &quot;[[Astronomy/Core of the Black Hole: The Theory of the Naked Singularity|naked singularity]]&quot;), all paths through space in 4-dimensions are inwardly curved, forcibly pulling all forms of matter toward the source. Such a dense region of space, the black hole, has been predicted to form either following the collapse of a massive [[Astronomy/Stars/Introduction|star]], or the collision of two neutron stars. The former is, however, said to be by far the more common, considering the rarity of the latter.

Many aspects of the black hole model still pose unanswered questions, and the nature of the black hole remains largely unknown. Numerous theories as to what a black hole looks like, and what exists in the interior have been proposed, and the black hole is a regularly seen element of science fiction. Some even propose that black holes could lead to be gateways to other universes or parallel realities with radically different physical laws.

In the following topic, we'll look at these theories, while exploring what is already known about black holes, as well as the history of the concept of objects with a gravitational field so strong that nothing can escape. We will discuss the properties of the black hole, and the impact these properties have on the surrounding spacetime and the matter around them, and how these properties, as well as the effects they cause, can be exploited in the detection of these invisible monsters. Finally, we'll examine the terrible life of the black hole, from its birth in the blazing remains of a destroyed star to its gradual evaporation. The second type of black hole is called the stellar black hole: It is formed by the gravitational collapse of a massive star. Stellar black holes have masses that range from 3 to several thousands of solar masses. Our Milky Way Galaxy has several stellar mass black holes that are closer to us than the super massive black hole in the region. The third type of black hole is called the Intermediate-mass black holes: Intermediate-mass black holes are found in the center of globular clusters. Astronomers believe that colliding stars may have formed the intermediate mass black holes. The fourth type of black hole is called the Super Massive black holes: Super Massive black holes are found in the center of the Milky Way and other active galaxies. Theoretically a star black hole forms and takes in enormous amounts of matter over the course of years. The other theory is that a cluster of star like black holes forms and then merges into a super massive black hole.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adding Resize option to images ==
This hack will allow any JPG file to be resized from the context-menu.
First: get ImageMagick toolkit for windows from [http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows This site] and install it.
Next: create a cmd file (a batch file for windows NT,XP, Vista) with the following contents:
&lt;pre&gt;
@echo off
set CONVERTPATH=&quot;C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-6.3.7-Q16\&quot;
if &quot;%2&quot;==&quot;&quot; goto NoSizeArgument
set SizeVariable=%1
set FileOnly=%~n2
set FileExtension=%~x2
set FilePath=%~p2
set DriveLetter=%~d2
goto DoConvert
:noSizeArgument
set SizeVariable=1024
set FileOnly=%~n1
set FileExtension=%~x1
set FilePath=%~p1
set DriveLetter=%~d1
:DoConvert
%CONVERTPATH%convert.exe -resize &quot;%SizeVariable%x%SizeVariable%&gt;&quot; &quot;%DriveLetter%%FilePath%%FileOnly%%FileExtension%&quot; &quot;%DriveLetter%%FilePath%%FileOnly%_%SizeVariable%%FileExtension%&quot;
echo resized %FileOnly%%FileExtension% to %FileOnly%_%SizeVariable%%FileExtension%
&lt;/pre&gt;
Let's say we name this file C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-6.3.7-Q16\convert1024.cmd
Now we have the command at hand to resize an arbitrary image to max dimensions of 1024x1024, keeping the aspect ratio intact. 
Here's how we add this command to the context menu:
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open any folder (e.g. My Documents)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Tools | Folder Options...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the opened dialog, go to the File Types tabsheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select in the &quot;registered file types&quot; the file type you want to add the resize option for. E.g. choose JPG for the most commonly used file format. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the 'Advanced' button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the dialog that just opened, click the 'New...' button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 'Action' fill in the description of the resize action. E.g. enter 'Re&amp;size to 1024x1024 max'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the browse button, and navigate to the cmd file we created in the beginning. Select it, and Click OK to confirm it all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the File Types dialog, and presto: you now have a resize command at the ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Keplers supernova.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The collapse of a large enough star can cause supernova.]]
In this subchapter, we examine the life of the black hole, from its birth in the fires of a dead star, to its gradual dissipation in the backwaters of space.

=== Birth  - Part I===
It would only make sense to begin chronologically, at the moment when the black hole is formed, shortly following the death of a sufficiently massive star. Before this, however, we must first understand what causes the death of this star. In short, such a star will collapse when its temperature is no longer high enough to stop it from collapsing under its own gravity. There are two possible reasons for this failing of equlibrium. The more common cause occurs when a star has burned up all of its nuclear and elemental &quot;fuel&quot;, and can therefore no longer maintain the necessary temperature, resulting in what is termed &quot;gravitational collapse&quot;. The second possible cause of this imbalance between temperature, pressure, and volume involves the star taking on a significant amount of added mass in some way, without causing the necessary increase in core temperature to support the additional mass.

Either way, the star now no longer has the needed temperature to stop a collapse. The star's core is compressed so tightly, that it forms what is known as degenerate matter, which is, essentially, matter that is so highly compressed that the forces of repulsion that creates the supporting pressure originate from quantum mechanical effects not from the usual forces of repulsion of like charges of normal matter. Its comprising particles are extremely dense. The collapse usually triggers subsequent events, such as supernovae, or gaseous fragmentation into planetary nebulae (shells of gas and plasma), that shed the outer layers of the star. The remnant that is left after the collapse and subsequent events forms one of a number of &quot;compact stars&quot;. These include white dwarfs, neutron stars, and, of course, black holes. For the latter to be a result, the remnant has to be sufficiently massive; just how massive is defined by the &quot;Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit&quot;, calculated by Julius Robert Oppenheimer and George Michael Volkoff, in 1939. Beyond this limit the gravitational attraction is greater than the opposing pressure, and, when the remnant's outer radius drops below its Schwarzschild radius, the black hole is fully formed.

The black hole emerges thus from the ashes of a broken star, and the birth is complete.

On a final note, before we continue, there is a second way that black holes can be formed, though it is much rarer for this to happen: the collision of two neutron stars&amp;mdash;another form of &quot;compact star&quot;&amp;mdash;can sometimes result in the formation of black holes. However, such collisions are not common, and this second possible cause of black hole birth is not always mentioned in short summaries of black hole formation.

[[Image:Accretion disk.jpg|left|thumb|A black hole devours a star that has strayed beyond the event horizon.]]

=== Life - Part II ===
The life of black holes is impossible to calculate, and how long they remain has only been predicted, not proven. Therefore, generalization is inevitable.

As black holes drift through space, they exist as vacuum machines of sorts, sucking in all the matter they come across, and steadily growing. As they devour, stellar black holes&amp;mdash;forged from the ashes of star corpses&amp;mdash;grow, becoming larger through a process called accretion. This refers to the growth of massive bodies due to the attraction of matter by gravity. Those black holes that devour many stars, planets, interstellar matter, or even other black holes often become substantially larger than average stellar black holes. How long a black hole feeds at a particular location depends on what it is consuming. Large stars often take eons for black holes to consume, while smaller objects&amp;mdash;such as asteroids, small planets, or moons&amp;mdash;take a comparably small amount of time.
[[Image:BlackHole.jpg|Right|thumb|250px|A simulated view of black hole and its accretion disk.]]

=== Death - Part III ===
This next section inevitably launches into the realms of theory. Because all but the micro black holes are predicted to live for longer than the current age of the universe, the death of a black hole possibly has not even occurred yet.

One theory, Hawking Radiation, denotes that every black hole, after a very long time, will eventually evaporate into nothing. Thus far, it is one of the few proposed theories regarding black hole evaporation, and remains a hotly debated topic. It is this theory that we will discuss here.

Even in the total vacuum of space, there is energy. Quantum mechanics says that even a true vacuum is not empty, in the sense that it is in fact a sea of zero-point energy. This body of energy fluctuates much like waves in a sea. These fluctuations continue to produce pairs of particles&amp;mdash;one normal matter particle, and one antiparticle&amp;mdash;that meet and are re-converted back into pure energy, restoring the balance in the sea.

Now, Hawking Radiation states that, if such a pair of particles were formed outside the event horizon of a black hole, and one of the two moves over the event horizon, while the other escapes, then the black hole will lose a small portion of its mass, because, in order to preserve &quot;total energy&quot; (the sum of an object's rest, potential, and kinetic energy), the particle which falls in must necessarily have negative energy.

However, only the smallest black holes could possibly evaporate in this way, because a black hole any more massive than Earth's moon would have a larger constant intake of cosmic microwave background radiation&amp;mdash;the electromagnetic radiation that fills the whole universe&amp;mdash;than it would emit through Hawking radiation. Indeed, there are currently no known, nor predicted, black holes even close to being the same mass as our moon, and therefore, as of now, Hawking Radiation is not, technically, a viable cause of evaporation in the present universe.

However, the cosmic microwave background radiation that fills space is slowly becoming weaker. Eventually, it will become so weak, that even the largest black holes will emit more by Hawking Radiation that they take in. In this way, after approximately a googol (10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;) years, even the very largest black holes would evaporate.

And so, the life of the black hole concludes, when it returns to nothingness, in the depths of space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A simple polymer consists of a long chain of monomers (components of molecules) joined by covalent bonds. A polymer usually consists of many of these bonds, tangled up. This is known as a bulk polymer.

==Types==

A bulk polymer may contain two types of regions. In crystalline regions, the chains run parallel to each other, whereas in amorphous regions, they do not. Intermolecular bonds are stronger in crystalline regions. A polycrystalline polymer consists of multiple regions, in which the chains point in a different direction in each region.

[[Image:Glass-Ball.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Polycrystalline glass]][[Image:Gummisnoddar.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|Amorphous rubber]]

==Properties==

===Transparency===

Polymers which are crystalline are usually opaque or translucent.  As a polymer becomes less polycrystalline, it becomes more transparent, whilst an amorphous polymer is usually transparent. &lt;ref&gt;C. A. Heaton, ''The Chemical industry'', page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elasticity===

In some polymers, such as polythene, the chains are folded up. When they are stretched, the chains unravel, stretching without breaking. When the stress ceases, they will return to their original shape. If, however, the bonds between the molecules are broken, the material reaches its elastic limit and will not return to its original shape.

===Stiffness===

Polymer chains may be linked together, causing the polymer to become stiffer. An example is rubber, which, when heated with sulfur, undergoes a process known as vulcanization. The chains in the rubber become joined by sulfur atoms, making the rubber suitable for use in car tyres. A stiffer polymer, however, will usually be more brittle.

===Plasticity===

When a polymer is stretched, the chains become parallel, and amorphous areas may become crystalline. This causes an apparent change in colour, and a process known as 'necking'. This is when the chains recede out of an area of the substance, making it thinner, with fatter areas on either side.

===Conductivity===

Polymers consist of covalent bonds, so the electrons are not free to move according to potential difference. This means that polymers are poor conductors.

===Boiling Point===

Polymers do not have boiling points. This is because, before they reach a theoretical boiling point, polymers decompose. Some polymers do not have melting points for the same reason.

==Questions==

1. Different crystalline structures have different refractive indexes. Why does this mean that a polycrystalline polymer is translucent?

2. What sort of polymer is a pane of perspex?

3. What sort of polymer does the pane of perspex become when shattered (but still in one piece)?

4. What sort of polymer is a rubber on the end of a pencil?

5. What happens to the translucency of an amorphous polymer when it is put under stress?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. Different crystalline structures have different refractive indexes. Why does this mean that a polycrystalline polymer is translucent?'''

The refractive index of each area is different, so the angle of refraction is different for each area. As a result, the image is blurred.

'''2. What sort of polymer is a pane of perspex?'''

Crystalline

'''3. What sort of polymer does the pane of perspex become when shattered (but still in one piece)?'''

Polycrystalline

'''4. What sort of polymer is a rubber on the end of a pencil?'''

Amorphous

'''5. What happens to the translucency of an amorphous polymer when it is put under stress?'''

The polymer becomes more translucent, as it becomes more polycrystalline as the chains are stretched and straightened.

== What Is This Book About? ==

This book is about the disassembly of x86 machine code into human-readable assembly, and the decompilation of x86 assembly code into human-readable C or C++ source code. Some topics covered will be common to all computer architectures, not just x86-compatible machines. 

== What Will This Book Cover? ==

This book is going to look in-depth at the disassembly and decompilation of x86 machine code and assembly code. We are going to look at the way programs are made using assemblers and compilers, and examine the way that assembly code is made from C or C++ source code. Using this knowledge, we will try to reverse the process. By examining common structures, such as data and control structures, we can find patterns that enable us to disassemble and decompile programs quickly. 

== Who Is This Book For? ==

This book is for readers at the undergraduate level with experience programming in x86 Assembly and C or C++. This book is not designed to teach assembly language programming, C or C++ programming, or compiler/assembler theory. 

== What Are The Prerequisites? ==

The reader should have a thorough understanding of [[x86 Assembly]], [[C Programming]], and possibly [[C++ Programming]]. This book is intended to increase the reader's understanding of the relationship between x86 machine code, x86 Assembly Language, and the C Programming Language. If you are not too familar with these topics, you may want to reread some of the above-mentioned books before continuing.

== What is Disassembly? ==

Computer programs are written originally in a human readable code form, such as assembly language or a high-level language. These programs are then compiled into a binary format called '''machine code'''. This binary format is not directly readable or understandable by humans. Many programs -- such as malware, proprietary commercial programs, or very old legacy programs -- may not have the source code available to you. 

Programs frequently perform tasks that need to be duplicated, or need to be made to interact with other programs. Without the source code and without adequate documentation, these tasks can be difficult to accomplish. This book outlines tools and techniques for attempting to convert the raw machine code of an executable file into equivalent code in assembly language and the high-level languages C and C++. With the high-level code to perform a particular task, several things become possible:

#Programs can be ported to new computer platforms, by compiling the source code in a different environment.
#The algorithm used by a program can be determined. This allows other programs to make use of the same algorithm, or for updated versions of a program to be rewritten without needing to track down old copies of the source code. 
#Security holes and vulnerabilities can be identified and patched by users without needing access to the original source code.
#New interfaces can be implemented for old programs. New components can be built on top of old components to speed development time and reduce the need to rewrite large volumes of code. 
# We can figure out what a piece of malware does. We hope this leads us to figuring out how to block its harmful effects. Unfortunately, some malware writers use self-modifying code techniques (polymorphic camouflage, XOR encryption, scrambling)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/278/how-does-a-crypter-for-bypass-antivirus-detection-work &quot;How does a crypter for bypass antivirus detection work?&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;, apparently to make it difficult to even detect that malware, much less disassemble it.

Disassembling code has a large number of practical uses. One of the positive side effects of it is that the reader will gain a better understanding of the relation between machine code, assembly language, and high-level languages. Having a good knowledge of these topics will help programmers to produce code that is more efficient and more secure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often the necessary data is spread over multiple web pages. 

Here is an example where data is taken from multiple pages to gather together the voting behaviour of a member in the US House of Representatives. 

An index of the issues in any session of the House are provided by pages such as [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/ROLL_000.asp].  For here, one can see that the pages reporting on any of sequentially numbered votes are generated by queries such as [http://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.asp?year=2007&amp;rollnumber=10]

The results are returned as an XML page rendered in a browser using XSLT.  The XQuery doc() function retrieves the underlying XML.

The following query aggregates the voting behavior for a specific member over 6 specific votes:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
{for $i in 10 to 15
let $path := concat(&quot;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll0&quot;,$i,&quot;.xml&quot;)
let $report := doc($path)
let $bill := $report//vote-metadata
let $specificvote := $report//recorded-vote[legislator/@name-id = &quot;E000215&quot;]
let $result := concat(data($specificvote//legislator),&quot; voted &quot;,data($specificvote/vote),&quot; &quot;,data($bill/vote-question),&quot; of &quot;,data($bill//legis-num))
return
  &lt;result&gt;{$result}&lt;/result&gt;
}
&lt;/results&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/voting.xq Execute]

More generally, the following function will return an XML node containing the extracted data. In general the vote pages encode the roll number with leading zeros, with minimum length of 3 digits:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:voting($repid as xs:string, $year as xs:integer, $rollnumbers as xs:integer*) {
for $rollno in $rollnumbers
let $zeropaddedrollnum  := concat(string-pad(&quot;0&quot;,max((0,3 - string-length(xs:string($rollno))))),xs:string($rollno))
let $path := concat(&quot;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/&quot;,$year,&quot;/roll&quot;,$zeropaddedrollnum,&quot;.xml&quot;)
let $report := doc($path)
let $bill := $report//vote-metadata
let $specificvote := $report//recorded-vote[legislator/@name-id = $repid]
return
  &lt;result&gt;
     &lt;year&gt;{$year}&lt;/year&gt;
     {$bill/rollcall-num}
     {$bill/vote-question}
     {$bill/legis-num}
     {$specificvote/legislator}
     {$specificvote/vote}
 
  &lt;/result&gt;
};

&lt;report&gt;
  {local:voting(&quot;E000215&quot;,2007,10 to 15)}
&lt;/report&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Gov/voteAnalysis.xq Execute]


Note.  It would be preferable to use the asp endpoint since this does not involve the complication arising here from leading zeros, but that produces mal-formed XML (??)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smith, Archibald Levin == 

=== “3rd Commissioner” (Spy), November 3, 1888 ===
[[Image:Smith_AL_Vanity_Fair_1888-11-03.jpg|thumb|right]]''He is the son of the late Francis Smith, Esq., J.P., of Salt Hill, Chichester, whose wife was a Miss Levin of the same place; and he perpetuates the names of both his parents.  Born in 1836, educated at Eton and Trinity, Cambridge, he was called to the Bar eight-and-twenty years ago, when he commenced the successful career which has lately culminated in his appointment as Third Commissioner to inquire into journalistic Charges and Allegations the truth of which is now being so tediously investigated in Probate Court I of the Royal Courts of Justice.  His education failed to make either a prig or a great scholar of him; but his legal experience and sound common sense have since combined to make him a Judge who has no superior amongst his puisne brethren.  His rise has been as rapid as it was deserved; for he showed enough practical sense in his conduct of such cases as fell into his hands early in his career to impress Lord Justice Bowen, then Attorney-General’s “devil,” with his quality, and, as a consequence, he became himself an imp of less degree, being appointed the devil’s devil.  That was all that was necessary to make the man, and when his master soared up to the Bench, Mr. Smith became a full-blown devil, in which capacity he counselled the Treasury so wisely that five years ago he was rewarded by being promoted to the position which he now occupies over the heads of all the Queen’s Counsel of the day.''

''He is not a very brilliant man, but his mental grasp is most comprehensive.  He drinks in a new Act of Parliament while other men skim its first section, and intricate accounts in a big commercial case are a delightful exercise to his well-trained mind.  He is very lucid, very popular, very good-natured, and very free from serious fault.  He never acts, never wastes time, and never sermonises even to criminals when they are found guilty before him.  He does not respect persons, he does not advertise, nor does he shirk the most unpleasant work.  All which is high praise, but merited both by what he does and what he does not.  Not having the gift of tongue in any marked degree, his charges to juries are choppy, and occasionally monotonous; but, being brief, clear, and always to the point, they are none the worse for that.  There is only one more youthful Judge on the Bench; but there is also, take him for all in all, only one better.  Being wealthy, he works rather for the good of others than himself; and having never been corrupted by Parliament, or by any other form of politics, he is extremely well adapted for the temporary office which he now occupies.  He is always courteous even to the more foolish, and consequently more irritating, among juniors.  He has much high spirit and much muscular strength; and his shoulders are types of the tremendous, with which he did stout service in the Cambridge Eight.  He still loves exercise and the fresh air of Sussex.  He is a jolly good fellow, who looks more like a sturdy English Squire than like the good Judge that he is.  He is well favoured in all senses; and he wears a pair of pince-nez at the end of his nose.''

[[w:Archibald_Levin_Smith|Archibald Levin Smith]] (1836-1901) rowed for Cambridge from 1857 through 1859 and won all the Henley events he entered in the only year he rowed there (1858):  the Grand with the C.U.B.C. and the Visitors’ and Wyfolds with First Trinity.  In later years he regularly bet a new hat on the Boat Race with W.B. Woodgate, “on principle and from patriotism to his flag, even when public favour and market odds might seem to be dead against the hopes of his own club.”{{ref|Woodgate}} 

Smith featured in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; three times in four years.  First as shown here, when he joined Sir James Hannen and Mr. Justice Day to inquire into the “journalistic Charges and Allegations” by the ''Times'' affecting C.S. Parnell and other Irish nationalists.  (In one occasion in that tribunal, Hannen denied thinking or saying something; Smith said “Nor I” and Day “made an inarticulate sound of concurrence”; but those reportedly were the only remarks of the two junior judges in the entire proceeding.){{ref|DNB}}  This 1888 print is rare, since it and the other nine “red robed judges” of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; have long been among the most collected “legals.”  Smith’s second  appearance was in the 1890 winter double number entitled “In Vanity Fair” (November 29, 1890), an unsigned composite reproducing the 1888 image.  The third was in the following winter number, “Bench and Bar” (December 5, 1891) by “Stuff,” for which &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; wrote:   “Of Puisne Judges here, best of all Common Law dispensers is Mr. Justice Smith, his common sense as English as his name; who when he notes joy and surprise on the face of the old offended whom he has sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, says bluffly, in vain attempt to hide his mercy, ‘Jones, remember it’s “''hard!”''’”

Smith joined the Court of Appeal in 1892.  He became Master of the Rolls in 1900 following the death of W.B. Brett (Viscount Esher) in 1899 and the interregnum of Lord Alverstone, and died a year later.

=== The 1859 Boat Race:  Cambridge Sinks, Smith Too ===
The morning of Friday, April 15, 1859 “was ushered in with heavy hail-charged clouds and half a gale of wind from the northward and westward,” &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Bell's Life&lt;/span&gt; reported.  “Notwithstanding these drawbacks no less than fourteen steamboats assembled to witness the race, all crowded with spectators, and the number along the shore, both pedestrian and equestrian, was very great.  Small boats there were few or none, as no one seemed to be so hardy as the crews. . . . [A]lthough the betting was 3 to 1 on Cambridge, good judges felt sure that the Cambridge boat would never live through the surf which was rolling.”  Good judges were right:

''[The start] took place at exactly one o’clock.  A complete sea was on at the time, although it had just previously lulled, leading the spectators to hope the crews would yet start in smooth water, but as they got to their stations a furious squall of snow and wind speedily dispelled the hope.  Oxford were on the Middlesex side, and Cambridge one buttress removed from them.  The start was level, and it was a splendid neck and neck race for 100 yards.  Here Oxford drew about a yard in advance and the water began to rush in torrents into the extremely frail bark which carried the Cantabs.  This, as may be supposed, did not help them in their pace, and they were stern by about half their boat opposite Searle’s [boatyard].  Oxford continued to gain slightly, and were one clear length ahead at Rose Cottage.  Here there was such a sea on that Mr. Hall [the Cambridge stroke] had his oar completely washed from his hand, but recovering it again in a moment, the race was continued with as much courage as before, the Cantabs pulling after their opponents in the most plucky manner, but losing ground at almost every stroke, till they reached Hammersmith Bridge, where there were nearly three lengths astern.''  Citizen J ''had several times come very near Cambridge, although repeatedly cautioned, and the screw'' Jackal ''again and again gave the Cantabs their wash.  The Oxonians reached the bridge in ten minutes, and directly after Cambridge had gone through,'' Citizen J ''(chartered by Searle), in a most reprehensible manner, went right ahead of them, and much discomposed them.  At the Waterworks there was nearly five lengths between the boats, both crews taking about thirty-eight strokes per minute, but although Cambridge was by this time almost full of water, they rapidly decreased the gap towards the end of Corney Reach, where the rowing of the whole crew was most beautiful and finished, while Oxford was keeping on in the same steady, workmanlike stroke.  At Barnes they were only two lengths in advance, and the time from starting was 20 minutes 50 seconds.  At this point the steamers that misbehaved themselves were the ''Jackal, Citizen L,'' a private boat, ''Citizen J,'' the ''Jupiter,'' chartered by Mr. Searle, and'' Citizen K, ''by Salter and Kelly, all of which were several times ahead of the Cantabs, who were still rowing very well, but it was all over.  The bow-oar had been frequently covered with water, and opposite the White Hart at Barnes three waves washed completely over the boat:  at the first warning the gallant crew, knowing what was coming, took their feet out of the stretcher straps and prepared for swimming, all except Mr. Smith, who had not learnt the art.  At the fourth wave the boat sank completely under them, and it was almost a miracle they were not drowned, for the umpire’s boat, the Lady of the Lake, was close on their stern at the time; but the captain, in a very clever manner, immediately stopped his vessel, and life buoys and ropes were immediately thrown out.  Mr. Darroch [No. 4] swam on shore, and all the others were fortunately picked up by various boats.  The Oxonians were about three lengths ahead at the time, and probably accomplished the distance in 24 minutes 30 seconds, although they were so far ahead at the finish that the time could not be accurately taken.''

The minute book of Smith’s college club, First Trinity, recorded:  “In going up to the Starting Post the Cambridge Boat had nearly filled with water, and at the start it was known by her crew that she could not live through the race, and so perhaps the finest crew that ever left the University was beaten by a comparatively very inferior one owing to rowing in too low a boat on a rough day.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Channell, Arthur Moseley == 

=== “An Amiable Judge” (Spy), February 17, 1898 ===
[[Image:Channell_AM_Vanity_Fair_1898-02-17.jpg|thumb|right]]''The Honourable Sir Arthur Moseley Channell, now one of the puisne Judges in the Queen’s Bench Division, began life precisely sixty years ago as son of the late Sir William Fry Channell, Baron of the Exchequer:  so that he is of quite legal parentage.  From the nursery he went to Harrow; then to Trinity, Cambridge (where he first became known as a Wrangler); and thence to the Bar, by way of the Inner Temple.  He practised as a Junior for two-and-twenty years, and as a Leader for twelve.  He has been Recorder for Rochester, and Vice-Chairman of the General Council of the Bar.  He has also been twice married, and now he is a Knight.''

''As a Junior, his practice was very general; as a “silk,” he chiefly conducted cases without juries, and very frequently argued points of Local Government Law before the Court in banc.  He has, indeed, made himself an authority on such small matters as pertain to vestries, boards, sewers, waterworks, and new streets.  He was never a great lawyer, nor an eloquent advocate; but he is well known as a good “workman,” with considerable knowledge of the Law and its Practice; and though never expected to be brilliant, he could always be trusted to make no mistakes.  It may be said of him that during all his four-and-thirty years of practice he never made an enemy among his brethren, his clients, or his opponents; and it is certain that he never received anything but friendly attention from the Bench.  He is a quiet, kindly, considerate gentleman, wholly free from conceit; in whose keeping the wholesome traditions of the English Bench for good sense in civil matters and for humanity in criminal will be quite safe.''

''He will not make a great Judge; but he is a very worthy sitter in the high place which he has honourably attained by long service to the Law.''

Arthur Moseley Channell (1838-1928) won the Colquhoun Sculls at Cambridge in 1860 and the University Pairs in 1861.  With First Trinity he won the Grand and Ladies’ at Henley in 1861 with J.C. Carter at cox.  He also rowed in the Wyfolds and Pairs, losing to Woodgate’s Brasenose crews.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured Channell at his trial court commencement.  He served sixteen years, retiring in 1914 in time to take up an appellate career in prize cases arising from the 1914-18 war.  In this latter position he was assisted by forty years’ experience as an amateur yachtsman.

=== How to Choose an Oarsman ===
John Arkell, who succeeded Edmond Warre as O.U.B.C. President, introduced Trial Eights at Oxford in the fall of 1858.  The C.U.B.C. followed suit three years later.  The new approach to selecting the university crews increased the talent pool and intramural competition, but still left considerable discretion to the U.B.C  president on whom to select for trialing, how to run the trials, and how to pick the final crew.  Although this approach has survived the years largely intact, one “E.B.M.” put a case in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 22, 1897) for a challenge system based on a form of seat racing:

[[Image:Coaching_on_horse_at_Oxford_c1897.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Coaching the Eights, Oxford, c. 1897]]
''Dear Vanity, -- In a former letter I ventured to submit that the choice of a winning oarsman de visu was not very much more satisfactory than an awarding of the Derby Stakes to that three-year-old which the experts most admired.  None of your readers having thus far disputed this assertion, I am tempted to go on a step further and suggest a mode whereby the places in the University boat might be filled with less risk of public dissatisfaction than at present.  What is the chief qualification for a seat in the boat?  Not strength in its crude form; still less weight, but that sort of strength which enables a man to exert the greatest pressure in forcing the blade of his oar through the water; in other words, to row the hardest.  How are you to discover which of any two men row the hardest?  Here the mystery is supposed to come in.  I do not admit that there is any mystery about it.  I say that it is as easy to tell which of two men rows the hardest as it is to tell which horse in a pair does the most work.  Given any number of competitors for the places in any boat, and I believe that it is possible, by pairing them against one another, to ascertain without any real risk of mistake which are the strongest oars.  Why not apply such a test?  It may be said that to a large extent the test is now applied.  But if it is -- and possibly of late more has been done in this way -- still, it is not used as a conclusive and positive criterion of merit.  And it is not used extensively enough.  Why not allow any man -- Freshman or otherwise, with or without the sanction of the captain of his College boat club -- to challenge any other man, Old Blue or not, to a trial of strength -- i.e., of the kind of strength above specified?  Ought not the mere fact that such a pretender had beaten the man challenged give the former an a priori right to oust the latter from the crew?  He might, no doubt, prove inferior in other respects.  He might not be able to go the four-mile course.  He might break down in training.  But these are hypotheses.  So might the other man.  At any rate, in preferring Paul of Emmanuel to Peter of Trinity, a President, if asked the question why he did so, would be able to say, not “because I thought him a better man,” but “because he proved himself the better man.”''

''How could he prove that?  Probably in several ways; but certainly in one.  Let us not discuss the most obvious method -- that of putting one man in one boat and one in another, starting them, and seeing which comes in first.  That would involve a resort to the art of sculling, which is supposed to involve other qualifications than those necessary for an oarsman pure and simple.  That there is any such difference -- except in the matter of steering, which can be obviated by adding coxswains of equal weight -- I am not prepared to admit.  If you took the winners of eight sculling races and put them in one boat, I should like to lay long odds on them against the eight losers rowing in another boat.  But let us not offend rooted prejudices.  Take another test, against which it is difficult to urge a common-sense objection.  Take out any two men for two rows of a quarter of a mile, out and home.  On the first trip let A row stroke and B row bow, and on the second trip reverse the positions.  Now, barring tricks -- which an expert will easily detect -- the man who on the two journeys has the rudder most against him will be the stronger oar.  This is not a matter of opinion; it is a mechanical truth.  A President who selected a man in preference to another because he had “rowed him around,” as the saying is, would be safe against all criticism.  To Therasites, who challenged his decision, he would be able to say, “If you don’t agree with me, get into the pair-oar, and try for yourself which is the stronger man.”  The President, maybe, does not care a jot what Therasites thinks.  But Therasites is a prevalent being in these days, and occasionally even a troublesome.  And if you can have conclusive argument ready for use, why resort to one that is inconclusive, either against him or any other critic?''

''Is, therefore, every Johnny who covets a seat in the University boat to be allowed to challenge any other who has already a good chance of rowing therein?  Non sequitur.  The aspirant might be compelled to show that he was the strongest oar in his own College -- barring Old Blues -- before having the right to “send in his name” to the P.U.B.C.  And he would show this, of course, by practical victories in the same sort of trials as those above referred to.  Captains and Committees of College Boat Clubs would not object to the trouble therein involved.  For it is their interest, as well as the University’s, that an unknown rowing genius should not blush unseen within the College walls.  Rowing “trials,” not of the inconclusive Trial Eight type, might become fashionable as well as useful.  If not, the institution, having been proved a failure, would die out.  Hitherto it cannot be said to have had a fair chance of success.  The Harrow or Winchester boy, however strong, and however likely to prove a first-rate oarsman, feels naturally shy about challenging competition with the Freshman who has come up from Eton with all the honours of the Ladies’ Cup at Henley thick upon him.  The odds are, doubtless, that the latter is really the better man for the University boat.  But in that minority of cases where the reverse occurs the newcomer from the non-rowing school has no fair start.  He has practically no chance -- or very little -- of showing that if given a place in the boat he will do better than the other.  That chance he ought to have; and he might have it if, without undue presumption, he were allowed to “send in” his own name.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">= The Fall of the Han Dynasty =

The Han Dynasty was, during its reign, one of the most sucessful in Chinese imperial history. It was preceded only by the Qin dynasty, the first to unite China as an empire, and the rulers of the Han perfected the socio-political balance necessary for the typical ancient autocracy. It was interrupted only briefly by rebellion, but had the durability to maintain order even in such  turbulent times. Many have hypothesized that this strength came from the religious pervasiveness of the Emperor, whose influence was felt in all aspects Chinese ritual and even daily existence. And it is quite feasible that this central theme of authority, once established, and a lack of natural disasters, attributed to the Dynasty's success. 

Yet as a firm central government and lack of natural calamity may attribute to the success of the Han, the corruption of its administration and a series of natural disasters may be said to have been the cause of its downfall. Like most history, there is no single catalyst for the passing of the Han, rather an accumulation of misfortune. According to the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong, written in the 1400's, the Emperor Ling Di relied heavily on the advice of corrupt, imperial eunuchs, who used the fact that they had helped his predecessor Huan Di into power to persuade the Emperor. Slowly, and against all advice, the Emperor gave in to most of their whims. They used the court for personal gain, led by their most influential member, Zhang Rang.</text>

2. SCENE II. The Island. Before the cell of PROSPERO

[Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA]

MIRANDA.
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creatures in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O! the cry did knock
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth, or e'er
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.

PROSPERO.
Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.

MIRANDA.
O! woe the day!

PROSPERO.
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am: nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.

MIRANDA.
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

PROSPERO.
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me.--So:

[Lays down his mantle]

Lie there my art.--Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.

MIRANDA.
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am: but stopp'd,
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay; not yet.'

PROSPERO.
The hour's now come,
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst: for then thou wast not
Out three years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Carter, John Corrie == 

=== “Steered Three Winning Crews” (WH), July 3, 1912 ===

[[Image:Carter_JC_Vanity_Fair_1912-07-03.jpg|thumb|right]]''Were you at Henley fifty years ago?   Did you notice the cox of First Trinity, Cambridge?  Of course you did.''

''He was Johnny Carter, who steered three winning crews in the biggest races of that year.''

''This record has never been broken, I believe.''

''When he left the ‘Varsity he was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple, and “went” the Midland Circuit, still keeping up his habit of winning.''

''Briefs came to the young lawyer, but he could have handled more.  He did not pine, however, for other duties came his way.''

''When the Midland Railway wanted a new member on its board about fifteen years ago, he gave up practice entirely and devoted himself to “directing” what many think is our most perfect railway.''

''His service in this capacity has been as significant as his earlier successes.''

''To him must be attributed the present wholesome policy of enabling the employees of the company to purchase small allotments of stock.  The result is that up to the limit of his holding each man feels he owns the railway -- which means that he will not lightly strike against his own interests.''

''This is a notable work, and the entire country owes Mr. Carter a debt for this initiative.''

''Mr. Carter has been for many years Recorder of Stamford and Chairman of the Quarter Sessions for Radnorshire.''

[[Image:Henley_train_station_ILN_1894.jpg|thumb|right|Henley train station during the regatta, 1894]]''He has edited three editions of the well-known law-book, “Rogers on Elections”; also a piscatorial classic, “Ronald’s Fly-Fisher’s Entomology,” which was written by his uncle seventy-six years ago.  This book is still used by the best fly-tiers.''

''A good sportsman and a useful citizen, his friends say he desires only to do well what comes to hand.''

''He has no taste for politics, but favours liberal principles in government as he understands them.''

''Mr. Carter loves his books, his rod, and his gun.  On the wall of his library hangs the old Trinity rudder, which has been for half a century so pleasant a reminder of happy days on the River.''

''What he likes most of all is “non-competitive golf.”  You see he cannot bear to lose a game.''

John Corrie Carter (1840-1927), the only coxswain ever featured in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, steered not three but four winning crews at Henley (Grand, Ladies’, Stewards’, and Visitors’), and it was not 50 years before his appearance in the magazine, but 51 (Henley1861).  The rest of the account is accurate, though also a sad example of T.R. Allinson’s editorship in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s waning two years.  The Stewards’ was made a coxless event in 1873 and the Visitors’ in 1874.	

On Carter’s role in the Grand (at 8 st. 10 lb.), &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Bell’s Life&lt;/span&gt; in 1861 reported:  “The Cambridge steering was very good in this race, and indeed much credit is due to the coxswains generally at this regatta, for the way in which they managed the starts in a strong wind, and also for keeping clear in those heats where three boats started abreast.”

=== “My garments expansion require” ===
“What more pathetic sight is there than a coxswain who starts his career with not ill-founded hopes of winning distinction, and then begins to increase in bulk, his prospects sinking as his weight rises,” wrote R.H. Forster,” till the vision of a ‘blue’ fades first to the less artistic white of a Trial Cap, and then sets altogether?”  As told in his 1894 verse:

''I once was a light little cox,''&lt;br&gt;
:''The smartest that ever was seen; &lt;br&gt;
''For I stood but five three in my socks,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And weighed barely seven thirteen:'' &lt;br&gt;
''The figures I give you are true,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And I coxed in a club Trial Eight;'' &lt;br&gt;
''And they said I was sure of my blue,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And I was -- till I went up in weight.'' &lt;br&gt;


''The change was begun in the Vac.,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''For I spared not the well-fatted calf;'' &lt;br&gt;
''And I found myself, when I came back,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Increased by a stone and a half.'' &lt;br&gt;
''Still they set me to cox a Lent crew,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''But docked my allowance of grog,'' &lt;br&gt;
''Threw doubts on my chance of a blue,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And said I was fat as a hog.'' &lt;br&gt;


''Yet still there comes increase of weight,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''My garments expansion require,'' &lt;br&gt;
''I project o’er each side of the eight,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And my buttons are fastened with wire.'' &lt;br&gt;
''They make me take runs in the Backs,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''(Now my running is marvellous poor):'' &lt;br&gt;
''And their pointed allusions to “stacks”'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Are very ill-natured, I’m sure.'' &lt;br&gt;


''O ‘Varsity President, you'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Are in need of an oarsman of weight:'' &lt;br&gt;
''Then give me, O give me my blue!'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Next year, ‘twill I fear, be too late.'' &lt;br&gt;
''For if in this way I enlarge,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Next year, I would have you to note,'' &lt;br&gt;
''Nought less than the bulkiest barge'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Will be able to hold me and float!''{{ref|Forster}} &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
When a form loads you want to set the initial cursor position so the user's first keystrokes are entered into the first field.  This prevents the user from having to select the the first field on a form with the mouse.  Although some people consider this &quot;polish&quot; it is the hallmark of a conscientious developer.

== Method ==
To perform this task you must do two things.  First you need to give the control you want to recieve the first keystroke event an '''id''' attribute.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:input id=&quot;first-field&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:label&gt;Search&lt;/xf:label&gt;
&lt;/xf:input&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The next step is to use the '''xforms-ready''' event to set the focus to this field using the '''setfocus''' element.

These initial actions are usually placed at the end of the model in the html header but before the body.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:model&gt;
   ...
   &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-ready&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:setfocus control=&quot;first-field&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/xf:action&gt;
   ...
&lt;/xf:model&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== The image has no effect ==

Ok, I'm just about as NOOB as you can be, only started with the first tutorial here yesterday, so there is hope that I'm just missing something, branching off in the wrong direction somewhere: the height map image has no effect on the landscape, it's just random noise, as I would get without an image.
I've done the same tutorial a few times now, always with the same result.
One thing that is suspicious is that we start in edit mode, and later it says to switch into edit mode; when did we switch into object mode?
[a little later:] In the next tutorial, the nor button is used, and I suspect that that is exaclty what is missing here, since the way it reads now we're turning color off in Map To, and nothing else on.

I'm a total noob as well but have been making great progress through these tutorials. However, this page is BADLY written! When we save an image in Photoshop, what format should we use? And the paragraph about bringing in your image is indecipherable. I don't see anywhere that it says &quot;now you have your image&quot;, or &quot;browse through your files to find your image.&quot; I can't get my image into Blender. I click on Add New in textures under Links &amp; Pipelines and nothing happens. This whole page is vague, poorly written and frustrating. It keeps asking questions that as a beginner I don't know the answers to. Please if you know how to get my image, or what format, let me know!

== For the ones above ==

I (random noob) figured this step out after a couple hours. I've updated the article in an attempt to make it easier to understand.
To address your problems:
# '''Image:''' I don't know which formats blender supports, but it supports JPEG (lossy) and PNG (lossless) so it's a good idea to save the images you intend to use in one of those formats.
# '''Heighmap produce random noise:''' Most likely it's not random, you'll see a pattern (make a 128x128 grid and you'll see it for sure) because the heightmap will be tiled, not stretched when you apply it after scaling the grid. Scale the grid after you've done the noise thing (zoom in instead for the time being) and it should work great.

I hope this helps. I removed the &quot;noob notes&quot; (I wrote the first one anyways) as they could be confusing, but here they are:

'''Noob note''': I recommend '''not''' scaling the grid yet. When I scaled the grid (Blender 2.44) before doing the &quot;noise&quot; thing i got the same result as described [http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?p=1001938 here]

(('''Another Noob's response''':  I found out what causes that, sort of.  When you load the height map image, the 'Map Image' box has a panel of buttons that affects this whole process - Extend, Clip, ClipCube, Repeat, and Checker.  The default is Repeat, which just tiles the image over the scaled grid.  From what I can tell, changing the MaxX and MaxY values from 1.000 to something far smaller, say 0.100, seems to partially fix the problem - with that setup I get an almost good result, except that it doesn't line up the image properly - it's more like four tiles meeting up at about center and going off of the grid in every direction.  Oh, and also - larger images don't actually produce larger tiles, so making a 1200x1200 pixel image won't be any better at solving this than a 200x200 pixel image - you'll just get more detail in those tiles.

== Request moving this section ==

&quot;''This entire Tutorial presumes that you are already familiar with other Editing Software, such as GIMP... and already know how to create &quot;textures&quot; with that software. In other words, this is not a &quot;Noob Tutorial&quot; for individuals who are very new to Blender, as it does not, unfortunately explain in any way, how to create Textures within Blender to complete this Height Mapping stuff it is trying to teach''&quot;

For this reason, I do not think this tutorial belongs in the &quot;Learn to Model&quot; section.  This would be better fit in the &quot;Advanced&quot; or &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; tutorial sections. --[[User:Zilch|Zilch]] ([[User talk:Zilch|talk]]) 07:23, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lawes, Charles Bennett == 

=== “Athlete and Sculptor” (Verheyden), May 12, 1883 ===

[[Image:Lawes_CB_Vanity_Fair_1883-05-12.jpg|thumb|right]]''The heir to a good old name, to an honourable new baronetcy, and to a very large fortune, Mr. Lawes was early moved by the ambition, not at all to enjoy the gifts of fortune, but to become and to deserve something in his own proper person.  At Eton and at Cambridge he distinguished himself by winning, in athletic contests, every prize that could be won as an oarsman and as a pedestrian; but on leaving the University he became smitten with a love of art, and especially of the art of sculpture, to which he has since devoted himself with the thoroughness and tenacity which characterise all his undertakings.  Looking neither to the right nor to the left, and foregoing not only all society, but all other things that might interfere with what he regards as his mission, he passes the whole of his days in his studio; and, if natural predilection and earnest application count for anything, should someday produce some fine work.  That in sculpture as in athletics he will one day achieve fame he is persuaded; and meanwhile he holds the sculptor’s art to be one which none but those with a mission should essay, and which it is his privilege as well as his duty to protect against all assaults on the part of those who may not have such a mission.''

Charles Bennett Lawes (1843-1911) did indeed collect pots for rowing and running, before taking a 3rd in the 1865 natural sciences tripos.  At Eton he won the tub sculling (1858), school pulling (1859), sculling (1860), and rowed in the Eight three years (1860-62), each time beating Westminster, and on the track won the 100 yards, hurdles, quarter-mile, and mile, as well as the steeplechase.  On leaving school, he gave a Challenge Cup for the mile race, stipulating that anyone who won it and the other four, as he had done, could keep it.  When one E. Lee did so in 1891, Lawes donated a second cup under the same conditions, but added that the sculling, pulling, and tub sculling must also be won, as he had done, to retire the cup.  No one has claimed it yet.{{ref|Littleton}}  

For Third Trinity, Cambridge, Lawes won the Colquhoun Sculls in 1862 and went Head of the River in 1863 and 1865, and at Henley he rowed in the Grand, Ladies’, and Diamonds, winning the Diamonds in 1863 and the Ladies’ in 1865.  In 1865 he won the Wingfield Sculls and stroked the losing Boat Race crew.  He won the half-mile, the mile (1864), and the two miles (1865) at the university sports; the mile (1864 and 1865) at the inter-university athletics, and the one mile amateur championship at the Amateur Athletic Club in 1865.  In 1898, at age fifty-five, he took up speed cycling and the next year gained the amateur record for twenty-five miles, covering it in 51:15.8.

After Cambridge, Lawes devoted himself to sculpting.  He studied in London under J.H. Foley, R.A. and in 1869 under Professor Hagen in Berlin.  From 1872 to 1908 he exhibited twelve works at the Royal Academy.  “His figures and portraits showed real ability, though his success was not quite equal to his ambition.”{{ref|DNB}}   In 1900, Lawes succeeded to the baronetcy, came into the family fortune, and inherited the Rothamsted Experimental Station that his father, a famous horticulturist, had established.  Lawes took the additional surname “Wittwronge” in 1902 after an eighteenth century kinsman from whom the family had derived the Rothamsted estate, and died in 1911 after an operation for appendicitis.

=== ''Belt v. Lawes'' ===
Why did &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; feature Lawes in 1883, an ex-athlete with modest artistic success?  Because he had lost a major libel case, which had been  brought based on statements made two years earlier in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; concerning one Richard Claude Belt.  Bowles himself laid the groundwork for ''Belt v. Lawes'' with the following carefully-hedged broadside August 20, 1881:

[[Image:Byron_statue_Hyde_Park_Corner_front.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Statue of Lord Byron (1880), Hyde Park Corner, London]]''Mr. Belt is undoubtedly the fashionable sculptor of the day.  Private busts, public monuments, and indeed all the pick of the work of sculpture, have lately been entrusted to him.  He is in favour at Court, he is known in the gilded saloons -- in short, he is the sculptor of renown.  And to judge of his talents by the works that bear his name, his reputation is well deserved.  Those works have met in these columns the praise we hold to be their due.  The bust of the late Mr. Eliot Yorke is admirably good, that of Lord Beaconsfield is excellent, so are the busts of Charles Kingsley and of Canon Conway, and though the Byron Statue is far from being equal to these, there can be no doubt of the general excellence of the work that bears Mr. Belt’s name, or of the claim of its author to a very considerable reputation.''

''But is Mr. Belt really the author of the works that bear his name?''

''Three weeks ago we drew attention to the fact that two of these works -- the busts, namely, of Baron Lionel de Rothschild and of the Prince Imperial -- claimed by Mr. Belt as his, and attributed to him in the catalogues of the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery, had been alleged in a paragraph in the Morning Post to be the work not of Mr. Belt, but of a Mr. Verhyden.  Thereupon our contemporary Truth published a statement that in fact all the productions ascribed to Mr. Belt were in fact the work of a Mr. Vanhyden, and ought to be ascribed to him.''

''The matter is one of no small importance not merely for Mr. Belt, but also for the world at large.  If Mr. Belt has really designed and executed the works that pass under his name, a cruel wrong has been done him.  If, on the contrary, not he but some other person or persons did indeed design and execute them, then Mr. Belt is the wearer of borrowed plumes which he ought not to be allowed to retain.''

''Feeling that this was a matter of much public interest, we caused inquiries of an extensive and detailed character to be made in the quarters where information was most likely to be obtained; and we now lay the result of those inquiries before our readers.''

[[Image:Byron_statue_Hyde_Park_Corner_Belt_signature.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Belt signature on the Byron statue]]''First, then, we find that among artists -- by which we mean especially but not exclusively sculptors -- there is an agreement of opinion, very openly and very plainly expressed, that Mr. Belt has not any claim to be considered as a sculptor, and that he is, in fact, only an ingenious and successful sculpture-broker, who presents to the public, as his own, work that has invariably been designed and executed by other hands than his.  This opinion appeared to warrant further investigation which, being pursued resulted in the following being communicated to us as Mr. Belt’s history in the arts.''

''Mr. Belt, in 1870, when about the age of nineteen, obtained employment in the studio of Mr. Foley, the sculptor.  Here he remained, as a monumental mason, for ten months, when Mr. Foley intimated to him that he had no further need of his services.  Mr. Belt accordingly left Mr. Foley with whom this was his only connection.''

''In the spring of 1871 however he applied to Mr. Lawes (a former pupil of Mr. Foley’s) for a situation in his studio.  This he obtained, and he remained with Mr. Lawes in the capacity of general attendant for four years.  Mr. Lawes states that during that period Mr. Belt neither executed, nor was able to execute, any artistic work whatever.''

''After leaving Mr. Lawes’s studio in 1875, Mr. Belt began to do business on his own account.  He published as his own work a statuette of Dean Stanley, of which a good deal has been lately heard.  This statuette however was worked up for him by Mr. Brock, as Mr. Brock himself declares.  In like manner, the memorial busts of Charles Kingsley and of Canon Conway which also pass as the work of Mr. Belt, were in fact invested by Mr. Brock -- as Mr. Brock himself declares -- with whatever artistic merit they possess.  Mr. Brock, equally with Mr. Lawes, declared that Mr. Belt was himself incapable of doing anything in the shape of artistic work.''

''In 1876 Mr. Belt took into partnership Mr. Verhyden.  Mr. Verhyden states that the drawings which procured for Mr. Belt the Conway monument (the bust of which was, as already stated, worked up by Mr. Brock) were his, and not Mr. Belt’s at all.  Mr. Verhyden further declared that he (Mr. Verhyden) and not Mr. Belt entirely modelled the sketch which enabled Mr. Belt to gain the victory over all the artists of the day in the Byron competition; and that he (Mr. Verhyden) also entirely modelled the Byron statue itself.''

''In short, we are assured that all Mr. Belt’s works from the year 1876, when he began business on his own account, up to the year 1881, were executed by Mr. Brock and Mr. Verhyden.''

''Mr. Verhyden states, equally with Mr. Lawes and Mr. Brock, that Mr. Belt was quite incapable of doing any artistic work whatever.''

''The names we have cited are those of only some among a number of men of the highest position in the artistic world, among whom our inquiries have been made.  And we feel bound to say that in the face of the detailed statements made to us, the bare outlines of which we have here set down, we find it difficult to believe that Mr. Belt has any good claim to the authorship of the works given to the public as his, or to any other title than that of a purveyor of other men’s work, an editor of other men’s designs, a broker of other men’s sculpture.  If he declared himself to be this there would be no harm in it.  But the point is that, if our information is correct, he has systematically and falsely claimed to be the author of the works for which he was only the broker, that he presents himself as a sculptor and an artist when in reality he is but a statue-jobber and a tradesman.''

''If, then, the statements made to us are true -- and we frankly avow that at present we fully believe them to be perfectly true -- Mr. Belt has been guilty of a very scandalous imposture, and those who have admired and patronised him as a heaven-born genius are the victims of a monstrous deception.''

''Why this deception -- if it be one -- should have been allowed so long to exist is a matter which does not concern us -- though we must say that it does very greatly concern those artists and others who were aware of it.  But we, having got hint of it, and having upon this hint made very full investigation, should not be doing our duty were we to withhold from the public the result of that investigation.  Accordingly, we have set down the information  we have obtained, and with it the conviction which that information has produced upon us, that Mr. Belt is not the author of the works that have made him to be believed to be a sculptor of genius.  Every paper in London announced on Thursday morning the fact that Mr. Belt had received from the Queen a commission to execute another statue of Lord Beaconsfield.  We shall be glad to know that Her Majesty’s choice of an artist is really warranted.''

Over the next month, these allegations in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; of professional incompetence and palming-off spiralled, as Belt kept quiet.  Lawes weighed in September 24:

''Sir, -- I am sure that I am expressing the feeling of the whole profession of sculptors when I say that we are extremely obliged to you for finding out and publishing the true history of Mr. Belt’s career.  We have always known him to be nothing but an “artistic” impostor, and, by giving us an opportunity of expressing ourselves publicly on the matter, we have been enabled, I think, to remove the imputation of “professional jealousy” upon which he so successfully traded.''

''There is one thing more that we should like to do, and that is to meet Mr. Belt and his “influential friends” in a court of justice, and satisfy the latter of the truth of the assertions we have lately made in your paper.''

''We are very sorry to see people in the highest social position pledged to a discreditable affair of this sort; but the reasons that have led them into their position are briefly these --''

''Firstly.  That anybody can do a bad bust.''

''Secondly.  That they have seen Mr. Belt at work.''

''Thirdly.  That they have never been introduced to a “ghost” -- that is to say,  a person employed by incompetent artists secretly to do up their work and make it artistic.''

''These “ghosts” are naturally rarely seen and difficult to catch, but, once in a court of law, it is wonderful what funny stories could be got out of them.''

''This is not the first attempt that has been made to bring Mr. Belt’s doings into the light of day; for at the time that he signed the drawings for the “Conway Monument,” and passed them off as his own, an attempt was made to do what we are doing now; but it was “bungled,” I believe; the “ghost” was scared and got away, and the affair had to be dropped.''

''In conclusion I must say that the way in which the work turned out by Belt, Verheyden, and Co. has been extolled in the newspaper is most ridiculous and contemptible, were it not injurious; and Mr. Verheyden himself would, I am sure, be the first to laugh at it; for he is, I believe, a genuine artist, though not a professed sculptor.''

''Now that the partnership is dissolved, there is, I hear, a great falling off in the quality of work (and it has been described to me as “wretched stuff” by people that understand it).  Either Mr. Belt’s present “ghost” is a bad “ghost,” or -- who knows? -- he might be doing the work himself, for, as I said before, “anybody can do a bad bust,” as the quantities exhibited every year bear ample testimony.  Finally, if the representatives of newspapers, instead of taking up and puffing the first artist they come across, were to make it their duty to visit the studios of the various sculptors, both high and humble, and make themselves acquainted with the position and workings of the profession, “Belts” would no longer be possible, and statues like the Byron would cease to be produced. --''

''Yours truly,   CHARLES LAWES.''

Three weeks later, Belt sued both Lawes and &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, but proceeded only against Lawes due perhaps to his deeper pockets and more aggressive, less legally-artful accusations.  The case went to trial in mid-June 1882 and immediately became a society and media event (although &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; remained understandably silent).  For one, the judge and key lawyers all appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; either before or as a result of the case:  Baron J.W. Huddleston (Feb. 28, 1874), the judge; Sir Hardinge Giffard (June 28, 1878) and Montagu Williams (Nov. 1, 1879) (both for Belt); and Charles Russell (May 5, 1883, Mar. 29, 1890, and Dec. 5, 1891) and Richard Webster (May 26, 1883, Nov. 25, 1897, and Jan. 15, 1913) (for Lawes).  For another, Belt’s witnesses necessarily included an array of society figures who had sat for Belt or seen him working, while Lawes’ witnesses came largely from the sculptoral elite of the Royal Academy.  ''Belt v. Lawes'' thus pit the art establishment against some of its society patrons.  The trial ran forty-three sittings in the old Westminster law courts.

Just after Christmas 1882, the jury found for Belt and awarded him an unprecedented £5000.  Bowles promptly spent a page and a half in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; reprinting other papers’ criticisms of Baron Huddleston’s handling of the case.  From the &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Spectator&lt;/span&gt;:  “[The] charge can be compared only to another and much shorter one, which is said to have been delivered in these words, ‘Gentlemen of the jury, the prisoner at the bar stole the boots.  You will find a verdict in accordance with your opinion of the evidence.’”  To such remarks Bowles added his own voice, starting with the judge’s favoritism towards Belt’s society witnesses (&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, January 6, 1883):

''In the first place, he ordered a considerable number of witnesses for the Plaintiff to be examined -- not in the customary manner in the witness-box -- but from seats on the Bench beside himself; and, what was a still greater error, allowed many of these witnesses -- including Mr. Alex Yorke (the principal witness for the Plaintiff) and others of the Plaintiff’s warmest and most undisguised partisans -- to remain seated on the bench day after day subsequent to their having given their evidence, while his own wife, Lady Diana Huddleston, was seated by his and by their side, and engaged with them in conversation and in the exchange of papers.  This was an error very apt to lead the jury to form an erroneous estimate of the value of their evidence of these witnesses as compared with those on the other side.''

Five months later, in May 1883, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured Lawes and his lawyers Russell and Webster, offering them praise and encouragement as they moved for a new trial and began to appeal.  (Verheyden did all three portraits, the Napoleonic rendering of Lawes imbuing him with a calm but righteous firmness.)  Eventually, under prodding from the appellate court that included two Cambridge Blues (Denman and Brett), Belt agreed to a reduction in damages to £500, but Lawes chose to go for broke.  Unfortunately for him, that’s exactly what he was forced to do, for in March 1884 the court affirmed the original award (which had by then swelled to £10,000 in damages and costs) and to stave off the ignominy of having to pay Belt anything, Lawes promptly filed for bankruptcy.  The fact that one of Belt's leading witnesses, a certain Mr. Schotz, came forward in January 1885 and confessed his testimony was perjured, did not alter the situation.{{ref|NYT}}  Lawes spent the next sixteen years poor, before inheriting from his father.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= CHINA =
What differentiates Chinese history from the history of any culture of the world is its sheer magnitude. China is the oldest civilization in the world, with the famous Peking Man having been found to have lived near 400,000 years ago. The Chinese Neolithic Period is made unique to archaeologists by the sheer number of tools found littered within the cultural borders of its peoples. So one must always keep in mind that when discussing the history of China, you are discussing, without question, the most established civilization that has ever existed. 


But the most remarkable aspect of Chinese history to any student (for the sheer massiveness of it all can prove an intimidating wilderness for any beginner) must be its unrivaled documentation. Chinese culture places an immense value on knowledge of their own history, and so current events have been documented meticulously throughout the country’s lifespan, beginning with the famous, “Records of the Grand Historian,” written in the Han Dynasty under the reign of Emperor Wudi by Sima Qian (who we will discuss later in the chapter on the Han Dynasty). In fact, when in the 1400’s, when in Italy Dante Alighieri and the Western World was concerned with the metaphysical questions enumerated in the “Divine Comedy,”  Luo Guangzhong was writing the first novel in China, “The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” which was itself based on historically accurate events that occurred in China between 190 and 280 AD! Literary works such as these, as well as dry, written annals, serve as guidebooks for the initiate, to lead you through the maze of foreign names and Dynastic cycles. But before we test ourselves against the veritable jungle of Chinese chronology, there are a few key principles to Chinese history that must be understood. 
== The Basics ==


Being so well established, Chinese history has certain patterns and principles, outlined and discussed by historians who themselves lived in antiquity, at least from our perspective. The historian/philosopher Chu Hsi, who lived  in the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) outlined all of the legitimate dynasties up until his own, saying that only the Zhou, Qin, Han, Jin, Sui and Tang dynasties are “proper”, even though the common thought was that there were several more dynasties before that, and several vied for power in the dynastic shifts. He also elaborated that the rulers of Zhou (who was overthrown in civil war) were to be known as merely “kings” not “emperors”. This merely illustrates how central to politics and culture records and histories were to the Chinese people. 

But above all of these petty definitional questions rises the one basic principle from which all of Chinese history is derived. It is enumerated in “The Romance of the Three Kingdoms” as both the opening and closing lines. As it reads there, it is:
        '''''“The Empire long divided must unite, long united must divide. Thus has it ever been.”'''''

The Chinese view of history is a cyclical one, a constant process of dynastic unity, and inevitable civil disarray. The Zhou Dynasty, then the Warring States Period. The Han Dynasty, then the Three Kingdoms Period, and so on and so forth. It could be compared to Hegel's dialectic version of history, save that the Chinese interpretation of the inevitable cycle is a much different one. Chinese history must be viewed by the learner, as we enter this jungle, through the lenses with which the culture looks upon its own history: from the perspective of the cyclical pattern, the cultural pride, and the ubiquitous and imperative striving for a Unified China.

A common theme in any introduction to Chinese history is a discussion of the different English translations you will find of the same words, or names. The historian Sima Qian referred to above may be called by that name, or, under another system, he may be known as Ss'uma Ch'ien.

The two primary systems of English translation of Chinese texts are 
* The Wade-Giles system, developed in 1867 by Thomas Francis Wade. It was later expanded and improved upon Herbert Alan Giles. This system is used mainly in the early translations of many Chinese texts, which were popular in the mid to late 1800's and early 1900's. This system is often associated with the flowery language of those early translations, and is given a negative connotation for being out of date, and too dry and scholarly for common use outside of academic circles.
* The Pinyin system. This is the official transliteration system for Chinese to English, and as such, it will be employed in these articles almost exclusively. Any translations done in the Wade-Giles system exist only because no Pinyin counterpart could be found. But in the cases that a reader may have preexisting knowledge and be confused by these translations, or run across other translations in their own research (which we encourage you to do), the table at left should be sufficient to explain the significant differences in the systems.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Brain Metastases: Randomized Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;


In progress of being cross-linked from the [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Brain_Metastases|Brain Metastases]] chapter


==Steroids +/- WBRT==
*'''ECOG''' -- prednisone +/- whole brain RT
**Randomized. 48 patients. Brain metastases (by radioisotope brain scan, EEG, echo, angiogram, of CSF studies), and histologically proven cancer. Extracranial disease status not considered. Arm 1) Prednisone 40 mg QD x 4 weeks, then 30 mg QD until disease progression vs. Arm 2) Prednisone 40 mg QD + whole brain RT 4000 r in 22-29 days. At the end, further randomized to +/- prednisone 30 mg daily. Clinical criteria used since imaging unreliable
**'''1971''' PMID 5541678 -- &quot;The management of metastases to the brain by irradiation and corticosteroids.&quot; (Horton J, Am J Roentgenol Radium Ther Nucl Med. 1971 Feb;111(2):334-6.)
***Outcome: Clinical &quot;remission&quot; prednisone 63% vs. prednisone + RT 61%; duration of remission 5 weeks vs. 11 weeks (wide range); median OS 10 weeks vs 14 weeks 
***Toxicity: Alopecia
***Conclusion: Combination of radiation and prednisone offers only a slight advantage over prednisone alone

==Surgery +/- WBRT==
*'''Patchell study #2''', 1998 (1989-97) - PMID 9809728 &amp;mdash; &quot;Postoperative radiotherapy in the treatment of single metastases to the brain: a randomized trial.&quot; Patchell RA. JAMA. 1998 Nov 4;280(17):1485-9.  
**95 pts. Randomized. &lt;u&gt;Solitary&lt;/u&gt; brain met. Pts with complete resection (verified by MRI) randomized to postoperative whole brain RT or observation.  Dose was 50.4 Gy over 5.5 weeks. Allowed to have other sites of metastases, but KPS &gt;= 70%.
**Median f/u 43-48 wks. Postop RT was associated with less recurrence anywhere in the brain (18% vs 70%), at the site of resection (10% vs 46%), as well as other areas in the brain (14% vs 37%). Decreased neurologic death (6 of 43 pts, 14%; vs 17 of 39, 44%).  No difference in overall survival (unlike Patchell #1) or length of time patient remained independent.
**Criticism: non-standard whole brain RT dose

==WBRT +/- Surgery==
*'''Canada Multi-Institutional''' (1989-1993) -- WBRT 30/10 vs. Surgery + WBRT 30/10
**Randomized. 84 patients. Single brain metastasis, KPS &gt;50, no lymphoma/SCLC. Dexamethasone per institutional policy. Arm 1) WBRT 30/10 vs. Arm 2) Surgery + WBRT 30/10. Treatment within 3 weeks of CT scan.
**'''1996''' PMID 8839553 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized trial to assess the efficacy of surgery in addition to radiotherapy in patients with a single cerebral metastasis.&quot; (Mintz AH, Cancer. 1996 Oct 1;78(7):1470-6.) 
***Outcome: Median OS WBRT 6 months vs. surgery + WBRT 6 months (NS). No difference in QoL
***Conclusion: No benefit from adding surgery to whole brain RT
**Comment: Worse baseline KPS than Kentucky and Netherlands studies.

*'''University Hospital Leiden''' (Netherlands)(1985-90) -- WBRT 40/20 BID vs. Surgery + WBRT 40/20 BID
**Randomized. 63/66 patients. Single brain metastasis. Arm 1)  Pts randomized to resection + WBRT vs WBRT alone. XRT was to whole brain 2Gy BID for 40 Gy over 2 weeks. No MRI.
**'''1993''' PMID 8498838 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of single brain metastasis: radiotherapy alone or combined with neurosurgery?&quot; (Vecht CJ, Ann Neurol. 1993 Jun;33(6):583-90.)
***Outcome: Stable extracranial disease: median OS 7 months vs. 12 months. Progressive extracranial disease: median OS 5 months both groups (NS). 
***Functional independence: Stable extracranial disease: 4 months vs. 9 months. Progressive extracranial disease: 2.5 months both groups (NS). More rapid and longer after surgery + RT
**'''1994''' PMID 8040016 &amp;mdash; &quot;The choice of treatment of single brain metastasis should be based on extracranial tumor activity and age.&quot;  (Noordijk EM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Jul 1;29(4):711-7.)
***Outcome: median OS WBRT 6 months vs. surgery + WBRT 10 months (SS). Stable extracranial disease (7 months vs 12 months), active extracranial disease (5 months both groups). Age independent predictor (60 years). Majority of deaths due to systemic progression
***Conclusions: surgery and radiotherapy should be offered over radiotherapy alone. However, for patients with active extracranial disease, radiotherapy alone is sufficient.

*'''University of Kentucky / Patchell#1''' (1985-1988) -- WBRT 36/12 vs. Surgery + WBRT 36/12
**Randomized. 48 patients. Suspected &lt;u&gt;single&lt;/u&gt; brain metastasis. Dexamethasone 4mg Q6 hours. Arm 1) (biopsy) then WBRT vs. Arm 2) Surgery + WBRT. Surgery within 72 hours of randomization. WBRT within 14 days of surgery; within 48 hours of randomization or biopsy; dose 36/12
**'''1990''' PMID 2405271 - &quot;A randomized trial of surgery in the treatment of single metastases to the brain.&quot; (Patchell RA, N Engl J Med. 1990 Feb 22;322(8):494-500. 
***Outcome: Local recurrence WBRT 52% vs surgery + WBRT 20% (SS); time-to-recurrence 5 months vs &gt;14 months (SS). Distant brain recurrence 13% vs. 20% (NS). QoL (KPS &gt;=70, functionally independent) 2 months vs. 9 months (SS)
***Survival: Median OS 3 months vs. 9 months (SS), &quot;neurologic death&quot; 6 months vs. 14 months (SS). No difference in &quot;systemic death&quot;. 
***Toxicity: operative mortality 4%, operative morbidity 8%
***Conclusion: Patients with single brain metastasis treated with surgery + RT live longer, have fewer recurrences, and better quality of life than patients treated with RT alone

==SRS +/- WBRT==
*'''EORTC 22952-26001''' (1996-2007) -- Surgery/SRS +/- WBRT
**See: [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Brain_Metastases/SRS#Radiosurgery_.2B.2F-_WBRT | Radiosurgery +/- WBRT]]

*'''MD Anderson''' (2001-2007) -- SRS vs SRS + WBRT
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to significantly worse cognitive outcome in WBRT+SRS arm.'' 58 of expected 90 patients. RPA I-II (KPS &gt;=70), 1-3 brain mets (57% single). Arm 1) SRS (dose per RTOG 9005; median 19 Gy) vs. Arm 2) SRS first (median 20 Gy) + WBRT 30/12. No concurrent chemo. Primary endpoint neurocognitive function using HVLT-R recall test at 4 months
**'''2009''' PMID 19801201 -- &quot;Neurocognition in patients with brain metastases treated with radiosurgery or radiosurgery plus whole-brain irradiation: a randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Chang EL, Lancet Oncol. 2009 Nov;10(11):1037-44. Epub 2009 Oct 2.). Median F/U 9 months
***Outcome: Significant decline in 4-month recall SRS 24% vs. SRS+WBRT 52% (SS). Functional brain assessment no difference. 1-year LC 67% vs. 100% (SS); 1-year distant brain control 45% vs. 73% (SS). 1-year CNS DFS 27% vs. 73% (SS). Median OS 15 months vs. 6 months (SS). Salvage much more aggressive in SRS only arm
***Toxicity: SRS 7% Grade 4
***Conclusion: Patients treated with SRS + WBRT were at greater risk of memory decline at 4 months

*'''JROSG 99-1, Japan''' (1999-2003) -- SRS vs SRS + WBRT
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to low likelihood of showing a difference.'' 132 of expected 188 patients. 1-4 mets, size &lt; 3cm. RPA I-II (85% RPA II). 50% active extracranial disease.  11 centers in Japan. Arm 1) SRS alone (dose if &lt;2cm 22-25 Gy, if 2-3cm 18-20 Gy) vs. Arm 2) WBRT 30/10 followed by SRS. SRS dose reduced by 30%. Primary endpoint OS
**'''2006''' PMID 16757720 &amp;mdash; &quot;Stereotactic Radiosurgery Plus Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy vs Stereotactic Radiosurgery Alone for Treatment of Brain Metastases: A Randomized Controlled Trial.&quot; (Aoyama H et al. JAMA 2006;295 2483-2491.)
***Outcome: Median OS SRS 8.0 months vs. SRS + WBRT 7.5 months (NS); 1-year OS 28% vs. 38% (NS); CNS death 19% vs. 23% (NS). 1-year LC ~75% vs. ~90% (SS); 1-year distant brain control 36% vs. 59% (SS). Decreased need for salvage brain treatment (10 pts vs 29 pts) with WBRT. No difference in neurocognitive measures
***Conclusion: SRS alone can be a reasonable strategy, with close monitoring and salvage retreatment

==WBRT +/- SRS==
*'''RTOG 95-08''' (1996-2001) -- WBRT vs WBRT + SRS
**Randomized. 331 patients, 1-3 brain mets with maximum diameter 4 cm, RPA class 1 (26%) or class 2 (74%), lung 63%. Arm 1) WBRT 37.5/15 vs Arm 2) WBRT + radiosurgery (24-18-15 Gy based on size) 
**'''2004''' PMID 15158627 [http://rtog.org/pdf_document/Lancet_Brain_Mets_Reprint.pdf Full text] &amp;mdash; &quot;Whole brain radiation therapy with or without stereotactic radiosurgery boost for patients with one to three brain metastases: phase III results of the RTOG 9508 randomised trial.&quot; (Andrews DW, Lancet. 2004 May 22;363(9422):1665-72.)
***Outcome: Mean OS WBRT 6.5 months vs WBRT+SRS 5.7 months (NS); single metastasis 4.9 months vs 6.5 months (SS) though (NS) on multivariate analysis. Higher 3-month response rate and control at 1 yr (71% vs 82%). No difference in overall time to progression (any intracranial failure) and no difference in neurologic death. Local recurrence 43% more likely with WBRT than WBRT+SRS. Improved KPS (4% vs 13%) and decreased steroid use at 6 months but no difference in mental status. 
***Toxicity: Acute G3+ WBRT 0% vs WBRT+SRS 3%; Late G3+ 3% vs 6%
***Conclusion: WBRT+SRS improved KPS, no difference in OS. Benefit in OS for single metastasis

*'''Pittsburgh''' -- WBRT vs WBRT + SRS
**Randomized. ''Trial stopped early after significant interim benefit in brain control for WBRT+SRS arm''. 27 patients, 2-4 brain metastases &lt;2.5 cm, KPS &amp;ge; 70. Arm 1) WBRT 30/12 vs Arm 2) WBRT + SRS 16 Gy. Primary outcome brain control.
**'''1999''' PMID 10487566 &amp;mdash; &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole brain radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for patients with multiple brain metastases.&quot; Kondziolka D et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Sep 1;45(2):427-34. 
***Outcome: 1-year local failure WBRT 100% vs WBRT+SRS 8% (SS); time-to-failure 6 months vs 36 months (SS). Median OS WBRT 7.5 months vs WBRT+SRS 11 months (NS). However, patients in WBRT arm who received salvage SRS median OS 11 months (NS to WBRT+SRS), while patients who received only WBRT median OS 7 months (SS to WBRT+SRS)
***Conclusion: WBRT+SRS significantly improves control of brain disease; WBRT alone does not provide effective and lasting control

==Whole Brain RT Dose==
*'''Kogarah, Australia''' -- 40/20 BID vs 20/4 QD 
**Randomized. 113 patients, brain mets, stable or absent extracranial disease, ECOG &lt;3. Surgical resection 36%. Arm 1) 40/20 BID vs. Arm 2) 20/4. Primary outcome intracranial control and QoL. 
**'''2009''' PMID 19836153 -- &quot;Randomized Comparison of Whole Brain Radiotherapy, 20 Gy in Four Daily Fractions Versus 40 Gy in 20 Twice-Daily Fractions, for Brain Metastases.&quot; (Graham PH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Oct 14. [Epub ahead of print]) 
***Outcome: Median OS 40 Gy 6.1 months vs. 20 Gy 6.6 months (NS). Intracranial progression 44% vs. 64% (SS). Median time-to-CNS-progression 9 months vs 5 months (SS). Salvage RT/surgery 4% vs. 21% (SS). CNS death 32% vs. 52% (SS) 
***Toxicity: Minimal. QoL clinically improved in 20 Gy arm over 40 Gy arm, but (NS). 
***Conclusion: Intracranial control better with 40/20 BID than 20/4 QD; should be considered for better prognosis patients 


==Chemo-RT==
===Topotecan===
*'''Germany''' -- WBRT vs. WBRT + topotecan
**Randomized. ''Closed early due to slow accrual''. 96/320 patients with SCLC or NSCLC, with brain metastases. Arm 1) WBRT 40/20 vs. Arm 2) WBRT 40/20 + topotecan 0.4 mg/m2
**'''2009''' PMID 19127261 -- &quot;A phase III trial of topotecan and whole brain radiation therapy for patients with CNS-metastases due to lung cancer.&quot; (Neuhaus T, Br J Cancer. 2009 Jan 27;100(2):291-7. Epub 2009 Jan 6.) Median F/U 2.8 years
***Outcome: No difference in LR or PFS
***Conclusion: No significant advantage for concurrent topotecan in patients with lung cancer, but number too small

===Thalidomide===
*'''RTOG 0118; 2007''' (2002-2004) PMID 18164847 -- &quot;A Phase III Study of Conventional Radiation Therapy Plus Thalidomide versus Conventional Radiation Therapy for Multiple Brain Metastases (RTOG 0118).&quot; (Knisely JP, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Dec 28 [Epub ahead of print])
**Randomized. ''Closed early due to non-superiority.'' 183 accrued patients from goal of 332 patients. Multiple (&gt;3), large (&gt;4 cm), or midbrain metastases from extracranial disease, PS 0-1. Arm 1) WBRT 37.5/15 vs. Arm 2) WBRT 37.5/15 + thalidomide
**Outcome: median OS 3.9 months for both arms
**Toxicity: 48% discontinued thalidomide due to toxicity
**Conclusion: No survival benefit for thalidomide; significant toxicity


===Motexafin gadolinium===
*'''Wisconsin; 2003''' PMID 12829672 -- &quot;Survival and neurologic outcomes in a randomized trial of motexafin gadolinium and whole-brain radiation therapy in brain metastases.&quot; (Mehta MP, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul 1;21(13):2529-36.)
**Randomized. 401 patients (251 NSCLC). Arm 1) 30 Gy WBRT vs. Arm 2) concurrent MGd 5mg/kg/d
**Outcome: no difference in survival (4.9 months vs. 5.2 months, NS) or time-to-neurologic progression (9.5 months vs. 8.3 months, NS). Improvement in neurologic progression in NSCLC patients
**Conclusion: No benefit, except possibly for NSCLC brain mets


===Bromodeoxyuridine===
*'''RTOG 89-05; 1995''' (1989-93) - PMID 7673021 &amp;mdash; &quot;Results of a randomized comparison of radiotherapy and bromodeoxyuridine with radiotherapy alone for brain metastases: report of RTOG trial 89-05.&quot; Phillips TL et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Sep 30;33(2):339-48. 
**Randomized. 72 patients, KPS &gt;=70, primary absent, controlled, or under RT; no other mets. WBRT 37.5/15 +/- bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
**Outcome: Median OS RT alone 6.1 months vs. RT + BrdUrd 4.3 months (NS)
**Conclusion: No benefit for BrdUrd

==Radioprotectants==
'''''Methylphenidate (d-MPH)'''''
*'''Wake Forest; 2007''' PMID 17869448 -- &quot;A Phase III, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial of d-threo-methylphenidate HCl in Brain Tumor Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy.&quot; (Butler JM Jr, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Sep 13; [Epub ahead of print])
**Randomized. 68 patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors. Arm 1) prophylactic d-MPH 5mg BID -&gt; 15mg BID vs. Arm 2) observation. Outcome measure QOL and cognitive function
**Outcome: No difference in fatigue, QOL, or cognitive function
**Conclusion: Prophylactic d-MPH not beneficial in brain tumor patients</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Andromeda Tonks''''', wife of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]] and mother of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], was born into the Black family, but has been disowned.
 
== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are discussing the tapestry of the Ancient and Honorable House of Black, Sirius mentions Andromeda in passing, saying she has been removed from the tapestry for the unforgivable crime of marrying a Muggle-born wizard, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] is their daughter.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

When Harry first sees Andromeda, he almost mistakes her for her sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], and is on the point of casting a jinx at her, but cannot find his wand. She, like her husband, is dismayed to hear that they had been ambushed by Death Eaters, and is concerned that her daughter may have gotten hurt.

== Strengths ==

We don't see much of Andromeda, but we know she must have significant strength of character to marry Ted Tonks, a Muggle-born, in the full knowledge that this would cause the Black family to effectively cast her out.

== Weaknesses ==

Her family – especially [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]] – is her weakness. This being all the family she has, with the Blacks disowning her, she will be concerned, perhaps overly so, with the wellbeing of her husband and daughter.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

She is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]]'s sister. She was the middle Black daughter, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s cousin, but she was disowned for marrying the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]. (He is not really a muggle, but being descended from Muggles is not considered to be a true Wizard.) Her parents are Druella and Cygnus Black. She is the mother of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], mother-in-law of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], wife of Ted Tonks, and grandmother of Teddy Remus Lupin.

}}

== Overview ==

'''''Bob Ogden''''', seen only in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], is a member of the department of Magical Law Enforcement. Our memory of him predates the birth of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

In Dumbledore's Pensieve, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and Dumbledore watch as Bob Ogden arrives at the Gaunt residence. He is attacked and cursed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]], who is interrupted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]]. Ogden tells Marvolo that Morfin had cursed a Muggle, and was required to attend a hearing at the Ministry. Marvolo, showing Gaunt family heirlooms, says that he and his family are pure-blooded wizards. Ogden's statements that purity of blood counts little in the eyes of the law are interrupted by the sound of horses, and the revelation (in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]] so Ogden doesn't understand it) that Marvolo's daughter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope]] is sweet on the Muggle he had Jinxed. Marvolo, furious that his daughter could fall for a Muggle, attacks her; Ogden, though not fully aware of what is going on, defends her and is attacked in turn, and makes good his escape, running headlong into the horses that were passing.

Dumbledore tells Harry that Ogden had returned with a squad and had subdued both Marvolo and Morfin. After their hearings, they had both been sent to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]].

== Strengths ==
Ogden takes his duties seriously and maintains a professional and courteous demeanor despite Marvolo's hostility toward him and the Ministry.  Ogden also shows bravery and compassion when he defends Merope from her father's assault.

== Weaknesses ==
Like most wizards, Ogden is not very experienced or skilled at the subtleties of Muggle clothing.  Trying to look like a Muggle, Ogden wears a frock coat and spats over a one piece bathing costume.

&quot;Ogden&quot; seems to be a common Wizarding surname, possibly an old family.  Professor Tofty, one of Harry's [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Major_Events/OWL_exams|O.W.L.]] examiners, mentions his friend '''Tiberius Ogden'''.  Tiberius was present at Harry's [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Order_of_the_Phoenix/Chapter_8|hearing]] in OOTP.  There is also '''Ogden's Old Firewhiskey''', a brand preferred by [[Muggles'_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Gilderoy_Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]].</text>

Though the Yiddish language took a heavy toll during the Holocaust, when most of its speakers were lost, the language is still commonly used to give ''shiurim'' or ''musar shmuessn'' in yeshivos. Unfortunately, many English-speaking yeshiva-students, though they already know many Yiddish words, and even incorporate them into their English, are unable to understand a full ''shiur'' given in Yiddish.

The purpose of this guide is to teach enough vocabulary and grammar to understand a Yiddish ''shiur''.

      <comment>/* Vowels */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Though a typical yeshiva bachur doesn’t need to read Yiddish too often, this lesson is essential so that you’ll be able to read the Yiddish words found in the remaining lessons.

Yiddish is written with the Hebrew alphabet. However, its rules of spelling are quite different. Unlike Hebrew, all vowels are written as full letters. Nekudos aren’t written, with a few exceptions, which are always written. Also, consonant blends are allowed. In other words, two consonants in a row are pronounced together, unlike in Hebrew where there must be a vowel or shva in between. For example, בּענטש is pronounced bentsh.

Words which come from Hebrew are spelled as they are in Hebrew, though they are pronounced the way Ashkenazim would pronounce them in everyday conversation (as opposed to the more correct pronunciation used for davening and layning). For example, יום טובֿ is pronounced yontiff; שלש סעודות is pronounced shalashudes; תּוספֿות is pronounced toysfis; ײשר כּח is pronounced shkoyach.

Pronunciation cannot always be determined exactly from the way it is spelled. For example, ער is sometimes pronounced like the English word air (such as in the word ער which means he) and sometime like the ''er'' in the English word h''er'' (such as the word שטאַרקער, stronger).

There are several different pronunciation systems for Yiddish; for convenience the Litvish and Polish systems are given here.

Following is a list of letters in the Yiddish alphabet, and how they differ from their Hebrew equivalents.

== Vowels ==
Some vowels are preceded by a silent א when they appear at the beginning of a word.

*אָ, אַ – pronounced the same as in Ashkenazi Hebrew (Polish: אָ is often ''oo'' as in t''oo'')
*ו – Litvish: ''oo'' as in t''oo'' (Polish: usually pronounce ''ea'' as in r''ea''d)
*ױ – This represents two distinct vowels. 1 Litvish: ''ay'' as in s''ay'' (Polish: ''oy''); 2 Litvish: ''oy'' as in b''oy'' (Polish: sometimes ''oy'' and sometimes ''ow'' as in b''ow''l); 
*י – ''i'' as in h''i''m (Polish: also ''ee'' as in gr''ee''n)
*ײ – Litvish: ''ay'' as in s''ay'' (Polish: ''y'' as in b''y'')
*ײַ – Litvish: ''y'' as in b''y'' (Polish: ''a'' as in c''a''r)
*ע – ''e'' as in b''e''d (Polish: also ''ey'' as in pr''ey'')

== Consonants ==

*א, ע – never used as a consonant in Yiddish, except for words that originate from Hebrew
*ב – always pronounced as a b, except in words originating from Hebrew. In these words, it may be pronounced with a v, in which case a line may be added on top (בֿ).
*ג, ד, ה, ז, ט, ל, מ, נ, ס, צ, ק, ר – same as Hebrew
*װ – when used as a v sound, a vov is always doubled
*ח, ת, כּ – used mostly in words originating from Hebrew
*י – same as in Hebrew, when used as a consonant. If a yud sound comes at the beginning of a word, it may be changed into an א (as in the word אידיש).
*כֿ – generally pronounced like a chof. In Hebrew words with a כּ, a dot is written.
*פֿ, פּ – f when written with a line, and p when not. If a p appears at the end of a word, it does not change into a ף (as in כֿאַפּ, catch).
*ש – when written without a dot (which is usually), it is pronounced sh. It has a dot for Hebrew words with a sin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several different words which all translate to the English word &quot;the&quot;. There are rules when to use each word, but if your goal is just to know basic Yiddish, it's not so important to actually know these rules.
{{../nword|דער, די, דאָס, דעם|the}}
{{../example|זאָגט דער רמבּ&quot;ן אַזױ.|The Ramban says the following:}}
{{../example|די ראשונים מאַכֿן אַ חילוק.|The Rishoinim differentiate.}}
{{../example|דאָס עסן אין ישיבֿה איז ניט גוט.|The food in Yeshivah isn’t good.}}
{{../example|ער האַלט פֿון דעם הסבּר.|He approves of the explanation.}}
|}
These words are also used to mean &quot;this&quot;. When it means this, more emphasis is given to the word.
{{../nword|דער, די, דאָס, דעם|this}}
{{../example|די סוגיא איז געשמאַק.|This subject is enjoyable.}}
|}
Another common word, which has already been used in some of the examples, is איז. It is usually pronounced exactly like the English word is, but sometimes the ז at the end is left unpronounced. It means the exact same thing as the English word is.
{{../nword|איז|is}}
{{../example|ער איז גערעכֿט.|He is correct.}}
|}
Here are a few more common words:
{{../nword|יאָ|yes}}
{{../example|עס איז יאָ שװער.|It is indeed difficult.}}
|}
{{../nword|נײן|no}}
{{../example|נײן! װאָס איז שװער?|No? What’s problematic?}}
|}
{{../nword|1=&lt;div style=&quot;direction:ltr;&quot;&gt;ניט (usually pronounced נישט)&lt;/div&gt;|2=not}}
{{../example|עס איז ניט שװער בּכֿלל.|It is not difficult at all.}}
|}
The word ניט is very often used together with קײן, which is somewhat hard to translate. It usually replaces the word אַ or אַן before a noun.
{{../nword|קײן|not}}
{{../example|איך האָבּ ניט קײן צײַט.|I don't have time.}}
{{../example|1=&lt;div style=&quot;direction:ltr;&quot;&gt;קײן עין הרע (usually pronounced keNAYne horo)&lt;/div&gt;|2=May there be no evil eye.}}
|}
{{../nword|אָדער|or}}
|}
{{../nword|אָבּער|but}}
|}
{{../nword|דען|then}}
|}
{{../nword|1=&lt;div style=&quot;direction:ltr;&quot;&gt;עס איז דאָ (usually shortened to ס'איז דאָ)&lt;/div&gt;|2=there is (literally: it is here)}}
{{../example|עס איז דאָ אַ פּני יהושע אױף דעם.|There is a Pnei Yehoshua about this.}}
|}
{{../nword|אַז|that}}
|}
{{../nword|אַזױ|so}}
{{../example|װי אַזױ?|How so?}}
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pot_schem.svg|right|thumb|100px|Circuit symbols for a potential divider]]

A potential divider, or potentiometer, consists of a number of resistors, and a voltmeter. The voltage read by the voltmeter is determined by the ratio of the resistances on either side of the point at which one end of the voltmeter is connected.

To understand how a potential divider works, let us consider resistors in series. The resistances add up, so, in a circuit with two resistors:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma R = R_1 + R_2&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply Ohm's law, remembering that the current is constant throughout a series circuit:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum V}{I} = \frac{V_1}{I} + \frac{V_2}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiply by current (I):

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma V = V_1 + V_2&lt;/math&gt;

So, just as the resistances in series add up to the total resistance, the potential differences add up to the total potential difference. The ratios between the resistances are equal to the ratios between the potential differences. In other words, we can calculate the potential difference across a resistor using the formula:

&lt;math&gt;V_{resistor} = \sum V \times \frac{R_{resistor}}{\sum R_{external}}&lt;/math&gt;

In many cases, you will be told to assume that the internal resistance of the power source is negligible, meaning that you can take the total potential difference as the EMF of the power source.

A potential divider may work by combining a variable resistor such as an LDR or thermistor with a constant resistor, as in the diagram below. As the resistance of the variable resistor changes, the ratio between the resistances changes, so the potential difference across any given resistor changes.

[[Image:Thermistor_potential_divider.svg|300px]]

Alternatively, a potential divider may be made of many resistors. A 'wiper' may move across them, varying the number of resistors on either side of the wiper as it moves, as in the following diagram:

[[Image:Potentiometer_diagram.svg]]

==Questions==

1. A 12 kΩ resistor and a 20 kΩ resistor are connected to a 9V battery. A voltmeter is connected across the 12kΩ resistor. What is the reading on the voltmeter? (Assume negligible internal resistance.)

2. A potential divider consists of 100 5Ω resistors, with a wiper which moves on one resistor for every 3.6° a handle connected to it turns. The wiper is connected to a voltmeter, and the circuit is powered by a 120V power source with negligible internal resistance. What is the reading on the voltmeter when the handle turns 120°?

3. A 9V battery with internal resistance 0.8Ω is connected to 3 resistors with conductances of 3, 2 and 1 Siemens. A voltmeter is connected across the 3 and 2 Siemens resistors. An ammeter is placed in the circuit, between the battery and the first terminal of the voltmeter, and reads 2A. What is the reading on the voltmeter?

      <comment>Corrected Q1, voltmeter connected across 12 kΩ resistor, previously stated 12Ω resistor.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. A 12 kΩ resistor and a 20 kΩ resistor are connected to a 9V battery. A voltmeter is connected across the 12 kΩ resistor. What is the reading on the voltmeter? (Assume negligible internal resistance.)'''

&lt;math&gt;V_{12 k\Omega} = 9 \times \frac{12}{12 + 20} = 3.375 V&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. A potential divider consists of 100 5Ω resistors, with a wiper which moves on one resistor for every 3.6° a handle connected to it turns. The wiper is connected to a voltmeter, and the circuit is powered by a 120V power source with negligible internal resistance. What is the reading on the voltmeter when the handle turns 120°?'''

First, work out the number (n) of resistors between the terminals of the voltmeter:

&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{120}{3.6} = 33.\bar{3}&lt;/math&gt;

The handle, then, has not turned enough to reach the 34&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; resistor, so the voltmeter is connected just after the 33&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; resistor.

&lt;math&gt;V = 120 \times \frac{33 \times 5}{100 \times 5} = 39.6\mbox{ V}&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. A 9V battery with internal resistance 0.8Ω is connected to 3 resistors with conductances of 3, 2 and 1 Siemens. A voltmeter is connected across the 3 and 2 Siemens resistors. An ammeter is placed in the circuit, between the battery and the first terminal of the voltmeter, and reads 2A. What is the reading on the voltmeter?'''

First, work out the resistances of the resistors:

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{G} = \frac{1}{3} , \frac{1}{2} , 1 \mbox{ }\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

Then, work out the external potential difference (i.e. excluding the potential difference lost due to the battery's internal resistance):

V&lt;sub&gt;external&lt;/sub&gt; = E - IR&lt;sub&gt;internal&lt;/sub&gt; = 9 - (2 x 0.8) = 7.4V

&lt;math&gt;V_{3\Omega , 2\Omega} = 7.4 \times \frac{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} + 1} \approx 6.17\mbox{ V}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Present tense ==
Most verbs are conjugated in the same form in present tense, though there are some exceptions. The subject usually comes before the verb (like in English), but sometimes the order is reversed (like Hebrew) to change the tone (most notably, in questions). Here is an example of a regular verb:
*הערן – hear
*איך הער – I hear
*דו הערסט – you hear
*ער הערט – he hears
*זי הערט – she hears
*עס הערט – it hears
*מיר הערן – we hear
*איר הערט – you (plural or formal) hear
*זיי הערן – they hear
Verbs that come from Hebrew are usually conjugated together with the word זײַן ''to be'', similar to in Yeshivish (they are Modeh; he is Meyasheiv the Stirah; they are Mechaleik between them). Here is an example:
*מסכּים זײַן – agree
*איך בּין מסכּים – I agree
*דו בּיסט מסכּים – you agree
*ער/זי/עס איז מסכּים – he/she/it agrees
*מיר/זיי זײַנען מסכּים – we/they agree
*איר זײַנט מסכּים – you agree

== Past tense ==
Past tense is conjugated by adding the helping verb האָבּן ''have'', and (usually) adding the letters גע to the verb. This is similar to some past tense words in English (&quot;I have done that.&quot;) For words which come from Hebrew, זײַן becomes געווען. Here are some examples:
*האָבּן געהערט - heard
*איך האָבּ געהערט – I heard
*דו האָסט געהערט – you heard
*ער/זי/עס האָט געהערט – he/she/it heard
*מיר/זיי האָבּן געהערט – we/they heard
*איר האָט געהערט – you heard

*האָבּן מסכּים געווען – agreed
*איך האָבּ מסכּים געווען – I agreed
*דו האָסט מסכּים געווען – you agreed
*ער/זי/עס האָט מסכּים געווען – he/she/it agreed
*מיר/זיי האָבּן מסכּים געווען – we/they agreed
*איר האָט מסכּים געווען – you agreed

== Future tense ==
Similar to past tense (and future tense in English), future tense is expressed by adding the helping verb װעלן ''will''. Here are the (now familiar) examples:
*וועלן הערן – will hear
*איך װעל הערן – I will hear
*דו װעסט הערן – you will hear
*ער/זי/עס װעט הערן – he/she/it will hear
*מיר/זיי װעלן הערן – we/they will hear
*איר װעט הערן – you will hear

*וועלן מסכּים זײַן – will agree
*איך װעל מסכּים זײַן – I will agree
*דו װעסט מסכּים זײַן – you will agree
*ער/זי/עס װעט מסכּים זײַן – he/she/it will agree
*מיר/זיי װעלן מסכּים זײַן – we/they will agree
*איר װעט מסכּים זײַן – you will agree

A '''Kartoshnik''' is a Russian holiday potato cake, typically made with cheese and onions.  A typical recipe may include potatoes, eggs, whipping cream, cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, baking powder and sour cream. It is assembled in such a way as to rise when cooking, and then slightly settle when cooled, resembling a cake.  It is then cut into squares, and served as a side dish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The new ANSI standards also emphasizes on a custom design for the safety sign . As per the standard convention a sign can include an Action statement, consequences, a symbol, the message can be written in mixed case and can add emergency information.

==Seven Steps to an effective ANSI Standard Safety Sign==
Here are seven secrets to make your signs and labels as effective as possible following the ANSI standards:

'''1. Over Emphasis on the Action'''

Give the viewer instructions on how to avoid the hazard. Bias the sign towards action. Signs are really advertisements for safety. They need to be persuasive.

'''2. Incorporating Symbols'''

Many people cannot read English. Many more cannot see clearly enough to read, even if they do understand English. A symbol provides a quick way to reinforce the safety message and broaden your audience.

'''3. Choosing the Proper Header'''

The header helps get the sign noticed. A warning, after all, should not be a wallflower.

''' 4. Describe the Hazards &amp; Consequences'''

You will die or get hurt if you ignore this warning! A safety message should tell you (1) why the situation is dangerous and (2) what will happen if you don't obey.

'''5. Write in a Headline Style'''

Use simple and direct words. Unfortunately, most people cannot read above the sixth grade level.

Use active rather than passive verbs: &quot;Wear Hard Hats&quot; is better than &quot;Hard Hats are Required&quot;. Avoid adverbs that are difficult to interpret: &quot;Respond within one minute&quot; is better than &quot;Respond quickly.&quot;

'''6. Provide Emergency Info.'''

Without a telephone number, lifesaving minutes can be lost. In a pinch, you don't want someone fumbling through the phone book to report an accident, or a potentially dangerous situation.
'''
7. Choose the Right Material'''

Installation and ordering costs are often more expensive than the sign itself. As a result, a durable sign always pay in the long run.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are quite a few prepositions in Yiddish, and they don't all quite correspond to an equivalent English expression. It takes a while to get used to all of their different uses. Here are a few examples of some common ones.

{{../nword|בּײַ|by, and all sorts of other words}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lots of verbs in Yiddish have associated adverbs attached to them. For equivalent English example, ''take'' and ''take on'' have quite different meanings, as do ''pay'' and ''pay back''. These added words are usually added on to the beginning of the word in infinitive form, and to the end in conjugated form. Here are a few examples.
{{../nword|אָנהײבּן|begin}}
{{../example|קענען מיר אָנהײבּן?|Can we begin?}}
{{../example|דער ריטבֿ&quot;א הײבּט אָן מיט אַ קשיא.|The Ritva begins with a question.}}
|}
{{../nword|צולײגן|add}}
{{../example|איך װיל צולײגן אַ ביסל צו דײַן װאָרט.|I would like to add a bit to your explanation.}}
{{../example|דער רשבּ&quot;א ברענגט דעם רמבּ&quot;ן און לײגט צו אַ פּאָר װערטער.|The Rashba quotes the Ramban and adds a few words.}}
|}
Another word which is commonly added to Yiddish verbs is the word זיך (pronounced zach or zich). It is always the next word after a verb, and it makes the verb before it passive. For example, עסן means to eat. עסן זיך means to be eaten.
{{../nword|זיך (pronounced זאַך)|(passive verb)}}
{{../example|װאָס הערט זיך?|What's up? (literally, what is heard, which is the source of the Hebrew expression מה נשמע?)}}
{{../example|דאָס רופֿט זיך אָן גירי דיליה.|This is called (from the verb אָנרופֿן, to call) his arrow (see the second Perek of Bava Basra).}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please feel free to edit, add to, and improve this book. The person who started this Wikibook does not speak Yiddish fluently at all, and it is very likely that there are many mistakes and lots of room for improvement.

Please try to conform to the following points if you contribute. If you disagree with any of these rules, discuss it on the discussion page and change the rule if a consensus is reached.
#No lashon hara, leitzanus, bizayon talmidei chachamim, nivul peh or any inappropriate content that a typical Yeshivah Bachur would not want to read.
#Try to keep the book as short as possible, but still containing all the useful information needed to understand a basic Shiur in Yiddish. For example, a lengthy list of all the appropriate way of adding adjectives to nouns would be considered unimportant. Keep in mind that the reader is already expected to know at least a basic level of Yeshivish, so it is unnecessary to teach words that exist in English (such as פּראָבּלעם), Hebrew/Aramaic (like חבֿר), or even basic Yeshivish (like טאַקע).
#Examples are very useful, since most of the readers probably already know the basic idea behind Yiddish, and just need some concrete usage to put it all together.
#To prevent confusion, both dageshes and rafes have been added to letters that can receive them (בּ, בֿ, כּ, כֿ, פּ, פֿ, תּ, תֿ). Please keep to this standard. If you would like to change this, you can discuss it on the discussion page, but keep in mind that it will take a long time to change the entire book to different standard.
#Don’t add unnecessary Nekudos. Only אָ, אַ, and ײַ get vowels (unless there is ambiguity).
#Don’t spell Yiddish words in English letters. See below to learn how to type Yiddish.
#Don’t use fancy English words. Though many Yeshivah Bochrim, and in particular those that don’t yet know Yiddish, do speak a high level of English, many don’t. On the other hand, don’t go out of your way to follow this rule. For example, there is simply no simple English word for conjugate.
#This book is only for Yiddish words and grammar that would be useful when trying to understand a Yiddish Shiur. If you would like to teach conversational Yiddish, then feel free to develop the [[Conversational Yiddish|other Yiddish Wikibook]], but this is not the place for it. Speaking of the other Wikibook, it is really a pity that no-one is working on it. Feel free to steal information from this book, though you'll probably have to significantly change the style due to the different audience. No forking is allowed in Wikibooks, but the content and style would have to be changed so significantly for the other book that it is very unlikely this would pose a problem.
#Include the code &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{{../Bottombar}}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the bottom of every page.
#Feel free to add yourself to the [[../Authors|Authors]] page if you have contributed significantly.

=== Using the templates ===
To produce one of the new word boxes, use the following code:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{{../nword|The new word goes here.|The translation goes here.}}
|}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
This produces the following box:
{{../nword|The new word goes here|The translation goes here}}
|}
Make sure that the two lines are kept on two separate lines. Don't worry if you see the punctuation in the Yiddish part going to the wrong side when editing; it will go to the right side when you save it (preview to test).

You may optionally add examples to the new word box by adding one or more example lines in between the two lines of the nword command, with the following exact format:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
{{../nword|The new word goes here|The translation goes here}}
{{../example|An example sentence goes here|Its translation goes here}}
{{../example|Another example sentence goes here|Its translation goes here}}
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which looks like this:
{{../nword|The new word goes here|The translation goes here}}
{{../example|An example sentence goes here|Its translation goes here}}
{{../example|Another example sentence goes here|Its translation goes here}}
|}
Again, remember to close it with the &lt;code&gt;|}&lt;/code&gt; at the end.

Speaking of the new word template, I would highly appreciate it if someone made it look nicer. I'm not insulting anyone, because I made the template myself. I don't like it. I especially don't like the look when there are a few of them on the same page. I tried centering it, and that made it even worse. Please remove this notice if you change it and you like the changes.

=== Typing Yiddish ===
It took me a while to figure out how to type certain Yiddish symbols, so I'll save you some time (if you’re using a relatively recent version of Windows). It is assumed that you know how to type Hebrew, and if you don't, there are lots of instructions around the Internet. If you don’t want to learn how to type Yiddish, and you just want to make a &quot;quick-fix&quot;, you can copy-and-paste from other parts of this book (such as Lesson 1).

Following is a list of Yiddish symbols that don't exist in Hebrew and how to type them in Windows. All of them assume that your keyboard layout is set to Hebrew. Right alt means the Alt key to the right of the space bar. It is unclear why there are separate symbols for ײ, ױ, and װ, but since they do exist the starter of this Wikibook does use them. You are welcome to use them or not as you wish. You can take a look at the keyboard layout from Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;On-Screen Keyboard.

*ײ – Right alt-H
*ױ – Right alt-J
*װ – Right alt-U
*ײַ – Right alt-H, Caps Lock, Shift-7, Caps Lock
*אַ – א, Caps Lock, Shift-7, Caps Lock
*אָ – א, Caps Lock, Shift-8, Caps Lock
*בּ – ב, Caps Lock, Shift-=, Caps Lock
*בֿ – ב, Right alt-- (that means Right alt pressed together with the minus symbol, i.e. underscore)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intended audience ==
Though the Yiddish language took a heavy toll during the Holocaust, when most of its speakers were lost, the language is still commonly used to give ''shiurim'' or ''mussar shmuessn'' in yeshivos. Unfortunately, many English-speaking yeshivah-students, though they already know many Yiddish words, and even incorporate them into their English, are unable to understand a full ''shiur'' given in Yiddish.

The purpose of this guide is to teach enough vocabulary and grammar to understand a Yiddish ''shiur''. 

Because of this intended purpose, this booklet differs from typical Yiddish lessons in two ways. 
First of all, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the large number of Yiddish words that most yeshivah bachurim already know. If you understand the following sentence, you should be okay: The Rambam holds that it’s a machlokes hasugyos, but other rishonim are meyasheiv the stirah.

The other difference between this book and others is the type of Yiddish that is taught. The goal of this ''kuntres'' is to enable the reader to listen to a ''shiur'' in Yiddish, not to buy a washing machine in Meah Shearim. &lt;noinclude&gt;If you want to learn the more everyday words of Yiddish, consider reading [[Conversational Yiddish|the other Yiddish Wikibook]].

&lt;/noinclude&gt;That being said, the grammar and much of the vocabulary presented here would be useful to anyone learning Yiddish.&lt;noinclude&gt; At the time of writing, the regular Yiddish Wikibook has very little content and this book may serve as a temporary substitute.&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Sections ==
The book is divided into two sections. The first section is about some basic grammar rules. It avoids going into any boring details that are unnecessary for someone whose sole purpose is to understand Yiddish, not to speak it. The second section is a list of words, divided into categories, which are commonly used in Yeshivos, together with examples.

The two sections are more or less independent of each other. You can read either section first, or both at the same time. If you are already more familiar with the vocabulary (as is common with people who have been learning in Yeshivah for a long time), you may want to concentrate more on the grammar section. If you already know the basic grammar (which is, in any case, similar to English and easy to pick up), you may wish to concentrate on the vocabulary section. One suggested reader order is first to read the [[../Reading Yiddish/]] section, followed by the section about [[../Some very common words/]], followed by the rest of the grammar section, and finally the remainder of the vocabulary section.

The book may be freely copied and distributed. Please be ''mezakeh'' the ''rabim'' by doing so.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{x86 Disassembly/Page}}

== Example: Hello World Listing ==

{{TextBox|1=Write a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; program using C or C++ and your favorite compiler. Generate a listing file from the compiler. Does the code look the way you expect it to? Do you understand what the assembly code means?

Here are examples of C and C++ &quot;Hello World!&quot; programs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
  printf(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

== Example: Basic Disassembly ==

{{TextBox|1=

Write a basic &quot;Hello World!&quot; program (see the example above). Compile the program into an executable with your favorite compiler, then disassemble it. How big is the disassembled code file? How does it compare to the code from the listing file you generated? Can you explain why the file is this size?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to be able to see a record of events as they happen.  This is a great way to learn about how XML Events work.

== Method ==
We create an instance and add a element to that for each event.

== Screen Image ==

== Link to Example ==

The above code doesn't work in the mozilla xforms plugin 0.8.5 with firefox 2.0.0.12 (it seems buggy dealing with instance). Try this code instead:

=== “A Far Advanced Radical” (Coïdé), November 25, 1871 ===

[[Image:Dilke_CW_Vanity_Fair_1871-11-25.jpg|thumb|right]]''Sir Charles Dilke is a far advanced Radical, a skirmisher who is ever ready to throw himself out far away from support, and to engage single-handed with the most portentous questions, which he attacks with a jaunty agility that leaves no doubt as to the contempt he feels for them.  As a man not yet thirty, he believes in “dear races,” in women, in the English language, and in Greater Britain, the destinies of which he has disposed of airily in a work wherein he has published all that he heard and thought in a rapid voyage around the world.  In the House of Commons he has displayed a marked want of reverence for age and prescription; and he is but too well known to whips as the founder and secretary of that compact body of kindred male and female politicians, the Radical Club -- the birth-place of all subversive ideas, and the cradle of all projects for forcing the unwilling Government to carry them into effect.''

''It was to be hoped that age and greater tactical experience would have made Sir Charles at least an endurable Radical, but his last exploit shows that any such hopes are not likely to be realised.  Himself the first inheritor of a title which was conferred through the personal friendship of a Royal Personage, he has, with a singular want of taste, attacked Royalty in a singularly wanton and unjust manner.  Sir Charles Dilke is unhappy when dealing with facts.  He asserts that the Queen’s pages do not pass examination when they enter the army; whereas they do pass examination.  He asserts that the Queen pays no income-tax upon her income; whereas She does pay it.  He asserts that the appropriation of savings out of the sums voted by Parliament for the Civil List to the Privy Purse is “directly in the teeth of the Act of Parliament”; whereas the Act expressly authorises such an appropriation.  Nevertheless, upon such assertions as these he has founded a suggestion so presented that it almost amounts to a charge of a conspiracy between Her Majesty and the Treasury to form a large private Royal fortune in an unlawful manner.  Seldom has so unwarrantable an attack been made, or one so ill-calculated for its purpose.  It has found an echo throughout the country which has unexpectedly proved the attachment of the English people to Royal Institutions, and above all to the Lady in whom they are personified; and Sir Charles Dilke in endeavoring to promote a Republic has but disclosed the strength of the Monarchy.''

Unlike his Cambridge contemporary C.B. Lawes, [[w:Sir_Charles_Dilke%2C_2nd_Baronet|Charles Wentworth Dilke]] (1843-1911) had no rowing experience on going up to Trinity Hall in 1862 but found, according to one of his biographers, that “it offered exactly the sort of purposive, vigorous, comparatively non-time-wasting athleticism which he wanted.”{{ref|Jenkins1}}  In this effort Dilke found a perfect role model in Leslie Stephen, his academic tutor and rowing coach, who founded the Dictionary of National Biography and had coached Hall crews while running alongside them on the towpath.{{ref|Bond}}  By the end of the first year Dilke was No. 4 in the Hall crew that entered the 1863 Grand and Ladies’.  The next year he was secretary of the club and rowed at No. 3 in the crew that again entered the Grand and Ladies’ and went head of the river (“the ever-memorable May 12th, 1864,” he wrote his father).  The boat was later cut up and Dilke kept his section on the wall of his Sloane Street study for the rest of his life.  In 1865, Dilke’s crew got bumped the second night by Third Trinity with Lawes and four other university oars.  Dilke had a chance to row at No. 7 in the 1865 and 1866 university boats, but “declined on the score of constitution,” he later wrote.  “I was strong, but afraid of the rowing in training over the long course, although perfectly able to stand up to the short course work of Cambridge or of Henley. . . .  I believe that I was unduly frightened by my doctor, and that I might have rowed.”{{ref|Dilke1}}   None of this came at the expense of academic success, as Dilke was Senior Legalist in his third year, the highest honor open to him, and twice served as both vice-president and president of the Union Society.  His “methodical bee-like industry,”{{ref|Gwynn1}} and ability to read in quantity and remember most of it served him well both at Cambridge and after.

On leaving Cambridge, Dilke toured the world.  His &lt;u&gt;Greater Britain:  A Record of Travel in English-Speaking Countries During 1866 and 1867&lt;/u&gt;, published in 1869 to popular and critical acclaim, included a moment with the 1866 Harvard crew.  Dilke measured them, like others whose paths he crossed en tour, with Darwin’s new yardstick of natural selection: 

''They were in strict training for their University race with Yale, which was to come off in a week; and as Cambridge had been beaten twice running, and this year had a better crew, they were wishful for criticisms on their style.  Such an opinion as a stranger could offer was soon given; they were dashing, fast, long in their stroke; strong, considering their light weights, but terribly overworked.  They have taken for a rule the old English notions as to training which have long since disappeared at home, and, looked upon as fanatics by their friends and tutors, they have all the fanatic’s excess of zeal.''

''Rowing and other athletics, with the exceptions of skating and base-ball, are both neglected and despised in America.  When the smallest sign of a reaction appears in the New England colleges, there comes at once a cry from Boston that brains are being postponed to brawn.  If New Englanders would look about them, they would see that their climate has of itself developed brains at the expense of brawn, and that, if national degeneracy is to be long prevented, brawn must in some way be fostered.  The high shoulder, head-voice, and pallor of the Boston men are not incompatible with the possession of the most powerful brain, the keenest wit; but it is not probable that energy and talent will be continued in the future generations sprung from the worn-out men and women of to-day.{{ref|Dilke2}}''

&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured Dilke in 1871 just before the less spectacular of the two great crashes in his political life.  Elected three years earlier (at age twenty-five) as a Liberal M.P. for Chelsea, he came to see Gladstone’s government as unduly conservative, and in 1870 organized the Radical Club of like-minded members to press for more aggressive reforms in such areas as voting rights and education.  At the same time, republican sentiment was on the rise, due in part to the declaration of the French Republic and, at home, an economic slump and working class disillusionment with the Reform Act of 1867.  In the summer of 1871, an anonymous pamphlet entitled ''What Does She Do With It?'' appeared questioning the Queen’s disposition of her budget, the Civil List.  Dilke responded, likely influenced both positively by his grandfather (who had been a mentor and lifelong republican) and negatively by his father (who received a baronetcy for service as a royal commissioner for the 1862 exhibition).  In a speech at Newcastle, Dilke called for a parliamentary audit of the Civil List, relying on the pamphlet and an 1855 report by the Financial Reform Association, and concluding:  “If you can show me a fair chance that a Republic here will be free from the political corruption that hangs about the Monarchy, I say, for my part -- and I believe the middle classes in general, will say -- let it come.”  From an M.P. who shared the podium with working-class leaders at a time of industrial unrest, his remarks were considered beyond the pale.  But rather than retreat in the face of such critiques as &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s, Dilke continued to speak on royal finance (with appropriate factual corrections) for the next several months.  Tissot’s caricature for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; captured the penetrating eyes and aggressive posture of a man on a mission.  In March 1872, Dilke formally moved Parliament for an inquiry into the Civil List.  Gladstone, a fellow Liberal, cheered on from the Conservative bench, “went ‘smashing’ into him as if he were Chelsea china.”{{ref|Punch}}  In the end Dilke lost 276 to 2, thereby not only killing parliamentary republicanism but also strengthening the constitutional monarchy, Gladstone’s goal all along.

It took Dilke the better part of a decade to recover.  By 1880, his relative moderation on domestic issues and unsurpassed competence in foreign, military, and colonial affairs earned him the Under-Secretaryship at the Foreign Office in the second Gladstone administration.  He excelled.  Disraeli not only described Dilke as “''the'' rising man on the other side,”{{ref|Barrington}} but used him as the fictional hero of &lt;u&gt;Endymion&lt;/u&gt; (1881):  a novel about an under-secretary of state for foreign affairs who becomes premier.  In 1882 Dilke entered the Cabinet as head of the Local Government Board, from which post he appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s 1883 Winter Number, “The Gladstone Cabinet” by Chartran.  By 1885, he and Joseph Chamberlain were the recognized co-leaders of the radical wing of the Liberal party, bent on the further democratization of central and local government.  In June Dilke drew this barb from &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; after he and the rest of the Gladstone cabinet resigned, having lost a Parliamentary vote of confidence:

 |}

Weeks later, before Dilke could regroup from this modest political setback, disaster struck:  one Donald Crawford filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery, naming Dilke as the co-respondent.  Mrs. Crawford was Dilke’s sister-in-law, quite young, and among the allegations was that Dilke taught her “every French vice” and orchestrated a ménage-à-trois with one of her servants.  To make matters worse, Dilke had in fact twice had an affair with her mother:  for a time before he married, and again after he was widowed.  The revelation of the details, through the course of two proceedings, made for “the most sensational trial that has taken place [in the New Law Courts],” &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; declared afterward, “a trial that will be mentioned years hence in the same breath with the Tichborne case, the Mordaunt case, the Belt case, and other causes célèbres associated with Westminster Hall.”{{ref|VF}}  (&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s coverage is excerpted below.)

This time Dilke never fully recovered.  He lost his Chelsea seat at the July 1886 general election, though defeat had less to do with the then-pending Crawford case than with more purely political matters.  For several years following the scandal he avoided office but turned to his pen, especially in foreign and military affairs.  That he might be content as a bystander to history was “a misfortune,” wrote &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (January 7, 1888).  “There was no clearer head than his in the whole House of Commons, and his grasp of details was phenomenal.  ‘Literary and historical work,’ which he has mapped out for himself for some years to come, are useful pursuits in their way, but Nature did not intend the author of ‘Greater Britain’ for a bookworm.  He is essentially a man of action, and in his present sphere his powers are to a great extent frittered away.”

Dilke’s self-enforced absence from public life did free up time to row.  In 1883 he bought property at Dockett Eddy, an island in the Thames near Shepperton.  At his bungalow there, completed just before the lawsuit, Dilke enjoyed a structured regimen of rowing, riding, and fencing, all of which he had continued in true Leslie Stephen fashion since Cambridge days.  Among his guests were oarsmen from Trinity Hall (such as Reginald McKenna) and a handful of other Oxbridge colleges (such as S.D. Muttlebury from Trinity, Cambridge).  One guest, Charles Boyd, recalled one of these “happiest and healthiest of week-ends or more extended summer holidays,” where “the black and white blazer of his old college carried a certain prescriptive right to share in every belonging of the most famous of old Hall men”:

[[Image:Dilke_and_East_in_pair_c1904.jpg|thumb|right|300px|C.W. Dilke and Bill East, c.1904]]''Less a country-house, indeed, than a camp of exercise.  You did as you pleased, but under Sir Charles’s guidance you were pleased to be strenuous.  He called everybody to bathe at 7 a.m., and where was ever better -- fresh-water -- bathing-place than the floating raft below the boat-house at Dockett?  Etiquette required you to dive in and go straight across to the other bank, touch, and return; when, like as not, Sir Charles, in shorts and sweater, might be seen very precisely preparing tea on the landing-stage for the deserving valiant.  His little kindnesses had an added and affecting quality from his reserve and sternness.  A rare figure of an athlete he was, and a rare athlete’s day his was in that retreat.  For hours before he called and turned out the morning guard he had been up busy gardening, or reading, or writing.  At a quarter to nine he breakfasted.  Very shortly after breakfast an ex-champion sculler, the admirable Bill East, would arrive from Richmond, and he and Sir Charles would row in a racing skiff a measured mile or more of the river.  One summer at least he changed from the rowing kit to boots and breaches after his rowing, and rode till luncheon.  At four o’clock there would be a second bout with East, and thereafter, having changed from his rowing kit into flannels and his Hall cap, he would take Lady Dilke in her dinghy, which nobody else has ever used or will use.{{ref|Gwynn2}}'' 

Dilke returned to Parliament in 1892 as Liberal M.P. for the Forest of Dean, where he pursued an independent blend of social radicalism in domestic policy and power politics in foreign affairs until his death in 1911.  A recent comprehensive biography credits him with a great deal during this final stage, which historians formerly overlooked due to the denigration he suffered by his contemporaries at the time of and well after the Crawford divorce.  Indeed, even the centenary history of the Trinity Hall Boat Club, published in 1930, virtually omits Dilke while showering notice on every other alumnus who made rank in the judiciary, clergy, or politics.  For his own unpublished memoir, Dilke chose an epigram from Ibsen that Leslie Stephen could have penned:  “We are all of us run over, sometime or other in life.  The thing is to jump up again, and let no one see you are hurt.”{{ref|Ibsen}}

=== Crawford v. Crawford ===
On the success of &lt;u&gt;Greville’s Memoirs&lt;/u&gt;, Dilke remarked that it made one think that “the art of biography consists solely in the reviving of forgotten scandals.”{{ref|Nichols1}}  About himself the record has been mixed:  his literary executrix who was also his niece did her level best to skip the Crawford case entirely in her 1917 biography, Roy Jenkins did the opposite in 1958, and David Nicholls took a middle path in 1995.  The first mention of the case in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (August 1, 1885) reported on Dilke’s withdrawal from public life, his immediate reaction to the refusals of Crawford to agree to a private investigation and of Mrs. Crawford to a retraction:

''The very sudden and very unexpected withdrawal of Sir Charles Dilke from all his engagements, from his place in the House of Commons, and from all political activity whatever, is a very serious blow to the Radical section of the Liberal Party.  It involves the loss of action in Parliament for which Sir Charles had been counted upon, and will probably involve also the abandonment of that campaign in Ireland from which so much had been expected.  It is in every sense a remarkable phenomenon and a portentous one, for Sir Charles Dilke has justly been regarded as the most possible and practicable of all the Radicals.  He has governed himself with great judgment and caution, his deliverances have been entirely free from that offensive character which has made so many of his late colleagues to be personally hated, and he has shown much statesmanlike ability in the elaboration and the conduct through Parliament of some of the most important practical measures that have been passed in our time.''

''It is inevitable that the sudden self-effacement of so important a politician should give rise to gossip and to rumours, and accordingly the town is full of stories affecting to be precise and circumstantial, accounting for it on special personal grounds.  It would be however extremely unfair to accept, much less to adopt, any such stories.  When a public man retires from public life, either temporarily or permanently, the only reasons for the course he takes which can fairly be entertained or canvassed are those which he publicly assigns for it himself; and in this case the reason assigned is the very probable, natural, and sufficient one of ill-health arising from overwork.  It is a reason which must therefore be freely accepted, and which it is equally unfair and ungenerous to question or to override by the adventurous whispering of irresponsible gossip.''

Within two weeks, the Crawford case and the allegations concerning Dilke had become public, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (August 15, 1885) offered its legal and political prediction:

''The “Dilke Scandal” seems already to have become a permanent department of news with some of the papers, and the Tories appear to expect that it will be the end of Sir Charles Dilke’s career, and to expect this with all the greater confidence since the publication of Sir Charles’s own letter on the subject.''

''I do not share these anticipations.  My expectation, on the contrary, is that the affair will either be settled out of Court altogether, or else that, if it comes into Court, it will be so conducted as to cause the least possible scandal.  My reasons are these:-- This is in every sense a family quarrel.  The principal parties to it are all connected by ties of relationship, and all the parties belong to the Liberal ranks.  Sir Henry James, the counsel for Sir Charles, is a Liberal who has achieved a high position; Mr. Inderwick, the counsel for Mr. Crawford, is a Liberal who has three times fought constituencies in the Liberal interest, and who is ambitious to achieve a high position; Mr. Crawford is a Liberal who was to have contested East Lanarkshire in the Liberal interest; and Mr. Eustace Smith is the Liberal Member for Tynemouth.  Now Sir Charles Dilke is held by all Liberals to be of absolute necessity to their Party.  It is certain, therefore, that superhuman efforts will be made to avoid anything that would fatally discredit him and cause the Liberal Party to lose the service of his undoubted talents.  It is equally certain that the greatest pressure will be brought to bear upon everybody here concerned to do anything that can possibly be done to arrange the affair either without scandal at all or with as little scandal as possible; and, finally it is no less certain that everybody concerned will only be too anxious to do anything humanly possible to bring about this result.  From the chiefs of the Party downwards all will use their best exertions and even Mr. Crawford himself may be expected to be ready to adopt any action in this direction which will at once save his honour and avoid for his Party what would be regarded as a fatal disaster.''

Later in the same issue &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; reviewed the main allegations, declining to take a position on them (due perhaps less to Bowles’ innate editorial restraint than fear of another libel case), but taking a stand on the eternal question of the link between private conduct and public office:

''We dismiss therefore wholly any consideration of the truth or untruth of these charges; but what is worthy of attention is the general question of how far charges against the private conduct of a public man should be allowed to weigh in dealing with his public career.  It is far too often assumed that the two should be kept entirely separate; that the public man is one entity, and the private man another; and that the one ought to be considered and dealt with wholly apart from the other.  Nothing can be more false or more absurd.  A man is not two beings; he is one; and if it be proved that he is false, dishonest, cowardly, disloyal, and base in his private capacity, it would be nonsensical to suppose that he could be true, honest, brave, loyal, and noble in his public capacity.  All that part therefore of a man’s private doings which comes to public knowledge, fairly may be, and most properly should be, taken into account, so far as it discloses the real character of the man himself, and consequently his fitness or unfitness for the public service.  He who is clearly shown to have betrayed private trust may reasonably be held likely to betray also a public trust; he who is clearly shown to be corrupt in private matters will probably also be corrupt in public matters; and if it be that such proof of private misdeeds comes before the public as warrants an evil opinion of the character of a public man, it is not wrong and unnecessary, but eminently right and necessary, that the knowledge thus acquired should be brought to bear upon the claim of the man to public confidence.  But if, on the other hand, the facts established only go to show that the man in question is moved by ordinary venial human weaknesses, or has been guilty of ordinary venial indiscretions, then it would be eminently unfair to visit upon him a public penalty for private faults of such a character.  The whole question turns upon the character of the acts established.  If they be such as affect his character for honesty, honour, and trustworthiness, they are necessary elements in estimating his fitness for public affairs; if they merely affect his discretion or his strength of mind, they are rather to be generously disregarded.  A bank manager would be wrong in refusing to take into account proofs that one of his cashiers had cheated a friend; he would be right in refusing to take into account proofs that he had eaten himself into an attack of jaundice.''

''Thus it may well be that a case of the kind alleged against Sir Charles Dilke may prove to be of such a character as may, upon a right judgment, be regarded as irrelevant to his public position, and unnecessary to be taken into account; or, on the other hand, it may prove highly relevant to it, and very necessary to be taken into account.  It all depends upon the complexion of the case, and the degree to which it is established, if at all.  It is right to bear these considerations in mind, and especially to bear them in mind now, because the matter is now sub judice, and because in all probability it cannot possibly be brought to a decision until after the General Election takes place.  Sir Charles is therefore entitled to the benefit of the doubt that hangs over every undecided case, and of his own denial of the charge.''

Mr. Justice Butt heard the case on February 12, 1886.  It consisted solely of Crawford’s account of his wife’s confession and the testimony of two witnesses that she had spent certain nights away from home.  Mrs. Crawford was not present; Dilke was, but on his lawyers’ advice did not testify.  Under the rules of evidence Mrs. Crawford’s confession helped prove Crawford’s case for a divorce, but could not be used against Dilke himself.  In addition, Dilke’s lawyers feared that his reputation would suffer more from questions into his private life were he to take the stand (even if overruled as objectionable and thus not requiring an answer), than it would if none were asked.  Sir Charles Russell, Dilke’s chief counsel who had also been C.B. Lawes’ in the Belt case, said so to the court, gratuitously noting that “in the life of any man there may be found to have been some indiscretions.”  In the end, Justice Butt found the record sufficient to prove Mrs. Crawford’s adultery (Crawford got his divorce) but not to prove Dilke’s (so he was dismissed from the case and awarded his legal costs).  To the newspapers, including &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (February 20, 1886), this outcome was ridiculous, and proved Mrs. Crawford a fallen but honest and courageous woman, Justice Butt a Liberal patsy who ought to be impeached, and Sir Charles Dilke either dishonest, not a gentleman, or both:

''THE SOCIETY VIEW OF THE DILKE CASE.''

''This is what Society says:--''

''Society is far from being censorious or over-severe in cases of what Mr. Attorney-General Charles Russell very prettily calls “indiscretions.”  It is, on the contrary, most long-suffering and indulgent with regard to them, as many a man and woman now in Society, who otherwise would not be there, can testify.  Neither is Society at all disinclined to allow a man -- so long as he “behaves like a gentleman” -- to escape on a flaw in the indictment.  There was, not so long ago, a general rejoicing in Society over a case in which it was held that a certain person had “rushed old Hannen,” and avoided, together with the lady, punishment for an offence which all Society nevertheless thought most likely to have been committed.''

''But Society draws the line nevertheless somewhere, even in cases of this description.  Nobody in Society can be found to defend the conduct of a man who debauches a child of eighteen to whom he has access by virtue of his kinship and of his intimate relations with her parents.  Society condemns that as being beyond the limits of the fair “indiscretion” at which it may fairly wink.  And it condemns such conduct still more uncompromisingly if the man has added to the offence by debasing the child’s mind and by initiating her into the obscene practices of French refinement.  All this however, and no less, is what is charged against Sir Charles Dilke by Mrs. Crawford’s confession.  The Judge believed that confession and Society believes it too, and (whether rightly or wrongly) treats the matter as though there were no doubt remaining whatever about any part of the confession.''

''How the confession arose Society holds that it knows exactly.  And the belief in Society is this:  That Mrs. Crawford, having given up her “indiscretion” with Sir Charles Dilke -- having, in fact, been abandoned by him -- for eleven months, was living, and intending to live, as many another has done, happy ever afterwards with her husband in domestic felicity and forgetfulness.  But when that last fatal anonymous letter arrived, she saw it and reflected.  She saw that she was pursued by a pitiless, unrelenting enemy, whom she believed to be no other than her mother.  She felt that if, after so long as a whole year of good conduct and desire to atone for the past, she was not left alone by her enemy, she never would be left alone.  She might indeed destroy this letter before her husband saw it -- but others would reach him (as others had) at his Club or his office.  It was clear that there was no peace or truce for her.  What should she do?  She would do this.  She would make a clean breast of it, and would thus at once bring to an end the strain she could no longer bear, and at the same time be avenged both on the man who had debauched and deserted her, and also upon her mother who was so evidently determined to hunt her to despair and ruin.  And so it was that she told her story -- and told it, not merely in bare outline, but with all the horrible details which take it outside any common story of debauchery and desertion.''

''And now, with regard to Sir Charles Dilke, what Society blames is, not his “indiscretion,” nor even so much the fact that this indiscretion was so great and exceptional as to take it beyond the time of all possible toleration; but rather that, when he was brought to book, his conduct was not what Society holds it should have been, but quite otherwise.  “Voyou tant que tu voudras -- mauvais genre jamais”{{ref|slum}} is the principle that Society lays down, and it holds that, under the most trying circumstances, a man must behave “like a gentleman.”  And Society holds that Sir Charles Dilke has behaved like one who has taken and acted upon the advice of a sharp attorney with an eye to virtuous dissenters; there is nothing about his conduct either of the magnificent impudence or of the generous assumption of blame which in these matters Society expects a gentleman to show.''

''Suppose the charge to be false -- the mere false invention of an hysterical woman.  In that case Sir Charles’s duty, as a gentleman, was to go into the box and deny it all, to prove that the lady was hysterical and deluded, and thus to save her as well as himself -- but her above all.  As a gentleman it was his duty to do this -- his duty for his own sake; his duty for her sake; his duty for the sake of her mother, whose name had been so terribly handled in the affair.''

''Or, again, suppose the charge to be true.  Suppose it to be so thoroughly and completely true that Sir Charles could not dare to go into the witness-box to deny it and to expose himself to having brought against him the proofs which in that case would have been easily accessible.  Here would be a situation in which his testimony could not avail either to save the lady or to save himself, and in which therefore he could not go into the witness-box at all.  But in that case the only course for a gentleman to take was to stand wholly aside; neither to enter an appearance nor to make a defence, but to let the case go by default, and to suffer in silence any penalty that the Court might impose upon him.''

''But Sir Charles did none of all this. What he did was to deny, and yet not to make his denial in the only effective, the only useful way.  And what is worst of all is that his friends, whom Society believes to be prompted by himself, go, and have gone, industriously about to declare that he is an injured innocent; that he is as pure as the driven snow; that the whole charge has originated in no indiscretion of his, but only in the utterly unfounded imaginings of an hysterical woman; that Sir Charles is a maligned man, and Mrs. Crawford a malignant, mad woman -- that all the faults are hers, and none of them his.  Society would be quite ready to believe this if Sir Charles had brought any evidence of it, or if he had successfully sworn it; but to ask Society to believe it in the absence of all evidence whatever, and to persevere in asking it, is to act in a way in which Society holds that no gentleman should act.''

''Moreover, Society does not view with favor any man who, under any circumstances, puts the fault in a case of this kind wholly upon the woman, and refuses to bear any part of it himself.  It holds that men and women are alike liable to “indiscretion”; but that if ever such indiscretions are discovered, or alleged, the stronger should shield the weaker vessel, and the man should take upon himself a fair share, and even the major share of the blame.  In connection wherewith it remembers the case of Valentine Baker, who, as it holds, did behave like a gentleman.''

''Under all these circumstances, Society distinctly holds that Sir Charles Dilke has not come up to the necessary standard, and it reprobates him severely.''

The case could have ended there but for Dilke’s decision to instigate a second proceeding in a desperate attempt to reclaim his reputation.  The legal vehicle was to have the Queen’s Proctor, who represented the Crown in divorce and probate matters, intervene to attempt to show that Mrs. Crawford had not committed adultery with Dilke.  The ensuing trial ran from July 16 to July 23 before Mr. Justice Hannen, Dilke testifying “with a complexion not unlke Mrs. Crawford’s dress -- light olive-green” (&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 24, 1886)):

''THE CRAWFORD CASE IN COURT.  BY ONE WHO WAS THERE.''

''The original suit of “Crawford versus Crawford and Dilke,” heard last February before Mr. Justice Butt, had a good deal to recommend it to the evening newspapers; but, compared with the present week’s sensation of “Crawford versus Crawford, the Queen’s Proctor showing cause,” it was tame, inconclusive, shadowy, and unsatisfactory.  Dramatically, the first trial was deficient.  The principal characters -- good, bad, and indifferent -- were not seen; they did not strut the stage or mount the witness-box.  They were merely talked about.  That, of course, was a grave fault, but it has been set right in the later proceedings, which have kept all London, and indeed all England, on the alert for a full week.  Mrs. Crawford has now told her story in open Court.  Sir Charles Dilke has been examined and cross-examined.  The redoubtable “Sarah” has shown herself to be possessed of a treacherous memory.  We have seen the much-talked-of Mrs. Rogerson in the flesh, and heard about her very, very hospitable house.  “Fanny,” it is true, has made another of her mysterious disappearances; but her photograph has been handed round from juryman to juryman, the Junior Bar meanwhile craning their necks to get a glimpse of the scrap of cardboard upon which the lineaments of the interesting absentee were imprinted.  That “Fanny’s” presence in Court would have given the finishing touch to a very thorough-going sensation is unquestionable; but it is perhaps captious to complain when the whole wretched story has been so fully and nauseously narrated.''

It took the jury of propertied London men fifteen minutes to reject the Proctor’s (and Dilke’s) case and affirm the first decision.  Again, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 24, 1886):

''The daily newspapers have, during the whole of this week, held a daily orgy of filth and foulness in their reports of the Crawford case, and, as usual, these prints, who are always so extremely virtuous and proper in their leading articles, have been as disgusting as the case would allow them to be throughout the rest of their columns.  And now the case has been ended by the inevitable verdict which stamps Mrs. Crawford as the witness of truth and so gravely discredits Sir Charles Dilke, these same daily papers will be lifting up their pious eyes and hands at the wickedness out of which they have been coining money every morning and evening by sending it into every household in the land.''

''It is however too much to suppose that the case is ended with the verdict which merely affirms that Mr. Crawford was rightfully entitled to and shall have his divorce, under circumstances which dismissed Sir Charles Dilke from the case.  There are already rumours abroad of prosecutions for perjury, which however I expect will come to nothing.  But there will certainly be very strong comments made upon the matter, and it will be a long time, which will probably be marked by startling events, before the excitement is abated.''

“Historians who have studied the divorce case in any depth have concluded that Dilke was in all probability innocent of any adulterous relationship with Mrs. Crawford,” David Nicholls concluded in his 1995 biography.  Evidence assembled after the second case “leaves no doubt that the divorce court had been misled and had based its verdict upon false information.  That Mrs. Crawford wove a net of fabrications in which Dilke became inextricably enmeshed is beyond dispute. . . . [Historians] have  therefore been left wondering why she chose him as her victim.  Their accounts at this point inevitably enter the realm of speculation.”{{ref|Nichols2}}

=== “The Master of the Heythrop” (Spy), March 15, 1906 ===

[[Image:Brassey_A_Vanity_Fair_1906-03-15.jpg|thumb|right]]''Mr. Albert Brassey is Master of the celebrated Heythrop Pack, the servants of which Hunt still sport the Beaufort green plush in compliment to the days when Badminton and Heythrop were closely associated.  It is a long reign which connects Mr. Brassey with the Heythrop Hounds -- commencing, indeed, in 1873 -- and public opinion has bestowed upon him the title of “Albert the Good” in recognition of a well-spent life and a strenuous nature, which enables him at the end of three score years both to work and play hard.  A man of order, all things with him are orderly, and it may easily be supposed that his nature revolts against the haphazard modes of modern life.''

''He was educated at Eton and University College, Oxford, and rowed in the Eton eight in 1862.  Later he joined the 14th Hussars, and while quartered at Cahir in 1870 hunted the Regimental Harriers.  About this time he fell a victim to the most pleasing of all maladies that affect the heart, and married the eldest daughter of Lord Clanmorris.''

''Mr. Brassey is a member of the Four-in-Hand and Coaching Clubs, and his bays form a spanking team.  He took a fair dose of Parliament, and held his seat in the Conservative interest for ten years.  He never caught the Speaker’s eye, but was beloved by the Whips for his regular attendance.  He has the right while in town to breakfast at the Oxford and Cambridge, lunch at the Army and Navy, have tea at the Naval and Military, dine at the Carlton, and sup at the Cavalry; and, if none of these suit his palate, he can retire to his own well-regulated establishment in Berkeley Square.  That he is a sportsman none has ever gainsaid, and upon his own land and midst the lovely surroundings of his stately home at Heythrop he is recognised as a just and generous landlord, and a bountiful donor to philanthropic schemes.''

''He sees as much of a fox-hunt as most of them, and his good common sense and prudence usually find him well placed at the finish.  The kindly manner in which the youthful Oxonian has ever been welcomed with the Heythrop still lives in the memory of a host of full-grown sportsmen who had their first experience of the gentle art of falling with his hounds.  Rebuke when deserved is courteously administered, and is reasonably effective, despite the absence of that loud-tongued abuse in which some Masters so greatly delight.''

[[w:Albert_Brassey|Albert Brassey]] (1844-1918) rowed bow to C.B. Lawes’ stroke at Eton in the 1861 School Pulling and in the 1862 Eight.  At Oxford, Brassey won the Grand and Ladies’ in 1863, the Visitors’ in 1864, and the Grand, Stewards’, and Visitors’ in 1866.

His portrait is representative of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s fox hunters, most of whom appeared after Bowles sold the magazine in 1889.

=== Blazers ===
Club uniform -- jerseys, jackets, ties, hats, scarves, etc. -- let an oarsman tell friend from foe at a glance, on and off the water.  To wear unsanctioned colors creates social and aquatic chaos, for which W.B. Woodgate pulled no punches in his Henley commentary:

[[Image:New_College_IV_in_blazers_1860.jpg|thumb|right|300px|New College, Oxford, 1860]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 13, 1893):

''One piece of bad form has, I am glad to see, almost wholly vanished during the last four years -- namely, the display of coloured flannel coats (called “blazers”), pertaining to no recognised aquatic Club, still less to any Club that competes at Henley.  Lawn-tennis jackets of an abnormal medley of colours, village cricket Club coats, etc., were for a season or two recently flaunted on the Reach by land-lubbers.  Now they are properly scouted, and those who do not belong to contending Clubs wear plain mufti flannel jackets.''

''N.B.-- The old term “blazer” was applied only to a few of the more gorgeous College boating coats -- e.g., Lady Margaret, Magdalene, Balliol, Exeter; more sober jackets like those of Jesus (Cambridge), Trinity Hall, Pembroke Oxon, Dublin, the U.B.C.’s, Black Prince, and University College, each and all time-honoured on the course, were not so styled.  When lawn tennis begat “Joseph coats” in every village nook, then the term “blazer” was snapped up and extended to these monstrosities.''

&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 18, 1895):

''Those vulgarisms of “dongola crews” in punts, four or more young women dressed en suite with as many non-rowing club squires in semi-acrobat, semi-matador costumes, which were in vogue a season or two back, have happily disappeared.  I saw but one minor exhibition of this sort in the week.''

&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 22, 1897):

''The lawn-tennis jackets of gaudy hues which bloomed so furiously about a decade ago on the course, and were laughed to shame off the water, did not appear this season; but there was one acme of bounderism in the shape of a  youth in a scarlet golf-jacket.  To make the picture complete another year, we ought to see some Hebrew road-rattler who patronises the Queen’s Buckhounds sporting his pink from the stern of a punt.  Then there would be arcades ambo.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rasch, Frederic Carne == 

=== “South-East Essex” (Spy), April 2, 1896 ===

[[Image:Rasch_FC_Vanity_Fair_1896-04-02.jpg|thumb|right]]''The late Frederic Carne Rasch, J.P., D.L., of Woodhill, became his father nine-and-forty years ago; and sent him to Eton and to Trinity, Cambridge, where he showed himself healthy in body and mind.  That qualified him to be a Lieutenant in the 6th Dragoon Guards (the Carabineers); with whom he served for ten years.  After that he naturally became Captain and Honorary Major of the 4th Battalion of the Essex Regiment; which he still is.  He is also a Justice of the Peace, a Deputy-Lieutenant, and County Alderman for Essex; besides which, having unsuccessfully contested the Elland Division of the North-West Riding eleven years ago, he has been the chosen representative in Parliament of South-East Essex for ten.  He is an Essex man and wholesome, bluff, genial fellow of strong opinions; who calls himself a Democratic Tory.''


	''He is a man of blood who has smelled powder.  He also helps to direct a couple of breweries, and it is believed that he does it well.  Though he is not a pushing man he is a valuable subject of his Queen and a very useful Member of Parliament; in whom is much common sense, much sense of honour, and a keen sense of the difference between right and wrong.  Yet is he a modest fellow with an undue sense of his own merit.  The Carabineers owe him their silver kettle drums, which he gave them when he left the Service.  He is a quick-spoken, ready man of military precision, who says very straitly what he means to say.''


	''He has athletic propensities; and he has run, ridden, and rowed more races than most men.''


	Frederic Carne Rasch (1847-1914) rowed for Third Trinity, Cambridge in the 1867 Diamonds.


	“He was an advocate of short speeches, and he opposed extreme temperence legislation on the ground that he objected to making drunken people sober by keeping sober people dry”  -- a reasonable view for a politician who directed a couple of breweries on the side.  Rasch was made a baronet in 1903, resigned from Parliament in 1908 for ill health, and died a month after the 1914-18 war broke out.


=== The 1869 Oxford vs. Harvard Boat Race ===


[[Image:Oxford_Harvard_photo_1869.jpg]]

In the first Anglo-American university match, Oxford beat Harvard by four lengths in coxed fours from Putney to Mortlake on August 27, 1869.  The Oxford crew included J.C. Tinné, an uncle of VANITY FAIR rower W.E. Crum.  Edmond Warre called them “the best four that ever sat in a boat.”   The race report by “Barkins” for &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (Sept. 4, 1869):


''A Boat-Race between Oxford and Harvard, though technically a match between two amateur boat-clubs, is in the eyes of the public a race between England and America.  That the Harvard men altogether repudiated the idea of being the champions of American amateur rowing, we know from their own courteous and modest refusal to row the London Rowing Club, who wrongly interpreted the challenge sent to Oxford as one to England in general.  Whether the Harvard crew is the best America can send or not we do not know, but judging from their prestige and their performances in the States, we can be sure they are no unworthy representatives of American amateurs.  Their success in America has been almost as marked and as continuous as that of Oxford has been in England for the last few years.  They have beaten their rivals of Yale University, and they have beaten a celebrated crew known as the Ward Brothers.  At any rate the crowd on the banks of the Thames on Friday afternoon chose to consider the race as one between two nations rather than one between two universities.''


	''That Oxford was worthily represented as far as the personnel of her crew goes, no one who saw the men can doubt.  Indeed, it is not every year that Oxford could provide four men of such experience and capacity as Darbishire, Tinné, Yarborough, and Willan -- a twice victorious stroke, a present and a past president, and one who has repeatedly been chosen (if it were not invidious to choose where all are good) as the best of the crew -- four such men are not to be found every day, even in Oxford.  But four good men do not necessarily make a successful crew; and disregarding (to use the language of their own University) the final and material causes of the success of the Oxford crew, the efficient cause is to be found in Messrs. Warre and Morrison, without whose able and consistent coaching the four would most assuredly have never been what it was; while the last, or formal cause, we may assume to be that very style or idea which our American rivals came to make trial of, and which exists in the minds of all duly qualified coaches, pre-eminently in those of Warre and Morrison.  It was in the possession and zealous assistance of such coaches that Oxford was peculiarly happy.  Never did a crew begin to train under fairer auspices than did the Oxford four, or rather five, for they kept an extra man in training last July.  We may fairly say that, had this crew been beaten, Oxford would have been in sore distress indeed.  Her case would have been far worse than that of Cambridge ever was, for she would not have known to whom she could turn.''


[[Image:Harvard-Oxford_boat_race_gallop_1869.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&quot;The International Boat Race Galop Dedicated to the Gallant Harvard Crew&quot;]]''However, all is now over, and Oxford has won once more; and whether it was by half a length or half a mile, she little cares.  The sharp drive of the blade through the water, the quick rebound of the hands off the chest, and the pendulum-like swing of the body have won the day again, and we shall still be able to instill the old principles into the ready ears of a rising generation without a qualm of doubt in our inmost souls of the efficacy and truth of those precepts on which we pin our aquatic faith.  An account of the actual race is now superfluous; suffice it so say, that Oxford beat Cambridge in America in very much the same way in which she beat Cambridge in England; that a lead to Hammersmith did not ruffle the equanimity of her stroke, that she plodded on behind as usual to Chiswick, and lead as usual in Corney Reach.  The race was decided in the old place, abreast of the reservoirs, the only difference being that the Americans kept their rivals harder at work than they have been in some of the ‘Varsity races. . . .''

	. . . . 

	''. . . No one can pretend that the Oxford men had any cause to be disappointed in their rivals; they proved themselves to be at least their equals in endurance, and made them row hard from start to finish.  The race has showed this, among other things, that men trained on milk and vegetables can work as hard and as long as those trained on beef, tea, and beer.  Hear and reflect on this, O ye captains, coaches, and trainers.''

==Installing Kdenlive for KDE4 from SVN==

Install KDE4.

You need a recent mlt compilation with qimage for qt4 producer.

Checkout mlt from svn:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-gpl --qimage-libdir=/usr/lib/ --qimage-includedir=/usr/include/qt4 --disable-mmx --avformat-swscale
 make clean
 make
 sudo make install

Checkout mlt++ from svn:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr
 make clean
 make
 sudo make install

Checkout kdenlive from svn:
 svn co https://kdenlive.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kdenlive/branches/KDE4

Then compile:
 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr CMakeLists.txt
 make
 sudo make install

This is it!

==Installing Kdenlive for KDE4 from SVN - the easy way==

The Kdenlive Builder Wizard can build the KDE4 (or KDE3) version of Kdenlive from current development sources. It is available from [http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=85826] and is suited both for one-shot builds, or automated nightly builds (the later requires obtaining the sources to the Wizard, available from the page).

== Possible problems ==
If your compilation ends with something like:
 MakeFiles/kdenlive.dir/projectlist.o: In function `ProjectList::slotAddClip(DocClipBase*, bool)':                                                                                  
 /home/jan/src/kdenlive/src/projectlist.cpp:293: undefined reference to `Nepomuk::Resource::Resource(QString const&amp;, QUrl const&amp;)'                                                   
 /home/jan/src/kdenlive/src/projectlist.cpp:293: undefined reference to `Nepomuk::Resource::~Resource()'                                                                             
 /home/jan/src/kdenlive/src/projectlist.cpp:174: undefined reference to `Nepomuk::Resource::~Resource()'                                                                             
 /home/jan/src/kdenlive/src/projectlist.cpp:174: undefined reference to `Nepomuk::Resource::~Resource()'                                                                             
 collect2: ld returned 1 exit status                                                                                                                                                 
 make[2]: *** [src/cmake_bindir/kdenlive] Error 1                                                                                                                                    
 make[1]: *** [src/cmake_bindir/CMakeFiles/kdenlive.dir/all] Error 2                                                                                                                 
 make: *** [all] Error 2                                                                                                                                                             

Then you have to install '''soprano''' and '''soprano devel''' package and '''rerun cmake''' or use wizard builder once more time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smith, Ernest John Heriz == 

=== “Pembroke” (Hay), January 28, 1888 ===

[[Image:Smith_EJH_Vanity_Fair_1888-01-28.jpg|thumb|right]]''Pembroke College, Cambridge, was born some five-and-forty years ago under the name of Smith.  In 1873 Smith took a Second Class in the Classical Tripos and a First Class in the Theological; and being a double honourman, was naturally elected a Fellow of Pembroke.  Subsequently he achieved the Dean, had the Proctor thrust upon him, and developed into Pembroke College of which he is the soul.  Sincere in his work, generous in his friendship, and the leading spirit among the undergraduates, both in the schools and on the river, he has combined, with a success hitherto unequalled, the characters of Dean, Proctor, and Mr. Smith, each one of which is more popular than the other two.''

''It is on the River that Mr. Smith has achieved his greatest glory.  There is no figure better known between Jesus Lock and Baitsbite than that of the Dean in his light and dark blue blazer, animating the toils of the fifth boat.  He teaches rowing also in his rooms, and has been known to encourage the oar men from the pulpit.  He believes in Mesmerism.  He is much admired by the fair Girtonites.  He is a scholar, a Christian, and a gentleman.''

Rev. Ernest John Heriz Smith (1851-1911) never rowed in the Boat Race or at Henley and thus appears here only on the strength of his &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; biography, the first in which rowing predominated.  Through men like Smith “[t]he Christian ethic became very deeply imbued in the sport of rowing at the club level throughout the country,” wrote historian Neil Wigglesworth, “being disseminated and consolidated by seemingly endless supplies of ordained oarsmen coming down from Oxford and Cambridge colleges, settling into their new parishes and preaching a combination of rowing technique and religious virtue.”{{ref|Wigglesworth}}   

The son of a Fellow of Caius, Smith became “a Pembroke man to the backbone, and the friend and counsellor of all Pembroke men,”{{ref|Pem1}} retiring in 1896 to hold the college benefice at Tarrant Hinton in Dorset.  At Pembroke he started a semi-religious society called the Companions of St. John, whose members wore a belt of sash under their clothes and thus were popularly known as “the belly-banders.”  For this and his vocal support of the Church of England, the inaugural issue of ''The Pem'' in 1893 offered these “Reminiscences”:

:Amidst his followers you see &lt;br&gt;
:	The valiant leader stand: &lt;br&gt;
:The Smith, a mighty man is he, &lt;br&gt;
:	With eager, restless hand, &lt;br&gt;
:Striving to find on every arm &lt;br&gt;
:	The social leather band! &lt;br&gt;


:Each Sunday night, for two long hours, &lt;br&gt;
:	You can hear the music flow; &lt;br&gt;
:You can hear him lead the frequent hymns &lt;br&gt;
:	With solemn voice and slow, &lt;br&gt;
:Like a sexton tolling the funeral knell, &lt;br&gt;
:	When his spirits are very low! &lt;br&gt;


:And men that on his staircase keep &lt;br&gt;
:	Shout through the open door; &lt;br&gt;
:They loathe to see the gathering throng, &lt;br&gt;
:	To hear the maddening roar: &lt;br&gt;
:And those below the ceiling thump, &lt;br&gt;
:	And those above, the floor! &lt;br&gt;


:He leans against the doorpost, and &lt;br&gt;
:	The singing he enjoys; &lt;br&gt;
:He hears the strains of hymn 18; &lt;br&gt;
:	He hears his own sweet voice &lt;br&gt;
:Ring loudly o’er the others, and  &lt;br&gt;
:	It makes his heart rejoice. &lt;br&gt;


:The members of his social throng &lt;br&gt;
:	Are with him hand and glove, &lt;br&gt;
:From willing feet, and willing hands, &lt;br&gt;
:	To willing throat above! &lt;br&gt;
:Bound with the band of fellowship, &lt;br&gt;
:	Bound with the ties of love! &lt;br&gt;


:Singing, -- reciting, -- chanting, &lt;br&gt;
:	Onward through life he goes: &lt;br&gt;
:One day he poses as a coach, &lt;br&gt;
:	Another day he rows. &lt;br&gt;
:With all his College work besides, &lt;br&gt;
:	He earns his night’s repose. {{ref|Pem2}}  &lt;br&gt;


=== Sporting Heads of Colleges ===
Victorian Oxbridge did not “recruit” athletes.  Still, certain “sporting heads” of colleges were not indifferent to matriculating talented oarsmen.  The Etonian flow to Oxford in the 1890s and to Cambridge in the following decade helped swing the Boat Race results those years.  W.B. Woodgate opined in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (April 9, 1903), that “[i]t does a College more good socially to produce a Blue with a pass than to shelve him to make room for some obscure substitute who in the Long scraps through with a Third Class, and meantime is a necessity in all College athletic arenas.”  His illustrations:

''Dr. Warren, [President of Magdalen College, Oxford,] was offered in 1901 the services of the then Captain of Boats at Eton -- John Edwards-Moss (junior).  He insisted on the youth passing Responsions before he would admit him.  To do this would have entailed cramming all Long Vac., abandoning all sport at the sire’s Scottish shooting-box; and possible failure after all.  So the boy elected, with paternal assent, to cast in his lot at Third Trinity, Cambridge, with other Eton aquatic pals who were simultaneously leaving.  Result, a high-class oar lost to Oxford and gained for Cambridge; and undeniably a very important factor in the Putney to Mortlake defeats that befell Oxford in the years immediately following.  But, I am glad to record, there still survive such commodities as sporting heads of Oxford colleges.  In July 1905, I chanced to be in the waiting-room of Worcester G.W.R. station.  A Right Rev. accosted me, and asked if I would mount guard over his chattels, while he went to get some food.  On his return I ventured to ask him what his diocese was; he replied, “None.  He was Bishop Michison, Master of Pembroke College.”  Then I bethought me that an old Radley friend of mine was at the moment contemplating sending a son of his to that college, not so much for the sake of degree, as to give him chance of earning his blue on the river; and that he was somewhat apprehensive as to the boy’s classical attainments sufficing to pass him for matriculation.  I volunteered to shove in my own oar at this juncture, and said:  “There is a son of an old friend of mine, good oar, good character, but unfortunately not likely ever to set the Thames on fire with his classics.  His father wants to send him to Pembroke. . . .”  The Bishop cut me short.  “Oh, I know whom you mean; young Illingworth.  I know all about him; you need not be afraid that I shall let him slip; I hear he can row; I shall matriculate him whether he can spell or not.”  (I wish we had had a few more Michisons at ''Alma Mater''.)''{{ref|Woodgate}}

Charles Hunter Illingworth of Pembroke College, Oxford got his blue at No. 2 in the 1906 Boat Race, though Cambridge with Duggie Stuart won.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 1872 - 1889:  Sliding Seats ==
The invention of sliding seats is generally credited to [[w:John C. Babcock|John C. Babcock]] of the Nassau Boat Club in New York, who used them on a single in 1857 and on a six-oar in 1870.{{ref|Dodd1}}  Neil Wigglesworth traces their emergence in the U.K. to Tynesiders, whose professional scullers used them as least as early as 1865.  The John O’Gaunt four from Lancaster used them in the Stewards’ in 1870, Bell’s Life commenting that the crew moved like “a piston and a pair of scissors.”{{ref|Wigglesworth1}}  In Babcock’s version, a ten-inch-square wooden seat covered in leather rested atop grooved brass tracks greased with lard to permit about twelve inches of slide, though only about six were used.  Even this modest amount converted into an extra foot of drive in the water that improved the efficiency of the stroke.  Edward Hanlan of Toronto, who held the world professional sculling title in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, introduced the eighteen-inch slide, which converted into about sixteen inches for sweep rowing and became the standard.{{ref|Havvy}}  In addition, new designs and materials were introduced to reduce friction and improve wear; clean shorts replaced oil-stained trousers.  In the evolution, some slide types proved defective, as W. Sweetman learned in the 1888 Diamonds.  “Shortly after the start, about half-way up the island,” Guy Nickalls recalled, “I heard a bang, and a shower of shrapnel fell around me; the balls from his bearings.  I offered to start again and he paddled back to the raft and got another slide fixed.”{{ref|Nickalls}} 

It took longer for sliding seats than for outriggers or carvel boats to gain acceptance.  To be sure, London R.C. made believers of the gentlemen amateurs by winning the 1872 Stewards’ and Grand with sliding seats, much as Royal Chester had done for carvel boats with its Henley victories in 1855-56.  Oxford and Cambridge promptly adopted them for the 1873 Boat Race, knocking half a minute off the record.  Yet the transition to long modern slides and the adjustment of style took time, especially at Eton and Oxford where Dr. Warre’s fixed-seat orthodoxy had deepest roots -- perhaps, in the words of a contemporary dark blue, because the Oxford mind was comparatively “of a more doubting and conservative, and less mathematical and radical type.”{{ref|Drinkwater1}}  The longer the slide, the greater the “piston and pair of scissors” effect and the greater the anxiety that it would destroy the rhythm and smoothness that the fixed-seat orthodox felt necessary for efficient boat propulsion.  Cambridge, under the thoroughly un-Warreian influence of Australian undergraduate Steve Fairbairn, adapted to longer slides in the mid-1880s, which helped them and their three-time President, S.D. Muttlebury, win four Boat Races in a row.  Oxford caught up a few years later when three of its blues -- D.H. McLean, Guy Nickalls, and W.F.C. Holland -- rowed behind Muttlebury in the 1888 Leander eight and brought their experience back to the Isis.{{ref|Drinkwater2}}   The styles debate went into remission during Oxford’s golden years in the 1890s, but flared up again after the turn of the century when the Belgians and other foreign crews started winning at Henley, and continued after the 1914-18 war on into the 1930s.{{ref|Wigglesworth2}} 

In the late Victorian years the technical arguments took on a social and religious cast, with fixed-seat gentlemen amateurs preaching a hard “catch” at the water using shoulders and body swing, against the professional style that stressed a fast entry in the water and strong leg extension.  “Professional” here meant oarsmen who raced for money, since by this time the tradesman class of watermen were almost non-existent, casualty to steamers, railways, and better roads and bridges.  London had some 3,000 watermen in the 1820s but only half that twenty years later; by 1901, R.H. Forster concluded in ''Down by the River'' that “the oar plays a humble part in the heart of London, a battered skiff or sturdy police boat is all that remains.”{{ref|Forster}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Are featured books any good?
Well, in theory, they are the &quot;best of the best&quot;, impeccably factual, and the gem and grace of Wikibooks.
In practice, ''none'' of these books are any good. Why? For the same reason that, in theory, they are the &quot;grace&quot; of Wikibooks-they are getting edited every day, with supposedly factual or helpful edits coming in to make them even better.
I can illustrate this very well. Once, I was browsing though [[Special:Recentchanges|Recentchanges]] when I came across an edit summary that had said its target page had just lost all its content. This vandalism was done to [[User:Mike.lifeguard|one of our own checkusers]], and I immediately reverted the edit.
So, we must make our featured books better. How? That's up to you to decide.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== An introduction to China ==
What differentiates Chinese history from the history of any culture of the world is its sheer magnitude. China is the oldest civilization that has continued an unbroken history into the contemporary world, and its pre-history, still being uncovered by archeologists, goes back at least as far as the famous Peking Man who lived nearly 400,000 years ago. The Chinese Neolithic Period is made unique to archaeologists by the sheer number of tools found littered within the cultural borders of its peoples. So one must always keep in mind that when discussing the history of China, you are discussing, without question, both the largest and longest living of civilizations that you can experience in the 21st century.

But the most remarkable aspect of Chinese history to any student (for the sheer massiveness of it all can prove an intimidating wilderness for any beginner) must be its unrivaled documentation. Chinese culture places an immense value on knowledge of their own history, and so current events have been documented meticulously throughout the country’s lifespan, beginning with the famous, “Records of the Grand Historian,” written in the Han Dynasty under the reign of Emperor Wudi by Sima Qian (who we will discuss later in the chapter on the Han Dynasty). In fact, when in the 1400’s, when in Italy Dante Alighieri and the Western World was concerned with the metaphysical questions enumerated in the “Divine Comedy,”  Luo Guangzhong was writing the first novel in China, “The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” which was itself based on historically accurate events that occurred in China between 190 and 280 AD! Literary works such as these, as well as dry, written annals, serve as guidebooks for the initiate, to lead you through the maze of foreign names and Dynastic cycles. But before we test ourselves against the veritable jungle of Chinese chronology, there are a few key principles to Chinese history that must be understood.

== The Basics ==

Being so well established, Chinese history has certain patterns and principles, outlined and discussed by historians who themselves lived in antiquity, at least from our perspective. The historian/philosopher Zhu Xi, who lived  in the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) outlined all of the legitimate dynasties up until his own, saying that only the Zhou, Qin, Han, Jin, Sui and Tang dynasties are “proper”, even though the common thought was that there were several more dynasties before that, and several vied for power in the dynastic shifts. He also elaborated that the rulers of Zhou (who were overthrown in civil war) were to be known as merely “kings” not “emperors”. This merely illustrates how central to politics and culture records and histories were to the Chinese people.

But above all of these petty definitional questions rises the one basic principle from which all of Chinese history is derived. It is enumerated in “The Romance of the Three Kingdoms” as both the opening and closing lines. As it reads there, it is:

'''''“The Empire long divided must unite, long united must divide. Thus has it ever been.”'''''

The Chinese view of history is a cyclical one, a constant process of dynastic unity, and inevitable civil disarray. The Zhou Dynasty, then the Warring States Period. The Han Dynasty, then the Three Kingdoms Period, and so on and so forth. It could be compared to Hegel's dialectic version of history, save that the Chinese interpretation of the inevitable cycle is a much different one. Chinese history must be viewed by the learner, as we enter this jungle, through the lenses with which the culture looks upon its own history: from the perspective of the cyclical pattern, the cultural pride, and the ubiquitous and imperative striving for a Unified China.

A common theme in any introduction to Chinese history is a discussion of the different English translations you will find of the same words, or names. The historian Sima Qian referred to above may be called by that name, or, under another system, he may be known as Ss'uma Ch'ien.

The two primary systems of English translation of Chinese texts are:
* The Wade-Giles system, developed in 1867 by Thomas Francis Wade. It was later expanded and improved upon Herbert Alan Giles. This system is used mainly in the early translations of many Chinese texts, which were popular in the mid to late 1800's and early 1900's. This system is often associated with the flowery language of those early translations, and is given a negative connotation for being out of date, and too dry and scholarly for common use outside of academic circles.
* The Pinyin system. This is the official transliteration system for Chinese to English, and as such, it will be employed in these articles almost exclusively. Any translations done in the Wade-Giles system exist only because no Pinyin counterpart could be found. But in the cases that a reader may have preexisting knowledge and be confused by these translations, or run across other translations in their own research (which we encourage you to do), the table at left should be sufficient to explain the significant differences in the systems.

It encompasses North American and South American study for both SL and HL Candidates.  Both SL and HL students are required to complete one Historical Investigation to be turned in to the IBO before they take their test.  HL Candidates delve further into History by looking at one Single-Party State, usually chosen by the instructor.

== The oy vowel ==
My Yiddish isn't amazing, but I can't think of any words that are pronounced oy by Litvish and aw by Poylish. The only one I'm not sure about is אױס, which is pronounced oys by Litvish, and I can't remember, but may be pronounced aws by Poylish. The other thing which comes close is אױף, which is pronounced awf even by Litvish. If these are the only two words (feel free to name others), then they are an exception to the rule, not the rule, and certainly don't deserve to be the first of the ways of pronouncing ױ. [[User:Clum|Clum]] ([[User talk:Clum|talk]]) 15:43, 9 January 2008 (UTC)
:There are two distinct vowels rendered as וי in Yiddish. A good example is טויב. This word means dove when pronounced ''tawp'' (P)/''toyb'' (L) and it means deaf when pronounced ''toyp'' (P)/''teyb'' (L).

:The preposition אויף is indeed an exception: it is pronounced ''of'' (P)/''af'' (L).

:There is also the verbal prefix אויפ- which is pronounced uf- by Litvaks as in ufruf, ufgeregt.

:You are correct about אױס, but there are many more words like it. Unfortunately, too many Yiddish speakers nowadays never learnt the language from native speakers. For example גענוי

:Anyway, I am not averse to changing the order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Preemption (computing)}}

Preemption as used with respect to operating systems means the ability of the operating system to preempt (that is, stop or pause) a currently scheduled task in favour of a higher priority task. The resource being scheduled may be the processor or I/O, among others.

Non-preemptability arises, for instance, when handling an interrupt. In this case, scheduling is avoided until the interrupt is handled. 

The schedulers used in most modern operating systems, such as various flavours of Unix, can preempt user processes. This is called preemptive multitasking, and is in contrast to cooperative multitasking wherein a process &quot;gives away&quot; its time by utilizing kernel resources or by specifically calling a kernel routine to allow other processes time to run. Some operating systems' schedulers (including Linux as of the 2.6 series) have the ability to preempt a process while it is processing a system call as well (a preemptible kernel).

The AmigaOS was the first preemptive multitasking system available for home users (1985). Other preemptive operating systems include the Windows NT family (also XP or Vista), Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X. Examples of cooperative operating systems include Windows for Workgroups (also known as Windows 3.1 or 95), NetWare, and Mac OS versions 9.x.

Linux kernels prior to Linux 2.6 were also nonpreemptive, but later releases implemented the preemptive model. Several commercial versions of UNIX are preemptive, including Solaris and IRIX.

==Analogy==
The person currently at the cashier may be interrupted and have to wait for another customer before finishing.

==Implementation==
In the Linux kernel, the scheduler is called after each timer interrupt (that is, quite a few times per second). It determines what process to run next based on a variety of factors, including priority, time already run, etc. The implementation of preemption in other kernels is likely to be similar.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
Making a scheduler preemptible has the advantage of better system responsiveness and scalability, but comes with the disadvantage of race conditions (where the executing process accesses the same resource before another preempted process finished using it).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anatomy is &quot;the science of the structure of living organisms&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; so human anatomy is the science of the structure of the human body. This wikibook will hopefully give you a good understanding of what your body is made of and of how it develops. Strictly speaking, how the body functions is [[Human Physiology| physiology]]. Despite this fact, it is almost impossible to explain anatomy without going into some physiology and vice versa so some physiological concepts will be introduced in this book.

There are two types of anatomy: gross, or macroscopic, and microscopic. Gross anatomy deals with things that can be viewed by the unaided eye. Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on the cellular level. There are, in turn, 3 fields of study within the topic of gross anatomy. These are surface anatomy, the study of external anatomical forms and markings; regional anatomy, which focuses on a certain region of the body (both internal and external); and systemic anatomy, which focuses on a given organ system. Within microscopic anatomy, there are two topics of study which are of great importance: cytology, the study of cells; and histology, the study of tissue.

==Standard Anatomical Position==

For positional terminology to make sense, a standard anatomical position has to be established. In human anatomy, the standard anatomical position is supine (lying down face up). The legs are straight and together, or slightly separated. The arms are straight out along the torso with the palms of the hands upward. The arms are separated slightly from the torso. The thumbs point away from the body.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_for_anatomical_location&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[Image:Horse Axes.JPG|thumb|right|Diagram of Anatomical Terms]]
In order to talk about anatomy, some terms need to be understood. The terms can be divided into positional terms and descriptive terms. Positional terms help in locating structures by giving precise descriptions of relations (which eliminates the need to specify in what position the subject is). An easy example is superior, which means above or on top of when the subject is upright: The human head is superior to the torso. It cannot be said that the head is above the torso if the person is lying down. Descriptive terms can give varied information.

===Descriptions of General Position===

'''Superior and Inferior '''

The terms superior and inferior are used when referring to parts of the body which are toward an end of the body. Superior meaning toward the head and inferior meaning toward the feet. Toward an end does not necessarily mean close to the end. For example, the bowels are inferior to the lungs. This does not mean that the bowels are close to the feet nor does it mean the converse (that the lungs are close to the head). It simply means that the lungs are closer to the head than the bowels. Cranial and caudal have the same meaning as superior and inferior, respectively, but are used in reference to animal, rather than human, anatomy. 

'''Anterior and Posterior'''

Anterior refers to the side of the body facing up in the standard anatomical position. Posterior refers to the bottom side. Like superior and inferior, these do not necessarily mean that the parts they are describing are close to the front or back of the body, they simply explain relative positions. Dorsal and ventral are sometimes used in place of anterior and posterior, respectively. These are mostly used with animal anatomy, but can be used in human anatomy as long as they are describing the side of an appendage.

'''Lateral and Medial'''

Lateral is a word used to describe anything which is closer to the outside (toward the arms, in the standard anatomical position) while medial is used to describe anything toward the center of the body.

'''Superficial and Deep'''

Superficial is a used to describe structures that are closer to the exterior surface of the body. Deep refers to structures closer to the center of the body region. For example, skin is superficial to bones, and bones are deep to skin.

'''Proximal and Distal'''

Proximal and distal are terms that describe one point relative to another.  Proximal refers to a point closer to the reference point while distal refers to a point farther away.  For example, the metacarpals are distal to the carpus.


'''Dorsal and Ventral'''

''Dorsal'' refers to a structure closer to the back of an organism while ''ventral'' refers to a point closer to the abdomen; these descriptors are generally used in animal anatomy in place of posterior and anterior, respectively.

===Other Directional Terms===

'''Ipsilateral and Contralateral'''

''Ipsilateral'' refers to two parts that are on the same side of a given reference point.  For example, it could be said that the left arm and left leg are ipsilateral to one another with respect to the midsagittal plane.  ''Contralateral'' is the inverse; the left arm and right leg are contralateral to one another with respect to the midsagittal plane.

'''Axial and Abaxial'''

''Axial'' refers to a point close to the midsagittal plane while ''abaxial'' refers to a point farther away from the midsagittal plane.

'''Intermediate'''

Between two points.  For example, the knee is intermediate between the gluteal and the foot.

'''Visceral'''

The term ''visceral'' refers to any system or point that contacts organs.  For example, the visceral peritoneum is in direct contact with the abdominal organs.

'''Parietal'''

Conversely, ''parietal'' refers to the outer membrane of a system.  For example, the parietal pericardium lines the pericardial cavity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Brooks, Frederick Vincent == 

=== “A Master Craftsman” (WH), September 18, 1912 ===
[[Image:Brooks_FV_Vanity_Fair_1912-09-18.jpg|thumb|right]]
''Born, some sixty years ago, to a sturdy Radical whose father was a Chartist, Mr. Brooks was in due course sent to the High School, Bishop’s Stortford, then under Dr. Godfrey Goodman, where he became head boy of the school, when Cecil Rhodes and Dr. E.A. Beck (present Principal of Trinity Hall, Cambridge) were there.  He is still, like Father O’Flynn, “learned in Divinity, also Latinity.”''

''A more serious part of his life has been spent in hardy exercises, which may account for his present outrageous health.  He rowed, and was for many years captain of the old West London Rowing Club, for which he helped to win the Thames Cup at Henley in 1876.  He also won sculling races until he grew well known on the river as “Daddy.”''

''He has swum with success, and has run without it; has taken much part in amateur theatricals; and his Sir Peter Teazle, played to Miss Compton’s Lady Teazle, is still remembered.''

''In 1868 Mr. Thomas Gibson Bowles invented this Journal -- the first of its kind -- and a month or two later its first cartoon appeared, that of Mr. Benjamin Disraeli.  Mr. Brooks has been connected with &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; ever since, and is still, as a lithographer, producing its counterfeit presentments of eminent men.''

''Is given to literary effort; has often contributed to the columns of VANITY FAIR and other journals; has been entrusted with the articles on lithography and sun-copying in the new edition of the “Encyclopaedia Britainnica,” and having considerable arbitration experience, he might with advantage have been included in the National Arbitration Committee on Trade Disputes.''

''He is not only a master-craftsman and a good speaker, but is a man altogether full of information, whose word is always believed, for he is as “straight” as he is modest.''

''A fair raconteur, a listener of quality, as Charles Lamb says of his father in his “Essays of Elia,” he is just such a companion as Mr. Isaac Walton would have chosen to go a-fishing with.''

Frederick Vincent Brooks (1848-1921) rowed for the West London R.C. in the Diamonds in 1874 and the Thames Challenge Cup in 1874-76.

Vincent Brooks, his father, was a pioneering lithographer on whose expertise Bowles built &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;.  In 1856, Brooks began reproducing old master paintings for the Arundel Society, an effort described as “the most important non-commercial application of chromolithography” in the country at the time.{{ref|Burch}}  Eleven years later his firm acquired Day &amp; Son, lithographers to the Queen, who had just brought chromolithography to the periodical press by publishing the Chromolithography Journal.  Yet as of the founding of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; in late 1868, the new technique had not been used with portrait caricature in England, since the well-established Punch used only wood engravings.  Thus in announcing &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s forthcoming “Pictorial Wares of an entirely novel character” in January 1869, Bowles could as well have been describing the work of Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son, the best and most expensive lithographers available, as the new portraits chargés of Carlo Pellegrini.  By “exploiting the process of chromolithography and wedding it to a new kind of visual humour,” concluded art critic Bernard Denvir, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; “helped to bring about a revolution in taste, preparing the way for the acceptance of less strictly representational art forms and breaching the fortifications of academic realism” with “a new kind of accessible imagery; coloured, vivacious, topical, cheap.”{{ref|Denvir}} 

Frederick Vincent Brooks was nineteen or twenty when &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; carried its first caricature, Pellegrini’s rendering of Benjamin Disraeli for the January 30, 1869 issue.  If Brooks was working for his father at the time, as &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s 1912 biography says, then he had a longer running connection with the magazine than did anyone else (including “Spy,” Leslie Ward, who first came to work in 1873 and left in 1911).  His connection might well have been shorter, had the owners and editors not clung to the weekly lithograph and eschewed other forms of illustration, well after photography had become widespread in the popular press.

=== Rowing Pictures ===
[[Image:College_boat_v1_c1830.jpg|thumb|right|400px|This aquatint of &quot;The Merton Eight, 1839&quot; was one of several similar images produced in the 1830s of Oxford college boats, some of which may have varied only in how the crews were colored{{ref|Weil}}]]Artists who recorded nineteenth-century rowing sometimes strayed from photographic fidelity, presumably because they either knew no better (not being oarsmen themselves) or enjoyed artistic license (say, to show crews close together just to fit them in the frame or to make the race seem more exciting than it was).  Woodgate complained some had originally been drawn as they lay unmanned, and therefore were shown two planks too high out of the water when oarsmen were painted in after the fact.{{ref|Woodgate}}  Unlike the ''Illustrated London News'', the ''Graphic'', or other Victorian journals, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; never published any etchings or other renderings of rowing, though it did carry a photograph in 1908 of Leander beating the Belgians in the London Olympics.  Nevertheless, under Woodgate’s pen, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; gave no quarter to the inaccuracies in other journals’ pictures:

&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;(July 16, 1896)

''The river cripple, who abounds at Henley, may generally be known by his attire:  a starched shirt, a high collar, tie in a bow -- worn while rowing -- flannels, and a belt.  The latter seems de rigeur with these creatures, and is their trade-mark.  Needless to mention, no Rowing Club man uses a belt, and, moreover, when seated at oars or sculls, loosens his waistband or buttons to allow free swing to his body.  A picture in ''The Daily Graphic'' depicting the “Grand” final is very true to life as regards Henley bounders, starched and belted.  It is apparently taken from a photo of some scene on the course, and the racing crews afterwards inserted by hand.  The eights are impossible, and never were in a photo; but the men in small boats and ashore are perfect samples of Henley louts.  There is just one Rowing Club man in the distance, in workmanlike costume; all the rest look as if just off the shop-board.''

&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 11, 1906)

''Talking of Henley, I trust I am not supercritical if I reason gently with Mr. Matania, whose picture appeared last week in the Sphere.  He represents two “fours” with coxswains.  Four-oar boats at Henley are steered by the foot of one of the crew, and not by coxswains.  There was an exception this year in a sporting military match, Sappers v. Gunners; but this was in Thursday, and Mr. Matania depicts Tuesday.''

''Again, the launch following the crews is represented as a crowded pleasure steamer with a cabin.  The long, low racing launch, on which the umpire and one or two friends stand, is not thus fitted.   A punt with large fixed wooden rowlocks is an unusual innovation.  That there were no pleasure craft whatever on the towpath side when the race took place is strange; and where are the posts and booms?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Eaton, Herbert Francis == 

=== “Brown” (Spy), October 31, 1891 ===

[[Image:Eaton_HF_Vanity_Fair_1891-10-03.jpg|thumb|right]]''Henry William Eaton, who made money in the silk trade, helped to manage Insurance Companies and to legislate at the bidding of Coventry, and dabbled in Geography and Horticulture, became the first Lord Cheylesmore in the fiftieth year of his Queen’s reign.  He also had three sons, of whom the third, born nearly four-and-forty years ago, and named Herbert Francis, went to Eton to be re-named “Cheeky Eaton.”  At twenty he joined the Grenadiers, and, going to Dublin, was by his brother officers called “Brown” -- a name by which he has been known ever since.  Being a good soldier, an industrious fellow, and quite enthusiastic in all that he does, he attained his Colonelcy and became a Peer’s son in the same year; and he is now in command of that 2nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards which he has just brought back from a well-deserved, if enforced, holiday in Bermuda.''

''He is a good all-round sportsman who drives his father’s team well; but though a fair shot, he is sometimes a little too eager to get birds.  He has thrown himself heart and soul into most things connected with the Brigade; and the Boat Club and Racing Club would miss him as much as he would be missed from an Ascot luncheon.  He has commanded the N.R.A. camp at Wimbledon and Bisley for seven years; yet withal he has found time to start and successfully edit ''The Brigade of Guards Magazine''.  He is a very good and very popular Colonel.''

''He had a narrow escape from degenerating into a politician four years ago, when he was only saved from becoming a Tory Member of Parliament by sixteen gallant Coventry voters.''

=== “Arms and Sport” (Ray), July 17, 1912 ===

[[Image:Eaton_HF_Vanity_Fair_1912-07-17.jpg|thumb|right]]''Born some sixty years ago, he has spent more than half of his life soldiering.  Did most of it in the “Grannies,” and was made major-general in 1899.''

''Always a rare man in the Army to “organise and organise and organise,” and left his mark on the Tournament when things were none too bright in that quarter.''

''Since retiring has found “employment on return to civil life” -- fine old official phrase that! -- in helping along all sorts of deserving institutions, among others the L.C.C., of which he is now chairman.''

''Does it all just as easily as he handles the ribbons when driving his team of bays at a meet of the Four-in-Hand Club.''

''Collects medals -- well-won war ones -- and has about the finest “aggregate” ever put in cases.''

''Also boats -- these he does not collect -- but uses to row in.''

''Shoots anything -- has done so since he had a pop for Eton in the Ashburton in 1866.''

''Has shot for the House of Lords since 1906, and would have shot for the Commons if he had not scored an “outer” at Coventry election in 1887.''

[[Image:Royal_Chester_Gibson%27s_Grand_medal_front_1856.jpg|thumb|right|E.B. Gibson's Grand Challenge Cup medal, 1856]]''Known to his intimates as “Brown,” he is never happier than when the boys have their week at Bisley, and he can devote a portion of his well-earned holidays to “teaching the young idea to shoot.”''

''Loves rifle shooting as much as marksmen like him -- which is indeed saying a very great deal.''

''Has done more to advance the “nation of marksmen” ideal than any other nobleman in the country.''

''Makes a very neat and nippy after-dinner speech -- always keeping his “few words” well on the target.''

''A man of infinite capacity and charming personality, whose sterling qualities of head and heart have made him many friends and never an enemy.''

Herbert Francis Eaton (1848-1925) won the Eton House Fours in 1866 at bow for Mr. Warre’s house, and rowed for the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards in the 1877 Grand.

He first appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; as commander of the 2nd Battalion, which he had “just brought back from a well-deserved, if enforced, holiday in Bermuda.”  As some curious punishment, the entire battalion had been sent to that terrible place for a year following “an act of insubordination.” 

Following his 1912 appearance, Eaton (who had by then inherited the baronetcy from his brother) returned to the military during the 1914-18 war to preside over courts martial in espionage and other cases.  He died in 1925 of injuries received in a motor accident, the first &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; rower to meet his end in that modern fashion.

=== Oarsmen at War ===
Of the fifty-nine rowers of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, seventeen served in the armed forces in wartime:  two in the Sudan (Compton and Grenfell (as a journalist)), four in the South African war (Chapman, Compton, McLean, and Fletcher), and fourteen in the 1914-18 war (Lord Ampthill, Bourne, Chapman, Crum, Dudley-Ward, Eaton, Fletcher, Fogg-Elliot, Gold, Guinness, Nickalls, W.F.D. Smith, Stuart, and Swann).  In his autobiography, The Sunlit Hours, T.A. Cook recalled W.A.L. Fletcher in South Africa:

''When the South African War broke out, at a period when many of us at home were without sufficient information to understand the many surrenders which were taking place, we were all suddenly cheered up by news of Lieutenant Fletcher at Hamelfontein.  On December 17 he was in command of twenty men of the 32nd Company Imperial Yeomanry (Lancashire Hussars), two of Nesbitt’s Horse, and nine Grenadier Guardsmen, a miscellaneous force responsible for the safety of a valuable depot of rations about twenty miles from Colesberg.  The patrol he sent out very early in the morning never came back.  At half-past ten the Boers made a strong attack, when Fletcher was half a mile away from camp.  He ran back, rushed the men to their stations, sent off reinforcements to an outlying picket, and galloped off to them himself some hundred yards under fire.  Luckily he never got there, for when his horse had been shot under him he reached a small kopje in time to see them smothered by the enemy’s advance and a man captured who had run to their assistance.  One of the men he had left was wounded, but Fletcher disposed his twenty-three rifles to repel the attack.  Another named Stevenson volunteered to run the gauntlet and get help.  He raced pluckily through the zone of fire only to ride straight into the Boer reinforcements, which now began to come up and close in upon every commanding kopje round the little camp.''

[[File:Lord Cheylesmore monument, by Luytens, Embankment gardens, London.jpg|thumb|right|400px|1927 monument by Luytens, Victoria Embankment Gardens, London WC2]]''By slow degrees Fletcher and his twenty-two men, reduced gradually to only sixteen, were driven back from their outlying kopjes to the sluits, and from the sluits to the irrigation ditches.  The enemy had gradually increased to between 200 and 250, and twice they sent in to demand surrender, mentioning something about cannon the second time.  Fletcher refused; and all his men stood by him though the foe had got to within 15 yd., and a rush was momentarily expected.  But it never came.  For eleven and a half hours the fight went on.  At last each man took a room to himself, barricaded every door, and waited at the window with fixed bayonets.  A desperate and heavy rowing-man at a window with a bayonet is not a pleasant thing to face, and the enemy preferred the cover of the sluits and bushes.  At last the Boers sent in to ask if a couple of their wounded would be admitted.  Fletcher took them in, but their hurts were mortal.  By the morning the discouraged enemy had disappeared, carrying off the rest of their wounded and leaving two dead upon the field.''

''“They could not last the course,” he wrote home to Sir John Edwards-Moss in England.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a text field that the users types text into.  You want to show a list of possible suggested items as the user types.  This feature is also known as autocomplete.

== Method ==
Use a standard input control and set the '''incremental=&quot;true&quot;''' attribute.  Use the '''xforms-value-changed''' event to trigger a submission that puts possible values in a list.  When the user select a value from the suggestion list it will replace the text value in the field.

We will also add a bind rule so that the selection view will only be visible if there is at least one suggested item.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;instance('conditional-views')/suggest-view&quot; 
         relevant=&quot;count(instance('suggest-results')//item) &amp;gt; 1&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This program depends on a server-side REST web service that you pass in a single parameter &quot;prefix&quot; such as the following that returns recipe ingredients that begin with '''ba''':

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;b&gt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/XForms/suggest-ingredient.xq?prefix=ba&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

This program returns an XML file that is restricted to the suggested ingredients that begin with the prefix passed to the XQuery web service:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;suggestions&gt;
&lt;tc&gt;Ba&lt;/tc&gt;
   &lt;ingredient&gt;Baking powder&lt;/ingredient&gt;
   &lt;ingredient&gt;Bananas&lt;/ingredient&gt;
   &lt;ingredient&gt;Barbecue Sauce&lt;/ingredient&gt;
   &lt;ingredient&gt;Barley&lt;/ingredient&gt;
   &lt;ingredient&gt;Barley, malt&lt;/ingredient&gt;
   &lt;ingredient&gt;Basil&lt;/ingredient&gt;
   &lt;ingredient&gt;Bass&lt;/ingredient&gt;
   &lt;ingredient&gt;Bay leaves&lt;/ingredient&gt;
&lt;/suggestions&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Screen Image ==

The following example shows that as the user types in the letter &quot;c&quot;, a list of possible ingredients instantly appears in the right column.  The user can continue typing and the list will be restriced to the suggestions that start with the letters typed.  When the user selects an item it will fill in the prior selected field.

[[Image:xforms-suggest-example.jpg|center|frame|Suggestions displayed in the right margin of a form]]

== Link to XForms Application ==

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;
NOTE: To get this program to run you will first have to add our server to the XForms &quot;Trusted Sites&quot; list.

To do this in FireFox, go to your Tools/Options/Security menu and add '''www.cems.uwe.ac.uk''' and '''googlecode.com''' to your '''allowed sites''' list.  This allows the form (loaded from the googlecode domain) to pull data from the server at www.cems.uwe.ac.uk.
&lt;/font&gt;

            &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
The above example also has several lines of event logging that can be removed in a production application.

As the user is typing and they see a suggestion they like in the suggestion view they will click on the suggested item trigger.  When
the focus moves out of the field we must keep track of the element that they just left.  This is done by the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMFocusOut&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:insert nodeset=&quot;instance('log')/event&quot; at=&quot;last()&quot; position=&quot;after&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('log')/event[last()]&quot; value=&quot;'Out of input 1'&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('selected-word')/calling-element&quot; value=&quot;'1'&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example attempts to reuse the selection functions for many elements.  To do this we have to get the items selected into the right field.  In this example we just set an integer value for the element.

Although this works if all your elements have the same element name you will have to replace the last setvalue with
an equivalent string expression if you have many complex items in a form that need suggested values.

== Setting the Field Value ==
The following action is used when the use clicks on  suggestion:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:insert nodeset=&quot;instance('log')/event&quot; at=&quot;last()&quot; position=&quot;after&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('log')/event[last()]&quot; 
       value=&quot;concat('Clicked on a suggestion word:', instance('suggest-results')/word[index('results-repeat')])&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('my-form')/element[number(instance('selected-word')/calling-element)]&quot; 
                              value=&quot;instance('suggest-results')/word[index('results-repeat')]&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The first two values are only for logging.  The last setvalue sets the field of the element that has the calling-element value.  So for the second element the value would be '''instance('my-form')/element[2]'''.

== Sample XQuery ==

As an example XQuery, we have a collection of &quot;Term&quot; elements with &quot;TermName&quot; subelements.  The following XQuery is use for our server side script.  If you use eXist just place it in the same collection as the form and call it &quot;suggest-item.xq&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace exist=&quot;http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;
let $collection-path := '/db/mdr/glossaries/data'
let $search-str := request:get-parameter('prefix', '')
return
&lt;suggestions&gt;{
       for $term in collection($collection-path)/Term[starts-with(TermName/text(),$search-str)]
       return &lt;item&gt;{$term/TermName/text()}&lt;/item&gt;
}&lt;/suggestions&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

        &lt;/xf:group&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using Minimal Trigger Appearance ==
If you do not like the appearance of the button in the trigger you can
add the '''appearance=&quot;minimal&quot;''' attribute to the trigger element.

The following CSS will reverse the background and font colors when the user hovers over the trigger:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
.suggestion:hover {
   background-color: blue;
   color: white;
   padding: 3px;
   font-size: 10pt;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Preventing Null Searches ==

XForms 1.1 added the conditional event attribute.  You can use this to only request an suggestion from the server
if the element is at least one character long.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-value-changed&quot; if=&quot;string-length(instance('save-data')/element[1]) gt 0&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('suggest-query')/prefix&quot; value=&quot;instance('save-data')/element[1]&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xf:send submission=&quot;get-suggestions&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
The functionality of suggesting items is contained in the Orbeon Autocomplete component [http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/xbl-components/autocomplete Orbon XBL Autocomplete]

XSLTForms has an example that uses the JSON results from Wikipedia search to suggest pages:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bankes, John Eldon == 

=== “Good Form” (Spy), March 29, 1906 ===

[[Image:Bankes_JE_Vanity_Fair_1906-03-29.jpg|thumb|right]]''Mr. John Eldon Bankes is, like Mr. Roosevelt, an advocate of the strenuous life.  For an Eton boy he was singularly unassuming; and, when the aquatic honour of rowing for his school in the Henley of ‘72 was bestowed upon him, Johnny still preserved his modesty of demeanor.  The same year found him at “Univ.,” and in 1875 he was given a place in the Oxford crew that rowed a winning race against their rival University.  He was secretary to the O.U.B.C. and president of the Eton Club and Vincents.''

''His paternal great-grandfather having been a Lord Chancellor, and his maternal grandfather a Lord Chief Justice, he was forced by heredity into the law.  Entering the Inner Temple, he was a pupil of the present Lord Chief Justice.  His legal career has been smooth and triumphant.  He took silk with a diffidence that was not appropriate to the occasion.  His practice is very large, and he has not an enemy to grudge him his good fortune.  His recent appointment to be a Fellow of Eton College gave equal pleasure to his old schoolfellows and to himself.''

''Had the women and children of the Flintshire boroughs been voters, Mr. Bankes would now have enjoyed the questionable honour -- in this Parliament, at least -- of writing M.P. after his name.  But the effervescence of his opponent overbore the logic of his speeches.  He married in ‘82, and has been blessed with a quiverful.  He is loved as a landlord, and his pheasants are as lofty as any in Wales.  He conducts his cases like a courteous gentleman, and is a standard of legal good form.  His charming manners and handsome face will adorn the Bench no less admirably than they have ornamented the Bar.''

Aside from the Eton and Boat Race rowing mentioned above, John Eldon Bankes (1854-1946) won the Visitors’ at Henley for University College, Oxford in 1875 and 1876, and rowed in the Stewards’ (1875, for University College) and the Grand (1876, for the “Oxford Mixture” of Brasenose and University).  At Oxford, he was head of the river in 1874 and 1875, and won the University Fours in 1873 and 1875.

After his unsuccessful run for Parliament in 1905, Bankes practised law another five years before being appointed to the High Court in 1910 where, according to his ''Times'' obituary, he proved “patient, unprejudiced, and, moreover, knew the rules of the game.”  He moved to the Court of Appeal in 1915, retiring in 1927.  “There have been more learned Judges, but few, if any, have won such universal admiration and respect.”{{ref|Times}}

=== Henley Society and House Boats ===
From the early 1870s through the late 1880s, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; reported virtually no rowing.  Woodgate was off the case.  Only Henley attracted notice, and then purely for its social appeal, which had risen steadily and made the place the late-June destination for luxurious house-boats that would moor alongside the course during regatta week.  “At first the house-boat was a floating structure of small proportions and humble pretensions -- the home of some artist or some devoted lover of the Thames who had become tired of camping out,” recalled an anonymous journalist.  “But the possibilities of the thing were soon gauged by those to whom money was not very much of an object.”{{ref|journalist}} 

&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, July 12, 1884:

[[Image:College_barge_at_Henley_c1895.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Henley Regatta, c. 1895]]
''Henley Regatta was a great success this year.  Seldom has there been finer weather for this most important gathering of oarsmen, and the crowds that came up from all parts were unprecedented.  The limpid stream was simply alive with craft of every kind and description, and the blaze of colours all adown the silver reach was dazzling.  House-boats, barges, steamers, and little launches lay moored in happy mixture along the Bucks shore, rivalling in their brilliancy the gay panorama that stretched away on the Berkshire meadows opposite.  The Isthmian Club was enormously patronised, and certainly presented a most inviting appearance.  Here lunch went on all day; and cosy little parties wandered about the enclosure, listening to the beautiful strains of the Hungarian Band, or resting themselves under the shady trees of Phyllis Court, whence a splendid view of the racing could be obtained.  Coaches thronged the bridge far up the reach, and the scene was altogether beautiful.''

June 30, 1888:

[[Image:Renoir14.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Renoir, &quot;The Luncheon of the Boating Party,&quot; 1881]]
''I am glad to see that Henley Regatta will once more spread over the three days.  From the number of house-boats that are daily being towed up river, I should imagine that the fixture will be a very brilliant one.  All the crews in training will be located in the town by Monday, when the usual pretty spectacle will begin.  From my own point of view, I always think that the two days preceding the Regatta are more enjoyable than the actual festivities.  There is then a spirit of laissez-faire amongst those who do not contend for the medals, and the quaint old town, made gay with a hundred pretty flags and a hundred bright coats, has an indescribably soothing charm.  In the evening, too, one may float down steam in a canoe or punt, watching the many coloured lamps darting and glinting upon the lapping wavelets, and listening to the subdued music from the house-boats.  The whole thing is original, and contrasts well with the noisy bellowings of blackened rascals and the ceaseless echo of the cork which mark the Regatta itself.''

. . . .

''Some of the house-boats this year are singularly gorgeous.  The Dolce-far-niente is a bank of flowers, and the Happy Land a bower of roses.  Life on these boats has its advantages in capitals during the Regatta Week.''

''The Leander Club is again quartered upon Temple Island, and the Isthmians will repeat all their games in the meadow to the music of the Red Hungarian.''

''In addition to the special day trains to be run from Paddington each morning of the Regatta, the G.W.R. have made arrangements for the issue of special Regatta tickets, available for the three days, as well as the day tickets available for both Henley and Marlow Regattas.  Marlow Regatta, as usual, follows Henley, being dated for the 7th, 8th, and 9th July.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Compton, Alwyne Frederick == 

=== “North Bedfordshire” (Spy), April 3, 1902 ===
[[Image:Compton_AF_Vanity_Fair_1902-04-03.jpg|thumb|right]]
''Born in the year of the Crimean War, he is naturally warlike; as he has shown in the Bedfordshire Yeomanry (of which he is Major) and in the House of Commons (to which he was returned by the Biggleswadians of Bedfordshire some years ago).  For he has served with Compton’s Horse in South Africa, and has earned Mention in Despatches in spite of the fact that he is the third son of the fourth Marquess of Northampton.  Naturally, of course, he joined the Foot Guards when he left Eton; and thence he migrated to the 10th Hussars and served in the Soudan Campaign of 1884-5 (when he got a Medal and a Star).  As a wholesome Unionist, he began his political life by turning out the great G.W.R. (author of “Chestnuts”) from the representation of the Biggleswade onions [sic]; but between whiles he turned his sword into a Stock Exchange Year-Book, and still pervades Capel Court when not legislating for Bedfordshire.  It is true that he does not often address Mr. Speaker, but, being goaded into action by the Leader of the House on the Vote of Censure, he lately read an edifying speech to the alleged Leader of the Opposition.  He occasionally attends the Service Members’ Committee, though he is not always in time for Prayers; he cultivates a malmaison in his buttonhole, and he is the husband of a sportsman’s daughter.''

[[w:Lord_Alwyne_Compton_%28politician%29|Alwyne Frederick Compton]] (1855-1911) rowed in the Trial Eights at Eton with J.E. Bankes in 1872.  In 1877, he rowed No. 3 for the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards in the Grand with H.F. Eaton and Alexander Fuller-Acland-Hood.

He lost his Parliamentary seat in 1906 but was returned in 1910 for the Brentford Division of Middlesex, only to resign a short time later for ill health.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Vincent, Edgar (''Viscount D’Abernon'') == 

=== “Eastern Finance” (Spy), April 20, 1899 ===
[[Image:Vincent_E_Vanity_Fair_1899-04-20.jpg|thumb|right]]''A parson and the eleventh Baronet of his family became his father two-and-forty years ago:  and when he had done those things which he ought (or ought not) to have done at Eton -- among others passing head as a Student Dragoman and not taking up the appointment -- he joined the Coldstream Guards.  After five years of service he became Secretary to Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, Queen’s Commissioner on the East Roumelian Question; and so began his real acquaintance with the East.  He got on; and after being a Commissioner for the Evacuation of Thessaly, President of the Council of the Ottoman Public Debt and Financial Adviser to the Egyptian Government, he was made Governor of the Imperial Ottoman Bank.  He holds various Turkish Orders; he has been guilty of “A Grammar of Modern Greek” which now plagues the members of the Athenian University; he likes yachting; he cycles, and he can play billiards.  He left Eton with the manuscript of his Greek Grammar; and consequently he left the Service with the name of “Sophos”:  which still sticks to him.  Nevertheless, he escaped through the roof of the Ottoman Bank during the great massacre.  He has a unique tennis court of his own at Esher.''

''He is the husband of one of the most beautiful women yet born.''

[[w:Edgar_Vincent%2C_1st_Viscount_D%27Abernon|Edgar Vincent]] (1857-1941) rowed no. 5 for Eton in the 1874 Grand and Ladies’.

Lord Kinross, historian of the Ottoman empire, recounted the escape through the roof of the bank as follows, in the context of rising Turkish-Armenian tensions:

''In August 1896, the succession of Armenian massacres culminated in Istanbul itself.  Once again, as in the previous year, the Turkish authorities were presented with a pretext for action by an Armenian revolutionary group.  A small body of Dashnaks was so bold as to enter the Ottoman Bank, the stronghold of European capitalist enterprise, during the lunch hour, for the ostensible purpose of changing money.  Porters accompanying them carried sacks which contained, so they pretended, gold and silver coinage.  Then at the blast of a whistle twenty-five armed men followed them into the bank, firing their guns and revealing that the sacks in fact were filled with bombs, ammunition, and dynamite.  They declared that they wee not bank robbers but Armenian patriots, and that the motive of their action was to bring their grievances, which they specified in two documents, to the attention of the six European embassies, putting  forward demands for political reform and declaring that, in the absence of foreign intervention within forty-eight hours, they would &quot;shrink from no sacrifice&quot; and blow up the bank.''

''Meanwhile, its chief director, Sir Edgar Vincent, had prudently escaped through a skylight into an adjoining building.  While his colleagues were held as hostages, he thence proceeded to the Sublime Porte [i.e. the Turkish authorities].  Here he ensured that no police attack should be made on the Dashnaks while they remained in the bank.  Thus he secured for them permission to negotiate.  The negotiator was the First Dragoman of the Russian embassy, who after gaining fro  them a free pardon from the Sultan and permission to leave the contry, addressed them at length and with some eloquence.  Finally, with assurances of talks to come, he persuaded them to leave the bank.  Retaining their arms but relinquishing their bombs, they proceeded quietly on board Sir Edgar Vincent's yacht, later to be conveyed into exile in France.''{{ref|Kinross}}

Shortly after his appearance in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, Vincent went to Parliament as a Conservative.  He was defeated in 1906 and again in 1910, ending an electoral career “for which indeed he was not well fitted for his rapidity of perception made him see every side of a question and stood in the way of a wholehearted accpetance of general principles.”{{ref|DNB}}  From 1912-17 he served as chairman of the Royal Commission on imperial trade, and during the war as chairman of the Central Control Board, where he imposed heavy taxation on alcohol.  In 1920 Lloyd George appointed him ambassador to Germany in recognition, in Lord Curzon’s words, that the post at that delicate time required “a close familiarity with economic and financial subjects and wide experience in dealing on friendly terms with various classes of men.”  During six stressful years in Berlin, Baron D’Abernon -- he was made a peer in 1914 -- dealt with reparations, disarmament, occupation of German territory, French security, and the attempted formation of a new European order, culminating in the 1926 Treaty of Locarno that admitted Germany to the League of Nations.  On return to England, he was made Viscount and spent several years as head or director of varied agencies, organizations, and philanthropies such as the National and Tate Galleries, the Lawn Tennis Association, the Race Course Betting Control Board, the Medical Research Council, the National Institute of Industrial Psychology, and the Royal Mint Advisory Committee.

The “most beautiful woman yet born”?  It was Lady Helen Venetia Duncombe, his wife for fifty-one years, daughter of the first Earl of Feversham.

=== To a Henley Minstrel ===
The banjo “was quite tolerable when heard across the water,” recalled Max Pemberton of 1880s Henley, though by 1936 when he published his autobiography “[t]he gramophone has squashed the itinerant musician and the casual ballad-monger has dust in his mouth.”  But such uninvited songsters were still thriving in 1904, when &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (July 14, 1904) offered these anonymous lines:

:''TO A HENLEY MINSTREL.'' &lt;br&gt;[[Image:Henley_Aquatic_Carnival_Punch_1889.jpg|thumb|right|500px|&quot;Henley Aquatic Carnival,&quot; ''Punch'', July 6, 1889 (minstrel at center bottom)]]

:''(After Swinburne.)'' &lt;br&gt;

:''Black bawler of blithering ballads,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Swart (soi-disant) son of the States,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why poison our lobsters and salads,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Turn the strawberry sour on our plates?'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why make heavenly Henley the target'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Of the song (save the mark!) that you shout?'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Why on earth don’t you go down to Margate?'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Get out!'' &lt;br&gt;


:''When we’re prone in a punt on the river'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Or coiled in a cosy canoe,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''The sweet summer stillness you shiver,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''You cork-burning criminal, you!'' &lt;br&gt;
:''If my bank-balance bulged to a billion,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Not one small, single sou would I give'' &lt;br&gt;
:''For the songs which you steal from Pavilion'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''And Tiv.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Dark dealer in drivelling ditties,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Devoid both of tune and of sense,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''In which not a shadow of wit is,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Think well ere you plague me for pence:'' &lt;br&gt;
:''I’m not one who sticks at a trifle;'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''I know neither pity nor fear,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And to Henley I’m taking my rifle'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Next year.'' &lt;br&gt;

: Hi Meowmom I assume the anon that left me a message was you. If you wrote these recipies and would be willing to release them under the GFDL, I have no problem keeping them. Sorry if it seemed like I was biting you, it's just we get people just copying stuff from those websites (most of the time written by someone else / without permission ) all the time, and though the recipies are free to print and such I don't think that in general it is acceptable to copy them onto another site (hence the copyright notices on the bottom of the sites in question). However, if you were the author of those works, just let me know and I'll remove the copyright notices (or you can remove them yourself if you wish) since in that case you'd obviously be allowed to do what you want with them, including post them on this site.

Annotations to '''''The Complete Peanuts: 1965 to 1966''''' by Charles M. Schulz (Fantagraphics Books, 2007. ISBN 1560977247)

*p. 2 (January 3, 1965). Billiard balls were made from elephant ivory from the 17th century until the early 20th century.  [[w:Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#English|English]] is a term referring to putting a spin on the cue ball by striking the ball off-center with the cue.

*p. 4 (January 9, 1965). [[w:Annette Funicello|Annette Funicello]] was an original cast member of ''[[w:The Mickey Mouse Club|The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' TV show in 1955, when she was 13 years old.

*p. 13 (January 30, 1965).  “I could have skated all night“ presumably refers to the song &quot;[[w:I Could Have Danced All Night|I Could Have Danced All Night]]&quot; from the musical ''[[w:My Fair Lady|My Fair Lady]]''.

*p. 28 (March 4, 1965).  A cinch notice is an official notice from a teacher that your grades are unsatisfactory.

*p. 32 (March 14, 1965).  The first reference in ''Peanuts'' to the kite-eating tree.

*p. 47 (April 18, 1965).  In baseball, a [[w:beanball|bean ball]] is a ball thrown by a pitcher directly at a player with the intent of hitting them.  The [[w:Children‘s Crusade|Children‘s Crusade]] was a possibly legendary event that occurred in 1212 during  [[w:Crusades|The Crusades]].  The [[w:John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|incident at Harper’s Ferry]] was an attempt by abolitionist John Brown to start a slave revolt in 1859.

*p. 52 (April 30, 1965).  In the [[w:Daniel in the lions' den|sixth chapter of Daniel]], Daniel is thrown into a lions’ den for refusing to stop praying to his god.  See also October 20, 1963.

*p. 54 (May 5, 1965).  First mention of Snoopy's siblings.  First mention of the &quot;Daisy Hill Puppy Farm.&quot;

*p. 70 (June 11, 1965).  Roy’s first appearance.  Roy was best known for later introducing [[w:Peppermint Patty|Peppermint Patty]] to the rest of the cast.  See August 22, 1966.

*p. 75 (June 23, 1965).  At the time of this strip, the phrase [[w:À gogo|À gogo]] was supposed to mean modern or up-to-date.  The actual meaning of À gogo is “plenty” or “galore”.

*p. 96 (August 9, 1965). There are several meanings claimed for 'hodad', but it appears that Schulz is referring to someone who brings a surfboard to the beach but never surfs, i.e. a poser. 

*p. 97 (August 14, 1965). It is difficult to know if this is a reference to the Houston Astrodome, which opened in April 1965 with natural grass as the playing surface.  The grass soon died due to painted-over skylights, but artificial grass was not installed until 1966.

*p. 98 (August 15, 1965). The phone number given in the last panel was actually the phone number of producer [[w:Lee Mendelson|Lee Mendelson]], who at the time was working on the very first animated ''Peanuts'' special, ''[[w:A Charlie Brown Christmas|A Charlie Brown Christmas]]''.

*p. 99 (August 19, 1965). [[w:Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Brahms' Symphony No. 4 in e minor, op. 98.]]

*p. 102 (August 24, 1965). An Australian phrase meaning an all-out effort.  &quot;Bush&quot; is Australian slang for a sparsely populated area or for wilderness.  An equivalent phrase in American English would be &quot;The Super Bowl or bust!&quot;

*p. 107 (September 5, 1965). Lucy's comments on the relationship between sin and personal misfortune reflects the conception of happiness in the Old Testament. She will often come back to it again, for example in the doghouse fire series (see p. 271, September 24, 1966). 
 
*p. 109 (September 9, 1965). The phrase “Better to light a single candle than to curse the darkness” is thought to originate in an ancient Chinese proverb.  It is also closely associated with [[w:Amnesty International|Amnesty International|]].

*p. 113 (September 19, 1965). ''[[w:Lord Jim|Lord Jim]]'' is a novel by [[w:Joseph Conrad|Joseph Conrad]] , while the [[w:1812 Overture|1812 Overture]] is a well known piece of orchestral music composed by [[w:Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].

*p. 122 (October 10, 1965). Snoopy’s first appearance in his most famous persona, the World War I flying ace.  The [[w:Sopwith Camel|Sopwith Camel]] was a British single seat fighter aircraft employed by the allies at the end of World War I.  The [[w:Manfred von Richthofen|Red Baron]] was a nickname for German fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen, the highest scoring German ace of the First World War.

*p. 129 (October 26, 1965). In the last panel, the phrase “ you try harder” is a reference to the corporate motto of [[w:Avis Rent a Car System|Avis Rent a Car]].  At the time, Avis conducted an extensive advertising campaign around the phrase “We’re number two because we try harder” versus the leading rental car company, [[w:The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]].  

*p. 135 (November 8, 1965). The beginning of Mark Antony's speech in Shakespeare's ''[[w:Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', Act III scene 2.

*p. 144 (November 29, 1965).  [[w:Amblyopia|Amblyopia]] is a visual deficiency in an eye that is otherwise physically normal.  Schulz calls Sally’s condition Amblyopia ex anopsia, but the symptoms and treatment sound more like Stabismic amblyopia.  Sally will continue to wear the eye patch in most strips until May 1966.

*p. 147 (December 6, 1965). In 1951, the [[w:C. F. Hathaway Company|Hathaway shirt company]] ran its first advertisement that featured a distinguished man in a shirt and tie and wearing an eyepatch.  The ad campaign was extremely successful and &quot;The Man in the Hathaway Shirt&quot; became the icon for the company.

*p. 147 (December 8, 1965). [[w:Long John Silver|Long John Silver]] is a pirate character from the novel ''[[w:Treasure Island|Treasure Island]]'' by [[w:Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson]].

*p. 177 (February 15, 1966). See September 28, 1964.

*p. 192 (March 21, 1966). Fort Zinderneuf is the main setting of the novel and film ''[[w:Beau Geste|Beau Geste]]'', which is about French Foreign Legionnaires.  Other references to ''Beau Geste'' appear in April 1966 strips.

*p. 194 (March 27, 1966). The baseball teams that Linus lists are the [[w:National League|National League]] and the [[w:American League|American League]] second place winner for each year.

*p. 210 (May 3, 1966).  Commissioner Eckert was Commissioner of Baseball [[w:Baseball_Commissioner#William_Eckert_.281965-1968.29|William Eckert]], who was commissioner between 1965 and 1968.

*p. 215 (May 15, 1966).  There is an interesting mismatch between the daily strip and the Sunday strip here -- Linus, who has moved away in the daily strip is present for the baseball game in the Sunday strip!

*p. 216 (May 18, 1966).  In the last panel, Schroeder is referring to another piece of music from the musical ''[[w:My Fair Lady|My Fair Lady]]'', &quot;[[w:I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face|I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face]]&quot;.

*p. 232 (June 23, 1966).  The quotation is from Jeremiah 31, verses 16-17.  Linus' speech happens at a time of rising anxiety in America about the sudden escalation of the [[w:Vietnam War|Vietname War]].

The book does not belong on Wikibooks, as it is not a textbook, it is actually a strategy guide, and it doesn't have enough content anyway. Thoughts? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 00:54, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

:{{keep}} --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:44, 7 January 2008 (UTC)
:{{Keep}} I disagree with the statement that this is not a textbook. At the very least, it is the stub for a textbook, or a textbook in development. However, I will grant that this book isn't well formatted, isn't well explained, etc. It needs a lot of work, but needing help is not justification for deletion. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 05:40, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

:{{keep}} It is a textbook for military and police tactical training. + what WhiteKnight said. ...[[User:Selden|Selden]] ([[User talk:Selden|talk]]) 15:13, 7 January 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Angle, Bernard Jack == 

=== “Jack in the Box” (F.C.G.), April 5, 1890 ===

[[Image:Angle_BJ_Vanity_Fair_1890-04-05.jpg|thumb|right]]''It is only five-and-thirty years -- not five-and-forty, as most people believe -- since he was born at Hendon, where he rapidly developed much muscle and waxed exceedingly.  Before he was eighteen years old he became quite well known in the athletic world.  He rowed his first race on the River Lea eighteen years ago, and he has since won the Thames Cup and the Grand Challenge for the Thames Rowing Club; he devoted a space to running, and won pots at the London Athletic Club and at other meetings; and he became, and for long remained, a force among Rugby Unionists, and, playing for the Wasps’ Football team, used to throw opposing footballers about as a child throws tin soldiers.  But having now become a popular member of the Stock Exchange and altogether a big man, he has put away childish things and has grown grey and staid.  Yet he is still identified with every branch of athletic exercise, and much honoured in the observance thereof.''

''He has boxed many people with vigour, and is still quite a hard man to mark.  And though he is now more bulky and less easily moved than he was, yet, being an honourable man, he is everywhere accepted as the fairest and best possible judge of other people’s performances with their fists.  Consequently he is generally wanted when there is any sparring to be done.  A practised swordsman, he is otherwise extremely well able to take care of himself, as frequenters of Angelo’s -- where he is often seen to illustrate the uses of both the small sword and the sabre -- well know.  He is something of a seaman, for he holds a Board of Trade certificate of competency; and he has been a prominent member of the Corinthian Yacht Club.  He has been seen with a gun; but he does not always hold it straight when it goes off.''

''Everyone likes “Jack,” in the box or out of it.''

Bernard Jack Angle (1855-1932) rowed for the Thames R.C. at Henley from 1874 to 1878, winning the Thames Challenge Cup 1874 and the Grand in 1878.  The 1878 crew was “one of the lightest and worst crews (as regards rowing form) that ever rowed for the Grand,” recalled “Piggy” Eyre, one of its members.  “Angle was enormously strong, but muscle-bound, and inclined to pull with his arms at the finish, and too stiff altogether.  He, however, really came on wonderfully during the Henley week, and, I do not doubt, was most effective in the race.”{{ref|Eyre}}

By the time Angle appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;, he had set down his oars and become a well-known boxing referee at the National Sporting Club, a sport for which the Thames R.C. and F.V. Brooks’ West London R.C. were known in their day.  Angle and two non-rowing lights of the N.S.C. “were men of dress and address -- what used to be called ‘swells,’ in fact.”{{ref|Journalis}}  For the transition from oarsman to referee, Angle owed something to Bill East, who won Doggett’s Coat and Badge in 1887 and the professional championship of England in 1891, rowed with C.W. Dilke and Rupert Guinness, and became the Thames R.C. boatman.  East shared in Angle’s first fight under Prize Ring rules.  “It was between two cabmen for a small stake,” Angle wrote, “and took place by moonlight on the Half Moon Ground, Putney.  It was really good until a sudden interruption by the police caused a hurried retreat over a fence, which landed me in a pigsty, necessitating a plunge into the river, all standing.”  A co-founder in 1881 of the Amateur Boxing Association, Angle by his own account refereed “the majority of the big fistic encounters decided in this country during a period of nearly forty years,”{{ref|Angle1}}  as well as the 106-round Paris match between Jem Smith and Jake Kilrain on December 19, 1887, without ever entering the ring to control a fight.  Not surprisingly then, Angle’s autobiography (“the story of fifty-five years of active association with manly games”) devotes almost 200 of its 250 pages to the sweet science:  “There is nothing that men of British blood love and admire so much as hard, straight, clean hitting above the belt.  It was by this means we taught the world to respect us. . . .  [W]e punch and punish just as lustily and just as heartily as ever we did.  That is one of the many revelations made by the War that we ought to be thankful for.”{{note|Angle2}} 

Gardeners and clerics take note:  Francis Carruthers Gould, &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s artist, could hardly resist the visual puns of adorning Mr. Angle’s lapel with ''Arisaema triphyllum'' -- Jack in the Pulpit, with the man himself at the center of the flower -- and of having him stand at a religious lectern.

=== Henley 1878:  Thames R.C. in the Grand ===
In the 1878 final for the Grand, Thames faced off against a Jesus crew averaging a stone heavier and loaded with past and future Blues.  “The general opinion among the cognoscenti,“ Angle recalled, was that “Thames, despite their splendid condition, had not the weight or power necessary to give them any chance of victory.”{{note|Angle3}}  From B.J.’s angle, the race went thus: 

[[Image:Henley_Regatta_by_Tissot_1877.jpg|frame|right|Henley Regatta by Tissot, 1877]]
''At the word “Go!” both crews got off on level terms, Jesus starting forty-two to our forty-four, but the great strength of the Cantabs soon began to tell its tale, and they gradually drew away from the lighter Thames crew.  By the time Fawley was reached they had a lead of nearly a length, Thames still rowing forty-four, but directly Prest dropped his rate of stroke Thames began to come up, and he again had to quicken.  His crew, however, were now plainly to feel the effects of the rapid stroke, and at the White House Thames came up, and before Poplar Point was reached had drawn ahead, and were leaving their opponents at every stroke.  We continued to gain all round the bend, and were a quarter of a length clear when coming into the straight for home.''

''Prest now called on his men for a final effort, and a grand one it was.  It really looked as if we might be beaten after all, but again our condition told its tale, and Hastie, still keeping his length without reducing his rate of stroke, stalled off the Jesus spurt, and amid a tornado of tideway cheers, drew clear away from the plucky Cantabs, to win by a good two lengths.''

''It is needless to say both crews finished in rather ragged form, Thames being the worse in this respect.  As we passed under Henley Bridge an enthusiastic Thames man, who had only just arrived and was running over the bridge, caught a glimpse of us as we passed under, rowing in anything but good form.  He took it for granted that we had been beaten.  On rushing down to the landing-stage to utter words of sympathy and comfort, it is painful to relate that Hastie cut his commiseration short by telling him not to be such a past participled fool as not to know a winning crew from a losing one.''{{note|Angle4}}

Why do most, but not all books have both the title page and print version listed here? --[[User:Clum|Clum]] ([[User talk:Clum|talk]]) 18:24, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

:That's an annoyance to me too, but there is really no good way to fix it. Books are added to this category using the {{tlx|print version}} template. What happens is that many books put this template on the main page or on the cover page. When the print version is created, the main page will be included in the print version, and so the {{tlx|print version}} will also be included as well. There are some tricks we could use to try and prevent that, but in general it's more hassle then it's worth. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:32, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

::Are you sure? It seems that both {{tlx|print version}} and {{tlx|Print version notice}} both add the page to this category.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Grenfell, William Henry (''Lord Desborough'') == 

=== “Taplow Court” (Spy), December 20, 1890 ===
[[Image:Grenfell_WH_Vanity_Fair_1890-12-20.jpg|thumb|right]]''Born five-and-thirty years ago of a family of traditional Liberals, he soon showed himself the sturdy child who has since developed into the record-breaking athlete in whom matter has not, as usual, triumphed over mind.  His life has been a compendium of athleticism varied with classical learning and political fighting.  He began as proxime accessit for the entrance Scholarship at Harrow, where he won the Mile, and played twice in the Eleven against Eton.  As a Balliol man, he ran three miles against Cambridge; helped to row a dead heat against Cambridge when only a broken oar saved the Light Blue crew from that beating which he easily helped to give them in the following year; and was made President of the University Athletic Club, and of the University Boat Club.  He also hunted the Draghounds.  Yet in spite of all this hard work he contrived to take a second-class in Moderations, which is an Honour Examination devoted to Classical Scholarship, and only failed to score more honour in “Greats” because he was temporarily disabled by illness.  He has moreover thrice climbed the Matterhorn among many other mountains; he has twice swum Niagara; he has rowed across the English Channel in a clinker-built eight; he has sculled from Oxford to London in a day; he has made a couple of expeditions to the Rocky Mountains; and he has thrice been declared Punting Champion of the Thames.''

''Yet he has found time for other pursuits.  He has been Private Secretary to a Chancellor of the Exchequer; he has been twice elected Member for Salisbury; and five years ago he saw fighting as special correspondent for the Daily Telegraph at Suakin.  But three years back he settled down as the husband of a charming lady, and he now seems more or less contented in the hunting of the Harriers which originally belonged to the Prince Consort.''

''He is a Justice of the Peace for two counties, and Deputy-Lieutenant for the Tower Hamlets.  He has two boys who promise to be worthy sons of their father.  He is a good, strong fellow off whom no one is known to have scored save certain unknown burglars at Taplow Court; whom he has never been able to meet.''

[[Image:W.H. Grenfell (Lord Desborough) in a racing punt - B&amp;W photograph - 1895.jpg|thumb|right|px150|Grenfell in a racing punt, c. 1895]][[w:William_Grenfell%2C_1st_Baron_Desborough|William Henry Grenfell]] (1855-1945) rowed for Oxford in the 1877 and 1878 Boat Races and in 1881, while a Liberal M.P. for Salisbury, rowed for Leander in the Grand.  When &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; featured him in 1890 in riding garb, his competitive rowing years were over but he continued to fence, hunt, fish, and ride, altogether “show[ing] a versatility unmatched by any of his contemporaries.”{{ref|Times1}}  He had a cameo in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s 1896 summer number by Hal Hurst, “Cycling in Hyde Park.”  In 1906 (at age forty-three) Grenfell was a member of the English épée team at the Athens Intercalated Games, and by age sixty-four had bagged about 850 stags, a good number on behalf of “the Venison Committee” during the 1914-18 war.  Before the war he coached a number of Oxford crews and hosted them at his house near Henley, Taplow Court.

Grenfell’s dual presidency of the O.U.B.C. and O.U.A.C. foreshadowed a lifetime of such stints at the head of sporting organizations, including the Amateur Fencing Association, Henley Regatta (steward), Lawn Tennis Association, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and the 1908 London Olympics.  He rose to the top outside of sport as well, serving as president or chairman at various times of the London Chamber of Commerce, the Royal Agricultural Society, and the Thames Conservancy (of which he was chairman for thirty-two years), as well as various local government posts and any number of ad hoc committees from local to international.  His obituarist concluded:  “With his union of social gifts, personal charm, and administrative ability, he was known as a man who could get things done, and at one time he was actually serving on 115 committees.  The multiplicity of his interests was indeed only matched by his industry and sense of duty.”{{ref|Times2}} 

Grenfell was made Baron Desborough in 1905 but the peerage became extinct in 1926 on the death of his third son in a motor accident, the older two having been killed in action in 1915.

=== The 1877 Boat Race:  The Dead Heat ===
In 1877 Oxford led after Barnes Bridge but stalled when their bow cracked his oar and foundered.  Cambridge caught up and the finish judge, who had no posts to mark the line, declared the result a dead heat, the only one on record.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; did not report on the Boat Race that year but R.C. Lehmann recalled it as follows:

[[Image:Dead_heat_finish_1877.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The 1877 Boat Race at the finish]]
''[Cambridge] had great trouble with regard to their boat.  The craft that Swaddell and Winship built for them was too small, and was, moreover, so heavily cambered that she failed to maintain her course in a beam wind.  On the morning of the race they attached a false keel to the stern half of their boat, but failed to add a corresponding piece to her rudder.  Notwithstanding this device, their boat began, as soon as they got into the rough water above Hammersmith Bridge in the race, to pay off into the wind.  While the Oxford boat was keeping a straight course, I saw Davis, the Cambridge coxswain, continually using his right hand rudder line, while his boat moved sideways as a St. Bernard dog does when he is running.  At Barnes Bridge, Oxford had cleared their rivals and seemed certain of victory.  Just beyond Barnes there was  heavy swell caused by a tug or a launch that had just passed up the course.  Suddenly we, who were on the steamer behind, perceived that Cowles, the Oxford bowman, was in trouble; he had apparently caught a crab, and his oar seemed to be damaged, for he did not use it for several strokes, and then, instead of rowing properly, he appeared to flap it about in the water and only occasionally attempted to row a stroke with it.  Cambridge were rowing the Surrey station, that is on the outside of the last bend.  They spurted with extraordinary pluck and determination at this point and began to gain rapidly on the leaders.  Up and up they came, and at the end of the race it was impossible for any one behind to say which crew had won.  The judge of the finish was an old waterman named John Phelps, “Honest” John Phelps, as he was always called.  He was stationed in a moored boat at the finish, but there were then no posts on either bank by which he could take his line.  He had to judge this as best he could.  In the following year, the two Presidents had finishing posts fixed and there they remain to this day.  After the race was over nobody know which crew had won.  The Umpire, Mr. Justice Chitty, was waiting on the Umpire’s steamer, but as Phelps did not come aboard he had to hurry back to his duties in London, leaving word, that Phelps was to come and see him later on in his Court.  When Phelps arrived there, he was immediately questioned as to the result of the race.  For answer he placed the two palms of his hands together, and, moving them slightly backwards and forwards, said, “They were going like this, sir; I couldn’t separate them.”  The result of the race, therefore, was given as a dead heat.  Mr. Justice Chitty, himself, told me this part of the story some years afterwards.''{{ref|Lehmann}}

Phelps was in Robert Coombes’ four that beat Harry Clasper in the 1845 Thames Regatta.  The 1877 race was his last to judge, and no waterman was ever permitted to do it again.  Finish posts were installed for all future races.{{ref|Cook}}

As on many websites, Wikibooks administrators occasionally [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy|block]] accounts and IP ranges that are deemed responsible for or related to problematic activity. You may be an innocent victim of [[w:collateral damage|collateral damage]], whereby a block of some other activity has accidentally caused your account to be unable to edit pages. If your editing access has been blocked by mistake, it will be reactivated very quickly, as soon as you let an administrator know of the problem. The box above gives the information you will need.

;What is a block?
:A [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy|block]] is a measure used to protect Wikibooks from possible improper use, or modification in breach of [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|editorial policies]]. Once blocks are over, they become history unless problems recur. Blocks can apply to a user account, an IP, or a range of IPs. A number of automated features identify unblocked usage which apparently should be blocked; these are known as ''autoblocks'' and can be quickly rectified if incorrect.
;Most common cause of an autoblock:
:Your IP matches that used by another blocked account, or the software believes your account or IP is connected to another blocked account. Ask for further information and/or request unblocking. Due to the nature of some [[w:Internet service provider|Internet service provider]]s, automatic blocks may inadvertently affect people other than the person whose account was blocked.

=== “Rudy” (Spy), January 17, 1895 ===
[[Image:Lehmann_RC_Vanity_Fair_1895-01-17.jpg|thumb|right]]
''He got his second name through his mother, the daughter of Robert Chambers, eight-and-thirty years ago; and as both his father and his mother knew Dickens, George Eliot, Browning, and a host of other such famous writers, it is natural that he should himself be an author.  But he is more.  From school he went to Cambridge; and having been athletically inclined since he first ran laps round the nursery table, he became First Boat Captain of First Trinity.  Having just missed his “Blue,” he left Cambridge and was presently converted into an excellent coach; than whom none is better known on the towpath to this day.  He has coached half-a-dozen ‘Varsity Eights, being in as much request with Oxford as with Cambridge, and always ready to do his best for either.  He was last year Captain of Leander; he is Secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association; and he is only less well-known at Henley than he is at Bourne End, where he has built for himself and his friends a comfortable house, which he calls Fieldhead.  He has also won trophies with his legs, with his wrists, and with his fists.  At an athletic meeting of the Middlesex Yeomanry he won the hundred yards, the quarter-mile, the hurdles, and the cricket ball throw right off; he has gained a prize for regimental swordsmanship; and he was middle and heavy weight boxing champion at Cambridge.  He also owns and edits The Granta, wherewith he has succeeded in showing that a University paper may be made to pay; and besides all these athletic attainments he is a good shot who has taught much in his “Conversational Hints to Young Shooters.”  Half-a-dozen years back he was asked to join the staff of Punch, and did so; in spite of which he is a merry fellow who can really write funny stuff in the way of bright parody and clever burlesque.''

''He is an all-round sportsman whose house is full of prizes, trophies, medals, presents, and mementoes:  in all of which he takes a proper pride.  Politically, he is a wicked, ambitious Liberal, who once dared to stand for Cambridge University when he might have been returned for East Hull; but this may be only another sign of the keen sense of humour that is in him.  He is a Justice of the Peace for Bucks; a wholesome, sound, fellow whom everyone likes; and an excellent host, who is always ready to help a friend.''

''He loves dogs.''

[[w:R._C._Lehmann|Rudolf Chambers Lehmann]] (1856-1929) fared worse at Henley than any other rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; who competed there:  he finished last in every heat he entered, from the 1877 Visitors’ to the 1888 Wyfolds.  Yet it is not for this record that he is best remembered in rowing, but as coach and author.  From 1891 to 1903 he focused on Oxford and Cambridge, generally as a finishing coach for one or the other but in 1892 for both.  He also coached at various times Leander, Harvard, Trinity College Dublin, and the Berlin Rowing Club.  “It was characteristic of him that he gave his valued services to two countries, three universities, and several colleges besides his own; he was not only a fine coach but a great oarsman, and his high ideals in both respects has had  lasting influence on the standard and spirit of international, as well as intercollegiate, rowing.”{{ref|Times}}  As an author, Lehmann became the “Poet Laureate of rowing”{{ref|Cook}} with verse and reminiscences that appeared most often in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Granta&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Punch&lt;/span&gt;.  His prose included &lt;u&gt;Rowing&lt;/u&gt; (1897, for the Isthmian Library) and &lt;u&gt;The Complete Oarsman&lt;/u&gt; (1908).

Outside of rowing, Lehmann kept to the broad trajectory outlined in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt;’s 1895 biography.  He came into Parliament with the Liberals from 1906 to 1910 as a member for the Harborough Division of Leicestershire.  During the war he volunteered in various ways on the home front and his health ebbed.  The balance of his professional energy went to literary and local political affairs around Bourne End, where he died in 1929 of pneumonia, age 73.  “‘Rudie’ Lehmann was a man of many talents, many interests in life, and, above all, very many friends,” wrote The Times.  “As humorist, journalist, oarsman and rowing coach, man of letters, barrister, and politician, he was continually adding to their number, and all of them, especially those whom he first knew and helped in their early manhood, will look back with affectionate gratitude to his ever-ready sympathy and kindly encouragement.”{{ref|Times2}}  To son John, writing of his own boyhood at Bourne End, the sweep oars stacked in the Fieldhead boathouse, where Lehmann had hosted the light and dark Blues, “called out of a legendary past for me my father’s rowing fame and a picture far more human and vital than the ‘Spy’ cartoon that hung in the bedroom corridor, of a man supple, athletic, radiant in the confidence of his strength and the love that all who knew him bore towards him.”{{ref|Lehmann}}

=== “''The Perfect Oar''” ===
By R.C. Lehmann:

:''Once on a dim and dream-like shore'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Half seen, half recollected,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''I thought I met a human oar'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Ideally perfected.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''To me at least he seemed a man'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Like any of our neighbours,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Formed on the self-same sort of plan'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''For high aquatic labours.'' &lt;br&gt;

:''His simple raiment took my eyes:'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''No fancy duds he sported,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''He had his rather lengthy thighs'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Exiguously “shorted.”'' &lt;br&gt;


:''A scarf about his neck he threw;'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''A zephyr hid his torso;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''He looked as much a man as you --'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Perhaps a trifle more so.'' &lt;br&gt;

:''And yet I fancy you’ll agree,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''When his description’s ended,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''No merely mortal thing could be'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''So faultlessly commended.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''I noted down with eager hand'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''The points that mark his glory;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''So grant me your attention, and'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''I’ll set them out before ye.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''His hands are ever light to catch;'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Their swiftness is astounding:'' &lt;br&gt;
:''No billiard ball could pass or match'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''The pace of their rebounding.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Then, joyfully released and gay,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''And graceful as Apollo’s,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''With what a fine columnar sway'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''His balanced body follows!'' &lt;br&gt;


:''He keeps his sturdy legs applied'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Just where he has been taught to,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And always moves his happy slide'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Precisely as he ought to.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''He owns a wealth of symmetry'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Which nothing can diminish,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And strong men shout for joy to see'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''His wonder working finish.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''He never rows his stroke in dabs --'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''A fatal form of sinning --'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And never either catches crabs'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Or misses the beginning.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Against his ship the storm winds blow,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''And every lipper frets her:'' &lt;br&gt;
:''He hears the cox cry, “Let her go!”'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''And swings and drives and lets her.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Besides, he has about his knees,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''His feet, his wrists, his shoulders,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Some points which make him work with ease'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''And fascinate beholders.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''He is, in short, impeccable,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''And -- this perhaps is oddest'' &lt;br&gt;
:''In one who rows and looks so well --'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''He is supremely modest.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''He always keeps his language cool,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Nor stimulates its vigour'' &lt;br&gt;
:''In face of some restrictive rule'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Of dietary rigour.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''And when the other men annoy'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''With trivial reproaches,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''He is the Captain’s constant joy,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''The comfort of his coaches.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''When grumblers call the rowing vile,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Or growl about the weather,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''Our Phoenix smiles a cheerful smile'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''And keeps his crew together.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''No “hump” is his -- when everything'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Looks black his zeal grows stronger,'' &lt;br&gt;
:''And makes his temper, like his swing,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Proportionately longer.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''One aim is his through weeks of stress: --'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''By each stroke rowed to aid work.'' &lt;br&gt;
:''No facile sugared prettiness'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''Impairs his swirling blade-work.'' &lt;br&gt;


:''And, oh, it makes the pulses go'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''A thousand to the minute'' &lt;br&gt;
:''To see the man sit down and row'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''A ding-dong race and win it!'' &lt;br&gt;


:''Such was, and is, the perfect oar,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''A sort of river Prince, Sirs;'' &lt;br&gt;
:''I never met the man before,'' &lt;br&gt;
:	''And never saw him since, Sirs.'' &lt;br&gt;


:Yet still, I think, he moves his blade, &lt;br&gt;
:	As grand in style, or grander, &lt;br&gt;
:As Captain of some Happy-Shade &lt;br&gt;
:	Elysian Leander.{{note|Lehmann2}} &lt;br&gt;

      <comment>/* Some Terrific Poetry Books to Check Out */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
Poetry is easy to recognize but hard to define.  Let's start with Webster's definition, &quot;The art of rhythmical composition, written or spoken, for exciting pleasure by beautiful, imaginative, or elevated thoughts.&quot;  As lovely as that sounds, it may already say too much about this unique and unpredictable art form.  Rhythm is important, perhaps the only element in poetry we can truly count on.  Rhymes are optional, but some sort of rhythm to the reading of quality poetry will always almost exist.  We can experience poetry through our eyes or our ears.  It is usually meant to excite pleasure but it can also reflect sorrow or regret; meaningful but not necessarily pleasurable.  That brings us to &quot;beautiful, imaginative, or elevated thoughts.&quot;  Poetry often contains these things, but sometimes it can just be silly and simple.  So, while Webster's Dictionary defines poetry in words far better than I could have come up with, it still may not include the full picture of what poetry is.

==Types of Poetry==
There are many types of poems and more types are just waiting to be invented.  Maybe you or your children will be the ones to create a whole new style of poetry.

===Acrostic===
You write one word vertically and use the letters in that word as the first word in words you write horizontally.  This is a fairly easy type of poem for kids to create and they can use their own name as the starting word or another word that they want to tell about.

===Cinquain===
These poems have five lines.  The first and last lines are the same single word which will be the title (the last line could be a variation of the word).  The second line is two words that describe the title.  The third line is three words long and includes an action.  The fourth line is four words long and express a feeling.  These are also relatively simple poems for students to create and again they can use their own names for the titles.

===Haiku===
Usually about nature, this style from Japan consists of three unrhymed lines.  The first and last line contain five syllables and the middle line has seven syllables.  These are easy in theory to fill in the syllables, but it can be hard for the students to actually make them meaningful.

===Free verse===
There is no fixed pattern and it can, but does not have to, use rhyming words.

===Lyric===
Lyric poems focus on feelings and visualizations rather than on a story.

===Narrative===
Narrative poems tell a story.


While the structured style of Cinquains, Acrostic, and Haiku are easier to teach and have students replicate, there is more creativity, choice, and excitement (to my mind) when you can lead your students to free verse, lyric, or narrative poetry.

==What Should We Do With Poetry?==
Poetry should not be a chore.  If kids have to memorize and recite a poem the teacher selects or determine the underlying meaning of a poem according to their teacher's interpretations, poetry ceases to be fun.  Like anything else, kids need to explore poetry.  They should be exposed to poetry, in many different forms, throughout the year.  It should not just be part of a special poetry unit that we then leave completely behind.  Poetry is great for transition times or when you finish something with just a few minutes to spare.  

&quot;Poetry needs to be performed and dramatized.  Take some chances and try out different effects (using different voices, elongating words, singing, shouting, whispering, pausing dramatically, and so on) as you read poems aloud.  Your voice is a powerful tool: You may change it from louder to softer to only a whisper; you may start at a deep, low pitch and rise to a medium and eventually high pitch; you may speak very quickly in a clipped fashion and then slow down and drawl out the words.&quot;  (Lynch-Brown/Tomlinson: Essentials of Children's Literature. p.70)

Have students find a poem they love and share with the class.  As teachers or parents, we can create lots of opportunities to share poems we like and think our children will like, but kids should have that opportunity as well.  Let them read a poem to the class that is special to them.  Let kids discover their own meanings in poetry and discuss those meanings without making them conform to an understood critical meaning.  Some poems would lend themselves well to having the students act them out.  Kids need to discover that poetry can be sweet or silly, short or long, fun, thoughtful, or personal.  It can have more than one voice. Help them find connections to their lives.  Tie poetry in to other areas.  You could introduce a Science lesson by reading a related poem.  

When you are ready for children to create their own poetry, make sure you have introduced them to several different forms and then let children choose a style to create their poem in.  Have fun!  If you do not enjoy poetry, try some different kinds.  Keep looking until you find something you like and then expand upon that.  If you yourself are not excited about the poems you are reading, it will show through to the children and they will have little reason to get excited themselves.

==Selecting High Quality Poetry Books==
The best way to tell if you have a good poetry book is simply to try it out.  Read a few poems.  Most poems are relatively short and it doesn't take long to read a few.  Don't just read the first couple poems, flip to the middle and the back too.  Do you like them?  Do they make you smile, laugh, or cry?  If you can't answer yes to any of those questions, you probably want to find another book.  

Poetry should sound good when it is read aloud.  It should have a rhythm to it.  It should use language that is interesting and non-repetitive unless the repetition serves a strong and effective purpose.  Because poetry can exist for so many reasons, the use of language is hard to define into one set criteria.  It might be beautiful, flowing language with impressive words or it might be cute, simple words that are fun.  

Illustrations can be a terrific added bonus, but you can find good poetry without illustrations (or with mediocre illustrations).  

There is so much freedom with poetry, it doesn't have to be accurate or realistic unless it claims or implies that it is.  When you are dealing with real people or places in a realistic way, then poetry has the same obligation that other genres have in providing accurate details.  It also has an obligation, as does all literature, to avoid harmful stereotypes (culture, gender, disabilities, etc.).  

If you simply don't know where to start, try some of the books I recommend below - or ask a librarian, a teacher, or a friend.  Someone will be glad to help get you started.  Once you've begun, follow authors you love and seek out more of their work.  

==Reaching Out to Boys==
I wrote this poem to address the reluctance of boys when it comes to poetry and how we, as teachers or parents, can overcome this problem and show even little boys the pleasures of poetry.  The work of Jack Prelutsky is one great way to penetrate the guarded shell that boys may have put up and offer them images far from what they expected to find in poetry, such as the fantastically awful beings that inhabit ''Monday's Troll'' and ''The Dragons Are Singing Tonight'' (both of which are referenced in the poem).


==Some Terrific Poetry Books to Check Out==

===''Rainy Day Poems===
2012.  Poems and artwork by James McDonald.  A fantastic collection of new poems from a relatively obscure poet whose first foray into the published word has released a collection of poems revolving around the adventures of two kids, Sami and Thomas, that take place in the Pacific Northwest.  Other books by James McDonald are: Through the Milky Way on a PB&amp;J.


===''Monday's Troll''===
1996.  Poems by Jack Prelutsky.  Pictures by Peter Sís.  This is my favorite book by Prelutsky.  It begins and ends with great poems about wizards and there are all kinds of delightfully dreadful creatures in between.  He uses some great language in this book.  &quot;I escalated my harangue, and blared triumphantly.&quot;  These are advanced words that many poets would leave out of children's poetry, but it will sound great to kids and they may even add some very impressive words to their vocabulary along the way.  Other Prelutsky books I highly recommend: ''The Dragons Are Singing Tonight'', ''The Gargoyle on the Roof'', ''Tyrannosaurus Was a Beast''.

===''A Light in the Attic''===
1981.  Poems and drawings by Shel Silverstein.  Silverstein's popular work is loaded with small, silly, fun poems.  Some are fabulous and you'll pick your favorites.  My favorites include ''Nobody'', ''Messy Room'', and ''Homework Machine'', as well as the sweet introduction to sign language ''Deaf Donald''.  There will be other poems you are less fond of, but there are so many great ones, you'll ignore the occasional dud. Silverstein's ''Where the Sidewalk Ends'' is another terrific collection very much like this one.

===''Casey at the Bat: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888''===
2000.  Poem by Ernest L. Thayer.  Illustrated by Christopher Bing.  This poem originally appeared in the San Francisco Examiner in 1888 and is a treasure in and of itself.  Christopher Bing, however, has enriched the poem with spectacular illustrations in the style of newspaper clippings of the day with terrific details scattered throughout.  Christopher Bing also does a magnificent job of illustrating ''The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere'' by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

===''If Pigs Could Fly... And Other Deep Thoughts''===
2000.  Poems by Bruce Lansky.  Illustrated by Stephen Carpenter.  A terrific collection of fun poems that will leave you smiling.  ''I Like My Nose'' is a terrific little poem about what would happen if our noses were upside down.  ''What I'd Cook For My Teacher'' would be a fun treat for kids to hear.  ''Out of Control'', where the TV station keeps getting switched after a quick catchphrase, would be so much fun reading in parts - in fact, I plan to try that tomorrow.  (I have now tried it twice, with 3rd and 5th graders, and it worked splendidly both times, exciting both the performers and the audience).

===''Insectlopedia''===
1998.  Poems and paintings by Douglas Florian.  Really cool poems all about bugs with great illustrations.  Highlights include ''The Hornet'', ''The Whirligig Beetles'', and ''The Army Ants''.

What is Realistic Fiction?  Realistic Fiction books are those that have plots, characters, and settings that could be found in real life but the stories are fiction (not true).  Realistic Fiction is divided into two parts: '''historical''' and '''contemporary''' fiction.  '''Historical''' fiction takes place in a time remote enough to be considered history, rather than '''contemporary''' fiction which takes place today or in the recent past.

== Criteria for Realistic Fiction ==
We have found '''8''' important criteria for finding a high quality Realistic Fiction book.  Along with some of the criteria there is a suggestion for a Realistic Fiction book.

#Must grab the reader's attention and/or interest with a good beginning that introduces the action and characters in an enticing way.  '''Suggestion:''' '''''Taking Sides by: Gary Soto''''' which is a story about Lincoln Mendoza, an aspiring basketball player, who must come to terms with his divided loyalties when he moves from the Hispanic inner city to a suburban neighborhood.
#Must be something the reader can relate to such as friendships, family life, school, or childhood.  '''Suggestion:''' '''''Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret by: Judy Blume''''' which is about a girl who is faced with difficulties of childhood and choosing a religion.
#Must give the reader a strong connection to the characters.  '''Suggestion:''' '''''Dear Mr. Henshaw by: Beverly Cleary''''' which is a story about a boy named Leigh who deals with his problems of coping with his parents' divorce, being in a new school, and finding his own place in the world.
#Must have a good and complete ending but not predictable.  '''Suggestion:''' '''''Because of Winn Dixie by: Kate Dicamillo''''' which is a heart-touching story about a girl and her dog.
#Must have characters that behave and express themselves as real children.  '''Suggestion:''' '''''On My Honor by: Marion Dane Bauer''''' which is a story about two boys swimming in a dangerous river and one accidentally drowns.
#Must have a theme with an underlying idea that ties the plot, characters, and settings together.
#Must have a style that helps develop the plot and bring the characters to life.
#Must help the reader expand his or her imagination and stimulate feelings.

== Types of Realistic Fiction ==
There are many types of Realistic Fiction: Coming of Age/Friendship, Death and Deadly Disease, Dysfunctional Families, Foster/Adoptive Families, Mental/Psychiatric illness, Novels in Poetry Form, School Stories, Survival, and Documentary.  These types of Realistic Fiction are explained more at this website: http://www.haworth.org/realistic.html

== Boys vs. Girls Reading ==
When a story has an interesting plot in the framework, it is easy to involve the students in the plot.  We can ask them to add dialogue to the beginning, middle, and end of the story.  Children's first response to a story is usually a personal one from an experience.  There are a difference in preference of stories between boys and girls.  Boys like to read about sports, humor, mysteries, or adventure.  While girls tend to read about fantasy, animals, and stories about people.  Using Realistic Fiction can help teachers or parents engage both girls and boys.  There is a book that can help teachers and parents find more information on engaging both girls and boys into reading: [http://books.google.com/books?id=N-yLkjegTYwC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=types+of+books+for+girls+vs+boys&amp;sig=32rlEwoxRyea]

Authors: Kim Rice &amp; [[User:LinChiehHuang]](黃麟傑)

In the past, children’s books generally treated minority groups badly or ignored them completely (Tunnell, M., &amp; Jacobs, S., 2008, p.192). In the 1960’s-1970’s, Children’s libraries were supported by federal government. This encouraged publishers to produce many ethnic groups’ books (Huck, C., &amp; Hepler, S., &amp; Hickman, J., &amp; Kiefer, B., 1997, p.123). Banks (1979) stated that &quot;It would be difficult to pinpoint its origin, but it may be safe to assume that the term multicultural literature came after the advent of the multicultural education movement in the 1960s&quot; (As cited in Dyson &amp; Genishi, 1994, p.57). In 1965, Nancy Larrick wrote “The All White World of Children’s Books” to report almost no African Americans appeared in any of America’s children’s books. People began to recognize and include African Americans and other minority groups in the books (Tunnell, M., &amp; Jacobs, S., 2008, p.192). In 1966, the Council on Interracial Books for Children (CIBC) was founded. CIBC encourages authors to write about their own cultures. In 1969, the American Library Association (ALA) gave the Coretta Scott King Award to excellent African American writers and illustrators (Tunnell, M., &amp; Jacobs, S., 2008, p.192). In 1974, the National Council for the Social Studies gave the Carter G. Woodson Award to excellent minority and race children’s books  (Tunnell, M., &amp; Jacobs, S., 2008, p.192). In 1985 only 18 books were eligible for the Coretta Scott King Award (Huck, C., &amp; Hepler, S., &amp; Hickman, J., &amp; Kiefer, B., 1997, p.123). In the last decade, multicultural literature has begun to flourish. Nowadays, multiculturalism is a big issue. Understanding multicultural issues is important. Banks (1991) stated “By the year 2020, one of every two students in the United States will be a person of color” (As cited in Dietrich &amp; Ralph, 1995). Dietrich &amp; Ralph (1995, p.1) stated that “educators should help students explore their own cultures and contribute to intercultural understanding.”

==Criteria for Selecting High Quality Multicultural Literature==

 
=== Multicultural Mix...Shaken and Stirred ===
I believe the most important guiding principle when choosing multicultural literature for students is to make a selection that will allow the reader to see the world through the character's perspective. Our students may be blessed with a variety of different looking people with diverse backgrounds: racial, religious and economic, but many of our students know little of others, for they know little of themselves or their families. They are fortunate if they know of their own cultural heritage.
Multicultural literature is of untold value to those with lack of experience. When students have been labeled &quot;language delayed&quot; perhaps they have only been experience deprived. With multicultural literature we have the opportunity as educators to bring the experience of others different from ourselves to be shared among a host of many. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) provides a wonderful resource entitled ''Anti-Bias Curriculum Tools for Empowering Young Children. ''This can be an invaluable resource to assist teachers and parents alike in the proper selection of quality, authentic multicultural children's literature.'' ''The children's lists within this volume naturally help to build and scaffold students' understanding in a variety of subject areas. It's important that we as educators locate literature that emphasizes different points of view and multicultural literature can easily provide this.''
Multicultural literature allows students to make their own connections for instance when studying holidays. Students come to recognize that we don't all share the same beliefs, traditions or holiday celebrations. With respect, we can honor one another's cultural roots and customs and value one another as we celebrate one another's differences.
Multicultural literature instills compassion and empathy in young and old readers. For instance, during a Civil War study it would be crucial to use a variety of literature to provide sympathy for runaway slaves: ''Barefoot'', ''Aunt Harriet's Underground Railroad in the Sky'',  ''Minty'', ''Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt'', ''Freedom River'', ''Follow the Drinking Gourd'', ''Nettie's Trip South'', ''Henry's Freedom Box''. ''Mr. Lincoln's Whiskers'' provides a perspective of America when women did not have the right to vote which opens up discussions and extended readings about Susan B. Anthony and even Harriet Tubman's suffragist constribution.

===Look For Accuracy===
Why is accuracy in multicultural literature important?

If the author wrote wrong information about that culture, it may lead readers to distort other cultures and have stereotypes. Agosto (2002, p.1) stated, “Accuracy of cultural representation is a crucial aspect of high quality multicultural literature.” Shioshita (1997, p.1) stated that books must have current, correct information, be careful of not reinforcing stereotypes, and use actual language in books. Harris (1993,p.50) also stated, &quot;Information should be factual and up-to-date.&quot; In other words, an accurate multicultural book must give readers the right information about other cultures. When readers understand other people who live in the world have some similarities with them, they do not have xenophobia anymore. “A good multicultural book must avoid racial and cultural stereotyping” (Tunnell, M., &amp; Jacobs, S., 2008, p.190). 

As teachers, we can evaluate accuracy as follows:
*Are those non-English words written or translated accurately?
*Does the author describe other cultures accurately (food, clothing, customs, religious beliefs, history, and holidays)?

===Look For The Language of Both The Author and The Fictional Characters===
*Background Knowledge
Having cultural background knowledge to write multicultural books is important, because insufficient cultural background knowledge can make writers write a distorted multicultural book. Agosto (2002, p.1) stated that multicultural writers must have enough background knowledge to write. Dietrich &amp; Ralph (1995, p.2) stated that “Accurate background information prevents the students’ prejudices and stereotypes from coloring the text.” Shioshita (1997, p.2) stated, “Some people believe that writers should belong to the cultures they describe; others believe that it’s enough if writers empathize with members of a culture even though writing from an outsider’s point of view.” “The authors can be outsider of that culture, but they must understand the culture very well and write with an accurate voice” (Tunnell, M., &amp; Jacobs, S., 2008, p.190). 

As teachers, we can evaluate cultural background knowledge by checking the author’s website or autobiography and see if the author comes from the same culture in which the book is written or the author has some experiences traveling to that country. We can also ask people who come from the same culture of the book to read and judge whether it is a good book or not before we read it to students.

*Language/Terminology
Harris (1993, p.50) stated, &quot;In light of the history of racism,offensive terms such as brutal, conniving, primitive, savage, and backward, should be avoided as descriptors of people of color. Writers should also avoid terms such as shacks, superstitions, and costumes, that would be offensive were they applied to their own homes, religious beliefs, or everyday wearing apparel.&quot;

===Look For Value (Respect)===
The world is parallel. People should value and respect each other. The writers who write multicultural books must value and respect the different culture they are going to write about. Agosto (2002, p.2) stated, “Creators of multicultural literature should exhibit respect for the cultures they portray.” Newling (1997, p.1) stated, “It has to be done respectfully” (As cited in Shioshita). People may mistrust, fear, or hate other people who are unlike them (Tunnell, M., &amp; Jacobs, S., 2008, p.189). “The character of the book must represent members of cultural minorities and must have their own set of personal values, attitudes, and beliefs and must present a positive image” (Tunnell, M., &amp; Jacobs, S., 2008, p.190). Kruse and Horning (1991, p.9) state, &quot;High standards must be applied to the evaluation of all books, as always. Evaluation criteria must always make room for any book to be valued for what it is, for the way in which it is unique, and for what it contributes...&quot; (As cited in Harris, Violet. J).

As teachers, we can evaluate value as follows:
Harris (1993, p.51) stated, &quot;Put yourself in the place of the child reader. Is there anything in the book that would embarrass or offend you...if so, choose a different book.&quot;

===Look For Quality Theme (Setting)===
A quality theme is the soul of a multicultural literature book. Booth (1996) stated, “This type of literature describes a variety of ethnic backgrounds and racial characteristics that discuss themes applicable across cultures” (As cited in De Leon, 2002, p.50). Dietrich &amp; Ralph (1995, p.2) stated that “Multicultural literature offers opportunities for personal reflection and identification with many cultures.” Shioshita (1997, p.1) stated that accurate setting is important for books and authors should offer multiple perspectives.”

==Benefits of Reading Multicultural Literature==
===Multicultural Literature Helps Readers Be Themselves and Respect Others===

Diamond &amp; Moore, (1995, p.13) stated, &quot;Multicultural literature further heightens understanding,respect, and affirmation of differences because it acknowledges that it is alright to be who you are.&quot; Royce (2006, p.33) stated that reading multicultural literature about their own culture can help minority children increase self-esteem and help majority children know people who are different from them. “Multicultural literature helps children identify with their own culture, exposes children to other cultures, and opens the dialogue on issues regarding diversity” (Colby, S. A., &amp; Lyon, F. 2004, p.24). De Leon (2002) stated that adolescents are interested in novels which talk about their own culture and these novels make them more open to others.

===Teachers and Students both Benefit from Reading Multicultural Literature===
Davis, Brown and Liedel-Rice (2005, p.176) stated, “Teacher candidates can understand differences through multicultural literature reading.” Dietrich &amp; Ralph, (1995, p.1) stated, “When multicultural literature becomes an integral part of the curriculum and teachers act as models and guides, classrooms can become arenas for open exchange.”

===Multicultural Literature Constructs Children's Version of the Truth===
Children often see other's perspective through characters who are their age. After children see these multicultural characters suffering from social injustice, they will make a decision to redress social injustice. Diamond &amp; Moore, (1995, p.14) stated, &quot;Once students understand the harmful effects of social injustice and inequities, they can make informed and rational decisions about the most effective ways to correct injustices in their community.&quot;

===Multicultural Literature Prepares Children for a Future in an Increasingly Multicultural World===
The world demographic is quickly becoming more diverse and Multicultural Literature provides an excellent opportunity to teach and understand compassion and cultural understanding. In order to combat racisim and break down cultural barriers, literature provides the perfect vehicle to inspire and educate children in understanding the benefits of cultural diversity. Multicultural Literature provides children the tools to live, work and participate for the future in an increasingly multicultural world.        

==Excellent Multicultural Literature Examples==

===*''My Name Is Maria Isabel''===

''My Name Is Maria Isabel'' by Alma Flor Ada is an excellent example of multicultural literature. In this story many important topics are dealt with delicately and admirably. One's given name is very important for one's family has chosen it in memory or honor of someone or some occasion and one's name should remain special and honored for what it is. The author Alma Flor Ada had the misfortune of having a teacher Anglosize her name and she based this story on some of her childhood recollections. This book also deals with the diversity of religious celebrations: Christmas and Hannukah and how the main character was drawn to customs and culture different from her own. Maria Isabel is intrigued by Hannukah, the story of Amahl and the Night Visitors, dreidels and latkes. Maria becomes more confident in herself and demands to be addressed by her given name of Maria Isabel Salazar Lopez and not Mary.

=== *''The Funny Little Woman'' ===
In Japan, a funny little woman who liked to laugh, &quot;Tee-HE-HE-HE&quot; liked to make dumplings out of rice. One day, when she was making a rice dumpling, the rice dumpling rolled and fell to the floor. She followed her dumpling and tried to catch it and encountered many Japanese Onis or evil demons. Onis caught her and asked her to make rice dumplings for them. One day, she looked to the right and left and saw no Onis there. She escaped and went back to her house.

=== *''The Snowy Day'' ===
Peter, an African-American boy, woke up and found out it was snowing outside. He ran outside and made a snowman, and snow angels. He loved snow, so he picked up a handful of snow to make a snow ball and put it in his pocket for tomorrow. Unfortunately, the snowball was gone when he checked his pocket before he went to bed. He was upset and went to sleep. He dreamed that the winter was gone. He woke up and found out snow was still everywhere. He was so happy.

=== The Snowy Day Activities === 
Ask students some questions before reading ''The Snowy Day'': 
“Have you played in the snow?”
“Have you made a snow man?”


Ask students some questions after reading ''The Snowy Day'':
Where do you think Peter lives? 
What do you think when Peter knew he wasn't old enough to join the snowball fight? 
What is something you will do when you are old enough? 
What do you think Peter and his friend will do in the snow?


Activity One: Footprints 
“When Peter walked through the snow, he left footprints. 
A teacher provides a snow scene with a variety of different animal footprints in it. 
Then, the teacher makes patterns of the animals which would make the prints.
Have your students match the print to the animal. (The Snowy Day. 2000).”

&quot;Literature serves an important function in our society, for children shape their reality about themselves and others based on much of what they read. Students' attitudes, values, and beliefs are influenced by children's literature&quot; (As cited in Diamond, B.J., &amp; Moore, M.A. 1995, p. 11). Young (2004) gave a clear description of traditional literature in the introduction to the book ''Happily Ever After: Sharing Folk Literature With Elementary and Middle School Students'':

{{cquote|Also known as traditional literature, folk literature is essentially the canon of tales or stories of a people, passed down orally through many generations. Folklore referring to a variety of oral lore including greetings, jokes, remedies, stories, etc. emerges from the folk, or grass roots, culture and becomes folk literature when it is recorded in written form. (p. 2)}}

[[File:Waterhouse decameron.jpg|255px|thumb|Tales circulated orally.]]
Traditional literature:
* was transmitted from one generation to another through oral storytelling 
* was narrated mostly
* had no identified authors
* explained the origin of natural events and reveals the social, political, and spiritual beliefs of society 

Traditional literature includes these features:
* Short plots
* Concentrated and fast paced action, which adds interest
* Two-dimensional characters that could easily be identified as either good or bad
* Unimportant setting
* Limited themes, such as good vs. evil and right vs. wrong
* Happy endings

Young (2004) also indicated that &quot;traditional literature has served to educate listeners/readers about the creation of the world, the history of its people, and the moral values a particular culture holds dear&quot; (p. 5). Such &quot;oral history&quot; and &quot;oral deed&quot; was a corridor, which enabled people to get to know the cultures of various foreign countries or tribes. In the past, traditional stories were once presented to adult (and sometimes child) audiences, but they have become a major part of children's literature during the 19th and 20th centuries. Some of the stories' content, however, involved crude humor and sexual implications. The criterion for selecting a traditional tale might depend on the reader or audience who would be enjoying the tale. As a prerequisite, it would be wise to consider the age and appropriateness of the content for the reader or audience.

==Criteria for Selecting Traditional Literature==

According to Donna E. Norton (2007, p. 212 and 253-254), traditional literature should be enjoyable to the reader and the following criteria should be considered:

* the ages, interests, and prior knowledge of the reader
* the amount of text written in the tale and the attention span of the reader
* the traditional literature features, including a satisfying ending
* the writing stays true to the oral storytelling style
* helps the reader understand the world and its cultural traditions
* displays the connections between various types of stories around the world (i.e. Cinderella tales)
* teaches appreciation of culture and art from different countries
* portrays the culture accurately and not stereotypically
* uses dialects and languages of different countries
* inspires creativity through artistic expression (i.e. drama, writing, art, etc.)
* acknowledges the goodness, compassion, bravery and the human struggles of people from other countries
* author's note was included at the beginning or the end with more information about the tale and its culture

==Types of Traditional Literature==
Listed below are the common types of traditional literature:

===Folktales===

[[File:Bremer Stadtmusikanten.jpg|right|180px|thumb|The Bremen Town Musicians.]]
Folktales, literally, were the tales of the folk. Folktales were understandable light literature, which flew orally from the general public. Folktales were divided into several categories. This was a brief introduction of a few that were presented from [http://www.story-lovers.com/listsfolktaletypes.html Types of Folktales.]

* Cumulative tale - repetitive tales that were added on to as the story progressed (i.e. [http://www.topmarks.co.uk/stories/gingerbread.htm ''The Gingerbread Man''])
* Pourquoi tale - tale used to explain why animals or humans have certain characteristic (i.e. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Mosquitoes_Buzz_in_People%27s_Ears ''Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears''])
* Beast tale&lt;br&gt;
* Trickster tale&lt;br&gt;
* Noddlehead, and numbskull tale&lt;br&gt;
* Realistic tale - tales based on an actual historical event or figure in history (i.e. [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault03.html ''Blue Beard''])
* Fairy tale
[[File:Barbebleue.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Bluebeard, illustration by Gustave Doré.]]

[http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/grimm-brothers/ The Grimm Brothers,] Jacob (1785 – 1863), and Wilhelm Grimm (1786 – 1859), were both well-known linguists in Germany and famous for collecting fairy tales and folktales. Their household tales such as [http://oaks.nvg.org/grimmtales1-2.html#bremenmusicians ''The Bremen Town-Musicians,''] [http://oaks.nvg.org/grimmtales41-42.html#rapunzel ''Rapunzel,''] and [http://oaks.nvg.org/grimmtales43-44.html#hanselgrethel ''Hansel and Grethel''] were diffused worldwide.

Another collector of some of the more popular traditional tales, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrault Charles Perrault,] preceded the Grimm Brothers by collecting French folktales and modifying them to be appropriate for the aristocratic French courts. According to Lydie Jean (2007), his modified tales were unique because Perrault &quot;remade a popular style by keeping the structure of the stories and some typical phrases, and he created a sense of belonging with intellectuals and aristocrats by using precious vocabulary and respecting the requirements of the salons fairy tale writing&quot; (p. 279). In other words, Perrault was able to bridge the enjoyment of several classes of French society without directly offending each class. Jean (2007) mentioned that &quot;his success was quite uncommon: fairy tales were usually not popular among the lower classes&quot; (p. 278), which preferred the vulgarity of traditional tales. Some of his well-known retellings were [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html#perrault ''Little Red Riding Hood,''] [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault01.html ''The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood,''] and  [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault03.html''Blue Beard.'']
  
An excellent example of a folktale that met the high quality criteria of traditional literature was [http://bhberger.com/childrens-books/all-the-way-to-lhasa-a-tale-from-tibet/''All the Way to Lhasa: A Tale from Tibet''] retold by Barbara Helen Berger. This tale was a simple story about a boy traveling to the holy city and finally reaching it. The small amount of text in this story might help readers with short attention spans focus on the story at hand.

===Tall Tales===
Tall tales were unique to American folk literature because the characters were based on historical figures or folk heroes who were just as '''EXAGGERATED''' as the situations they were put in. Most of the characters were usually larger than life and their occupations were included within the tall tales to further define the characters' traits. Two famous characters were [http://www.americanfolklore.net/pecosbill.html ''Pecos Bill''] and [http://www.americanfolklore.net/paulbunyan.html ''Paul Bunyan.'']

Reminiscent of Paul Bunyan, [http://www.patmora.com/books/dona-flor/ ''Doňa Flor: A Tall Tale About a Giant Woman with a Great Big Heart''] by Pat Mora, was about a giant woman who helped her neighbors and the surrounding animals with her big heart and physical strength. These similarities among tall tale characters displayed connections between various types of stories around the world, in accordance with the criteria for traditional literature listed above.

===Fables===
Fables were short, brief stories that were intended to teach a moral lesson. Talking animals were featured as having human characteristics in these stories. [http://www.umass.edu/aesop/index.php ''Aesop's Fables''] are the best-known fables.

Jerry Pinkney's rendition of fables, [http://www.omart.org/exhibitions/jerry-pinkney-aesops-fables ''Aesop's Fables,''] was an example of high quality children's literature. Each fable was one page in length and was accompanied with a picture and simplified moral.

Other sample such as  [http://chinese.dsturgeon.net/text.pl?node=2852&amp;if=en The Tree on the Mountain] was the 17th book embodied in [http://chinese.dsturgeon.net/text.pl?node=2714&amp;if=en Outer Chapters] of a Chinese Taoist ancient book, [http://chinese.dsturgeon.net/text.pl?node=2712&amp;if=en ''Zhuangzi.''] The story was about the Tao philosopher, Zhuangzi, and his followers as they attempt to understand two dilemmas: a tree remained uncut by a woodcutter because its wood was good for nothing, but a goose was killed because it could not cackle like the other geese. In other words, the  tree on the mountain was seen as '''worthless''' to the woodcutter and therefore remained living, whereas the goose who couldn't cackle was useless to the host and therefore '''worth''' killing for dinner. As a result of these dilemmas, Zhuangzi explained that it was wise to avoid  stereotypes or subjectivity when making decisions/judgments. Zhuangzi, who was good at writing apologues (allegorical narratives with morals) and seizing every chance to convey his philosophical thinking, related his explanations to the Tao and its Attributes.

===Ballads===
A ballad was a folk rhyme told in song form about a sad death, a tragic romance, or a stirring and dramatic adventure of a hero. Some examples were: [http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.html ''The Iliad''] and [http://www.lone-star.net/literature/beowulf/ ''Beowulf.'']

A good example of a ballad is the book [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog_Went_A-Courtin%27_%28book%29 ''Frog Went A-Courtin'''] retold by John Langstaff. It originated in Scotland hundreds of years ago and it has no author. This ballad was sung or told to children from generation to generation.

===Epics===
Partitioned into [http://english.tjc.edu/greekromanepic/origins.htm The Folk Epic and the Literary Epic,] epics were long narratives in verse form that told about the adventure of a hero or some historical events. In some classification systems, an epic was a sub-category of a myth, such as [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/homer/ody/ody00.htm ''The Odyssey''] and [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/homer/ili/ili00.htm ''The Iliad.''] These major ancient Greek epic poems were created by [http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~tliv/bioe.html Homer,] a legendary ancient Greek blind poet.

One of the more popular epics, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/homer/ili/ili00.htm ''The Iliad,''] has been retold by several authors in order to make it accessible to readers of every age. It was, however, more difficult to find a version where the author's writing stays true to the oral storytelling style.  Rosemary Sutcliff's retelling, [http://books.google.com/books?id=KbRyuXfTHvQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=Black+Ships+Before+Troy:+The+Story+of+the+Iliad ''Black Ships Before Troy: The Story of the Iliad,''] included aspects of the original epic's verses and metaphors throughout the book, which reflected the oral storytelling style. For example, Sutcliff (1993) included, &quot;In the high and far off days when men were heroes and walked with the gods,....&quot; (p. 6).

===Myths===
A myth is a sacred story from an ancient time. It explained people's origins and beliefs of the universe and of life, or the culture's moral values in human terms. Myths also included the powers that control the human world and the relationship between those powers and human beings. [http://www.pantheon.org/articles/a/atlantis.html ''Atlantis: the Myth''] was a famed example. Although Greek, Roman, and Norse myths were some of the most famous myths, other myths from around the world had similar attributes. For example, the characters, in general, were gods and goddesses observing human life from a setting that was high above earth.

A collection of myths called [http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Childrens-Book-of-Myths-and-Legends/Ronne-Randall/e/9780760725429 ''The Children's Book of Myths and Legends: Extraordinary Stories from Around the World''] retold by Ronne Randall, related to the criteria of teaching appreciation for different countries. Throughout the book, myths (and legends) from many countries were categorized based on the origins, beliefs, and adventures of different cultures (i.e. tales of creation and death, etc.). These comparisons might help the reader gain a greater understanding and appreciation of different countries' myths.

===Legends===
A legend was a saga that concerned people, places, and events from the past. They were usually about a saint, a historic hero, or a major incident that was based on either a true historical happening or associated with a particular place and time in history; for instance, [http://www.arthurian-legend.com/ ''Arthurian Legend''] and [http://www.cariwave.com/eldorado.htm ''The Story of El Dorado.'']

''The Two Mountains: An Aztec Legend'' retold by Eric A. Kimmel, was about a god and goddess who fall in love while disobeying their parents' wishes. The couple was married but they defied a sacred promise, which caused them to become mortal and bound to the earth as two mountains for eternity. This legend's descriptions provided the reader with a greater understanding of the world by reflecting the cultural traditions (and beliefs) of the Nahua people (who were the descendants of the Aztecs).

===Religious Stories===
Most people did not like to classify religious stories with traditional literature because it insinuates that these stories were fictionalized, like myths, and denounced religion. However, religious tales did have features of traditional literature. According to Tunnell and Jacobs (2000), religious tales involved a &quot;human's quest to discover and share with one another the truth concerning the spiritual aspects of existence&quot; (p. 72), which were first told through oral storytelling. Some examples of religious tales were [http://www.bhagavad-gita.us/ ''The Bhagavad Gita - The Divine Song of God''] and [http://scriptures.lds.org/ot/contents/ ''The Old Testament.''] Also, tales associated with religious celebrations and holidays were considered religious stories, such as the Christmas story of [http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=164 ''La Befana''] from Italy.

[http://www.angelahuntbooks.com/books/tale-of-three-trees/''The Tale of Three Trees: A Traditional Folktale''] retold by Angela Elwell Hunt, was about three trees who grew up to become the lumber used to create the manger, the fishing boat, and the cross for Jesus Christ. The third tree, which became the cross, discovered that God's love was more powerful than hatred and this  gives strength to His Christian followers. Although this religious tale discussed the hardships Jesus Christ encountered on the cross, the features of traditional literature were present and did include a satisfying ending for its readers.

===Cinderella Tales===
[http://www.readyed.com.au/Sites/extra/cintales.htm Cinderella Tales] were types of fairy tales that shared characteristics and motifs with hundreds of other versions from around the world. Some of the shared similarities were:

{| style=&quot;width:82%; height:35px&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|Elements
|Characteristics
|-
|'''Three Daughters/Sisters'''
|two were deceitful and envious and often conspired against the third
|-
|'''The Youngest Daughter'''
|was usually the third daughter/sister who was passive and displayed kindness and honesty, which matched her beauty
|-
|'''Terrible Mother'''
|was cruel, irrational, jealous, and was portrayed as the mother, stepmother, witch, or queen
|-
|'''Supernatural Helpers'''
|were kindly, sometimes invisible helpers that assisted the heroine, such as a Fairy Godmother
|-
|'''Magical Object'''
|was magical and powerful, like a magic wand
|-
|'''Transformation'''
|a change occurred, usually by magic.
|-
|'''Hansome Higher status male'''
|was usually a prince or other form of royalty
|-
|'''Test of Worthiness'''
|a test or task that determined the worthiness of a character, such as the shoe test (i.e. the glass slipper fits)
|}

A good example of a Cinderella story was [http://books.google.com/books?id=oNhw11KtVDEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=zh-TW ''Little Gold Star: A Spanish American Cinderella Tale''] retold by Robert D. San Souci. This story comprised the essence of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and it was revised from the Spanish origin, which maintained the Spanish dialects and languages. With Sergio Martinez's vivid and transparent style of drawing, the illustrations might inspire and attract readers as well.

== Introduction to Modern Fantasy ==
Modern fantasy is literature written by a known author that is set either in a make-believe or imaginary world in which places, people and creatures could not exist,and/or have events that could not possibly happen such as tiny people, talking animals, or traveling through time.

== Categories of Modern Fantasy ==

According to C. Huck, S. Hepler, J. Hickman, B. Kiefer (&lt;u&gt;Children's Literature in the Elementary School&lt;/u&gt; 1997) there are several categories of children's modern fantasy books.  
===Animal Fantasy===
The category of animal fantasy is often given to stories about animal characters that still maintain their animal characteristics, such as Wilbur in &lt;u&gt;Charlotte's Web&lt;/u&gt;, by E.B. White, who lives in a barn and eats slop, but also displays human characteristics such as being able to talk with other animals.

===Toys and Objects===
This category is about toys and objects that have a secret life with or without the knowledge of their owner. For example the Velveteen Rabbit who wants to become real and of course the well known and loved &lt;u&gt;Winnie the Pooh&lt;/u&gt; by A.A. Milne. 

===Tiny Humans===
This category is about humans who are extremely tiny. They have human traits and have real human situations but are just little. Some examples are &lt;u&gt;The Borrowers&lt;/u&gt; by Mary Norton and 
&lt;u&gt;Thumbelina&lt;/u&gt; by Hans Christian Andersen.

===Unusual Characters and Preposterous Situations===
This category is about strange and unusual characters such as Willy Wonka, Mary Poppins, and the Mad Hatter. These types of characters portray human characteristics but put themselves in strange situations. Some books that fall into this genre would be &lt;u&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/u&gt; by Lewis Carroll and &lt;u&gt;Mr. Popper's Penguins&lt;/u&gt; by Richard and Florence Atwater.

===Imaginary Worlds===
Imaginary Worlds begin in the realm of reality then move rapidly into a world of make believe where situations seem impossible but still have a realistic quality. For example &lt;u&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/u&gt; by L. Frank Baum and &lt;u&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/u&gt; by Roald Dahl.

===Supernatural===
Books under this category capture the attention of children because they enjoy the different types of characters and places that appear in supernatural books. Places such as Hogwarts school found in the &lt;u&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/u&gt; series by J.K.Rowling are intriguing in the minds of its readers.  

===Time-warp===
Time warp books start out in the &quot;real world&quot; with characters who find a way to travel back in time or to the future. In the book &lt;u&gt;The Golden Hour&lt;/u&gt;, by Maiya Williams, four children find themselves in the middle of the French Revolution while trying to discover the secrets surrounding the town and the abandoned Owatannauk resort. In &lt;u&gt;Tuck Everlasting&lt;/u&gt;, by Natalie Babbitt, Winnie falls in love with Tuck who is a character that has the gift of everlasting life, a person from the past must now help a friend in need. 

===High Fantasy===
High fantasy includes popular books like &lt;u&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/u&gt; by J.R.R Tolkien and &lt;u&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;/u&gt; by C.S.Lewis. These books involve the battle between good and evil and their characters may include elves, dwarves, witches, dragons and other mythical beings as well as humans.  High fantasy books typically have a quest for a lost or stolen object of power that the protagonist and antagonist need for different reasons and purposes.

===Science Fiction===
Science Fiction books are those that contemplate future worlds and may often include space travel.  Readers will find real scientific information included in these books. Literature books such as &lt;u&gt;A Wrinkle in Time&lt;/u&gt; by Madeline L'Engle or &lt;u&gt;The Giver&lt;/u&gt; by Lois Lowery are included in this category.

What is Historical Fiction?  Sarah Johnson, Assistant Professor, Eastern Illinois University, states that &quot;the obvious definition that comes to mind is that historical fiction is simply &quot;fiction set in the past&quot; (March 2002).  The words &quot;historical fiction&quot; themselves represent a controversy of meaning.  To be considered historical means that the story is based on fact or attained from research.  To be considered fiction means that the story is not true.  So how is it that this literary genre can be both?  Historical fiction uses real characters along with fictitious characters to tell about factual events which occurred more than 50 years ago.  In this way the story can give shape to the past while also making it come alive in the present.  It allows children to see that those characters also dealt with problems that we still face today. 
Johnson (March, 2002) concludes that the &quot;very best historical fiction presents to us a TRUTH of the past that is NOT the truth of the history books, but a bigger truth, a more important truth - a truth of the HEART.&quot;

==Types of Historical Fiction==
According to Tunnell and Jacobs, (&lt;u&gt;Children's Literature, Briefly&lt;/u&gt;, 2000)  there are four types of Historical Fiction:  
#A Story of Historical Events Happening Before the Life of the Author 
#:&lt;u&gt;Stealing South&lt;/u&gt; by Katherine Ayres [http://personal.chatham.edu/faculty/kayres/default.htm Katherine Ayres] 
#A Contemporary Novel Becomes Historical Fiction With the Passage of Time
#:The Sound of Music, 1949 [http://www.trappfamily.com/familystory/history.php  The von Trapp Family Story] 
#An Author Chronicles his/her Own Life Story in a Fictional Format 
#:The Little House books by Laura Ingalls Wilder are books of this type.  [http://frodo.marshall.edu/~irby1/laura/frames.html Laura Ingalls Wilder, Frontier Girl]
#The Protagonist Travels Back Into History
#:The Magic Tree House books [http://www.marypopeosborne.com/ Mary Pope Osborne]

==Criteria for selecting High Quality Historical Fiction==
#The historical facts must be correct and true without being overbearing to the story.
#:&quot;Telling a good story is the essence of historical fiction.&quot;  (Tunnell and Jacobs, &lt;u&gt;&lt;u&gt;Children's Literature, Briefly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, 2000)
#The dialogue, thoughts, actions, and motivations of the characters must be true to the time period of the story.
#:The stories should not be &quot;candy coated&quot; to appeal to reader simply to shield readers from the horrific and disturbing events of our history. &quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it&quot;.  (George Santayana)
#The setting, characters, plot, mood, word choice, and themes need to be interesting to keep the attention of young readers.  
#:The story must be written so that the reader feels as if they have time-traveled to a place of long ago and immersed into authentic historical detail.

==Examples of High Quality Historical Fiction==
;Picture Books
: &lt;u&gt;Rudy Rides the Rails:  A Depression Era Story&lt;/u&gt; written by Dandi Daley Mackall and illustrated by Chris Ellison
::  This story weaves an accurate picture about the lives of hoboes during the Great Depression.  The theme is of family love that drives &quot;Rambling Rudy&quot; back to his home in Akron, Ohio.  The author and illustrator share symbols, dialogue and action from this time period with the reader so that one feels as if they are riding the rails, searching for work and food, along with the characters.  [http://www.dandibooks.com/Teachers_guides/Rudy%20Teacher's%20Guide.pdf Teacher's Guide]
: &lt;u&gt;The Wall&lt;/u&gt; written and illustrated by Peter Sis
::  This story depicts Peter Sis' view of growing up behind The Iron Curtain in Czechoslovakia during the Cold War.  The author is true to the time period and does not shield the reader from the atrocities of the brain-washing done by the government in the Soviet Union.  His illustration horrifically reveal the mindset of the time by the Soviet leaders.  Together the story and illustrations show one little boy's &quot;awakening&quot; of a better life because of the crack that rock-n-roll had put in the wall that kept him from the western world.  
: &lt;u&gt;Hot Air:  The (Mostly) True Story of the First Hot-Air Balloon Ride&lt;/u&gt; written and illustrated by Marjorie Priceman
::  This book is a light-hearted story about the first hot-air balloon ride.  It recounts the travels of a sheep, a rooster, and a duck  who were the first to take flight in a hot-air balloon.  Luckily, theirs was a happy ending which led to Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier making the first public flight.
;Chapter Books
: &lt;u&gt;Worth&lt;/u&gt; by A. LaFaye
::  This is a heart-felt story about the struggles of two boys during the late 1800's  when orphan trains were a way of life for some unwanted children.  The author's word choices and use of figurative language throughout the book pull the reader into the text.  The dialogue gives the reader the feeling that they have stepped back in time to the old west.  There is a mix of historical facts and literary elements that make this story's theme come alive as the plot unfolds.  This book leads to many enriching discussions about friendship, family, and right versus wrong.  Kids really enjoy reading this story.
: &lt;u&gt;The Breadwinner&lt;/u&gt; by Deborah Ellis
::  This story is truly written to touch the reader's heart as it draws us into the lives of several women in war-torn Afghanistan.  The struggle, fear, and raw perseverance of the main character truly reflects the depth of despair that the human spirit can be capable of enduring.  The author successfully conveys the horrific lives of Afghan women without too many details about their plight.  The plot, setting, and characters bring this historical time period alive for the reader.
: &lt;u&gt; Remember My Name&lt;/u&gt; by Sara H. Banks 
::  This story is a masterpiece of emotions ranging from courage to heart-breaking defeat about the Indian Removal Act of 1838.  The author's word choice and dialogue help the reader envision a much less &quot;sophisticated&quot; world.
: &lt;u&gt;Elijah of Buxton&lt;/u&gt; by Christopher Paul Curtis
:: This is the story of Elijah Freeman, the first free black person born in the settlement of Buxton, Canada.  His claim to fame is throwing up on Fredrick Douglas when he visited the colony when Elijah was a baby.  Elijah is an eleven year old boy who is treated like an adult because he is an only child.  He is born into freedom which makes him innocent and gullible so when he experiences the evil of slavery and crime his mind is opened to the cruelty around him.   What is so special about this book is it's authenticity.  The settlement of Buxton, Canada actually existed as a place for runaway slaves.  Douglas did visit this settlement at one time.  The fear and treatment of the slaves is accurately detailed, they hide from the slave traders while trying to survive in a new place.  The book is written in southern twang with a slightly educated tone to it because Elijah is going to school and the teacher is from New York. Elijah faces many decisions that the students can relate to.

Informational books have evolved in the last several years. These books are no longer left on the library shelf. Illustrations have improved and the books are targeted to younger audiences. Authors of informational books are working hard to make learning enjoyable for children. Informational books are nonfiction books that present current and accurate knowledge (Tunnell and Jacobs, 130). Students can use informational books to write reports, develop critical reading and thinking skills, and expand vocabulary. Authors of informational books often write them to encourage self reliance. A great reason to read informational books is for their enjoyment value. Children can spend hours reading and discovering new facts and ideas (Norton, 501).

== How to select Quality Informational Books ==  
Several aspects need to be considered when searching for quality informational books. The book should have an attractive format and design. The content should be appealing with a sufficient mix of text and illustrations. The text needs to include compelling details such as quotations and anecdotes. The accuracy of the text is important. It needs to have current information that is factual and reliable(Tunnell and Jacobs, 133). Authors can not include anthropomorphism in the text. This means they can not give animals or objects human-like characteristics. Stereotyping is also discouraged in informational books (Norton, 502).

Teachers and parents can choose award winning books to find quality informational books (Narang, 1). '''The Robert F. Sibert Informational Book Award''' is one well respected award. This award was established by the '''American Library Association'''. Three books that were given this medal or honor are described below. Another informational book award to look for is the Orbis Pictus Award. '''The National Council of Teachers of English''' give this award to an outstanding nonfiction book published each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">By Beth Constantine and Cheryl Hartman

A biography falls under the category of Non-Fiction/Informational Books.  It is a vast category which is usually approached in one of several ways.  In the past, biographies were fictionalized because many experts felt that children would not read a biography unless it read like a good story. This approach to biography often fell victim to inaccuracies in order to make the story compelling.  In order to meet the needs of children, today's trend in biographies is to approach the story of a subject's life both authentically and in a compelling, entertaining manner.  As challenging and technical as this sounds, the biographical author is mostly driven by their primary goal, which is to reveal the subject's inner mind and feelings and get the reader to emotionally connect with the subject, thereby making the subject more human and memorable.

==Categories==
Often confused by the differences among biographies of the same person or event, readers of biographies are left wondering about the authenticity and accuracy of each book.  In pursuing the answer to this, I found the answer to be simple.  The answer lies in the inherent purpose of the book and the intended audience.  There are six categories in biographies. Each offers a different perspective and appeal.  All six are listed here with descriptions and examples.

[[File:Harriet_Tubman.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Harriet Tubman.]]
=== Picture-Book Biographies ===
Biographies under this category are mainly directed at young children.  They may cover a certain part of the person's life or span the person's whole life.  The illustrations carry much of the story and connect the reader emotionally to that person.  Many of the facts are woven throughout the story and conveyed through the illustrations.  An excellent example of a picture-book biography is ''Moses:  When [[w:Harriet Tubman|Harriet Tubman]] Led Her People to Freedom'' by Carole Boston Weatherford, illustrated by Kadir Nelson.  Weatherford's main purpose of this book is to convey the spiritual journey of Tubman.  Nelson's illustrations beautifully portray Tubman's struggle to freedom and the intensity of emotions she experienced along the way.

=== Simplified Biographies ===
Created especially for the newly independent or lower skilled readers, simplified biographies tend to provide straightforward accounts of people's lives.  These biographies are short and contain many illustrations so they receive high marks for readability.  On the other hand, due to the simplistic nature of this category, many of the complexities and details are left out. Because the sentences are manipulated in such a way to make the text more readable, many of these books sound choppy.  However an example of a well written biography from this category is F. N. Mojo's I Can Read History Book ''The One Bad Thing About Father.''  This story reveals the life of a boy, ([[w:Quentin Roosevelt|Theodore Roosevelt's son]]) living in the White House with his uncontrollable sister, [[w:Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice]].

=== Partial Biographies ===
The partial biography covers only a part of a person's life, usually a dramatic or high interest event. Many authors choose this category because of their own interest in a certain event or aspect of the subject's life and because covering the subject's entire life would make the book too long and difficult for primary readers. Many of the partial biographies not only address the events of the subject's life, but act as a social history of what life was like for a group of people.  This is the case in the book ''Rosa'' by Nikki Giovanni.  While this book is specifically about the bus incident of Rosa Parks, it also is a social history of how black Americans struggled long and hard to win their civil rights and what life was like for them in America in the 1950's.  

=== Complete Biographies ===
The complete biography covers the subject's entire life.  Complete biographies, although typically long and detailed, can also be conveyed in other categories, such as in picture-books and even in fictionalized versions.  The reader can expect an in-depth and complex look at both the positive and negative aspects of the subject. Many complete biographies will contain reproductions of original maps, journal entries, direct quotes and photographs. ''Amos Fortune, Free Man,'' by Elizabeth Yates is a Newberry Medal winning book revealing the moving story of a man born in Africa, enslaved in America, who managed to purchase his and others' freedom.

[[File:JackieRobinson1945.jpg|right|100px|thumb|Photo of [[w:Jackie Robinson|Jackie Robinson]] in Kansas City Royals uniform. The Kansas City Royals of the time were the barnstorming team of the Kansas City Monarchs Negro League club.]]
=== Collective Biographies ===
Collective Biographies were written to provide a brief explanation about specific groups of people, such as presidents, sports heroes and scientists.  Some of these biographies detail the lives of lesser-known individuals who have performed some great contribution to their trade or had a great impact on their culture, others' lives or the world.  A notable example from this category is ''Leagues Apart'' by Lawrence Ritter.  This book reveals the contributions and racial struggles faced by twenty-two African Americans who played baseball in the Negro Leagues.

=== Autobiographies  ===
[[File:Anne_Frank_stamp.jpg|left|150px|thumb|
German stamp of Anne Frank.]]
Under this category we have stories written by the subject about the subject.  The reader can expect great insight into the subject's life, although biased and subjective.  Most of the books in this category for primary children are partial biographies, meaning they do not cover the subject's entire life.  Some of these books are not about the person's personal life, but their work.  And still others reveal much about themselves through personal memories, journals, letters and photographs.  In terms of journal writings/memoirs, nothing is perhaps more famous than the ''Diary of Anne Frank''. Although written by an older child, it is an example of an autobiographical journal, which recounts her life as a member of the Jewish faith, hiding from Nazis.  Especially problematic, autobiographical work recounting very traumatic events in American and World history, such as the Holocaust does not have as welcome of a home within young children's literature as other topics.  Publishers of children's literature have struggled in the past to provide as accurate, yet protective personalized view of the Holocaust as Frank in her autobiographical journal.  On a more positive note, current trends within this category reflect the child's growing interest in favorite authors.  Newberry Honor book, ''Homesick, My Own Story'' by Jean Fritz tells a revealing story about life in 1920's China, her father's stories of America and her ensuing desire to go to America, followed by her feelings of displacement once she arrived there.

== Criteria for Selecting High Quality Children's Biographies ==
Donna E. Norton in Through the Eyes of a Child, An Introduction to Children's Literature, suggests the following criteria to use to select Children's Biographies:

# Does the biography meet the criteria for good literature?
# Is the subject of the biography worth reading about?
# Is the biography factually accurate in relation to characters, plots, and settings?
# Does the biographer distinguish between fact and judgment and between fact and fiction?
# Does the biographer use [[Enquiry_Skills/Sources|primary sources]] when conducting research for the text?  Are these sources identified in the bibliographies or other notes to the readers?
# Does the biographer include photographs and other documents that increase the credibility of the text?
# If the biographer uses illustrations other than photographs, are the illustrations accurate according to the life and time of the person?
# Does the writing style appeal to the readers?

Select at least two books about the same historical figure for each student to read. Have them work individually or in groups to record information about one or more elements of the biographies:
# Did you find conflicting information? Different versions of the same story?
# What source materials did the authors use? How do you know? Which sources are more likely to be accurate? Which are less likely to be accurate?
# What was the main theme of each biography? How did you determine this?
# What information did the biographer choose to include and how was it presented?
# Is there information about how the author became interested in the historical figure?

=== Biographies as Writing Models ===
In their Classroom Connections Journal Article, &quot;Picture-Book Biographies as Writing Models&quot;, Sheryl Saunders and Mary McMackin suggest that &quot;Effective instructional strategies that can help students transform their blasè report writing into robust expository prose may be no farther than your school or classroom library.&quot;  The article goes on to say that, &quot;When teachers
analyze what authors have done to create notable leads, transitions, and conclusions, students will discover that these books can serve as exemplars to improve their own nonfiction writing, incorporating similar effective beginnings, middles, and ends into their own reports—and that satisfies both writer and reader.&quot;  The article lists several quality biographies and provides examples that can be utilized to instruct students on how to write quality texts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Typically, the first books that children will read are picture books; they should, therefore, be a positive experience for children.  In addition to teaching children that reading is fun, picture books have an important role in a child’s development.  When books are read to children, and as they look at the pictures, language development and auditory discrimination are stimulated.  Early concepts of reading such as how to turn the pages and which way to hold a book come into play.  Concepts of print such as recognizing sound-symbol relationships and the position and order of words are introduced.  It teaches children that shapes and symbols on the page have meaning.  Of course, picture books can be used to teach young children to read, but readers of all ages can gain so much more.  Readers can use the illustrations to find further meaning, value symbolism, and practice higher level thinking skills.  It allows people of all ages simple, aesthetic pleasure.

==What Are Picture Books?==
:Typically picture books have pictures on almost every page. The illustrations are so essential to the story that sometimes they could tell the story by themselves. In fact, there are picture books with no words at all.  Sometimes the pictures expand the story line or give more significance to the words.  The books are either intended to be read aloud to children or for children to read themselves with guidance. (Lynch-Brown, 2008)

==What Do I Look for in High Quality Books?==
:There are multiple criteria for selecting excellent children’s picture books.  Most importantly, we must choose the right book for the right child in the right situation.  It should be a book that has “high literary merit” and one the child enjoys (Kurkjian, 2005) Parents and teachers are in the best position to determine what books are appropriate.  However, students can also be taught how to choose books for themselves.  The following are some ideas to consider when choosing books for children: (Lynch-Brown, 2008) (Norton, 2003) (Kurkjian, and Livingston, 2005)

*Topics and themes that children enjoy or need such as:  of imagination in overcoming fear as in Where the Wild Things Are adjusting to new siblings, as in Darcy and Gran Don’t Like Babies, or the importance of friendship as in Officer Buckle and Gloria.  Children often enjoy and can relate to stories that use animals that are disguised as people.   Jan Brett is an excellent author of such books. The use of humor and fantasy as in many Dr. Seuss books such as And to Think that I Saw It on Mulberry Street and Chris Van Allsburg’s Jumanji where animals enter real life through a game.  
*Illustrations are accurate to the plot, characters, and setting, as well as pleasing to the eye.  The pictures must support the text.  The less words there are in a book, the more the pictures must convey.  Understanding how illustrations show visual elements such as line, color, shape, texture, and composition can help to appreciate and understand the artists’ intentions through the artwork. Children and adults can begin to identify illustrators’ styles such as realistic, impressionistic, expressionistic, abstract, primitive, and surrealistic. The manner of creating the artwork is unlimited.  Examples include: drawing, collage, print making, photography, and painting. Early exposure helps to develop the aesthetic sensitivities of young children. &lt;p&gt;Kay E. Vandergrift explains on her website at http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/~kvander/Culture/illustration.html that
&lt;small&gt;''Children's book illustration is both an art form in its own right and an integral part of the literary composition of the book as a work of art. To fully appreciate all the styles, media, and techniques represented in children's literature, one must be knowledgeable about art in general as well as about the composition and design of children's books.''&lt;/small&gt; 
*Pictures should avoid stereotyping. Children are very impressionistic. Not only should the pictures that accompany the text avoid stereotyping, they should encourage children and adults to think outside of the box. Teachers should choose books with care, considering their own teaching situation.
*Length and amount of text per page should be appropriate to the age or development of the child. Wordless books require the reader to rely on illustrations only to present the story. An example is A Boy, A Dog, and a Frog by Mercer Mayer.  A few words allow the reader to use the pictures to help figure out the words to the story. Chris Rashchka’s Yo! Yes? uses just a few words to describe a story of friendship between two people who are very different.  Without the pictures and punctuation the story wouldn’t make very much sense.  If there are too many words on a page or the words are too difficult, the reader may become frustrated. Generally, the longer the text, the more mature a child must be to appreciate it. 
*Books should offer something to the reader and listener. As children become more mature and better readers, they may think that picture books are for babies. Understanding what the illustrations add to the story will help children and adults to better appreciate the text. The illustrations can also provide hidden meaning or underlying storylines that wouldn’t be able to be perceived if it were not for the illustrations. 
*Use professional recommendations such as Caldecott Medal Award Winners, The New York Times Best Illustrated Children’s Books of the Year, and reviews in journals such as ''The Horn Book'', ''School Library Journal'', and ''Publishers Weekly''.

==Types and Excellent Examples of Picture Books==
===Baby Books===
Intended for children 0-2,these books must be durable for little mouths and hands because children of this age need to experience books through feel.  They may be made of plastic, vinyl, cloth or board books. The content is usually focused on developing vocabulary, familiar objects and routines such as bedtime or bath time. There is usually little or no text.

===Interactive books===
Intended for children 2-6,this type of picture book encourages a child to participate through rhyme, repetition, predictability, or movement such as clapping or dancing.  One classical interactive book is Dorothy Kunhardt’s Pat the Bunny. In this book children are encouraged to lift flips and feel different types of material in the book.

===Wordless books===
Children must rely on pictures and their imagination to figure out the story line.  They teach children about book structure typically before they are able to read words.  However, Reading A-Z.com, the Online Reading Program located at http://www.readinga-z.com/more/wordlessbooks.html list 150 books that are available and suggested at various levels. There are also lesson plans available for primary and intermediate teachers.   These types of books often encourage children to invent words to the story which promotes language skills on multiple levels. 

===Alphabet books===
This type of book can have an audience of a large age range. They usually present letters one at a time usually with a theme such as animals, foods,  ocean life, or some kind of device such as showing pictures that start with the sound of a letter.  Most are intended for the pre-reader or beginning reader, however there are rather complex alphabet books that can be enjoyed through adult age.  One example is The Z was Zapped  where the letter is related to a action that begins with that letter.  The easier books encourage print-sound correlations, phonics skills, and vocabulary. 

===Counting Books===
This type of book introduces children to numerals and words that represent numerals.  It allows children to practice one on one correspondence.  Children count hidden pigs in Arthur Geisert’s Pigs From 1 to 10.   Counting books for older children focus on math concepts such as addition, subtraction, or multiplication. Inez Ramsey, Professor Emeritus in Library Science, James Madison University has identified the criteria she uses to evaluate counting books at http://falcon.jmu.edu/~ramseyil/counting.htm#TOP.  First, it must be clear what is being counted. The children must be able to identify the objects. The numbers themselves must be clear, especially for young children. It should also be clearly accurate. The number of legs on spiders, for instance, may be easily confused with the number of spiders. There should be plenty of open space and uncluttered illustrations. Even though a book is advertised as a counting book, advanced math concepts may be taught as well.  	

===Concept Books===
Intended for children 2-4
These types of books teach concepts such as opposites, fast/ slow shapes, and seasons.  Eric Carle’s My Very First book of Colors is a wordless book where a child is to match a color block to a picture of an object with that color. These books usually do not have a plot.  The Internet School Library Media Center at http://falcon.jmu.edu/~ramseyil/concept.htm lists several recommendations in the following categories: How to Draw, Time, Calendar/ Clocks, Days, Months, Colors, and Opposites. 

===Nursery Rhymes===
Bobbie Crane and Andrea Owens have explained that many basic skills are taught through rhythm, rhyme, and melodies. They teach concepts such as counting, abc, body parts, and vocabulary.  Of particular interest on this site is works by Mother Goose.  
Each nursery rhyme is a little story unto itself. In many ways they function as simple parables. Traditionally, nursery rhymes have been a vehicle for children to safely explore age appropriate questions about identity and their emotions. Many of these rhymes help children to confront their fears about losing things, getting in trouble or getting hurt.  Numerous collections feature charming illustrations full of descriptive detail which explore and expand the rhyme's theme in a comforting and entertaining way. You can investigate this more at http://www.ga.k12.pa.us/academics/LS/PreK/MotherGoose/

==Early Reading/ Pattern Books===
Intended for children 5-7. These books are easily decorable and predictable. An example is Brown Bear, Brown Bear What Do You See? By Eric Carle

How do you find the best literature for your child or classroom? Begin with those books that have won awards for excellence.

Keep in mind that, in most cases, award winners are selected by adults with extensive exposure to children's literature. They judge books based on specific criteria and the award-winning books, though they may be technically superior to other books under consideration at the same time, may not strike the reading audience in the same manner as they did the judges. The selected books may also not be as popular as other books published within the same time frame as the winner. However, the long track record of the success and major influence of award-winning books is undeniable.

The most reliable resource parents and teachers have is the knowledge they possess of the strengths, weaknesses, likes, and dislikes of their child(ren) or students. I suggest to adults that they read or research the books they want children to read prior to introducing the books to the children. Just as there is no one movie that appeals to all moviegoers, so it is with award-winning books. There generally is no one book that will appeal to every reader. Excellence does not imply acceptance, understanding, or appreciation, but quality is a permanent attribute. Use discretion, knowledge, and resources before asking your children to read a book. Take care to select books they will learn to know, enjoy, love, and share with others.

Reading is a wonderful skill that can provide a lifetime of enjoyment. Allow your readers to develop their imaginations, their language, and their insight into how and why others behave as they do. Understanding is the beginning of knowledge and books are a perfect means to set our readers on that course. [http://jbitner-pjhs-math.pbwiki.com/ Reading &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; fundamental].

== John Newbery Medal ==
The Newbery Medal is America's oldest and most prestigious children's book award. Since 1922, The American Library Association has annually awarded the [http://www.ala.org/ala/alsc/awardsscholarships/literaryawds/newberymedal/aboutnewbery/aboutnewbery.cfm Newbery Medal] for the best children's book published in the previous year. Those books worthy of consideration, which also have been considered for the medal award, often are selected as Honor books.

The importance of the Newbery Medal and Honor books is evident by the long-lasting appeal of many of the books that have received the award. Award-winning books that were of excellent quality in the year chosen, are still of excellent quality today. ''Charlotte's Web'', a 1953 Honor book, is still read by children today with as much enjoyment as when it was first selected. Quality remains, no matter the passage of time.

== Orbis Pictus Award ==
In November each year, the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) awards the [http://www.ncte.org/elem/awards/orbispictus/106877.htm Orbis Pictus Award] for the best children's nonfiction book published in the United States in the previous year. Those books worthy of consideration, which also have been considered for the award, often are selected as Honor or Recommended books.

According to the NCTE web site, &quot;The name Orbis Pictus, commemorates the work of Johannes Amos Comenius, Orbis Pictus—The World in Pictures (1657), considered to be the first book actually planned for children.&quot;

Nominated books must meet detailed criteria for accuracy, organization, design, and style. The NCTE web site states: &quot;In addition, each nomination should be useful in classroom teaching grades K-8, should encourage thinking and more reading, model exemplary expository writing and research skills, share interesting and timely subject matter, and appeal to a wide range of ages.&quot;

===What is this book about? ===

This book is meant to cover Java persistence, that is, storing stuff in the Java programming language to a persistent storage medium.  Specifically using the Java Persistence API (JPA) to store Java objects to relational databases, but I would like it to have a somewhat wider scope than just JPA and concentrate more on general persistence patterns and use cases, after all JPA is just the newest of many failed Java persistence standards, this book should be able to evolve beyond JPA when it is replaced by the next persistence standard.  I do not want this to be just a regurgitation of the JPA Spec, nor a User Manual to using one of the JPA products, but more focused on real-world use cases of users and applications trying to make use of JPA (or other Java persistence solution) and the patterns they evolved and pitfalls they made.

=== Intended Audience ===
This book is intended to be useful for or to anyone learning to, or developing Java applications that require persisting data to a database.  It is mainly intended for Java developers intending to persist Java objects through the Java Persistence API (JPA) standard to a relational database.  Please don't just read this book, if you're learning or developing with JPA please contribute your experiences to this book.

=== Style ===
This book is meant to be written in a casual manner.  The goal is avoid sounding dry, overly technical or impersonal.  The book should sound casual, like a co-worker explaining to you how to use something, or a fellow consultant relating their latest engagement to another. Please refrain from being overly critical of any product, ranting about bugs, or marketing your own product or services.
