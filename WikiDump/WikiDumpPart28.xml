      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
==How Fluent Speech Is Produced==


&lt;p&gt;Speech begins with breathing, also called &lt;i&gt;respiration&lt;/i&gt;. Your lungs fill with air, more air than you would inhale if you weren't talking. You expand your upper chest and your diaphragm (belly) to get all this air in. Your lung pressure and respiration muscle tension increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you release air through your throat, past your vocal folds (also called &lt;i&gt;vocal cords&lt;/i&gt;). Your vocal folds are a pair of small muscles in your larynx. If you tense these muscles slightly, and release a little air, your vocal folds vibrate. This is called &lt;i&gt;phonation&lt;/i&gt;. It's also called the &lt;i&gt;fundamental frequency&lt;/i&gt; of your voice. If you place your fingers across the front of your throat, then hum or talk, you can feel your vocal folds vibrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adult men vibrate their vocal folds about 125 Hz (125 times per second). Women vibrate their vocal folds about 200 Hz. Children's voices are even higher. This is too fast for your brain to control. Vocal fold vibration is the only muscle activity that your brain doesn't directly control. Instead, phonation results from the coordination of respiration muscles with slight tensing of your vocal fold muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key word in that last sentence was &lt;i&gt;coordination&lt;/i&gt;. Stuttering is largely a disorder of poorly coordinated speech production muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you tense your vocal folds too much, you block off your throat and stop air from escaping your lungs. This is good when lifting heavy weights. By blocking your larynx muscles, you increase lung pressure, which strengthens your chest and you can lift more weight. Similarly, tires inflated to high pressure can carry a heavier car. But that's what stutterers do when they talk, and it's not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space in your throat above your larynx is called the &lt;i&gt;pharynx&lt;/i&gt;. Above your pharanx are your oral and nasal cavities. These spaces create vocal resonation. This is like the echoing of a cathedral or tunnel. The unique shape of these spaces makes each of our voices sound unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your jaws and lips, collectively called the &lt;i&gt;articulation muscles&lt;/i&gt;, modify your voice into intelligible speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vowels and &lt;i&gt;voiced&lt;/i&gt; consonants (such as /b/ and /d/) are produced by your vocal folds, and modified by your articulation muscles (jaw, lips, tongue). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other consonants are &lt;i&gt;voiceless&lt;/i&gt;, such as /p/ and /t/, produced by your articulation muscles modifying airflow, without your vocal folds vibrating. When you whisper, you don't vibrate your vocal folds. You just modify airflow with your articulation muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speech requires coordination of over 100 muscles. The average person speaks about 150 words per minute. Each word requires a different configuration of most of those muscles. Speech is our most complex, balanced neuromuscular activity.&lt;/p&gt;

==Core Stuttering Behaviors==

&lt;p&gt;Core stuttering behaviors include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Disordered breathing, including antagonism between abdominal (belly) and thoracic (upper chest) respiratory muscles; complete cessation of breathing, and interrupting exhalation with inhalation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disordered vocal folds, including high levels of muscle activity or muscle tension; poor laryngeal too late or holding tension too long; and poor coordination of laryngeal muscles, e.g., incompatible contractions of opposing muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Disordered articulation, including dysfunctions of the lips, jaw, and tongue in stuttering. In general, stutterers place their articulators in the right positions (in contrast to other speech disorders such as lisping, in which individuals form incorrect sounds), but time the movements wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Low-frequency tremors in the neck, jaw, and lip muscles of adult stutterers. These are found to a lesser extent in older children, and not found in young children who stutter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

==Secondary Behaviors==

&lt;p&gt;Secondary stuttering behaviors are unrelated to speech production:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Physical movements such as eye-blinking, forehead wrinkling, sudden exhaustion of breath, frowning, or nostril quivering.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gross (large) muscle movements such as head jerks or slapping one's thigh in an attempt to release a vocal fold block or other overtense speech-production muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoidance of feared words, such as substitution of another word.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Postponement of a feared word, with pauses or filler words.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Interjected &amp;quot;starter&amp;quot; sounds and words, such as &amp;quot;um,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ah,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;you know,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;in other words.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Repeating a sentence or phrase &amp;quot;to get a running start.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vocal abnormalities to prevent stuttering, such as speaking in a rapid monotone, affecting an accent, or using odd inflections.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Looking away from the listener, not maintaining eye contact.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Articulating an unrelated sound, e.g., forming a /t/ sound when trying to say /s/.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondary behaviors may help you get around stuttering at first, but then lose their effectiveness. The secondary behavior is then retained out of habit.&lt;/p&gt;

==Definitions of Stuttering==

&lt;p&gt;Fluent speech can be defined in four parameters:{{ref|Starkweather1987}}
*Smoothness, or lack of interruptions.
*Speaking rate.
*Prosody, or emotional intonation.
*Mental effort.

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering can be defined as:{{ref|Wingate1964}}

*I. (a) disruption in the fluency of verbal expression, which is (b) characterized by involuntary, audible, or silent repetitions or prolongations in the utterance of short speech elements, namely: sounds, syllables, and words of one syllable. These disruptions (c) usually occur frequently or are marked in character and (d) are not readily controllable. 
*II. Sometimes the disruptions are (e) accompanied by accessory activities involving the speech apparatus, related or unrelated body structures, or stereotyped speech utterances. These activities give the appearance of being speech-related struggle.
*III. Also, there not infrequently are (f) indications or reports of the presence of an emotional state, ranging from a general condition of &amp;quot;excitement&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tension&amp;quot; to more specific emotions of a negative nature such as fear, embarrassment, irritation, or the like. (g) The immediate source of stuttering is some incoordination expressed in the peripheral speech mechanism; the ultimate cause is presently unknown and may be complex or compound.

&lt;p&gt;An essential difference between speech and language disorders is that persons with speech disorders (e.g., stuttering) know what they want to say, but can't say it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stammering&lt;/i&gt; is the British word for stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">what does &quot;cdq&quot; do?  I can't find it  [[User:137.148.5.13|137.148.5.13]] 23:59, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

cdq is &quot;Convert Doubleword to Quadword&quot;. Essentially, it sign-extends eax into edx. See http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-5477/6mkuavhri?a=view.

== sysenter mention of protected system mode ==

This is also known as kernel mode or supervisor mode. Protected mode is the term used for the state the processor is in when 32 bit is enabled. The use of &quot;protected system mode&quot; may be confusing. I am going to add that the mode referring to is supervisor mode for clarification.

== Good info on RDTSC, but not enough background on code snippet ==

The listing demonstrating a use of the RDTSC would assemble per the instructions, but would not link. I'm guessing the author's development environment has something set up that I don't. There appears to be enough information there for the topic at hand, but I'm going to have to do substantial digging to make use of it.
:It could be that you are running on a 64bit system, I edited the instructions to be more portable, hopefully the modified instructions work for you.
[[User:Syaghmour|Syaghmour]] ([[User talk:Syaghmour|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Syaghmour|contribs]]) 02:22, 1 November 2012 (UTC)

I don't think that's the problem. I was running CygWin, getting a linker error &quot;undefined reference to '_WinMain@16' &quot;. I'm hoping to get Ubuntu running on my target system later today, and I will try it there. Meanwhile, I think I have enough information to make use of the RDTSC instruction for my purpose, which differs a bit from the example. What I need to do is output a 1 on an I/O line, and return it to a zero after a precise interval (from 1 to 25 us, depending on which test I'm running).
:I was able to figure out how to get it working on cygwin, or at least &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; way to get it working. The code requires the following modifications:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main has to be renamed to _WinMain@16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#printf needs to be changed to _printf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interrupt to call exit(3) needs to be replaced with a ret 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


The full but reduced code is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
global _WinMain@16

extern _printf

section .data
        a:      dd 10.0
        b:      dd 5.0
        fmtStr: db &quot;edx:eax = %llu edx = %d eax = %d&quot;, 0x0A, 0

section .bss
        cycleLow:       resd 1
        cycleHigh:      resd 1

section .text
        _WinMain@16:

        xor     eax, eax
        cpuid
        rdtsc
        mov     [cycleLow], eax
        mov     [cycleHigh], edx

        fld     dword [a]
        fld     dword [b]

        cpuid
        rdtsc

        sub     eax, [cycleLow]
        sbb     edx, [cycleHigh]
        push    eax
        push    edx
        push    edx
        push    eax
        push    dword fmtStr
        call    _printf
        add     esp, 20         ; Pop stack 5 times 4 bytes

        ret 16
&lt;/source&gt;

To build you will need to do as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
nasm -f win32 -g rdtsc.asm
gcc rdtsc.obj -o rdtsc.exe -mwindows
&lt;/source&gt;


The following article has good set of Linux and Windows assembly language programs and how to build across both platforms:[http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/x86assembly/ x86 Assembly Language Programming]

That material should eventually be incorporated under the Syntaxes and Assemblers section.

I don't follow your other comments on your intended use of RDTSC but if you look under the resources section there is a good pdf with more details on RDTSC that I put up a little while ago.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[w: MythTV|MythTV]] is a &quot;do it yourself&quot; (homebrew) personal video recorder ([[w: Personal video recorder|PVR]]), which is a device that lets you record and watch television shows. In fact, it is more than just a PVR, it is a home entertainment personal computer ([[w: HTPC|HTPC]]), also called a Media PC. Yet MythTV is more than a mere HTPC, it is a powerful and functional [[w: server|server computer]] that can provide users with a wide range of entertainment services. With a functional MythTV, you can:
* Pause and rewind live TV
* Schedule programs to be recorded, and watch them at your leisure
* When viewing recorded programs, you can quickly fast-forward, rewind, automatically skip commercials, and much more
* Play [[w: DVD|DVDs]], [[w: Video_CD|VCDs]], music [[w: Compact_disk|CDs]], and downloaded audio/video
* Use your TV as a computer (to browse the web, or anything else)
* Play video games on your TV
* Use your TV to play music
* Get automatic regionalized weather reports
* and much more!

MythTV is, essentially, a piece of [[w: open source|open-source]] (and [[w: free software|free]]) software that, once running properly, captures your television signal, records it on your hard drive, and allows you to watch those recordings off of the hard drive at a later time. The functionality of MythTV can be accessed with an on-screen menu system, with a web interface (via the MythWeb plug-in), or via a remote terminal (telnet or SSH). It is open source and highly configurable and customizable.

MythTV, and its related open-source components, are being developed by enthusiastic programmers. Everything is provided in a free and open format so as to encourage others to use the software, and hopefully expand upon it. The good news is that MythTV is free, powerful, customizable, fun to tinker with, and fun to use. It can run on any standard PC, so it doesn’t take much to get started with it!

==What's the downside? ==
* MythTV is still developmental, and as such is not a finished or ‘polished’ product yet. Getting it to run properly can be difficult.
* The fact that MythTV runs on Linux is what makes it so powerful, but to those who don’t have any experience with Linux, this can be a major issue.
* Once MythTV is running, it is very much like a commercial PVR, in that it has an on-screen menu-interface to control all its features. However, MythTV will occasionally require some tweaking and re-working, meaning bypassing the interface and getting to the 'guts' of the system (i.e.: the Linux Operating System you have running behind the scenes).
* You need a spare PC of some sort (although this same PC can be used as a file server, web server, etc.).
* You need a capture card (which can cost $30 to $300, depending what you’re interested in).

==Should I build a MythTV?==
First, you should only consider building a MythTV if you look upon it as a hobby, and you enjoy tinkering with computers. Don’t build a MythTV simply because you don’t want to spend money on a commercial equivalent (you will just end up being frustrated). If, however, you are interested in a fun do-it-yourself project (that culminates in a highly useful product that your whole family will enjoy), then MythTV may be for you.

Another good point to consider is how much spare computer hardware you have lying around. If you have a lot of spare computer components at your disposal (in your home or through friends), then you can build the hardware for MythTV with very little money. Starting from scratch is also possible, but will end up costing more than a commercial equivalent (of course, your final product may be quite a bit more powerful and feature-rich). Many people who build a MythTV find that they only need to buy a few components (the capture card and maybe a bigger hard drive). If you’re only missing a few components, they can also be purchased second hand (eBay for instance) at a reasonable price. Since the hardware requirements for linux and even MythTV are fairly modest, it doesn’t cost much to get up and running.

Ultimately, the decision to build a MythTV is up to you. If you’re excited about the idea, then no one will be able to stop you.

==Alternatives to MythTV==
Instead of building a MythTV, you may want to consider alternatives. You can purchase commercial PVRs from a number of companies. Your local cable provider may offer a PVR. The advantage here is that they will likely guarantee compatibility with their listing services, making the transition seamless. The disadvantages are the price tag, and the inability to truly control and customize your system. Other companies build more independent PVRs. The most well known are [http://www.tivo.com/ TiVo] and [http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/replaytv/default.asp ReplayTV]. TiVo is, by all accounts, a well-designed product and service. However, it is expensive (one has to buy the TiVo PVR, and then pay approximately $15/month for continued service), and many question the long-term viability of the company.

If you’re interested in transforming a computer into a HTPC, you can purchase [http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx Windows XP Media Center Edition], [http://www.sage.tv/ SageTV], [http://www.snapstream.com/ Snap Stream’s Beyond TV], or [http://www.showshifter.com/ ShowShifter]. These software programs will enable you to use a PC to record television, while still having numerous other PC functionalities available. They are probably easier to setup than MythTV, but are not nearly as powerful. There is also a Mac OS X alternative, purchasing an EyeTV product and using an Apple Macintosh as an HTPC. While the Macintosh option does not have all of the features of MythTV, it does offer the UNIX stability of Linux with a better interface and generally superior hardware to all but the best PCs.

[http://freevo.sourceforge.net/about.html Freevo] is another open source software suite that runs on linux and enables HTPC functionality. [http://www.team-mediaportal.com/ MediaPortal] is an open source media center that runs on Windows XP, and [http://www.gbpvr.com GB-PVR] is a free but closed source PVR client for Windows.

Lastly, you may be interested to know that [http://www.magicitx.com/ MagicITX] is offering pre-built MythTV boxes (no international shipping).

MagicITX no longer exists.

Another solution would be [http://cosmoseng.com/cgi-bin/cosmos/004-LBMC1200.html Cosmo Engineering] and their MythTV offering

==Linux==
Installing and configuring MythTV requires basic knowledge of [[w: Linux|Linux]], a powerful, free, open-source operating system suitable for running servers and multi-user desktops. If you’ve never used Linux, the instructions here will seem very mysterious. You should certainly get acquainted with Linux before attempting this how-to. That having been said, getting MythTV up and running can be a fun way to learn Linux. The first thing you should do, in such a case, is to play with Linux for a while, read some tutorials on the subject, and obtain a basic familiarity with the Linux command-line interface (CLI), also known as the shell, terminal or console.

In this document, Linux shell commands entered as a normal user (implicitly the user ‘mythtv’) will be denoted by a $ prompt, whereas commands meant to be entered by the superuser (‘root’) will be preceded by a #.

==Other sources of help==
If you’re interested in getting a MythTV setup working, this &quot;how-to&quot; guide will hopefully help you. Every installation is different, especially depending on what version of Linux you are using. Thus, there are many different how-to documents you may want to refer to for suggestions when getting things working. You will undoubtedly encounter many unique (and annoying) errors throughout your installation, but usually a search on the internet will provide you with an answer.

Some how-to guides worth reading:
* [http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=MythInstall The official MythTV install guide]
* [http://www.byopvr.com/Sections+index-req-viewarticle-artid-13-page-1.html For Mandrake 10.1, there's maiku's guide]
* [http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/ For Fedora Core, there's Jarod's guide]
* [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Setup_MythTV Wiki how-to for Gentoo]
* [http://www.pvrweb.com/ The PVR Guide gives helpful how-to guides and a forum]
* [http://www.punkrockworld.it/mythwiki/wiki.asp?db=MythWiki&amp;o=InstallWithGentoo Install MythTv using Gentoo]

(It's also worth noting that the instructions presented here are heavily inspired by Maiku's excellent guide.) The [http://www.mythtv.info/ unofficial MythTV wiki] has a [http://www.mythtv.info/moin.cgi/LinuxDistros list of how-to guides] for different Linux or Unix distributions (Debian, FreeBSD, Gentoo, Slackware, Suse, etc.).

==Getting your hardware together==
MythTV can run on any modern PC that can run Linux. A 'minimum' configuration might be a Pentium-III 500 MHz machine. If attempting to use such a configuration, however, you should consider investing in a capture card that does MPEG-1/2 encoding '''and decoding''' on-board, so that the CPU is not overloaded with those tasks. If you have a more powerful computer, you can purchase a less expensive capture card, and let the CPU do the work of MPEG decoding and rendering video.

You will want a healthy amount of RAM/memory (around 1 Gbyte), and will certainly want a big hard drive, so that you can store lots of video (most users get 130 Gbyte drives or bigger). MythTV compresses video using the same compression scheme as a DVD: MPEG-2. This means that one hour of video will use up about 2 Gbytes of space, so you should plan your hard drive needs accordingly.

You will also probably want to get a CD/DVD drive, and may also want to get a DVD writer, so that you can make backups of data, shows, and movies you own. Your computer must also have a sound card (obviously), although it needn't be anything fancy. Having RCA output jacks on the card is helpful, but not required (you can easily purchase an adapter to connect a normal sound card to a TV). Your video card will need to have a TV-out capability (unless you're using a capture card that also has TV-out).

It is also worth thinking about where you will put your MythTV. If your intention is to have it sitting in your living room, directly connected to your TV, then you may want to think about getting quiet hardware. This means finding a hard drive and a power supply fan that don't make too much noise, as well as thinking about what kind of processor (and associated cooling solution) would work best.

Most importantly, you need a capture card. The most widely used capture cards for MythTV are the Hauppauge cards (150, 250, 350, 500). These cards are quite high-performance, many come with a remote control, and most importantly, open-source Linux drivers have been written for these cards.

If you have a set-top box (digital cable box, satellite receiver, etc.) then you will probably want to pick up an &quot;IR blaster.&quot; This is a device that can be used to send arbitrary IR pulses. This can be used to allow MythTV to control your set-top box. Essentially, when MythTV wants to change a channel, it will send the appropriate IR signal, through the blaster, which emulates the normal remote control for that set-top box. The [http://www.mytvstore.com/product_id_005.html My Blaster] produced by My.TV is compatible with MythTV and Linux, or you may consider [http://www.usbuirt.com/ USB-UIRT] or [http://www.irblaster.info/ buying this], or you can even build your own quite easily (you can find wiring diagrams on the [http://www.lirc.org/ LIRC] homepage, or [http://losdos.dyndns.org:8080/public/mythtv-info/MythTV_DISH_IR_LED_TX_via_Modified_LIRC.html elsewhere]).

The most important thing with all the hardware is to make sure that it is Linux compatible (that there is a Linux driver available somewhere). Most modern Linux distributions have compatibility for mainstream hardware built-in, but you should certainly check before buying anything.

Lastly, for those who want a real challenge, in principle you could run MythTV on a PowerPC (PPC) architecture. That is, you could install MythTV on a &quot;Apple/Macintosh&quot; computer that has been converted to run a PPC version of Linux. This will require some extra work, such as downloading the MythTV source code and compiling it yourself for your PPC processor, and probably some fiddling to get the capture card drivers working. Some users have reported success in running the MythTV frontend on Mac OS X (with the backend running on another PC). You can find help for that on the [http://www.mythtv.info/moin.cgi/MythOnMacOsx MythOnMacOsx] page. You could obviously use a PC as the backend and as the frontend for the TV, and then use a PowerBook as an additional frontend, for editing videos while watching TV, or for portability. If you're interested in this, you can also run the MythTV frontend on a modified Xbox (running [http://www.xbox-linux.org/ Xbox-linux]), or even on a diskless Via EPIA M system. For help with running MythTV on an Xbox, read the [http://www.ps.masny.dk/projects/linux/mythtv-0.4b-xbox-HOWTO.html how-to] and download files [http://bit.blkbk.com/ here]. To run a network-booting MythTV frontend, use [http://linpvr.org/ MiniMyth].

==Selecting a Linux distribution==
In principle, any Linux distribution should work with MythTV. Of course, your selection of distribution will be affected by many other things. If you are familiar with a particular distro, then your first impulse may be to use that one. However, you should of course check if there are any compatibility issues with the hardware you're planning on using.

[http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html KnoppMyth] is a variant of the [http://www.knoppix.net/ Knoppix] distribution that has been specifically customized to make MythTV as easy to install as possible. It includes the MythTV suite and many required drivers. In principle, it would be the easiest distro to use for someone who wants an easy install, and since it only installs what is needed for MythTV, it should run smoothly. In practice, other factors may make KnoppMyth a non-ideal choice. If you want your machine to be used for other tasks, then another distribution might be more flexible and powerful. The minimalist design of KnoppMyth may also make it harder to troubleshoot problems that arise. KnoppMyth is certainly worth a try. When starting out, you could download KnoppMyth, burn it to a CD, install it, and see what happens. If everything works, then great! If you find KnoppMyth isn't working out for you, you can just try a different distro. You can find help for KnoppMyth by visiting the [http://mysettopbox.tv/phpBB2/ forum].

Many people decide to use [http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora] because it is a well-supported and popular distro, and because of the highly detailed [http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/fcmyth.php how-to] guide available for MythTV on Fedora.

Many users of MythTV have reported successful installations when using Mandrake Linux (now known as [http://www.mandriva.com/ Mandriva] linux). Advantages of Mandrake are a healthy user base, the ability to obtain additional help online with Mandriva (for a small fee), and a fairly user-friendly interface (Mandrake includes many GUI-based configuration tools). The availability of MythTV tutorials aimed at the Mandrake distribution make this a nice choice.

Ultimately the choice of distribution is up to you. Probably the most important thing is to pick a distro that others have had success with, that has lots of support documentation online, and that has an easy method for automated packaging and installing of software over the internet. This will make your experience much smoother!

==Software prerequisites==
MythTV depends on many other software packages being installed on your system. If you are performing a MythTV installation using a package manager, then probably all these other requirements will be automatically downloaded, installed, and configured properly during your MythTV package installation. However, for those of you attempting a manual install (and for your knowledge), these are the packages that MythTV needs to have installed:
* kernel source and drivers: You need the source code for the kernel to properly compile the capture card driver. Obviously you need all the drivers required for your hardware to be installed and configured properly.
* X: You need some sort of window managing system. At a minimum, X must be running, although most people will add a desktop environment (such as Gnome or KDE) on top of that.
* QT: a multi-platform, Graphical User Interfaces toolkit for C++ programming.
* Freetype fonts
* [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL]: A powerful open-source database system. The MythTV backend manages video recordings using MySQL entries. (The recordings themselves are simply stored as normal files.)
* [http://lame.sourceforge.net/ LAME]: Open-source mp3 encoder.
* [http://www.lirc.org/ LIRC]: Linux Infrared Remote Control. 

==Other information==
You probably have lots of questions about how you'll end up configuring your MythTV and about what it'll eventually be able to do. Here's some additional information about MythTV (just to give you a preview of what you'll be installing).

===Backend and frontend===
Like most Linux software, MythTV uses a client/server architecture. What this means is that one program (mythbackend) deals with capturing video and managing the database, while another program (mythfrontend) deals with showing the user video and providing the on-screen interface. Why split it into two programs? There are many advantages. For one, if mythfrontend freezes or crashes, the backend will continue recording and managing properly. This makes the system rather robust. Secondly, this architecture means that you can have one computer run the backend, and use a different computer as the frontend. The frontend computer will log into the backend to get the video data. This gives you quite a bit of flexibility. You can even have multiple computers attached to different televisions, each running a separate instance of the frontend, but all getting their video from the same backend. This gives you even more flexibility. The frontend computers could have less hardware and be quieter. Some users have a laptop that also runs the frontend, so they can watch TV in bed, or even edit recordings while watching something else on TV. You can even copy recordings to your laptop and take them on vacation with you. There are many possibilities.

With regard to configuring MythTV, remember that the frontend and backend are separate. Even if you exit the frontend, the backend is probably still running. During the configuration phase, you may need to exit the backend and restart it for changes to take effect. In principle you can do this without even shutting down the frontend.

===Remote controls===
Will you be able to control your MythTV with a remote control? Yes, it's possible. A program called LIRC allows Linux to interface with remote controls. Some capture cards come with remote controls. LIRC can be configured to receive data from these. A number of IR detectors can also be interfaced via LIRC, enabling you to use other remotes. LIRC in principle can be configured to interface with multiple remotes and IR blasters.

===TV listings===
Will you be able to have an on-screen program guide? How will you get your listings? In many places, you can sign up for a DataDirect account with [http://labs.zap2it.com Zap2It]. By answering a simple survey, you'll receive a subscription that allows you to download program listings. MythTV has built-in functionality to connect to that service. If you need a &quot;certificate code&quot; for zap2it, you can use ZIYN-DQZO-SBUT (this lets zap2it know that you're using MythTV). The code TGYM-ZKOC-BUTV may also work.

===Set-top box===
Will you be able to control your satellite or cable provider box (set-top box)? What you can do is use a device called an IR Blaster. This device can be programmed to send IR pulses that mimic the signals from your remote control for your set-top box. Essentially, whenever MythTV needs to change a channel, it will send a signal to your set-top box to change channels as required. This introduce an additional delay in switching channels, which can be annoying if you're trying to &quot;channel surf&quot; on live TV. However, most users of MythTV change viewing habits, and rarely watch live TV anymore.

Many set-top boxes have input connections (serial, USB, etc.). In principle, a direct connection between your MythTV and the box should be possible. In practice, few cable providers or set-top box companies will give out the required details in order to make your box work. It is much simpler to use an IR blaster.

[http://lircconfig.commandir.com LIRC Config] is a free tool by the makers of the USB transceiver [http://www.commandir.com CommandIR] that generates configuration files for remotes and set-top-boxes online.

===Capture card===
In order to use a capture card, you of course need a Linux driver. The ivtv driver is an open-source driver written for Linux to enable interfacing with capture cards. This driver is geared towards the Hauppauge WinTV PVR-250 and 350 cards, although other cards are also supported. The people at Hauppauge have provided the people at ivtv with some useful information, which has enabled a highly functional driver to be written.

===Plugins===
MythTV's functionality has been greatly extended by a large number of plugins. In most modern MythTV packages, all of these plugins are wrapped together into a &quot;MythPlugin&quot; package. Thus, they do not need to be installed individually. Available plugins include:
* MythBrowser: allows web browsing on your MythTV
* MythDVD: DVD library features
* MythGallery: image gallery/slideshow plugin
* MythGame: lets you play video games on your MythTV using xmame frontend
* MythMusic: play music (with visualizations) through MythTV
* MythNews: RSS feed reader
* MythPhone: video conferencing plugin
* MythVideo: play any video file in MythTV
* MythWeather: get localized weather forecasts
* MythWeb: lets you control your MythTV from anywhere, using a web browser

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MythTV}}


The easiest way to install MythTV is to follow a how-to. The following how-to is geared towards Mandrake 10.1 Official (download), but most of the steps will be similar for other linux distributions. The locations of some files may be slightly different, and instead of using urpmi to install updates, you will need a different tool depending on your distribution. So, you should first figure out what packaging tool is used on your linux distribution, and whenever commands involving urpmi arrive, use your tool instead. Examples of tools used on other command-line tools are apt-get, and emerge (used on Gentoo). There are also graphical tools, such as grpmi (graphical version of urpmi), rpmdrake (for Mandrake), Synaptic, etc.

If you're using another distribution and need to find a particular file, you can always use the find command. For instance:
 # find / -name &quot;file*&quot;
will find everything that starts with &quot;file.&quot; (Note that searching starting at the root level, &quot;/&quot;, will take a long time, so you should limit your search if you can.) This can be a great way to figure out where a file has been placed in your distribution. You can also use
 $ which ''command_name''
To find out where a given command or script is located. (The &quot;whereis&quot; comand is also useful.) If the command does not exist on any defined path, this will let you know (so that you can either install the required software, or add it to the path appropriately). This is useful when a how-to asks you to run a command that you seemingly don't have. Also, before running any commands you should probably do
 $ man ''command_name''
to get some information on what the command does and how to use it. Many times the answer to your question is hidden inside a manual page.

==Example installation: MythTV 0.17 on Mandrake 10.1 with a Hauppauge PVR-350==

===Download and install Mandrake===
You can download the latest Mandrake [[w:ISO 9660|ISO]] images from the [http://www1.mandrivalinux.com/en/ftp.php3 official download page], or from any number of mirrors. You then burn these ISO images to CD, and perform the installation by booting off the CD. There are many other ways to install linux of course. What you install of course depends on what you want. You should install all the multimedia options, and development tools (so that you'll be able to compile things later). It's probably a good idea to install network client functions, and if you want to access your MythTV remotely, you should install some server packages (web server and ssh server especially). Having your MythTV running an SSH server can be handy if you have another computer at your disposal, because then you can have your MythTV hooked up to your television, but configure it via command line of another computer (this is good because your MythTV, when hooked up to a television, doesn't have very good resolution, and it can be aggravating to use it as a computer). You need to install some sort of window manager. KDE is a good choice if you have no other preference.

In terms of partitioning your disk, it makes good sense to have your linux OS on one partition, and keep another partition for storing your MythTV data. That way you can reinstall linux without deleting your videos. Linux doesn't need very much space (5 or 10 Gb is sufficient). Be sure to make your swap partition (512 Mb is pretty typical, but you can make it bigger if you like). And of course the bulk of your space (100+ Gb hopefully) is allocated for mythTV. You can set the mount point of this partition as &quot;/data/&quot; or &quot;/home/mythtv/data/&quot; or &quot;/home/&quot; or whatever you like.

During installation, you may aswell create an account called 'mythtv'. Once the installation is complete, create the directory where you will store your MythTV data (make sure it is inside your big partition!). So, for example, if you wanted to create /data you would type 'su' to become root, and:
 # cd /
 # mkdir /data
 # chown mythtv:mythtv /data
 # mkdir /data/mythtv

You'll also want to have your kernel source installed (for compiling drivers, later). To install software on Mandrake, we use a convenient tool called &quot;urpmi&quot; that downloads, installs, and configures automatically. Often, you can just type:
 # urpmi kernel-source
and your source will be installed. However, this won't always install the correct kernel source. You must make sure that your kernel source version matches the version of the kernel you're using. To determine your current kernel version, type:
 $ uname -r
 2.6.8.1-12mdk
In this example, a 2.6 kernel is running. To install the right 2.6 source:
 # urpmi kernel-source-2.6-2.6.8.1-12mdk
Of course modify this command depending on what source you're looking for. You can also use &quot;urpmq&quot; to query your urpmi sources, and find out what different kernel sources are available, and what the package names are called (be warned: packages like &quot;kernel-source-2.6&quot; might not be the exact kernel version you have, so look for something that matches exactly). If you can't find the right source, you can try configuring some urpmi sources (refer to the next section), and then use &quot;urpmq&quot; again to find a source that matches your kernel.

Once you have your kernel source installed, it's a good idea to double check that it's the right one:
 $ cd /usr/src
 $ ls -lF
 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root   19 May 28 20:50 linux -&gt; linux-2.6.8.1-12mdk/
 drwxr-xr-x  21 root root 4096 May 28 20:50 linux-2.6.8.1-12mdk/
 drwxr-xr-x   3 root root 4096 May 21 13:09 RPM/
Thus, make sure that the &quot;linux-*&quot; directory matches what uname returned. If not, you should uninstall the current kernel source (by typing something like &quot;# urpme kernel-source&quot;) and then install the correct source. Also, make sure that you have the above symbolic link. If you don't have one, then make it:
 # ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.8.1-12mdk /usr/src/linux
There is another symbolic link that is often missing, which you should create if it isn't there. Check:
 $ cd /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk
 $ ls -lF
 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root     15 May 28 20:07 build -&gt; /usr/src/linux/
 ...
And make it if it is missing:
 # ln -s /usr/src/linux /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/build

===Get urpmi sources===
Mandrake uses urpmi to download and install all sorts of software. After installing Mandrake from CD, you probably have three CDs listed as sources inside urpmi. When you tell urpmi to install something, it checks all of its sources, finds the package you want, and installs it. For our purposes, it's best to add some online repositories of Mandrake packages to urpmi. That way, all the dependencies will be automatically downloaded and installed as needed. So that we always get the newest packages, we can remove the current sources (which are the installation CDs):
 # urpmi.removemedia -a
Now we need to find some good, trustworthy, and fast online package sources. There is a great online tool called [http://easyurpmi.zarb.org/ Easy Urpmi]. You pick your distribution, pick a trustworthy local package source, and it prints out the command you must enter to add the designated source properly. Nothing could be easier! There are numerous mirrors of Easy Urpmi:
* [http://easyurpmi.zarb.org/ Easy Urpmi official]
* [http://mandrivausers.org/easyurpmi/ Mandriva users]
* [http://www.urpmi-addmedia.org/index2.php urpmi-addmedia]
* [http://addmedia.linuxfordummies.org/ Linux for dummies]
* [http://www.linuxfordummies.org/addmedia/ Linux for dummies]
* [http://www.linuxfornewbies.org/addmedia/ Linux for newbies]
* [http://urpmi.notix.net/ notix]
Be sure to pick the right Mandrake version and architecture. If you're not sure what you're using, try this:
 $ cat /etc/mandrake-release
 Mandrakelinux release 10.1 (Official) for i586
An example of what Easy Urpmi outputs, which you then type in a console as root:
 # urpmi.addmedia main ftp://ftp.rutgers.edu/pub/Mandrakelinux/official/10.1/i586/media/main with media_info/hdlist.cz
 # urpmi.addmedia contrib ftp://ftp.rutgers.edu/pub/Mandrakelinux/official/10.1/i586/media/contrib with media_info/hdlist.cz
 # urpmi.addmedia jpackage ftp://ftp.rutgers.edu/pub/Mandrakelinux/official/10.1/i586/media/jpackage with media_info/hdlist.cz
 # urpmi.addmedia plf-free ftp://ftp.free.fr/pub/Distributions_Linux/plf/mandrake/free/10.1 with hdlist.cz
 # urpmi.addmedia plf-nonfree ftp://ftp.free.fr/pub/Distributions_Linux/plf/mandrake/non-free/10.1 with hdlist.cz
 # urpmi.addmedia --update updates ftp://ftp.rutgers.edu/pub/Mandrakelinux/official/updates/10.1/main_updates/ with media_info/hdlist.cz
Downloading all the package information will take a little while (depending on your internet connection speed). Finally, we must add a source for the Mandrake MythTV RPM. Luckily, [http://rpm.nyvalls.se/index10.0.html Thac's RPMs] have what we need:
 # urpmi.addmedia thacs.rpms http://rpm.nyvalls.se/10.1/RPMS with hdlist.cz

===Download MythTV===
With our sources defined, a single command will download, install, and configure MythTV, including all missing dependencies (MySQL, QT, etc.):
 # urpmi mythtv-suite
The installer will prompt you for which package to select. You may notice three options, one with &quot;nvidia&quot; in the name, one with &quot;via&quot; and one that is generic. If you specifically have nvidia or via hardware, you can go that route, but the generic packages should work in most cases. When presented with the (long) list of packages to install, say &quot;yes&quot; and wait for it to finish (may take 30 minutes to several hours).

===Install ivtv===
Now we need to install the ivtv driver, which is an open-source driver written to enable linux compatibility with Hauppauge WinTV PVR capture cards. The example below should work for the PVR-150, 250, 350, and 500. With a little imagination, you can also adapt these instructions to your own capture card. First off, let's avoid any hardware conflicts by getting rid of the default ivtv driver provided in most Mandrake installs:
 # find /lib -name &quot;*ivtv*&quot;
 /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/kernel/3rdparty/ivtv
 /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/kernel/3rdparty/ivtv/ivtv-fb.ko.gz
 /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/kernel/3rdparty/ivtv/ivtv.ko.gz
 # rm -rf /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/kernel/3rdparty/ivtv

The msp3400 module will be replaced too:
 # find /lib -name &quot;msp3400*&quot;
 /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/kernel/drivers/media/video/msp3400.ko.gz
 # rm /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/kernel/drivers/media/video/msp3400.ko.gz

If you're nervous about all this, then you can move the implicated files somewhere else for safe keeping. Just make sure you put them out of the modules directory, so that they are not loaded (use the &quot;mv&quot; command and put them in /home/mythtv/tmp for example). Now download the source code for ivtv. Go to the [http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/ ivtv project page] and select download. You'll then have the option to [http://ivtv.writeme.ch/tiki-index.php?page=DownloadIvyTv download] various versions. As of the writing of this document, the 0.2 drivers are stable, whereas the 0.3 are beta and unstable. A safe bet is to pick the latest 0.2 release (ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j as of this writing). If you have problems with the driver, you can try different versions (or even try a 0.1.9 or a 0.3 driver).
 $ cd /home/mythtv
 $ lynx http://www.ivtv.tv/releases/ivtv-0.2/ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j.tgz
 $ tar -zxvf ivtv-0.2.0-rc3a.tgz
 $ cd ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j/driver
 $ make
 # make install
Those last two commands will compile the driver and put all the required files in the right places. Many users experience errors during the make operations. If you have permission errors, try switching to root and make again. Sometimes the problem is fixed by trying a different driver version. Often the problem is simply that your kernel source version does not match your running kernel (see elsewhere in this document). In extreme cases you may have to change to a different kernel. Try searching the internet (and elsewhere in this document) for the error messages you're seeing. Someone else may already have figured out the solution to your problem.

The next step is to extract the firmware for the capture card. This is binary driver information that we need to communicate with the capture card properly. For this next step to work, g++ must be installed, so let's check:
 $ which g++
 /usr/bin/g++

If it's not on your system, install it with urpmi:
 # urpmi gcc-g++

Now let's compile the firmware-extraction utility:
 $ pwd
 /home/mythtv/ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j/driver
 $ cd ../utils
 $ make
 # make install

So far so good. Now we need to get the capture card driver binary and extract out the part we need. Depending on whether you have a new or old Hauppauge card, these files will be located in slightly different places on the installation CD-ROM that came with your card. The [http://ivtv.writeme.ch/tiki-index.php?page=Drivers+and+Firmware ivtv wiki] has lots of helpful information. For older cards, expect a file called &quot;pvr48wdm_1.8.22035.exe&quot; (or something similar) but for newer cards it will be &quot;pvr_1.18.21.22301_inf.zip&quot; or &quot;hcwPVRP2.sys.&quot; You can also simply download the appropriate file from the [http://ivtv.writeme.ch/tiki-index.php?page=FirmwareVersions ivtv firmware] page. For example:
 $ cd /home/mythtv
 $ lynx ftp://ftp.shspvr.com/download/wintv-pvr_250-350/inf/pvr_1.18.21.22301_inf.zip
Then extract the firmware:
 # cd /home/mythtv/ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j/utils
 # ./ivtvfwextract.pl /home/mythtv/pvr_1.18.21.22301_inf.zip

This should have placed two new files in the &quot;/lib/modules&quot; directory, 'ivtv-fw-dec.bin' and 'ivtv-fw-enc.bin'. You can go check:
 $ cd /lib/modules
 $ ls -lF
 drwxr-xr-x  4 root root   4096 May 29 12:14 2.6.8.1-12mdk/
 drwxr-xr-x  3 root root   4096 May 28 21:14 2.6.8.1-12mdkcustom/
 -rw-r--r--  1 root root 262144 May 28 20:09 ivtv-fw-dec.bin
 -rw-r--r--  1 root root 262144 May 28 20:09 ivtv-fw-enc.bin

The installer has also placed our new modules into the &quot;/lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdkcustom/extra&quot;, but our kernel won't see these. Instead, let's put them in the right place:
 # cp /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdkcustom/extra/*.ko /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/misc
Now let's reload the module list. You can reboot too, just to make sure everything gets loaded:
 # /sbin/depmod -a
 # /sbin/reboot

After rebooting, we can try loading our new ivtv module and see if it actually works. A few modules have to be loaded in the proper order:
 # /sbin/modprobe i2c-core
 # /sbin/modprobe i2c-algo-bit
 # /sbin/modprobe tuner type=2
 # /sbin/modprobe msp3400
 # /sbin/modprobe videodev
 # /sbin/modprobe saa7115
 # /sbin/modprobe ivtv

Note that the &quot;tuner type=2&quot; varies depending on your capture card's tuner type. You can find a list of the tuner types in the &quot;tuner.h&quot; file in your ivtv driver directory:
 $ cd /home/mythtv/ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j/driver
 $ emacs tuner.h
(Note: to exit emacs use &quot;Ctrl-x Ctrl-c&quot;.) For North American users, &quot;tuner type=2&quot; (Philips NTSC) will probably work. If the module loaded properly, we can run a quick test. Hook up a video input to your card, and type:
 # /bin/cat /dev/video &gt; test.mpg
Let this run for awhile (10 seconds maybe) then hit Ctrl-C to stop it. This should have captured a bit of video and saved it to the file &quot;test.mpg&quot;. Try playing the file:
 # /usr/bin/mplayer test.mpg
If everything is working, you should see some video. If you see snow or even black, that's actually a good sign. It means the driver is probably working, but you'll need to play with settings to get it to capture on the right channel. If you instead get an error message and no video is captured, then you should start looking for solutions. Maybe your tuner type is wrong. Maybe you forgot to remove conflicting ivtv modules. Maybe a different driver version would work. Play around, search for answers.

If everything is working, then you can create a script to load these modules. Let's call it &quot;/usr/local/bin/start-ivtv&quot;. Open a text editor (emacs, vi, kwrite, etc.) and put this in:

  #!/bin/bash
  # a script to load modules for MythTV
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-core
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-algo-bit
  /sbin/modprobe tuner type=2
  /sbin/modprobe msp3400
  /sbin/modprobe videodev
  /sbin/modprobe saa7115
  /sbin/modprobe ivtv

Save and exit (in emacs &quot;Ctrl-x Ctrl-s&quot; does this, in vi use &quot;ESC, :x&quot;). Remember to make the script executable:
 # chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/start-ivtv
Now if you type &quot;start-ivtv&quot; (as root) everything will be loaded. Later you can modify this script to start MythTV automatically when the computer boots.

===Configure MySQL===
First set the MySQL service to automatically load during boot, and start it manually for now:
 # /sbin/chkconfig mysql on
 # /etc/init.d/mysql start
And now change the database permissions so that MySQL can do what it needs to. Note that you should replace &quot;root_password&quot; with your root password.
 # mysql -u root mysql
 mysql&gt; UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('root_password') WHERE user='root';
 mysql&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
 mysql&gt; quit
Now update the database:
 $ mysql -u root -p &lt; /usr/share/doc/mythtv-0.16/database/mc.sql
MySQL should be ready to go.

===Configure MythTV===
Before configuring MythTV, set up an account with a service that will give you XMLTV listings. In North America, this means setting up an account with [http://labs.zap2it.com/ zap2it] DataDirect. Now we can setup our MythTV using a graphical configuration tool:
 $ mythtvsetup
The options in this program are fairly self-explanatory. Set everything up consistent with your hardware and preferences.
:1. General:
::For &quot;IP address for localhost&quot; and &quot;Master Server IP address&quot;, you can enter your IP address, or leave it with the defaults if you're running the frontend and backend on the same computer
::For the &quot;recordings&quot; and &quot;Live-TV buffers&quot; directories, enter the directories you've chosen. For example, &quot;/home/mythtv/data&quot; or &quot;/data/mythtv&quot; or whatever.
::For the &quot;TV format&quot; selected &quot;NTSC&quot; (or whatever your local setting is).
::For &quot;VBI format&quot; you probably want &quot;NTSC Closed Caption&quot;. Depending on your driver, closed captioning might not be supported.
::For &quot;Channel frequency table&quot; most North Americans should select &quot;us-cable&quot;.

:2. Capture cards:
::Create a new capture card, set the &quot;Card type&quot; to &quot;MPEG-2 Encoder card&quot;, and set &quot;Default input&quot; to whatever you're using (tuner, S-video, etc.).

:3. Video sources:
::Create a new video source.
::Set &quot;XMLTV listings grabber&quot; to &quot;North America (DataDirect)&quot;.
::Enter your User ID and password for zap2it 
::Select &quot;retrieve lineups&quot;.
::Check that the &quot;Data Direct Lineup&quot; is consistent with your zap2it subscription.

:4. Input connections:
::Set the &quot;S-video0&quot; (or whatever you're using) &quot;Video source&quot; to the name of your defined video source.

Now you can fill the MythTV database with your listing of TV channels:
 $ mythfilldatabase
This operation will take awhile, as MythTV downloads all the program data (for the next few weeks). Once it's done, start MythTV:
 # /etc/init.d/mythbackend start
 $ mythfrontend
Use the keyboard to move around and see if things are working. If everything is good, then you can update your &quot;start-ivtv&quot; script to include &quot;/etc/init.d/mythbackend start&quot;:
  #!/bin/bash
  # a script to start MythTV
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-core
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-algo-bit
  /sbin/modprobe tuner type=2
  /sbin/modprobe msp3400
  /sbin/modprobe videodev
  /sbin/modprobe saa7115
  /sbin/modprobe ivtv
  /etc/init.d/mythbackend start

If everything is working, then you may aswell set your &quot;start-ivtv&quot; script to start automatically at boot time. To do this, edit your &quot;/etc/rc.d/rc.local&quot; file, by adding &quot;/usr/local/bin/start-ivtv&quot; to the end:
 # echo &quot;/usr/local/bin/start-ivtv&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.d/rc.local

===Configure remote control===
We'll be using [http://www.lirc.org/ LIRC] to read the signals from the Hauppauge remote. Refer to the [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=lirc-list mailing list archive] when searching for answers to problems. First get rid of any other version of LIRC that MythTV may have installed:
 # rpm -e --nodeps liblirc0
 # rpm -e --nodeps liblirc0-devel
Go to the [http://www.lirc.org/ LIRC] page and download the latest release, then untar it and start the configure script:
 $ cd /home/mythtv
 $ lynx http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lirc/lirc-0.7.1.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxvf lirc-0.7.1.tar.gz
 $ cd lirc-0.7.1
 $ ./setup.sh
What to do is pretty obvious. Select item 1, then item 5 &quot;TV Card&quot;, then select &quot;Hauppauge TV card&quot;.
Then select &quot;Save configuration &amp; run configure&quot;. Now make and install everything, and link it up:
 $ make
 # make install
 # ln -s /usr/local/lib/liblirc_client.so.0 /usr/lib/liblirc_client.so.0
Open up the file &quot;/etc/ld.so.conf&quot; and add &quot;/usr/local/lib&quot; to the end. Or just type:
 # echo &quot;/usr/local/lib&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/ld.so.conf
Then run ldconfig (which updates the run-time link libraries):
 # ldconfig
Copy the configuration file from MythTV documents to your lircrc directory, and add a symbolic link:
 $ cd /usr/share/doc/mythtv-0.17/configfiles
 $ cp hauppauge-lircrc-nativelirc /home/mythtv/.mythtv/lircrc
 $ ln -s /home/mythtv/.mythtv/lircrc /home/mythtv/.lircrc
Copy the appropriate remote config file:
 $ cd /home/mythtv/lirc-0.7.0/remotes/hauppauge
 # cp ./lircd.conf.hauppauge /etc/lircd.conf
You could now update your &quot;start-ivtv&quot; script to load the remote (lirc_i2c) modules:
  #!/bin/bash
  # a script to start MythTV
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-core
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-algo-bit
  /sbin/modprobe tuner type=2
  /sbin/modprobe msp3400
  /sbin/modprobe videodev
  /sbin/modprobe saa7115
  /sbin/modprobe ivtv
  /sbin/modprobe lirc_i2c
  /usr/local/sbin/lircd -d /dev/lirc0 --permission=666
  /etc/init.d/mythbackend start
Now you should restart everything:
 # /etc/init.d/mythbackend stop
 # /usr/local/bin/start-ivtv
 $ mythtvfrontend
See if the remote works. It might be a good time to reboot, and see if everything starts up:
 # /sbin/reboot
Once its booted, you should be able to run &quot;mythfrontend&quot; and use your MythTV. You can open the &quot;/home/mythtv/.lircrc&quot; file and edit it to map your remote properly (more on this later). For the moment, if you're using a Hauppauge silver remote, then you should change &quot;Rew&quot; to &quot;Rewind&quot; and &quot;FFW&quot; to &quot;Forward&quot;.

===Configure TV-out===
The configuration of your TV-out depends on your hardware. If you're using a video card with a TV-out, then it may simply be a matter of having a TV connected to that output during boot, and the card may output everything (the console, the GUI, and MythTV) to the TV. This is an easy solution. For other cards, you may have to edit your X server configuration file. On older versions of linux, this file would be &quot;/etc/X11/XFree86Config&quot; (there are many similar locations where it may be found). In a modern Mandrake distribution, the file that is used is &quot;/etc/X11/xorg.conf&quot; (which may just be a symlink to another config file mind you). Before going any further, make a copy of your old xorg.conf, and then you can try editing it and see if that helps. After making a change to xorg.conf, you can use Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to exit and restart the X server (and thus your window manager, KDE). If your new settings worked, then you may see output to your TV. If not, you can get back to a console by using Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, and switch back to your old xorg.conf or try something else. Some extra help can be found [http://www.schaefer.dhcp.biz/pvr350tvout.htm here] and [http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/fcmyth.php here].

To use the TV-out on the Hauppauge 350 in particular is a good idea, since the 350 has hardware MPEG decoding, which means that it will do the work of decoding the video stream, thereby taking the strain off of your processor. To enable it, there is an option in MythTV that says &quot;use hardware MPEG decoder&quot;, which will just use the 350 to output TV. Although this will output recorded playback to the 350's TV-out, you won't have your MythTV menus on that same graphics output. To get everything to work together smoothly, we need our entire X environment (including the desktop and MythTV frontend) to output using the 350's TV-out. Here's what you do:

First, modify your &quot;/usr/local/bin/start-ivtv&quot; script to load &quot;ivtv-fb&quot; also, by adding a line &quot;/sbin/modprobe ivtv-fb&quot;:

  #!/bin/bash
  # a script to start MythTV
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-core
  /sbin/modprobe i2c-algo-bit
  /sbin/modprobe tuner type=2
  /sbin/modprobe msp3400
  /sbin/modprobe videodev
  /sbin/modprobe saa7115
  /sbin/modprobe ivtv
  /sbin/modprobe ivtv-fb
  /sbin/modprobe lirc_i2c
  /usr/local/sbin/lircd -d /dev/lirc0 --permission=666
  /etc/init.d/mythbackend start

Now let's get the ivtv driver right. Essentially, X needs a driver to use the 350's TV output. What you want is for the &quot;ivtvdev_drv.o&quot; driver to end up in &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers&quot;. As usual, there are a couple of options. You can build the appropriate driver from the ivtv source you have. The source is here:
 $ find /home/mythtv -name &quot;ivtvdev*&quot;
 /home/mythtv/ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j/utils/ivtvdev_drv_o
 cd /home/mythtv/ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j/utils
The instructions to install are in &quot;/home/mythtv/ivtv-0.2.0-rc3j/utils/README.X11&quot;. So essentially you should be able to run install, which will make everything. The second way (which might be easier) is to download a binary version from [http://membres.lycos.fr/badzzzz/ somewhere], and then just copy it:
 $ cd /home/mythtv
 $ lynx http://membres.lycos.fr/badzzzz/ivtvdev_drv.o.gz
 $ tar -xvzf ivtvdev_drv.o.gz
 $ cp ivtvdev_drv.o /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers
Now we need to determine the PCI settings of your card. There are three different ways of getting this info:
 # /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg -scanpci
or
 # lspci
or
 # scanpci
What you will get will be information about the PCI address of devices. Find the one corresponding to your desired TV-out (the Hauppauge 350 card in our running example). The address is usually given in the order &quot;bus&quot;, &quot;card number&quot;, &quot;function&quot;. Pay attention to whether the numbers are decimal or hexadecimal (preceeded by 0x). The lspci and scanpci tools report in hexadecimal, whereas Xorg outputs decimal. Keep in mind that the xorg.conf file expects things to be in decimal, although you can explicitly denote hexadecimal by preceeding a value with &quot;0x&quot; (or just convert them to decimal).

The output of lspci will look something like:

The &quot;iTVC15 MPEG-2 Encoder&quot; is the capture card, which we'll use for TV-out. This card would thus be given the bus designation:
 BusID &quot;PCI:0:11:0&quot;
(Remember that 0x0b is 11 in decimal.) Now we need to know what linux device this maps to. The 350 is essentially a special kind of framebuffer device. There are many ways to do this. Let's check &quot;/var/log/messages&quot; and see what &quot;ivtv-fb.o&quot; is mapped to:
 grep fb /var/log/messages
 ...
 Jun  6 20:42:30 localhost kernel: ivtv-osd: fb1: iTVC15 TV out frame buffer device
 ...
You could also use &quot;fbset&quot; and go device by device (&quot;fbset -fb /dev/fb0&quot; then &quot;fbset -fb /dev/fb1&quot; etc.) and see which one corresponds to your required card. In our current example, the output we want is &quot;/dev/fb1&quot; (for video-card TV-out, it may end up being a /dev/fb or a /dev/video).

Now we need to reconfigure xorg.conf, armed with our new information (namely that our card is /dev/fb1 at BusID &quot;PCI:0:11:0&quot; using ivtvdev_drv.o). As usual, be warned: '''improperly configuring your video settings could damage your video card and/or monitor.''' These instructions are provided as examples. Use them '''at your own risk''' and be sure to double-check that they make sense for ''your hardware.'' Now to start, let's add a monitor:
 Section &quot;Monitor&quot;
     Identifier &quot;NTSC Television on Hauppauge card&quot;
     # D: 34.563 MHz, H: 37.244 kHz, V: 73.897 Hz
     HorizSync   30-68
     VertRefresh 50-120
     Mode &quot;720x480&quot;
          DotClock 34.564
          HTimings 720 752 840 928
          VTimings 480 484 488 504
          Flags &quot;-Hsync&quot; &quot;-Vsync&quot;
     EndMode
 EndSection
That should work for NTSC. For PAL, it would be something like:
 Section &quot;Monitor&quot;
     Identifier  &quot;PAL Television&quot;
     HorizSync  30-68
     VertRefresh 50-120
     Mode &quot;720x576&quot;
     # D: 41.475 MHz, H: 44.693 kHz, V: 74.488 Hz
          DotClock 41.476
          HTimings 720 752 840 928
          VTimings 576 580 584 600
          Flags    &quot;-HSync&quot; &quot;-VSync&quot;
     EndMode
 EndSection
Note that the Identifier in all xorg.conf sections is arbitrary. You can set it to whatever you like. However, once you decide on a name, remember to stick to it. Elsewhere in your file you must refer to the sections by name exactly. Any little typo will break your configuration. Now add a device:
 Section &quot;Device&quot;
     Identifier &quot;Hauppauge WinTV PVR 350&quot;
 #    Driver &quot;fbdev&quot;
     Driver &quot;ivtvdev&quot;
 #    Option &quot;ivtv&quot; &quot;/dev/fb1&quot;
     Option &quot;fbdev&quot; &quot;/dev/fb1&quot;
     BusID &quot;PCI:0:11:0&quot;
 EndSection
Again the identifier is arbitrary, but remember what you pick. Above we are using the &quot;ivtvdev&quot; driver and the &quot;fbdev&quot; option. The commented-out lines are alternate options that you could try using: they may be better for your particular setup (in that case, be sure to comment-out the other line to avoid conflict). Remember to update the &quot;/dev/fb1&quot; as needed by your device, and change the BusID to whatever you determined before. This is critical! Now we define a screen (this again would be slightly different for PAL):
 Section &quot;Screen&quot;
         Identifier &quot;Hauppauge Screen&quot;
         Device &quot;Hauppauge WinTV PVR 350&quot;
         Monitor &quot;NTSC Television on Hauppauge card&quot;
         DefaultDepth 24
         DefaultFbbpp 32
         Subsection &quot;Display&quot;
                    Depth 24
                    FbBpp 32
                    Modes &quot;720x480&quot;
         EndSubsection
 EndSection
Lastly we switch the ServerLayout to use our new output. Just by changing this one section, you can control what input and output devices (defined above) are going to be used. This will let you switch between different configurations easily. You can have multiple ServerLayouts defined if you like. For your new ServerLayout, it's best to copy the existing one and just modify it as needed. It will end up being something like:
 Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot;
     Identifier &quot;TVLayout&quot;
     Screen &quot;Hauppauge Screen&quot;
     InputDevice &quot;Keyboard1&quot; &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
     InputDevice &quot;Mouse1&quot; &quot;CorePointer&quot;
 EndSection
Save the file, restart X (Ctrl+Alt+Backspace if you are inside the GUI), and hopefully it will begin to output to the TV-out you wanted. Note that for some cards this won't work unless there is a device hooked to that output when X starts up. So make sure the TV is hooked up and turned on before trying to switch to/boot into your new X setting. If it didn't work, you can go back to your older settings or try something else.

===Test everything===
So now everything should be working. Upon booting, the drivers should load, and &quot;mythbackend&quot; should have started. If you use &quot;pgrep&quot; you should get a process ID number (PID) for that process:
 $ pgrep mythbackend
 5166
MythTV should start when you invoke:
 $ mythfrontend
Once MythTV is running, you should be able to select &quot;Live TV&quot; and watch TV. Using the keyboard,  you can pause ('p' key), rewind and fast-forward (arrow keys) and so forth. You should be able to go into the program guide and select a particular show, and then select &quot;Record&quot; and then wait for it to record that show. There are many options that you can adjust to suit your preferences. You may want to increase the font size or even select an entirely different theme. If the basics of MythTV are working, you can start using it, and over the next while you can continue customizing it, and getting other functions and plugins working properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MythTV}}


Once MythTV is mostly running (i.e.: you're able to pause, record and play TV), then you can start tuning your system to do exactly what you want. The possibilities are endless, but there are a couple of things you'll probably want to tweak.

==Remote control==
For your remote control to work, LIRC must be loaded. Thus, in one of your boot scripts, you should have:
 /sbin/modprobe lirc_i2c
This loads the lirc_i2c kernel module. Thereafter, you can configure your remote using the &quot;/home/mythtv/.lircrc&quot; file (which is actually a symbolic link for &quot;/home/mythtv/.mythtv/lircrc&quot;). Inside this file, you will find a bunch of statements like:
 begin
    prog = mythtv
    button = Power
    config = Esc
 end
These statements should be self-explanatory. The &quot;prog = mythtv&quot; tells LIRC that this command should be bound to the MythTV application. The &quot;button = Power&quot; tells LIRC that when the &quot;Power&quot; button on the remote is pressed, this command should be issued. The &quot;config = Esc&quot; tells LIRC what command to pass along to the application. So when I press &quot;Power&quot; MythTV will receive the &quot;Esc&quot; signal (a convenient mapping, since then you can use the power button to exit from MythTV). You can set these mappings up however you like. To find out what names are allowed for your particular remote, go to the documentation provided with LIRC (created when you untarred the LIRC source). For instance:
 $ cd /home/mythtv/lirc-0.7.1/remotes/hauppauge/
 $ emacs lircd.conf.hauppauge
Obviously you should navigate to the documentation appropriate for your remote. In the end, your lircrc file should have a bunch of begin/end statements (one for each button), which are bound to MythTV functions in a way you like. If your MythTV installation went well, there are probably already some smart defaults loaded.

To make proper use of specialty buttons, you can set key bindings. In MythWeb's settings mode you can set additional key bindings (such as using F2 to launch MythWeather directly, for instance). Then in LIRC you can set a remote button to that same key.

When using MythVideo and MythDVD, [http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/index.html mplayer] is called to show video. If you want your remote control to work with mplayer, then you can set additional bindings for mplayer. The bindings might look like:
 begin
    prog = mplayer
    button = Vol+
    config = volume +1
    repeat = 2
 end
 begin
    prog = mplayer
    button = Vol-
    config = volume -1
    repeat = 2
 end
The program is now &quot;mplayer.&quot; The allowed keys are the same as before (find the doc for your remote). The allowed &quot;config =&quot; lines are based on the commands that mplayer knows. Type &quot;mplayer -input cmdlist&quot; for a list of commands that are allowed, and then bind the ones you want. Note that the &quot;repeat = 2&quot; command controls what happens when a button is held down. That is, changing this number will control how quickly the button will repeat when held (a low number repeats fast, a high number is slow). You can play with these settings to suit your fancy. You can also find [http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/lircrc-haupgrey.txt samples] online of other people's settings, for inspiration.

[http://lircconfig.commandir.com/ LIRC Config] is a free tool that creates custom lircrc's online.

==Control set-top box with MyBlaster==
If you have a set-top box that you want to be able to control from within MythTV, you have several options. Many types of IR blasters (whether purchased or home-built) can be controlled using the [http://www.lirc.org/ LIRC] program already described.

If you're using [http://www.mytvstore.com/ My.Tv]'s [http://www.mytvstore.com/product_id_004.html MyBlaster] product, then here's what you do. First of all, note that My.TV only guarantees that the serial version of their product will be compatible with linux. You can view their [http://www.mytvstore.com/mythtv_linux.html instructions] or go to the [http://www.mythtvtalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=622#622 forum] for help. Another user of MythTV has written Perl module that lets us easily interface the MyBlaster product. So first you should download the [http://www.my.tv/download/MyBlaster14.zip MyBlaster14.zip] file from somewhere. Inside the zip file, you'll find documentation for a variety of devices (TVs, satellite boxes, etc.). Find your device type and brand, and you'll see a bunch of codes that might work for your device. So next let's test to see which code works. Let's put the MyBlaster.pl perl script into &quot;/usr/local/bin&quot; (as root):
 # cp MyBlaster.pl /usr/local/bin
Now edit this file in your favorite text editor. Change the &quot;$Device_Type=&quot; to your device type. Now change the &quot;$remote_code=&quot; to one of the codes suggested for your brand. Save the file and exit. Now turn on your set-top box (or TV, or whatever), and point your IR blaster product at the box, and type:
 # MyBlaster.pl power
This will tell the product to send the signal for &quot;power on/off&quot;. If your box turns off, then obviously the code works for your model. If nothing happens, edit the script again, and try a different code. Eventually you'll find the code that works for your product. Then inside mythtvsetup you can change the &quot;external channel change comamnd&quot; option to be &quot;/usr/local/bin/MyBlaster.pl&quot;. Now everytime MythTV wants to change channel (for that video source), it will call MyBlaster.pl, and pass the channel number as an argument. You can restart your lirc module and try it in MythTV. When you change channel, you should indeed see your set-top box change channel (remember to point your IR blaster at the device!). An alternative less expensive option is available from [http://mythblasterz.gotdns.com/ Mythblasterz].

==Control other devices==
You can in fact use your whole setup to control multiple devices, such as your set-top box and your TV (and VCR, etc.). All it takes is some imagination and time modifying the right scripts. A useful option to be aware of is setting &quot;prog = irexec&quot; inside your &quot;.lircrc&quot; file. Here's a trivial example: let's say we modify our &quot;/home/mythtv/.lircrc&quot; file to contain
 begin
    prog = irexec
    button = Power
    config = echo &quot;Hello world!&quot;
 end 
If you save these changes, and then run &quot;irexec&quot; from a command line, you should see &quot;Hello world!&quot; output to the prompt every time you press the &quot;power&quot; button on your remote control. The irexec program lets us execute arbitrary shell commands using any key on the remote. The only catch is that the irexec program has to be running. You can easily arrange for this to be the case by, for instance, adding &quot;/usr/local/bin/irexec &amp;&quot; to your &quot;/usr/local/bin/start-ivtv&quot; script (the trailing &amp; tells the command to be placed into the background).

Now we can get a little more clever. Let's say our remote buttons are mostly bound to MythTV, and we are using the &quot;MyBlaster.pl&quot; program to control our set-top box. Now say we further want the &quot;power&quot; button on our remote control to turn the television on and off (but not turn off the set-top box!). Here's what we could do. First, let's make a copy of MyBlaster.pl:
 # cd /usr/local/bin
 # cp MyBlaster.pl MyBlasterTV.pl
Now find the device code for your TV in the MyBlaster documents (figure out which one is the right code, as before, by modifying the file and trying &quot;MyBlasterTV.pl power&quot; until the TV turns off). Once your MyBlasterTV.pl file is controlling the TV, you can edit your .lircrc file and add:
 begin
    prog = irexec
    button = Power
    config = MyBlasterTV.pl power
 end 
When you press the power button on your remote, the LIRC daemon (lircd) will pass the command to &quot;irexec&quot; which simply executes &quot;MyBlasterTV.pl power&quot; which should send a signal to your IR blaster that fools your TV into turning off. Obviously you can map buttons on your remote to all sorts of different scripts. In this way, you can control a wide variety of AV equipment.

==Changing channels faster==
New users of MythTV are usually quite annoyed with how slowly it changes channels, especially if you're using a set-top box. MythTV is constantly buffering live TV. This is what allows you to pause and rewind at will. However, this also means that you're always 4-5 seconds behind live television. So, if you want to change channel, there's always a delay while buffering of the new channel starts. If you're using an IR blaster to control a set-top box, then there's an additional lag due to that. Can anything be done?

You can (slightly) optimize the channel changing of a set-top box. If you're using the MyBlaster script, you can optimize it. First off, in the &quot;/usr/local/bin/MyBlaster.pl&quot; file you can enable the finalize option by setting &quot;$finalize=1;&quot;, which will cause the blaster to send a keystroke to immediately confirm a channel change. For most remote controls there is a &quot;select&quot; or &quot;ok&quot; button that does this, so set that in the &quot;$finalize_key=&quot; section. You can also try editing the &quot;Emit_Time=0.333;&quot; option. This is the time that each keypress IR signal lasts. By reducing this, key entry will be faster. Don't reduce it too much, however, or else keypresses will be lost. You can adjust this value and see what happens. Modern set-top boxes seem to be able to handle &quot;Emit_Time=0.2;&quot; without much trouble. The &quot;$inter_key_delay=1;&quot; option can also be changed. This is the time in between key pulses. As usual, too low a setting and your box will become confused. The default 1 second is safe, but many boxes can handle 0.2 seconds without trouble. These options can make channel switching faster.

Ultimately, however, you won't be able to get rid of that last 4 seconds of buffering delay. This leaves you with two options. First, you could set up your TV so that a live signal from your set-top box goes straight to your TV, and another signal goes to your MythTV. Then you could switch between &quot;live mode&quot; and &quot;myth mode&quot; by changing the input selection on your TV. This requires some user intelligence, however, because you might be changing channels while MythTV is trying to record something, thereby ruining that recording.

Another option is to just adapt! Most users of MythTV find that after awhile they give up the whole &quot;channel surfing&quot; habit, as it is mostly a relic of not being able to find anything interesting on TV at any given moment, or being bored by commercials. With MythTV, you'll hopefully only be watching recorded shows that you like, and you'll watch them when it suits you. When you sit down to watch TV, you'll just look at the listing of recently recorded shows, and watch something that interests you. Not only that, but you'll just use the auto-commercial-skip feature to avoid boredom. Give this new paradigm a chance, and you may find that the need to compulsively change channels will disappear.

==MythWeb==
If your MythTV installation went well, then MythWeb is probably already running perfectly. On your MythTV box, open a web browser and go to &quot;http://localhost/mythweb/&quot; (or &quot;http://127.0.0.1/mythweb/&quot;). Don't forget that trailing slash, or you'll just get a &quot;page not found&quot; error! If you can see your MythWeb, then all is well. Refer to the next section for information on making it accessible worldwide on the internet. If you can't see your MythWeb, then you should probably look into the [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html options] for [http://www.apache.org/ apache], the web server that is running your MythWeb (note that the apache process/service is called httpd or httpd2 depending on your version). To modify the behavior of your MythWeb, you are meant to modify the files:
:/var/www/html/mythweb/.htaccess
:/var/www/html/mythweb/config/conf.php
These documentation also suggests that you add the option &quot;UseCanonicalName on&quot; to your apache configuration file, located at: &quot;/etc/httpd/conf/httpd2.conf&quot; However, the default is &quot;on&quot; in modern versions of apache, so adding this directive is usually not necessary.

If you have problems seeing your MythWeb page outside of your local network, then it may be that your ISP is blocking the default http port (80). You can work around this by running MythWeb on another port (anything greater than 1024, like, for example, 8050). Remember to adjust any router settings for port forwarding aswell. See elsewhere in this document for more help on that.

If you have problems seeing your MythWeb page inside your local network, but can see it outside, then probably your router is not passing internal requests properly. One easy fix is to use your MythTV's internal IP address inside your network (instead of using the domain name that you would use outside of your home network). You may want to set your MythTV to use a static IP address if you do this. You may also be able to fix this by adjusting router settings (but probably not). Alternately, you can buy a router that does port forwarding properly ([http://www.cisco.com/ Cisco] routers have been reported as being a good choice in this regard).

==Dynamic DNS==
MythWeb allows you to access your MythTV over the internet. However, to access your MythTV from outside your house (work, vacation, etc.), you need your computer to act as a web server. Linux makes running a web server easy. A program called Apache (which runs as &quot;httpd&quot;) will do everything for you. If you've installed MythTV and MythWeb properly, then apache is already running.

However, if you connect to the internet with an ISP that uses DHCP, then you're probably assigned a random IP from a pool. This means that your IP address will change periodically. This is called having a &quot;Dynamic IP address.&quot; With your address constantly changing, how will other computer know where to reach your MythWeb?

The solution is to use a DNS service that updates when your IP addres changes. Luckily, there are numerous free subscription services that will let you do this with linux. The most well-known appear to be [http://www.no-ip.com/services/page/free/dynamic/dns no-ip.com] and [http://www.dyndns.org/services/dns/dyndns/ DynDNS]. [http://www.technopagan.org/dynamic/#TheList An extensive list] of options is available. Pick the one that suits you! Most of these services will allow you to pick the domain name from a short list, and then will map your username onto that. So if your username with their service is &quot;user155&quot; then you may end up with a domain like &quot;user155.no-ip.com&quot; or whatever. Then you can get to your MythWeb anywhere. It's address will be: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://user155.no-ip.com/mythweb/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you have registered your own domain, you can point a custom subdomain to your myth box even if it has a dynamic IP.  Once you have established that user155.no-ip.com points to your box.  Add a cname record to your &quot;myMostFavoritestDomain.com.&quot; DNS zone that points mythtv.myMostFavoritestDomain.com. to user155.no-ip.com.  Make sure you end the domains with a dot.  Otherwise it appends the name of the dns zone to the name you specify.  eg: in the DNS zone entry for myMostFavoritestDomain.com. a record like &quot;mythtv.myMostFavoritestDomain.com cname user155.no-ip.com&quot; actually points &quot;mythtv.myMostFavoritestDomain.com.myMostFavoritestDomain.com&quot; to &quot;user155.no-ip.com.myMostFavoritestDomain.com&quot; which is not desirable.

You may have to play with port options in Apache if your ISP blocks port 80. Refer to other help in this document for details. These services will provide you with a program that runs on your linux box. Whenever its IP address changes, it will update the service, so that DNS lookups always get sent back to your current IP address. It's an easy (and cost-effective) way to get your own (semi-customized) domain name. If you want a full-featured domain name, you can upgrade your service easily.

==DVD menus==
By default, MythTV uses mplayer to play DVDs. However, mplayer doesn't support DVD menus. You could try installing [http://xinehq.de/index.php xine] instead, and configuring MythTV to call xine instead (see [http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man1/xine.1.html xine man page] for command line syntax).

==Trouble installing MythTV RPM for Mandrake==
You may encounter errors after trying to &quot;urpmi mythtv-suite&quot;. If during the MythTV package installation you receive errors like &quot;bad signatures&quot; try entering 'y' to continue, and see if the packages work anyway. If you get errors like &quot;installation failed&quot;, it may be because you're running Mandrake version 10.1 Community. To figure out your Mandrake version:
 $ cat /etc/mandrake-release
 $ Mandrakelinux release 10.1 (Community) for i586
This apparently has to do with conflicting files in different packages. Let the install attempt complete, then run &quot;urpmi mythtv-suite&quot; again and see what happens. You can look through the error message to isolate which packages are having problems. Try installing these packages seperately (urpmi ''package_name'') and then install MythTV again (urpmi mythtv-suite). You can also try to force the install to finish:
 # urpmi --allow-force mythtv-suite
There's no guarantee this will work, however.

==Error during make of ivtv==
There are many reasons why an ivtv compilation might fail. You can try different versions of the driver. If you are receiving missing directory errors, you might be missing a symbolic link. Check that it is correct:
 $ cd /usr/src
 $ ls -lF
 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root   19 May 28 20:50 linux -&gt; linux-2.6.8.1-12mdk/
 drwxr-xr-x  21 root root 4096 May 28 20:50 linux-2.6.8.1-12mdk/
 drwxr-xr-x   3 root root 4096 May 21 13:09 RPM/
If the symbolic link is missing or not pointing to the right place, fix it:
 # ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.8.1-12mdk /usr/src/linux
Then check this other symbolic link:
 $ cd /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk
 $ ls -lF
 lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root     15 May 28 20:07 build -&gt; /usr/src/linux/
 ...
If this one is missing, add it:
 # ln -s /usr/src/linux /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/build

In many cases, a make error is due to your kernel source version being wrong. Obviously the installed version must match the kernel you are using. If this is the problem, while trying to make ivtv, you may see errors like:
 make[2]: *** No rule to make target `modules'.  Stop.
Or, the make might work properly, but when trying to load modules, you'll get:
 ivtv FATAL: Error inserting tuner (/lib/modules/2.6.8.1-12mdk/misc/tuner.ko): Invalid module format
So first check your kernel version:
 $ uname -r
 2.6.8.1-12mdk
And see what you have installed:
 $ rpm -qa | grep kernel
 kernel-source-2.6-2.6.8.1-12mdk
 kernel-2.6.8.1.12mdk-1-1mdk
Make sure the source matches your current kernel version. If it doesn't, then you should uninstall the old source:
 # urpme kernel-source-2.4.27
Obviously replace &quot;2.4.27&quot; with whatever your &quot;not right source&quot; happens to be! Now add the source you really want:
 # urpmi kernel-source-2.6-2.6.8.1-12mdk
Again, modify the syntax to match your current kernel. You may have to use urpmq to query the available rpms until you find the one that matches. You may also need to configure urpmi to use online media repositories of rpms to give you access to the rpm you need (see elsewhere in this doc or refer to the [http://easyurpmi.zarb.org/ Easy urpmi] website). Don't simply use &quot;urpmi kernel-source&quot; or even &quot;urpmi kernel-source-2.6&quot; since these won't necessarily give you the exact source you want.

Double check that your source now matches your kernel version (otherwise nothing will compile properly!), and ivtv should now compile.

If ivtv still won't compile, try other versions or look up the error messages on the various [http://www.shspvr.com/smf/ ivtv forums] and [http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/ivtv/devel/ mailing list archives].

==Time in program guide off by one hour==
This is a well-known bug in MythTV caused by QT. It seems to only manifest itself half of the year (due to daylight savings time). Setting a one-hour offset inside MythTV does not solve this. If this is indeed your problem, then change your current timezone to be one hour ahead of where you are actually located. Then run &quot;mythfilldatabase&quot; again (you might also have to delete the channel listing in mythtvsetup and recreate it after filling the database). With your timezone setting off by one hour, everything should look normal in MythTV.

==mplayer won't output to my TV-out==
If you have MythTV outputting to the TV properly, but mplayer isn't (i.e.: videos and DVDs are not sent to the TV-out), then try changing the driver that mplayer uses. Inside the MythTV settings for MythDVD and MythVideo, there is a line that allows you to call an external program, that probably looks like this:
 mplayer -fs -zoom -quiet -vo xv %s
What you need to do is find out what driver to use. The &quot;-vo xv&quot; is trying to use the xv driver, but there are many others (xv, x11, fbdev, fbdev2, etc.). The complete list can be obtained by typing &quot;mplayer -vo help&quot;:
        xv      X11/Xv
        x11     X11 ( XImage/Shm )
        xover   General X11 driver for overlay capable video output drivers
        xmga    Matrox G200/G4x0/G550 overlay in X11 window (using /dev/mga_vid)
        mga     Matrox G200/G4x0/G550 overlay (/dev/mga_vid)
        gl      X11 (OpenGL)
        gl2     X11 (OpenGL) - multiple textures version
        dga     DGA ( Direct Graphic Access V2.0 )
        sdl     SDL YUV/RGB/BGR renderer (SDL v1.1.7+ only!)
        ggi     General Graphics Interface (GGI) output

        pnm     PPM/PGM/PGMYUV file
        md5sum  md5sum of each frame
For the Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350, using &quot;-vo x11&quot; seems to work fine (although it is a frame-buffer device, so perhaps fbdev could be made to work). Try different settings and see what works for your TV-out. You can always do &quot;man mplayer&quot; for help from the [http://tivo-mplayer.sourceforge.net/docs/mplayer-man.html manual page].

==No volume control with Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350==
If you're using the TV-out on your Hauppauge 350 to run MythTV, you'll quickly discover that the volume and mute functions don't do anything. You can hear sound, but not modify it. As of the writing of this document, the ivtv driver does not support control of volume. This leaves you with two options. You can control the volume using a different remote control (use the one for your TV, for instance). You may even be able to configure your IR blaster, via LIRC, to control your TV properly. Alternately, you can feed the audio output from your capture card into your sound card, and then send the output from your sound card into the TV. That way, volume control (via the sound card) is under control of the OS. Hence when MythTV tries to change volume, it will indeed affect what you hear.

==No sound in mplayer when using Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350==
If you've followed the instructions above to get mplayer to work with the TV-out on your capture card, you may discover that no audio is being played through your capture card's TV-out. By default, mplayer will be sending audio to your computer's sound card. The simple fix is to feed your audio out from your capture card into your sound card, and use the output from the sound card for the TV. That way, mplayer can play sound to the TV, and so can MythTV when it is buffering video through the Hauppauge capture card TV-out.

==Can't boot cleanly into TV-out==
If you're using a startup script (as shown elsewhere in this guide), you may find that you can't boot cleanly into your TV-out. That is, you may be able to get the TV out to work once your window manager is up and running (you can switch graphics mode into the TV output), but that you can't simply boot into the TV-out video mode. The ServerLayout you have defined in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file for your TV-out works properly, but the problem appears to be that the required modules are not loaded when X tries to use the TV-out drivers.

First off, using a startup script (like the /usr/local/bin/start-ivtv suggested elsewhere in this document) is not as good as using modprobe properly. That is, you should be loading modules by adding appropriate lines to your /etc/modprobe.conf file. Some users have found that this doesn't work, however, and that they must use a script that is called from /etc/rc.d/rc.local during startup.

A workaround to boot into the TV-out anyway is to let your computer boot into a normal window session (into GNOME, KDE, or whatever you're using) and then have that window session launch a new X window session onto your TV-out, and use that new X session to run mythfrontend. To implement this, first edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to have at least two different &quot;ServerLayout&quot; sections. Make sure that each of these layouts work properly and independantly before you try to make this trick work.

  Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot;
      Identifier &quot;layout1&quot;
      InputDevice &quot;Keyboard1&quot; &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
      InputDevice &quot;Mouse1&quot; &quot;CorePointer&quot;
      Screen &quot;screen1&quot;
  EndSection
  Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot;
      Identifier &quot;TVlayout&quot;
      Screen &quot;Hauppauge Screen&quot;
      InputDevice &quot;Keyboard1&quot; &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
      InputDevice &quot;Mouse1&quot; &quot;CorePointer&quot;
  EndSection

It's very important that the Identifier contains '''no spaces'''. If the identifier contains spaces in the name, then it will cause a bug with the startx function (which we'll use later). So don't call your layout &quot;TV layout&quot;, use &quot;TVlayout&quot; instead. Again make sure that the two layouts both work for their respective output sources (monitor or TV) before going to the next step. Now we can make a little script that, during the startup of KDE, will either launch our new instance, or launch mythfrontend, depending on the situation.

  #!/bin/bash
  if [ &quot;$DISPLAY&quot;  = &quot;:1&quot; ]
  then
      # We are in the second KDE instance
      # Launch mythTV
      echo &quot;Launching MythTV...&quot;
      mythfrontend &amp;
  else
      # We are in the first KDE instance
      # Launch a new KDE on the Hauppauge card
      echo &quot;Launching new KDE instance on Hauppauge 350...&quot;
      startx -- :1 -layout &quot;TVlayout&quot;
  fi

Save this script as /home/mythtv/.kde/Autostart/mythscript.sh (or whatever). As usual, make it executable:

 $ chmod +x mythscript.sh

If it's not obvious, this is what the script does: First, it checks the current $DISPLAY environment variable (you can use &quot;set&quot; to play with environment variables). This variable specifies the display in our current context. Normally, $DISPLAY is something like &quot;:0.0&quot; which means screen 0. In our script, however, we start the TV-out on screen 1 explicitly. So if the script finds that it's running on screen 1, then it launches mythTV. Alternately, if it's not being launched on screen 1, then it must be running on the default screen 0, which means that it's the first instance of KDE, and it should start a new instance of KDE, and send it to screen 1.

The startx command launches a new X session (and runs the default window manager, which is KDE in this example). The &quot;:1&quot; says to explicitly run this on &quot;screen 1&quot;. The &quot;-layout&quot; option lets us pick exactly which ServerLayout to use. Obviously replace this with the ServerLayout that you have working for your TV-out.

With this script in the /home/mythtv/.kde/Autostart/ directory, it will run automatically when a new KDE session starts. Thus, when the computer boots, it will start KDE (on the default screen 0), and run the script. This script will not be on screen 1, so it will run startx to generate a new instance of KDE on screen 1, using the &quot;TVlayout&quot; ServerLayout. This new KDE session will start, and it will also automatically run the script. This time, the script will see that it is running on screen 1, so it will just launch mythfrontend.

This little work-around should get your MythTV booting into your TV-out transparently (although somewhat slowly).

==Blue lines during playback==
If you're seeing &quot;faint blue lines&quot; across the screen, you should use the &quot;xvattr&quot; command to fix this (according to [http://www.byopvr.com/Sections+index-req-viewarticle-artid-13-page-1.html Maiku's guide]). Try this:
 # urpmi xvattr
 $ xvattr -a XV_COLORKEY -v 0
If that fixes it, then you should run the command every time X starts. Reportedly, adding the command to &quot;.xinirc&quot; conflicts with X. Instead, you could add the command to a script and then put the script in &quot;/home/mythtv/.kde/Autostart/&quot;

==I forgot to add a channel to zap2it==
If you forgot to add a channel when you initially signed up for your zap2it (DataDirect) account, or want to otherwise modify your channel listing, here's what you have to do. Unfortunately, it appears that the only way for the changes to &quot;take&quot; is to completely erase the old channel listing and then download the listing again. First, log into your [http://labs.zap2it.com/ zap2it account], make your changes and save them. Then, you should run &quot;mythtvsetup&quot; and copy down the info you have entered under &quot;3. video sources&quot; and &quot;4. Input connections.&quot; 

Now, exit setup and shutdown the backend for now, and re-enter setup:
 # /etc/init.d/mythbackend stop
 # mythtvsetup
This time, say &quot;yes, delete my channel settings&quot; and then re-configure it like you had it before. Be sure to select &quot;download listing&quot; to get the new channel listings. Then exit mythtvsetup and re-fill the database:
 # mythfilldatabase
 # /etc/init.d/mythbackend start
 $ mythfrontend
Now your modifications to the channel listings should have taken effect.

==MythWeb isn't accessible outside my local network==
If you can get to your MythWeb by using &quot;http://localhost/mythweb/&quot; on your MythTV machine (and perhaps even get to it by using &quot;http://internal.ip/mythweb/&quot; but can't access your MythWeb from anywhere else, then perhaps your ISP is blocking port 80. Some ISPs do this to protect you from viruses and such, whereas others block it to prevent you from running a web server. In any case, you can work around this by using a port number greater than 1024. To do this, you'll need to edit your [http://www.apache.org/ apache2] configuration file, which serves up the MythWeb files. So edit &quot;/etc/httpd/conf/httpd2.conf&quot; and add a line like:
 Listen 8050
You can use whatever port you like (8050 is just an example). Note that older versions of apache would use a command like &quot;Port 8050&quot; but &quot;Listen&quot; is the new version (refer to [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html core features] documentation). Now you should be able to access your MythWeb from anywhere by using &quot;http://your.ip.address:8050/mythweb/&quot; or &quot;http://your.domain.name:8050/mythweb/&quot;.

Remember to update your router settings (if applicable). Log into your router (most have a web-page on some pre-defined IP address; check your documents), and enable port forwarding for port 8050 to the IP address of your MythTV box inside your local network.

==I can't log into KDE anymore: dcopserver error!==
At some point in your fiddling with MythTV, it may crash and take KDE with it. Afterwards you won't be able to get back into KDE (much less run MythTV). You may get an error message like this:
  There was an error setting up inter-process communications for KDE.
  The message returned by the system was:
  Could not read network connection list
  /home/mythtv/.DCOPserver_localhost__0
  Please check that the &quot;dcopserver&quot; program is running!
You may also notice other errors when trying to run X from a command line:
  usr/X11R6/bin/iceauth:
  timeout in locking authority file /home/mythtv/.ICEauthority
  Failed to load module &quot;usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.a
  FBIOPAN_DISPLAY: invalid argument
This problem is easy to fix. Just delete any files to do with ICE and DCOP:
 $ cd /home/mythtv
 $ rm .ICEauthority*
 $ rm .DCOPserver*
 # reboot
The deleted files will be re-created by KDE during logon, and everything should work after that.

==I lost my MySQL password==
If you have lost (i.e. you forgot) the root password for the MySQL database system, then you cannot retrieve it, but you can reset it. First, stop the mysql daemon that is running:
 $ su
 # service mysql stop
Then start the daemon again, but this time without access control:
 mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &amp;
(Remember, the &amp; at the end is important: it puts the process in the background.) Now enter the &quot;mysql&quot; database and set a new password for the root user:
 # mysql -uroot mysql 
 &gt; UPDATE user SET password=PASSWORD(&quot;abcdef&quot;) WHERE user=&quot;root&quot;; 
 &gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
 &gt; exit
Where (obviously) &quot;abcdef&quot; is the password you want to set. Now restart the server, just to be safe:
 # service mysql restart
You can test that the new password works:
 $ mysql -u root -p
(and then enter the password), or simply:
 $ mysql -u root -pabcdef

Installing and configuring MythTV can be a challenge. However, there's no denying that having a functional MythTV is both a matter of fun and pride. There's so much a MythTV can do, that you'll be happily playing and tinkering for a while to come. Also, most users of MythTV note that they change their viewing habits entirely. Instead of watching TV based on the network's choices, you can watch on your own schedule. This doesn't necessarily mean you'll watch more TV. Rather, you'll find that the time you spend watching TV is better spent. You watch quality shows and don't waste time surfing, unable to find something interesting on TV when you are in the mood to watch. You'll also be amazed how many good shows and movies routinely play on TV (especially at odd hours). By using your MythTV, you'll be able to finally take full advantage of your subscription to cable or satellite television. It's a liberating experience, especially because you're in full control of both your TV viewing experience, and the hardware/software that makes it all possible. So enjoy it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Topological spaces ==

Given an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a subset of the power set of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''topology'' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if it includes
*(i) the empty set and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;
*(ii) the union of any subset of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and
*(iii) the intersection of any two members of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
The members of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are said to be ''open'' in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Immediate examples of topologies are &lt;math&gt;\{ \varnothing, X \}&lt;/math&gt; and the power set of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. They are called ''trivial'' and ''discrete'' topologies, respectively. In the discrete topology, every set is open. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are the only subsets that are open in the trivial topology.

In application, we are usually given some set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (which often carries an intrinsic structure on its own) and then ''induce a topology'' to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by defining a &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; according to how we want to do analysis on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The key insight here is that saying some set is open and another closed is merely the matter of labeling. One way to induce a topology is to combine existing ones. For that, we use:

'''1 Lemma''' ''The intersection of topologies for the same set is again a topology for the set.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of topologies for the same set. If &lt;math&gt;\tau \subset \cap \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\tau \subset&lt;/math&gt; every member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, which is closed under unions. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\cup \tau&lt;/math&gt; is in every member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. The other properties can be verified in the same manner. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Another common method of inducing a topology is to define topology from convergence of filters. A filter &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''converge to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'' if &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; contains every neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The convergence depends on which sets are considered neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, it depends on a topology. We could go in the other way: given a collection of filters &lt;math&gt;s \to x&lt;/math&gt;, we declare sets to be ''open'' so that &lt;math&gt;s \to x&lt;/math&gt;. We only have to check this in fact defines a topology.

Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a function to some topological space. Then the set of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (G)&lt;/math&gt; for every open set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a the weakest among topologies that make &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; continuous. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of functions defined on the same set, then a ''weak topology generated by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the intersection of the weakest topology that makes each member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; continuous. A weak topology is indeed a topology since the intersection of topologies for the same set is again a topology by Lemma.

Two important types of topological spaces are constructed by this method: product and quotient spaces.

A subset &lt;math&gt;E \subset X&lt;/math&gt; is said ''closed'' in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;E \backslash X&lt;/math&gt; is ''open''. The intersection of all closed set containing &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''closure'' of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;. By (iii) in the definition, the closure of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Moreover, a set is closed if and only if &lt;math&gt;E = \overline{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''1 Lemma'''
*''(i) &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i \in I} \overline{E_i} \subset \overline{\cup E_i}&lt;/math&gt; where the inequality holds if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is finite'', and
*''(ii) &lt;math&gt;\overline{\bigcap_{i \in I} E_i} \subset \bigcap_{i \in I} \overline{E_i}&lt;/math&gt;.''
Proof: (i) Since &lt;math&gt;\overline{E_j} \subset \overline{\bigcup_i E_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j \in I&lt;/math&gt; the desired inequality holds, and since the finite union of closed sets is closed the equality holds if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is finite. A similar argument shows (ii).&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A ''neighborhood'' of a point &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; is an &quot;open&quot; subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. A point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in the closure of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; intersects &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Paraphrasing in the language of filter, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in the closure of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; if and only if a filter containing &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

In a sense, a filter is a generalization of the notion of &quot;neighborhoods of a point.&quot; This explains why a filter, by definition, doesn't contain the empty set (the empty set is a neighborhood of no point as well as the property &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is in a filter then any set containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is in the filter (if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood of a point , then any larger set should also be a neighborhood of that point.) In fact, given a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in some set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;f = \{ A \subset X : x \in A \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt;. We say &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is ''continuous'' when its pre-image of every open set in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is open.

'''1.4 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;. The following are equivalent:''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.''
* ''(ii) If &lt;math&gt;V \subset X&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset and &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f[U] \subset V&lt;/math&gt;.
* ''(iii) If a filter &lt;math&gt;s \to x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f[s] \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.''
Proof: (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii) &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in V&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x \in f^{-1}[V]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[V]&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f[f^{-1}[V]] \subset V&lt;/math&gt;. Take &lt;math&gt;U = f^{-1}[V]&lt;/math&gt;. (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii): If &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then there is &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as in (ii). Since &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, by convergence, &lt;math&gt;U \in s&lt;/math&gt;; thus, &lt;math&gt;f[U] \in f[s]&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;V \in f[s]&lt;/math&gt;. (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i): We claim:
:&lt;math&gt;f[\overline{E}] \subset \overline{f[E]}&lt;/math&gt;
for any subset &lt;math&gt;E \subset Y&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose a filter &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; converges to some point &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;. By (iii), &lt;math&gt;f[s] \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. This proves the claim. (By the way, the claim is then another equivalent definition of continuity.) Now, given a closed subset &lt;math&gt;F \subset X&lt;/math&gt;, applying the claim we get:
:&lt;math&gt;f[\overline{f^{-1}[F]}] \subset \overline{f[f^{-1}[F]]} \subset \overline{F} = F&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;\overline{f^{-1}[F]} \subset f^{-1}[F]&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[F]&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Since &lt;math&gt;Y \backslash f^{-1}(U) = f^{-1}(X \backslash U)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is an open mapping then. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, (iii) means that if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete space, then every function on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

'''1 Theorem''' ''The composite of continuous functions is again continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: If a filter &lt;math&gt;s \to x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f[s] \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)[s] \to (g \circ f)(x)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A subset of a topological space is ''locally closed'' if it can be written as the intersection of a closed set and open set. (Note: sets here are allowed to be empty; so, closed sets and open sets are locally closed.) Equivalently, a set is locally closed if and only if it is open in its closure.

A topological space is said to be ''connected'' if it is not a disjoint union of nonempty open sets. Equivalently, a topological space is connected if it has no proper open closed subsets.

A topological space is said to be ''irreducible'' if it cannot be written as a union of two proper closed subsets.

'''1. Theorem''' ''Let ''X'' be a topological space. Then the following are equivalent. 
*''(i) ''X'' is irreducible.''
*''(ii) Every nonempty open subset of ''X'' is dense.''
*''(iii) Every open subset of ''X'' (in particular ''X'') is connected.''
Proof: (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii): Let &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty open subset. ''X'' is then the union of &lt;math&gt;\overline{U}&lt;/math&gt; and the complement of ''U''. By (i), &lt;math&gt;\overline{U}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be a proper subset. (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (iii): Let ''A'' and ''B'' be open subsets. By (ii), &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is dense and so intersects ''B''. (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i): If ''X'' is not irreducible, then ''X'' is the union of proper closed subsets ''A'' and ''B''. Then &lt;math&gt;(X \backslash A) \cup (X \backslash B)&lt;/math&gt; is the disjoint union of nonempty open subsets; thus, not connected. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X'' is irreducible, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{C}(X, \mathbf{C})&lt;/math&gt; is a domain. (Consider the zero set of the product &lt;math&gt;fg&lt;/math&gt;)

'''1. Corollary''' ''A continuous image of an irreducible space ''X'' is again irreducible.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to f(X)&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous map. Let &lt;math&gt;V \subset f(X)&lt;/math&gt; be an open subset. Then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is open. By (ii) in the theorem and continuity, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;f(X) = f(\overline{f^{-1}(V)}) \subset \overline{f(f^{-1}(V))} \subset \overline{V}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Compact sets and Hausdorff spaces ==

A subset of a topological space is said to be ''compact'' if every ultrafilter in it converges to exactly one point. (Note: This definition, due to Bourbaki, is slightly different but much simpler than one in literature.) In particular, a compact set is closed, and a closed subset of a compact space is compact.

'''1 Theorem''' ''A continuous function sends compact sets to compact sets.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a compact set, and suppose &lt;math&gt;f[s]&lt;/math&gt; is an ultrafilter on K. Then s is an ultrafilter and so converges to, say, x. By continuity, f[s] converges to f(x).&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Corollary''' ''A function with compact graph is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a function that has compact graph. Let &lt;math&gt;\pi: \operatorname{gra}(f) \to Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i:X \to \operatorname{gra}(f)&lt;/math&gt; be canonical surjection and injection, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;f = \pi^{-1} \circ i&lt;/math&gt;. By hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is a closed map; its inverse is thus continuous. Hence, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A function is said to be ''proper'' if the pre-image of a compact set is compact.

'''1 Theorem''' ''A function &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is proper if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;x_n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;x_n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that every compact set contains only finite many &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) is obvious. For the converse, suppose ''f'' is not proper. Then there exists a compact subset &lt;math&gt;K \subset X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(K)&lt;/math&gt; is not compact. The non-compactness allows us to find a strictly increasing sequence &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; of open subsets such that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(K) \not \subset U_n&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; but the union &lt;math&gt;\bigcup U_n&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Inductively, we can then find a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n \in f^{-1}(K)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_n \in U_n \backslash U_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \not\to \infty&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \in K&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;x_n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, suppose &lt;math&gt;L \subset X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact subset. Since &lt;math&gt;\{ x_1, x_2, ... \}&lt;/math&gt; consists of isolated points; thus, closed, the set &lt;math&gt;\{ x_1, x_2, ... \} \cap L&lt;/math&gt; is a compact subset, of which &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover. Thus, there is some &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;U_{n_0} \supset \{ x_1, x_2, ... \} \cap L &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x_n \not\in L&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n &gt; n_0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Theorem''' ''A topological space X is compact if and only if, for all topological 
spaces Y, the projection &lt;math&gt;X \times Y \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is closed.''

A Hausdorff space ''X'' is said to be ''compactly generated'' if closed subsets ''A'' of ''X'' are exactly subsets such that &lt;math&gt;A \cap K&lt;/math&gt; is closed in ''K'' for all compact subsets &lt;math&gt;K \subset X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''1 Theorem (Tychonoff's product theorem)''' ''The following are equivanelt:
*(i) Every product space of compact spaces is compact.
*(ii) Axiom of Choice.
Proof: (i) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii). Let &lt;math&gt;\{ X_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in A}&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of compact spaces and &lt;math&gt;\pi_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be a projection from &lt;math&gt;\prod X_\alpha \to X_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be an ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;\prod X_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\pi_\alpha (\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; is again an ultrafilter and &lt;math&gt;X_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is compact, &lt;math&gt;\pi_\alpha (\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; must converge. Then it follows that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; converges. Axiom of Choice implies that the product space is compact. Conversely, let &lt;math&gt;\{ X_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in A}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty collection of nonempty sets. Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be a point such that &lt;math&gt;p \in X_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Such a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; must exist; if not, the intersection of &lt;math&gt;X_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is ''the'' universal set, contradicting that it is a proper class. For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha = X_\alpha \cup \{ p \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_\alpha = \{ 0, p, X_\alpha, Y_\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\tau_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a topology for &lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and since finiteness is compact. Using (i) &lt;math&gt;\prod Y_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is compact and thus &lt;math&gt;\{ X_\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt; has the finite intersection property and this implies the statement equivalent to (ii). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A topological space ''X'' is called a ''Tychonoff space'' if it is Hausdorff and, given a closed set ''F'' and a point ''x'' outside ''F'', there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f = 1&lt;/math&gt; on ''F'' and &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''cover'' of the set E is a collection of sets {&lt;math&gt;G_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;} such that &lt;math&gt;E \subset \bigcup G_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. An ''open cover'' of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; consisting of open sets, or equivalently, a subset of the topology whose union contains &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. A subset of ''cover'' of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''subcover'' if it is again a cover of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

'''1 Theorem''' ''A topological space is compact if and only if
*''(i) Every open cover of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains a subcover that is a finite set, and ''
*''(ii) X is Hausdorff.''
Proof: (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) (ii) is immediate. For (i), we first remark that the following are equivalent:
*(a) Every nonempty collection of closed subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the finite intersection property is nonempty.
*(b) Every nonempty collection of closed subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with empty intersection contains a finite subcollection with empty intersection.
*(i).
To see the equivalence of (i) and (b), consider the collection consisting of &lt;math&gt;U_j^c&lt;/math&gt;, given an open cover &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt;. We shall prove (a). Let &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty collection of closed sets with the finite intersection property, and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{s}&lt;/math&gt; be an ultrafilter containing &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\tilde{s}&lt;/math&gt; converges to, say, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;x \in \cap \tilde{s} \subset \cap s&lt;/math&gt;.
(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) Because of (ii), we only have to show that every ultrafilter converges to some point. Let &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; be an ultrafilter. Since &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; has the finite intersection property, by an equivalent form of (i), &lt;math&gt;\cap s&lt;/math&gt; has a point, say, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. For every  neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we have either&lt;math&gt;U \in s&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;U^c \in s&lt;/math&gt;. The latter not being the case, we have &lt;math&gt;U \in s&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;s \to x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Corollary''' ''If &lt;math&gt;K_n \supset K_{n_1} \supset ...&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of compact sets, then &lt;math&gt;\cap_{n=1}^\infty K_n&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty.''

A set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is ''compact'' if every open cover {&lt;math&gt;G_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;} of it has a finite subcover; i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;K \subset G_1 \cup G_2 \cdots \cup G_n \subset \bigcup G_\alpha &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
For example, let &lt;math&gt;\{ G_\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt; be open cover of the finite set &lt;math&gt;\{ a_1, a_2, ... a_n \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then for each &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt;, we can find some &lt;math&gt;G(a_k)&lt;/math&gt;. It thus follows that a finite set (e.g., the empty set) is compact since
:&lt;math&gt;\{ a_1, a_2, ... a_n \} \subset G(a_1) \cup G(a_2) \cup ... G(a_n) \subset \bigcup G_\alpha &lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, every compact subset of a discrete space is finite.

'''1 Theorem''' ''If a topological space is the union of countably many compact sets, then any of its open cover admits a countable subcover.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;K_j&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of compact sets, and suppose that its union is covered by some open cover &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;j = 1, 2, ...&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover of &lt;math&gt;K_j&lt;/math&gt;, it admits a finite subcover &lt;math&gt;\gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;K_j&lt;/math&gt;. Now, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1 \cup \gamma_2 ...&lt;/math&gt; is a countable subcover of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

'''1 Theorem''' ''The following are equivalent:''
* (i) Axiom of Choice.
* (ii) Every product topology of compact topologies is compact. (Tychonoff's product theorem)
* (iii) Something has empty intersection.
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a product topology and &lt;math&gt;\{ \pi_\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of projections on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be an ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\pi_\alpha (\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; is again an ultrafilter and &lt;math&gt;\pi_\alpha (X)&lt;/math&gt; is compact, &lt;math&gt;\pi_\alpha (\mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; converges. From the lemma 1.something it follows that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; converges. If (i) is true, then the convergence implies that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compact. To show (ii) implies (iii), Let &lt;math&gt;\{ X_\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty collection of nonempty sets. Also, let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be a element such that &lt;math&gt;a \not\in \cap X_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Such an element must exist since the contrary means that &lt;math&gt;\cap X_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the universal set. For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha = X_\alpha \cup \{a\}&lt;/math&gt; and induce the topology &lt;math&gt;\tau_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; by letting &lt;math&gt;\tau_\alpha = \{ 0, \{a\}, X_\alpha, Y_\alpha \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then since its topology is finite, each &lt;math&gt;Y_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is compact. That (iii) implies (i) is well known in set theory. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

We say a point is ''isolated'' if the set &lt;math&gt;{x}&lt;/math&gt; is both open and closed, otherwise called an ''limit point''. If a set has no limit point, then the set is said to be ''discrete''.

'''1 Lemma''' ''Every infinite subset &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of a compact space &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has a limit point.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;E \subset K&lt;/math&gt; be infinite and discrete. Then &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is closed since it contains all of limit points of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset of a compact set, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is compact. It now follows: for each &lt;math&gt;x \in E&lt;/math&gt;, the singleton &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is open and thus the collection &lt;math&gt;\{ \{x\} : x \in E \}&lt;/math&gt; is an open cover of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, which admits a finite subcover. Hence, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;E \subset \{ x_1, x_2, ... x_n \}&lt;/math&gt;,
contradicting that &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is infinite. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;.

We say a topological space is ''Hausdorff'' if two distinct points are covered by disjoint open sets. This definition can be strengthened considerably.

'''1 Theorem''' ''A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff if and only if every pair of disjoint compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be covered by two disjoint open sets.&lt;br /&gt;''

For each &lt;math&gt;y \in K_2&lt;/math&gt; we can find disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;A(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(y)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \in A(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in B(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt; is compact, there is a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n \in K_2&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;K_2 \subset B(y_1) \cup B(y_2) ... B(y_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;A(x) = A(y_1) \cap A(y_2) \cap ... A(y_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B = B(y_1) \cup B(y_2) ... B(y_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint from any of &lt;math&gt;B(y_1) ... B(y_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint. &lt;math&gt;A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is open since it is a finite intersection of open sets. Since &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; is compact, there is a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_n \in K_1&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;K_1 \subset A(x_1) \cup A(x_2) ... A(x_n) \subset B^c \subset {K_2}^c&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Theorem''' ''A topological space is Hausdorff if and only if a filter &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; on it converges, if it ever does, to at most one point.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; converges to two distinct points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. By the separation axioms, we can find disjoint subjects &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in B&lt;/math&gt;. Since convergence, &lt;math&gt;\{ A, B \} \subset \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. But this then implies that &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = 0 \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A Hausdorff space is said to be ''locally compact'' if every point in it has a compact neighborhood. A locally compact space is thus locally closed.

We also give two other characterizations of Hausdorff spaces, which are sometimes useful in application.

'''1 Lemma''' ''A topological space &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff if and only if for every point &lt;math&gt;p \in T&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\{ p \}&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection of all of its closed neighborhoods.''&lt;br /&gt;

'''1 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a family of functions from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to a Hausdorff space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be the union of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (G)&lt;/math&gt; taken all over open sets &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the Hausdorff separation axiom if and only if for each &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x \ne y&lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ne f(y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: First suppose the separation axiom. Then we can find two disjoint sets &lt;math&gt;A, B \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in B&lt;/math&gt;. Then since by definition, there is some function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and sets &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A = f^{-1}(G_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = f^{-1}(G_2)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ne f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, suppose the family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; separates points in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the separation axiom there  are disjoint open open sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in B&lt;/math&gt;. Then by the definition of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint and both open. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be continuous. If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff, then the graph of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is closed.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the complement of the graph of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;(x, y)\in E&lt;/math&gt;, then, since &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ne y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff, we can find in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; disjoint neighborhoods &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. It follows: &lt;math&gt;(x, y) \in f^{-1}(U) \times V \subset E&lt;/math&gt; since there is no point &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;z \in f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(z) \in V&lt;/math&gt;. By continuity, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open; thus, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is open. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f, g: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; be continuous functions. Suppose &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff. If &lt;math&gt;f = g&lt;/math&gt; on some dense subset, then &lt;math&gt;f = g&lt;/math&gt; identically.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the intersection of the graph of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the graph of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is dense in the graph of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by hypothesis and closed by the preceding theorem. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Theorem''' ''A dense subspace X of a compact Hausdorff space Y is locally compact if and only if X is an open subset of Y.''

A ''graph'' of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the set consisting of ordered pairs &lt;math&gt;(x, f(x))&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in&lt;/math&gt; the domain of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. In the set-theoretic view, of course this set ''is'' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. But since we usually do not see a function as a set, the notion is often handy to use.

'''1 Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a function. Suppose &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is locally compact. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuos on every compact subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in U&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt; is an open subset. By local compactness, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V \subset K \subset U&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a compact set. Since &lt;math&gt;f|_K&lt;/math&gt; is continuous by hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; such that: &lt;math&gt;f(W) \subset V&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Topological groups ==
Let ''G''  be a topological group, which we don't assume to be Hausdorff. 

'''1 Theorem'''
*''(i) ''G'' is Hausdorff if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{e\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed.''
*''(ii) If ''G'' is Hausdorff, then its discrete subgroup is closed.''
Proof: Left to the reader. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 Theorem (Baire)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a locally compact space. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is written as a union of countably many sets, then one of those sets contains a nonempty open subset.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Similar to one given in [[w:Baire category theorem]].

'''1 Corollary''' ''If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is countable and locally compact, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is discrete.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: We write &lt;math&gt;G = \{ g_1, g_2, ... \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\{g_j\}&lt;/math&gt; is then open for some &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;\{g_j^{-1}\}&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\{e\}&lt;/math&gt; is open. (Recall that every finite subset of a Hausdorff space is closed.) Hence, every subset of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is open and closed. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the only topology that makes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; a locally compact topological group is the discrete one.

'''1. Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;K \subset G&lt;/math&gt; be a compact subset. Then &lt;math&gt;C(K)&lt;/math&gt; consists of uniformly continuous functions.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: We only show right uniform continuity, since the proof for the left uniform continuity is completely analogous. Let &lt;math&gt;f \in C(K)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. By continuity, for each &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;V_x&lt;/math&gt; of ''e'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon \qquad &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for all &lt;math&gt;y \in x {V_x}^2&lt;/math&gt;.
(Note: by the continuity of translation, for any neighborhood ''V'' of ''e'', one can always find another neighborhood ''W'' of ''e'' such that &lt;math&gt;W^2 \subset V&lt;/math&gt;.) By compactness, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the union of some &lt;math&gt;x_1 V_{x_1}, x_2 V_{x_2}, ..., x_n V_{x_n}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;V = \cap_k V_{x_k}&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for all &lt;math&gt;y \in x V&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, if &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x \in x_k V_{x_k}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and so:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| \le |f(y) - f(x_k)| + |f(x_k) - f(x)| &lt; 2\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for all &lt;math&gt;y \in x V&lt;/math&gt;.
for any &lt;math&gt;y \in x V \subset x_k {V_{x_k}}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''1. Corollay''' ''Every function in &lt;math&gt;C_c(G)&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous.'' (Actually, true for C_0(G)?)

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Stuttering isn't a physical disorder. It's not a psychological disorder. Stuttering is a &lt;i&gt;developmental disorder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children grow up in a certain order. They crawl before they walk. They walk before they run. They run before they ride bicycles. They ride bicycles before they borrow your car keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually. Some children walk before they crawl. My three-year-old nephew borrows my car all the time. Just joking. I don't own a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each stage of physical development, a child's brain develops too. E.g., crawling helps the child develop communication between the left and right hemispheres of his brain. If all goes well, the child's physical, neurological, and psychological systems develop together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small, sometimes imperceptible, developmental misstep in early childhood can nudge a child off the normal developmental track. The child then grows on an abnormal developmental track. A minor problem can develop into a major disability as the child grows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Language-Learning Impairment&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Some children can't hear the difference between short duration speech sounds. The difference between /b/ and /d/ sounds occurs within a few milliseconds (thousands of a second). Some children's brains' auditory processing isn't fast enough to hear fast speech sounds. To these kids, &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dad&amp;quot; are the same word, &amp;quot;bug&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dug&amp;quot; are the same, and so are &amp;quot;buck&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;duck.&amp;quot; (This is a form of &lt;i&gt;central auditory processing disorder&lt;/i&gt;, or CAPD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd think this would be a minor problem. After all, you know the difference between &amp;quot;sew&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;so.&amp;quot; But it's not a minor problem. These children develop speech slower than other children. Slow speech development causes them to miss other developmental stages. Their grammar develops poorly. Listeners have difficulty understanding these children's speech. These children understand the difference between boys and girls, but interchange &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;she.&amp;quot; They mix up past, present, and future tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then these children are labeled mentally retarded, even though they're normal or even excel at non-language activities (e.g., building with Legos). They're put into special ed classes, with children who really are mentally retarded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The children miss more developmental stages. As adults, these individuals may be unable to read, or have poor social skills, or be unable to work at more than menial jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disorder is called &lt;i&gt;language-learning impairment&lt;/i&gt; (LLI). In the last ten years a treatment has been developed. These children can distinguish /b/ from /d/ if the words are slowed down. Children with LLI now play a computer game that trains them to hear the difference between short-duration speech sounds.{{ref|Merzenich1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When their auditory dysfunction is corrected, the children develop normally. The children usually catch up with their peers, e.g., advancing four reading grade levels in six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogously, children's brains are like a railroad going from New York to Los Angeles. A little dysfunction can bump a child onto a sidetrack. The sidetrack may start out only a few feet from the main track, but twenty years later he's lost somewhere in South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment is like giving the child a shove back onto the main railroad track. The child then zooms ahead to catch up with his peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Brain scans show that adult stutterers have a [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Neurology_of_Stuttering#Auditory_Processing_Underactivity|different form of CAPD]], which may affect how we hear our own voices or feel our speech-production muscles moving. No researchers have investigated whether children who stutter also have this form of CAPD, or if treating this form of CAPD stops stuttering from developing.)&lt;/p&gt;

*Wikipedia doesn't have an article about language learning impairment (LLI) but it has an article about [[w:Specific language impairment|specific language impairment]] (SLI).

&lt;h3&gt;Early Intervention Is Best&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is similar to LLI, in that something small nudges a child off the normal developmental track at the age of two or three. This small nudge causes the child to grow on an abnormal developmental path. By adulthood, the stutterer has developed a variety of core symptoms, secondary behaviors, and psychological problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average age of stuttering onset is 30 months.{{ref|Yairi1992}} I.e., two-and-half-years-old is the typical age that children begin to stutter. Stuttering rarely begins after age six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;65% of preschoolers who stutter spontaneously recover, in their first two years of stuttering.{{ref|Yairi1993}} These children grow up to have normal speech.{{ref|Finn1997}} Some pediatricians tell parents to &amp;quot;wait and see&amp;quot; if a child outgrows stuttering on his own. But this advice is wrong. Children who stutter should be treated by a speech-language pathologist as soon as possible. (Schools provide free speech therapy to children as young as three years old.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, children who stutter longer are less likely to recover without treatment. Only 18% of children who stutter five years recover spontaneously.{{ref|Andrews1983}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peak age of recovery is 3.5 years old. By age six, a child is unlikely to recover without speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your child is in grade school and has stuttered for five years, he or she will need a bigger shove to get back onto the normal development track. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Critical Ages in Stuttering Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At two or three years old, children are quickly developing communication skills. Their brains are growing rapidly. A child's language skills may develop faster than his speech skills. He wants to communicate but can't easily and freely generate speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child interjects &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;um.&amp;quot; He repeats words. He has silent pauses. He revises what he's saying in the middle of sentences, or leaves sentences incomplete. He's most dysfluent with long sentences, when interrupting or being interrupted, or during stressful periods, such as a divorce, the birth of a sibling, or moving to a new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are &lt;i&gt;normal dysfluencies&lt;/i&gt;. All children have normal dysfluencies. Normal dysfluencies aren't stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; say that some children move from normal dysfluencies into stuttering. These children's frustration trying to talk leads them to push out words. The children tense their breathing, their vocal folds, and their lips, jaws, and tongues. The children struggle to talk, getting into longer repetitions, prolongations, and silent blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing which behaviors are normal dysfluencies and which behaviors are stuttering is a key issue. The [http://www.stutteringhelp.org/ Stuttering Foundation of America] has a videotape to help parents differentiate normal dysfluencies from stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because children's brains are growing at this time, their stuttering behavior becomes hardwired. Their brains shift onto an abnormal development path. The &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; have identified five stages children go through as stuttering develops, over months and years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or are the &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; wrong? Some parents report that their children woke up one morning stuttering severely. These children went from normal dysfluencies to severe stuttering overnight. The children skipped the development stages in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Neurology_of_Stuttering#A Trigger for Tourette's|later chapter]], you'll learn that a disorder similar to stuttering is triggered by a streptococcal infection causing a child's immune system to attack his or her brain's putamen motor control area. It's possible that a similar autoimmune dysfunction could attack a child's left caudate nucleus speech motor control area, causing severe stuttering to develop overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll also learn that [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Genetics_of_Stuttering|three genes]] are linked to stuttering. These genes affect the neurotransmitter dopamine, which functions abnormally in adult stutterers. I.e., some children are genetically predisposed to a class of disorders that includes stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll also learn that adult stutterers have [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Neurology_of_Stuttering#Auditory_Processing_Underactivity|abnormal auditory processing]]. (This abnormality is different from the auditory processing abnormality that causes language-learning impairment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions are important because they affect what therapy should be effective for children. If the &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; are right that stuttering develops in five stages, beginning with normal dysfluencies, then early intervention is paramount, but the therapy can be a gentle nudge (e.g., telling the parents not to interrupt when the child is speaking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; are wrong, and some children develop severe stuttering without going through intermediate stages, then therapy should start with a big shove back onto the normal developmental track. This important issue&amp;#151;&lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;indirect&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;therapy&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#151;is addressed in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood_Stuttering/Pre-School_Stuttering|Stuttering Therapies for Pre-School Children]].&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Vectors on a Plane? --&gt;
In practice, one of the most useful applications of trigonometry is in calculations related to vectors, which are frequently used in [[Physics]]. A vector is a quantity which has both magnitude (such as three or eight) and direction (such as north or 30 degrees south of east). It is represented in diagrams by an arrow, often pointing from the origin to a specific point.

A plane vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in two ways -- as the sum of a horizontal vector of magnitude &lt;math&gt;A_x&lt;/math&gt; and a vertical vector of magnitude &lt;math&gt;A_y&lt;/math&gt;, or in terms of its angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and magnitude &lt;math&gt;\left|\vec{A}\right|&lt;/math&gt; (or simply A). These two methods are called &quot;rectangular&quot; and &quot;polar&quot; respectively.

== Rectangular to Polar conversion ==
For simplicity, assume &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is in the first quadrant and has x-component &lt;math&gt;A_x&lt;/math&gt; and y-component &lt;math&gt;A_y&lt;/math&gt; (which will necessarily be positive). Given these components, we want to find the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and the magnitude &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

If we draw all three of these vectors, they form a right triangle. It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{A_y}{A_x}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \frac{A_y}{A_x}&lt;/math&gt; (A vector with an angle of zero is defined to be pointing directly to the right.) Furthermore, by the Pythagorean Theorem, &lt;math&gt;A_x\,^2 + A_y\,^2=A^2&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;A=\sqrt{A_x\,^2 + A_y\,^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Polar to Rectangular conversion ==
This is essentially the same problem as above, but in reverse. Here, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are known and we want to calculate the values of &lt;math&gt;A_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_y&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the same triangle as above, we can see that &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \frac{A_x}{A}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;A_x=A \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Also, &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{A_y}{A}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;A_y=A \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

== Review of conversions ==

* &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \frac{A_y}{A_x}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\left|\vec{A}\right|=A=\sqrt{A_x\,^2 + A_y\,^2}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A_x=A \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;A_y=A \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Regexp Regular Expressions =

Class Regexp holds a regular expression, used to match a pattern of strings. 

Regular expressions can be created using /your_regex_here/ or by using the constructor &quot;new&quot;.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt; /a regex/
&gt;&gt; /a case insensitive regex/i
&lt;/pre&gt;
or use the new constructor with constants, like
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt; Regexp.new('a regex')
&gt;&gt; Regexp.new('a regex', MULTILINE)
&lt;/pre&gt;

To see all available creation options, please see the regex [http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Regexp.html rdoc].

== oniguruma ==

Starting with 1.9, ruby has a new Regular Expression engine (oniguruma), which is slightly faster and more powerful, as well as encoding aware/friendly.
To see a good explanation of how it works, please see its [http://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/doc/re.rdoc rdoc].

== Simplifying regexes ==

Strategy: name them, then combine them.

&lt;pre&gt;
float = /[\d]+\.[\d]+/
complex = /[+-]#{float}\.#{float}/
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">INTRAPERSONAL INTELLIGENCE
There are 8 learning styles or intelligences as researched and published by Howard Gardner: Musical, Kinaesthetic, Mathematical / Logical, Visual / Spatial, Linguistic, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal and Naturalist

[[Image:8-smarts.jpg]]

Picture taken from: http://www.multi-intell.com/

Gardner's Definition:

Intrapersonal intelligence, (self smart) refers to having an understanding of yourself, of knowing who you are, what you can do, what you want to do, how you react to things, which things to avoid, and which things to gravitate toward.  We are drawn to people who have a good understanding of themselves because those people tend not to screw up.  They tend to know what they can do.   They tend to know what they can’t do.  And they tend to know where to go if they need help.

http://www.chariho.k12.ri.us/curriculum/MISmart/intra.htm

Intrapersonal intelligence is the ability to gain access to understand one's inner feelings, dreams and ideas. This form of intellect entails the ability to understand one's own emotions, goals and intentions.

Although it is difficult to assess who has this capacity and to what degree, evidence can be sought in students' uses of their other intelligences - how well they seem to be capitalizing on their strengths, how cognisant they are of their weaknesses and how thoughtful they are about the decisions and choices they make. 

Their Skills include:
Recognizing their own strengths and weaknesses, reflecting and analyzing themselves, awareness of their inner feelings, desires and dreams, evaluating their thinking patterns, reasoning with themselves, understanding their role in relationship to others

The two personal intelligences are, perhaps, the hardest to observe and at the same time, are the most important to success in any societal domain.

Technology can be used to facilitate learning in each intelligence area. There is no &quot;right way&quot; to integrate intelligences or technology into the classroom. The key is to provide the most effective learning environment for students

These &quot;self smart&quot; people learn best through metacognitive practices such as getting in touch with their feelings and self motivation. They are able to concentrate and be mindful. Provide tools to help students &quot;think about their thinking&quot; through writing, diagramming, or recording ideas.

Roles: They are good at setting and pursuing goals and assessing work. They are good at working independently toward a group goal.

Technology Tools 
•	Computer-based journaling 
•	Concept maps (Inspiration and Kidspiration) - idea webs 
•	Problem solving software - self paced software 
•	Internet research - self paced 
•	Word processing - brainstorming, diaries, journals 
•	Video projects - record personal ideas 
•	Multimedia portfolios

Visual-spatial

Spatial awareness is to do with vision and spatial judgement. People with good spatial awareness can usually boast excellent hand-eye coordination, can interpret art well and can tessellate objects easily (as in loading a truck or laying tiles).

In other words, spatial awareness is, very simply, an organized awareness of the objects in the space around us, and also an awareness of our body’s position in space.

According to http://www.balametrics.com/explain.htm#spatial_awareness, without this awareness, we would not be able to pick food up from our plates and put it in our mouths. We would have trouble reading, because we could not see the letters in their correct relation to each other and to the page. Athletes would not have the precise awareness of the position of other players on the field and the movement of the ball, which is necessary to play effectively.

As mentioned, spatial awareness requires that we have a model of the three dimensional space around us, and it requires that we can integrate information from all of our senses.

Deficiencies in spatial awareness can hold people back from achieving their full learning potential. However, there are products and therapies that can be applied in a learning environment to help develop people’s spatial awareness. http://www.balametrics.com/explain.htm#spatial_awareness illustrates some of these products.

Virtual Reality (VR), for instance, is a multi-sensory highly interactive computer based environment that can be applied in a learning environment to powerful effect. According to Education and Information Technologies, a VR system shows and exploits pedagogical principles. Passive learning is transformed into active with the experiential education provided from virtual environments. In a virtual environment the scale, information density, interaction and response, the time and the degree of user participation, can be defined and altered. Virtual learning environments allow the students to exercise different facets of their repertoire of cognitive skills.

There are practical examples of where learning technologies can be applied in a learning environment to support people relying on spatial awareness as a multiple intelligence. The training of airline pilots and forestry commission operatives historically relied on very sophisticated, expensive and remote equipment as a means of training. VR can now be applied to the same affect using desktop systems, demonstrating that the basic principles of fully immersive 3D training systems can be transferred successfully to desktops and hence increase student accessibility.

Research has also shown that the use of 3D virtual worlds can support children’s spatial abilities. An appreciation of spatial awareness can also assist certain types of problem solving activities especially in the field of mathematics.

Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)


According to wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_learning_environment], a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) is a software system designed to facilitate teachers in the management of educational courses for their students, especially by helping teachers and learners with course administration.  The system can often track the learners’ progress, which can be monitored by both teachers and learners.  While often thought of as primarily tools for distance education, they are most often used to supplement face-to-face classroom.

The systems usually run on servers, displaying the course to students as internet pages.  Typically, the systems contain templates for content pages, discussion forums, chat, quizzes and exercises.  

A VLE, which nearly all make extensive use of computers and the internet, should comprise all the following elements:

*	The syllabus for the course
*	Administrative information including the location of sessions
*	A notice board for up-to-date information
*	Student registration and tracking facilities
*	Basic teaching materials.

The principle functions needed from a comprehensive VLE include controlled access to curriculum that has been mapped to elements that can be separately assessed and recorded.  Student activity and achievement should be able to be tracked against these elements using simple processes for course administration.  This makes it possible for tutors to define and set up a course with accompanying materials and activities to direct, guide and monitor learner progress.  There should be good communication between the learner, the tutor and other learning support specialists, providing direct support and feedback for learners, as well as peer group communications building a sense of group identity. 

VLEs are becoming increasingly popular within Universities, thanks to the benefits offered.  For instance, there are economies on the time of teaching staff, especially those involved in research and administration.  VLEs ensure that quality control requirements are met by providing a standard vehicle for collecting the required information.

There are risks associated with the use of VLEs.  As reported by The Learning Development Centre at Staffordshire University (http://www.staffs.ac.uk/COSE/cose10/posnan.html), relying on VLEs can sometimes result in a failure to engage properly with the learner, to mistake “interactivity” for engagement and to focus on content rather than outcomes.  Some adopt a view of learning as an information delivery process, where the learner is seen as operating individually “for themselves”.  When this view is upheld in the context of VLEs, it can lead to a genuine sense of isolation, ignoring the social aspects of effective learning.

Using Portable Media for Education


As we enter the 21st Century, teaching practices are being developed to help engage and motivate learners in new ways.  These new practices in teaching and learning exploit Information Technology and new media, particularly portable Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices. 

A portable ICT device is usually defined as a computer able to be carried by a person with reasonable ease with regard to its size and weight.  Such devices must be able to be used without connection to a main power supply.  Examples of such devices could include multimedia notebook computers (laptops), personal digital assistants (PDAs), hand-held computers, palmtop computers, programmable calculators, Compact Discs (CDs) and memory sticks.

According to research by the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (Becta), there are several benefits to students, teachers and parents of using portable media devices in learning environments.  For students, gains in understanding and analytical skills, development of writing skills, increased motivation, organisation skills and responsibility are all reported.  Teachers are shown to benefit through gains in ICT literacy skills, confidence and enthusiasm.  Portable devices allow access to up-to-date pupil and school data, any time and anywhere.  Finally, parents gain through increased involvement in education and in some cases, self-esteem.  Parents’ knowledge of children’s learning and capabilities is increased because of the increase in learning activity being situated in the home.  

The Becta research also highlighted factors for effective use of portable devices.  For instance, teachers and students need sufficient time for familiarisation with the devices.  There needs to be ready access to technically competent staff and their use must be supported by clear pedagogical approaches and identification of specific learning goals.  

A practical example of where new portable technology is being used to help students is taking place at the University of Wales, Bangor.  Here, students are downloading extra information provided by some of the University’s School of Psychology lecturers to support their learning.  Students have been making pod casts of lectures and even making videos which are then stored in their MP3 players and listened to or watched at a later date.  These lectures can also be viewed on the internet.  The University are now recording all first and second year lectures and intend to make them available to all students with disabilities.

Finally, it’s worth noting that ‘ownership’ of portable ICT devices increases students’ motivation and responsibility, with attendance and punctuality increasing as a result.  Disadvantaged pupils or students can benefit in particular, as they are less likely to own ICT devices at home.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cognitivism is a learning theory which deals with, in particular, how people perceive and remember information, solve problems and ultimately learn.  The term 'cognition' refers to all processes by which sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered and used.  A key focus of cognitive psychology is looking at how to communicate or transfer knowledge to learners in the most effective and efficient way by looking at mental processes and how the structure of the brain is changed during the course of learning.  

The thinking behind cognitivism has come mainly as a result of the work of many learning theorists and psychologist.  One Swiss psychologist, Jean Piaget, [link?] was very influential in the development of the cognitivist theory but it was not until the1950s that cognitive psychology became a dominant theory of learning.
  
A key concept of cognitivism is that learning constructs mental maps in the brain and learning process is the means by which these mental structures are understood.  Piaget’s theory was that developing children build these structures or mental maps for understanding and responding to physical experiences within their environments.  Piaget believed that cognitive structures were interrelated and new knowledge would have to fit into the existing system for it to be properly understood.   These mental maps are changed to make way for new information and it is the integration of new information that forces our cognitive structures to become more elaborate.  

Understanding the cognitivist theory can be beneficial for learning as the theory can be applied to all learning style preferences [link].  If learners acquire understanding by building mental maps based on the information they are given, it makes sense to ensure that they have as many opportunities as possible to properly understand what they are learning.  Therefore if the cognitive demand of the learner is increased during instruction it is likely they will be able to make more links with prior learning and be able to apply what they have learnt.  Therefore to support a cognitive approach instructional materials should be varied and include audio visual examples, demonstrations, opportunities for practical application along with corrective feedback.  The use of feedback to guide and support the learner in creating accurate mental connections is a key component of the cognitive theory.  The use of technology can be used effectively by providing interest and variety, thereby aiding comprehension and the elaboration of existing cognitive structures.  

To summarise, a key belief of cognitivists is that new knowledge must be understood in a meaningful way and if the correct understanding is not there then learning has not really taken place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- It is an observation that when a car is stationary a considerable amount of force is required to turn the steering wheel. But when the same car is moving, the force required to turn the steering wheel is reduced considerably. Why this should be so? Why is it more difficult to turn the steering wheel of a stationary motor car than of a moving motor car?

Commented out as it is not a valid question to ask. Some qualitative answers about difference between coefficient of static friction and coefficient of kinetic friction (more like rolling friction) can be said, but in that case, this question is in a totally wrong section---it has absolutely nothing to do with rotational kinematics. -- novakyu, 12-23-2007 --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particle of mass ''m'' is constrained to move on a horizontal circle of radius ''R''. This circle also rotates in space about a fixed point (''P'') on the circumference of the circle. The rotation of the circle is about an axis of rotation perpendicular to the plane of the circle and tangent to the circle, at point (''P''); the rotation is at a constant angular speed ''ω''.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show that the particle’s motion about one end of a diameter passing through the pivot point and the center of the circle, perpendicular to the axis of rotation, is the same as that of a plane pendulum in a uniform gravitational field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(''Note: This is a difficult question, most likely requiring the use of Lagrangian mechanics, not simple Newtonian mechanics.'')&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the average density of a planet if an orbital period of a spacecraft on a low orbit is ''N'' minutes? Assume that by &quot;low orbit&quot; means that the spacecraft's orbital radius approximately equal to the planet's.&lt;/li&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Few would dispute the fact that people learn better when they are having fun and that generally learning is more effective when there is enjoyment linked to it.   Using animation within education settings can really command the attention of the learner and when learning is presented in a fun, game like way, using sound and movement, then it is often seen as entertainment rather than education or learning.   The word animation literally means to breathe life into something and animating topics within education can breathe life into what can sometimes be difficult to understand topics. 
[link http://animation.raremethod.com/Solutions/Educate/]

Animation within an educational setting can be used to support amongst others the teaching of English, foreign languages, music and mathematics.  It is particularly beneficial for science subjects as it can clearly demonstrate how things work in a way that paper based or audio techniques alone could not.  

As well as for educational support animation can also be used to educate both children and adults on health issues.  Animation can provide general advice and/or create a training programme to educate patients on the effects and treatment of various conditions.  Whilst these training programmes are likely to also make use of photographs, audio and video effects, animation will be crucial in creating a product to suit a multi-aged audience.  Within the medical profession animation is used to enhance medical training bringing to life difficult topics and creating learning materials for different audiences.   There are different animation techniques that can be used such as keeping backgrounds muted so that the main message is clear or to use a more dramatic style that has a lot of action to hold the learner’s attention.[link] 
   
Over the last century there has been much research into and theories developed about how people learn.  In 1984 David Kolb created a model based on the different ways that people learn and absorb information [link http://education.academicinfo.net/articles6.html ].  Kolb believed there were four distinct styles of learning and also four distinct types of learners with most people and their learning styles falling into more than one category.  Being aware of these learner types and learning styles can help ensure that the animated information presented to a group of learners is likely to be beneficial to the majority by using sound, visual effects and some interactivity.  

Within business animation can support the fields of science and engineering who may have need of high quality, dynamic, photo realistic animations. Scientists and engineers already use animation to communicate complex ideas that would be otherwise difficult to visualise.  
 
In summary, computer animation can be used very effectively in all kinds of learning environments to make learning more enjoyable and ultimately more effective by stimulating and enlivening situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Can audio media player technology when used in an education context actually widen participation and provide equality of opportunity to a broad range of students. In my view this is a resounding yes. The new generation of audio media players have an increasing role to play in providing enhanced learning opportunities to learners not in traditional learning environments. A very good example of this is in the area of Work Based Learning. Work based Learning is mainly a programme of study in the work place and includes a significant amount of work based assessment. Although it may include attendance at further education institutions, it is typically for people in paid employment. This can present significant barriers to achievement and in particular, progression to further and higher education and progression routes are an even greater than ever priority for increasing participation. Foundation Degrees are a good example of the sector’s response to this issue and are designed to offer the flexibility of study to attract employed students. With this work based element in mind audio media player technology can play a major part in bringing the classroom into the work place and make studying and revision more accessible. 
Many education and training institutions are now utilising the use of IPOD technology to enable students to learn in the workplace. Students can be issued with MP3 players onto which they can down load lecture notes, handouts and training materials which can be viewed multiple times in the workplace without the need for attendance in a formal classroom setting. The benefits are not just confined to presenting lecture notes but have direct benefits in the workplace environment. For example the NHS Greater Hospital Glasgow issue staff with this technology to deliver audio induction to the workplace which is followed by a computer-based knowledge test. They are then used to train staff about issues like workplace safety, infection control and coping with violence. New hand held technology such as Smartphones can be easily and efficiently used to undertake learning in the work place. Examples of software applications include Letterdraw which teaches students literacy skills which may be particularly beneficial to a student reluctant to attend formal literacy classes but needs to improve these skills in order to progress both on their programme of study and to progress within the workplace. Pod casting technology is also a significant development in supporting work based learners. Students can listen to broadcast lectures and view materials multiple times with out the need for classroom attendance and have the opportunity to multitask whilst listening to lectures. Obviously this is a major benefit to a student that is primarily based in the workplace.

The to Orbis/Ellinia is rigged so dark sight and haste won't do anything, this means Crimson Barlogs will hit you even with darksight on. If you try hitting a C rog and survive the physical damage (2000+)
the almost unavoidable lightning attack will kill you(4000+ damage).~ [[User:Gamefreak|Gamefreak]]

Hi -could you give me some more information about the graphics on this page - I realise they have an apparent license however checking it out the original site is not in english.  Equally Wikibooks does not usually have any form of game guide on it - could you give me an idea of where the article is going - as it stands it is not any form of &quot;text book&quot; I have seen and so its overall status is questionable.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step by Step==
To setup ZK in Eclipse you can use description in [http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-tapestry/HowToSetupEclipseWtp HowToSetupEclipseWtp for Apache Tapestry] with some adoptions for ZK:

Except the tapestry stuff you have the same benefits and prerequisites... probably sourcelevel debugging is not possible for java code inside *zul files...

Changes in the steps:
*'''Steps 1 and 2:''' as they are...
*'''Step 3:''' instead of ''Add .application, .page, .jwc and .library extensions to the Text &gt; XML node'' add the ZK specific extensions to the XML node (*.xul, *.zuml ...)
*'''Step 4:''' not applicable for ZK... a template file for ZK files could be created...
*'''Steps 5 and 6:''' as they are...
*'''Step 7:''' not applicable for ZK... probably there are other useful switches for the VM for developement purposes
*'''Step 8:''' as is... but probably don't call it TapestryTest... ;)
*'''Step 9:''' of course you have to copy the ZK jars (as in [http://zk1.sourceforge.net/wp/ZK-quickstart.pdf Quickstart] instead of the Tapestry jars
*'''Step 10:''' Setup a Sceleton Site... setup the [[/web.xml|WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml]] and the [[/hello.zul|WebContent/hello.zul]] as in [http://zk1.sourceforge.net/wp/ZK-quickstart.pdf Quickstart].
*'''Step 11:''' as is...
==Verification==
Verify the installation with [http://localhost:8080/ZKTest/hello.zul http://localhost:8080/ZKTest/hello.zul] (replace ZKTest  with your Project name...)

&lt;p&gt;About 2.5% of preschool children stutter.{{ref|Proctor2002}} This prevalence of preschool stuttering is less important than the incidence figure, which is about 5%. I.e., about 5% of children stutter at some point, and about 2.5% of children stutter now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 1% of adults stutter. 0.73%, or about one in 135 adults, was the figure found in a recent study.{{ref|Craig2002}} That suggests that about two million Americans stutter. But this seems high. The number of adults who’ve sought treatment is somewhere around 25,000.{{ref|Ref1}} How many stutterers have you met, outside of speech clinics and support groups? You likely hear 135 people talking every week. Do you hear someone stutter every week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensive publicity for several anti-stuttering devices was seen by over 100 million people, yet only about 2500 devices of each device were sold. The membership figures for the National Stuttering Association are similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that stuttering is either relatively common, but unimportant to 90% to 99% of the people who stutter; or that stuttering is a rarer disorder than the non-profit organizations say in their fundraising letters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <comment>/* Left Caudate Nucleus Speech Motor Area Overactivity */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Most brain scan studies have found no differences between stutterers’ and non-stutterers’ cerebral activity during silent rest and during ﬂuent speech.{{ref|Ingham1996}}. But during stuttering, cerebral activity changes dramatically. Changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

*Left-hemisphere areas active during normal speech become less active, and areas in the right hemisphere not normally active during speech become active.{{ref|Braun1997}} {{ref|Ingham1997}}
*&lt;i&gt;Underactivity&lt;/i&gt; in the central auditory processing area.
*&lt;i&gt;Overactivity&lt;/i&gt; in the speech motor control area.

&lt;p&gt;No brain scans have been done of stuttering children. We don't know whether these neurological abnormalities &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt; stuttering or &lt;i&gt;are caused by&lt;/i&gt; stuttering. It's possible that stuttering causes a child's brain to develop abnormally in these two areas. It's also possible that some children have one or both neurological abnormalities before they start stuttering, which cause them to stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

==Right-Hemisphere Overactivity==

&lt;p&gt;This abnormal right-hemisphere activity has produced a variety of speculative hypotheses from researchers.  According to one hypothesis, something is wrong with stutterers’ left-brain speech areas, and so right-brain areas not developed for speech take over.  This seems unlikely, given that most stutterers are capable of normal, ﬂuent speech in certain conditions. In contrast, neurogenic speech disorders (resulting from head injuries, strokes, etc.) result in disordered speech under all conditions. Because stutterers sometimes speak fluently and sometimes stutter, it seems unlikely that stutterers have something wrong with their left-hemisphere speech areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hypothesis says that the right-hemisphere activity is the fears and anxieties that stutterers experience, generated by the limbic and paralimbic structures.  But brain scans haven't shown these areas to be abnormally active during stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third hypothesis suggests that stutterers' auditory processing underactivity reduces the left-brain communication of sensory information processed in the rear brain to frontal speech and language areas. The abnormal right-brain activity may be an alternative pathway for rear-brain sensory information to travel to the front of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

==Auditory Processing Underactivity==

*Wikipedia article about [[w:Auditory processing disorder|Auditory processing disorder]]

&lt;p&gt;Our ears hear sounds. Our brains process those perceived sounds into useful information, such as words. Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) is not a single disease but rather is the term for anything wrong with how our brains process auditory information. A wide variety of disorders seem to have a CAPD component, including ADHD and language disorders.{{ref|Kutscher2005}}  CAPD is not a hearing disorder, i.e., a person with CAPD usually has nothing wrong with his or her ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's wrong with adult stutterers' auditory processing is unknown. Speculatively, stutterers have something wrong with how we hear our own voices. A study suggested that adult stutterers have an inability to integrate auditory and somatic processing,{{ref|Braun1997}} i.e., comparing what we hear ourselves saying to how we feel our muscles moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brain scan study examined the planum temporale (PT), an anatomical feature in the auditory temporal brain region. Typically people have a larger PT on the left side of their brains, and smaller PT the right side (leftward asymmetry). A brain scan study found that stutterers' right PT is larger than their left PT (rightward asymmetry).{{ref|Foundas2001}} A second study found that stutterers with this abnormal rightward asymmetry had significantly improved fluency with DAF ([[Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/Delayed_Auditory_Feedback|Delayed Auditory Feedback]]), but stutterers with the normal leftward asymmetry didn't improve with DAF.{{ref|Foundas2004}} The study also found that stutterers with this abnormal rightward asymmetry stuttered more severely than stutterers with the normal leftward asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have other symptoms associated with CAPD? Such symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;

*Preferring to watch movies with the subtitles on.
*Preferring to learn a foreign language (or challenging vocabulary words, or difficult last names) by learning to read and write the words first, and then learning to hear and speak the words, and then only when the words are spoken slowly.
*Difficulty understanding what people are saying when there's background noise, such as noise at a party or wind on an outdoor hike.
*Difficulty picking out one musical instrument from a band or orchestra.
*Sensitivity to certain noises (e.g., inability to &quot;tune out&quot; a television on in the background while &quot;tuning in&quot; a conversation with a person).
*Difficulty identifying the direction of sounds.
*Difficulty following multi-step directions, especially if given in one sentence.
*Difficulty paying attention when reading long lists of stuff. Just joking!

&lt;p&gt;For general treatments of CAPD, see the Wikipedia article about [[w:Auditory processing disorder|Auditory processing disorder]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculatively, exercises that train a stutterer to listen to his voice might improve fluency, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Such exercises might include acting or telling jokes with different voices for different characters, or doing actors' accent training. Learning to switch from an Irish brogue to sounding like a Mississippi Delta blues musician to a Korean shopkeeper might enhance your brain's ability to integrate auditory and somatic processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculatively, altered auditory feedback anti-stuttering devices may correct stutterers' auditory processing underactivity. This hypotheses has never been tested but is the most likely explanation how anti-stuttering devices work. This would also explain the &quot;chorus effect&quot; of speaking with another person. For more information, see the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Anti-Stuttering Devices|Anti-Stuttering Devices]].&lt;/p&gt;

==Left Caudate Nucleus Speech Motor Area Overactivity==

&lt;p&gt;The other neurological abnormality associated with stuttering is overactivity in the left caudate nucleus speech motor control area. Because stuttering is primarily overtense, overstimulated respiration, vocal folds, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue) muscles, it should be no surprise that the brain area that controls these muscles is overactive.  (Citations of peer-reviewed research supporting these statements would be appreciated.)&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;However, research also documents that the left caudate is associated with decreased glucose uptake in people who stutter in both stuttering and enhanced fluency speaking conditions (Wu, et al., 1995); as such, this data argues that people who stutter demonstrate left caudate &lt;b&gt;hypo&lt;/b&gt;metabolism as a possible trait marker for stuttering.  Further research documents increased FDOPA uptake in the left caudate tail (Wu et al., 1997).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency Shaping|Fluency shaping therapy]] trains stutterers to speak with relaxed breathing, vocal folds, and lips, jaw, and tongue. A study tested stutterers before and after fluency shaping therapy, finding left-hemisphere activity, although large areas of activation in the right hemisphere remained. No specific changes were seen in the left caudate nucleus.{{ref|Kroll1997}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This left caudate nucleus overactivity appears to be related to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Speculatively, if stutterers' left caudate nucleus is too sensitive to dopamine, then this would explain why dopamine antagonist medications reduce stuttering (see the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Anti-Stuttering Medications|Anti-Stuttering Medications]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculatively, if stutterers' left caudate nucleus is too sensitive to dopamine, then varying levels of dopamine would explain the &quot;good days, bad days&quot; phenomenon, in which stutterers have days with relatively fluent speech, and other days when they &quot;can't get a word out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more about dopamine, see Wikipedia article [[w:Dopamine|Dopamine]] or the book The Edge Effect, by Eric Braverman (ISBN 1402722478).&lt;/p&gt;

==Tourette's and Stuttering==

&lt;p&gt;Three genes that correlate with stuttering also correlate with Tourette's Syndrome (see the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Genetics of Stuttering|Genetics of Stuttering]]). Tourette's and stuttering have many commonalities, suggesting that the neurology of Tourette's may shed light on the neurology of stuttering.
Stuttering happens frequently in Tourette's syndrome. Many of the medications that help control tics also help stuttering. Abnormalities in the basal ganglia and the cortical motor systems may be shared by both disorders.
&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tourettec tics and stuttering disfluencies are embarrassing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The more a Touretter tries not to make a certain movement, or a stutterer tries not to stutter, the less he or she can control the behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Touretters control the disorder by substituting more-acceptable tics. Stutterers substitute words they can say.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Both Touretters and stutterers enjoy support groups, where they can &amp;quot;let go&amp;quot; and move or stutter without embarrassment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Environmental cues can &amp;quot;switch off&amp;quot; Tourette's and stuttering temporarily. E.g., a surgeon with Tourette's has tics everywhere but the operating room.{{ref|Sacks1996}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress can &amp;quot;switch off&amp;quot; Tourette's and stuttering temporarily.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dopamine-blocking medications, such as Haldol, reduce both stuttering and Tourette's.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Both disorders run in families.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The prevalence of Tourette's and adult stuttering is similar.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Both disorders originate in childhood.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Both disorders can be disabling, but Touretters and stutterers who achieve success say that their disorder was a gift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more, see the Wikipedia article about [[w:Tourette syndrome|Tourette's syndrome]]. Or invite a Tourette's support group to meet with your stuttering support group.&lt;/p&gt;

===A Trigger for Tourette's===

&lt;p&gt;Why do some individuals with these three genes develop stuttering, while others develop Tourette's or OCD, and still other individuals with these genes develop none of these disorders?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a subgroup of individuals with Tourette's, a childhood autoimmune &amp;quot;trigger&amp;quot; leads to Tourette's. A childhood streptococcal infection can cause a child's immune system to attack brain cells in the putamen area.{{ref|Singer1998}} The putamen controls gross (large) muscle movements. Excessive dopamine in the putamen area of the brain is associated with Tourette's. The child recovers from the fever, but then develops Tourette's.&lt;/p&gt;

For more about this controversial hypothesis, see [[w:P.A.N.D.A.S.|P.A.N.D.A.S.]]. No one has suggested that stuttering is a PANDAS disorder, but the three PANDAS disorders (Tourette's, OCD, and tics) are genetically linked to stuttering, so perhaps PANDAS shouldn't be ruled out in the development of stuttering.

&lt;p&gt;Tourette's involves a &lt;i&gt;genetic &lt;/i&gt;predisposition and an &lt;i&gt;autoimmune&lt;/i&gt; trigger leading to a &lt;i&gt;neurological&lt;/i&gt; abnormality. Combined with later &lt;i&gt;psychological&lt;/i&gt; issues, Tourette's is a &lt;i&gt;multifactoral&lt;/i&gt; disorder. Because only some individuals with Tourette’s developed the disorder from this autoimmune trigger, Tourette’s has &lt;i&gt;multiple development pathways&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

==&amp;quot;Good Days, Bad Days&amp;quot;&amp;#151;and the Anti-Stuttering Diet==

&lt;p&gt;Stutterers have &amp;quot;good days&amp;quot;&amp;#151;with less stuttering&amp;#151;and &amp;quot;bad days&amp;quot;&amp;#151;when they can't get a word out. The &amp;quot;good days/bad days&amp;quot; syndrome may be due to varying levels of dopamine in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is affected by several factors, including diet. Dopamine is produced from the amino acids phenylalanine and  tyrosine. Both amino acids are components of protein. Meat sources of protein have more tyrosine than plant sources of protein. The exception is wheat germ, which is high in tyrosine. The foods highest in phenylalanine are soy and fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A vegetarian, wheat-free, low-protein diet should lower dopamine levels. I tried this. I stuttered less, but felt sluggish and depressed. I'd rather eat protein, feel mentally alert, and stutter.&lt;/i&gt;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 05:06, 28 March 2006 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;

Concepts involving dietary modifications have never undergone scientific study in stuttering and this is unlikely to significantly alter dopamine synthesis. Reducing dopamine synthesis may be detrimental to other neurophysiological processes.
Pharmacological agents are a much more effective way of modulating dopaminergic activity. The ideal drug would be a dopamine receptor modulator that is precise enough to modulate dopaminergic activity without causing detrimental neurological side effects, but such medications don't currently exist. Aripiprazole is the first drug to  have some properties similar to a dopamine receptor modulator, but its metabolite acts as a full dopamine antagonist, negating the selective modulating activity of aripiprazole itself.

==More Stuttering Brain Scan Studies==

&lt;p&gt;Different studies found different results because a variety of technologies were used (EEG vs. SPECT vs. PET, H2150 vs. FDG).  Most studies were small, usually a half-dozen stutterers.  The subjects were usually right-handed men — women and left-handed men may have different cerebral activity.&lt;/p&gt;

*Salmelin, 1998: “Neuromagnetic responses to monaural tones [found that] the basic functional organization of the auditory cortices was found to be different in stutterers and controls…and more severely by self-paced [stuttered] than accompanied [ﬂuency induced by the chorus effect] speech.”{{ref|Salmelin1998}}
*Braun, 1997: Language processing shifted to the right hemi-sphere, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, middle temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex.  Motor function shifts to the right hemisphere, including the “anterior fore¬brain regions and associ¬ated archicortical paralimbic areas.”  Visual processing also appeared to shift to the right hemisphere.  Decreased sensory perception, including post-rolandic sensory areas and related paleocortical paral¬imbic regions.  Increased somatosensory processing (sensation of the body), including the “dorsal region of the angular gyrus, adjacent to the superior parietal lobule, as well as somatosensory association cortices in the medial SPL.”{{ref|Braun1997}}
*De Nil, 1995: During silent reading, increased activation in the left angular cingulate cortex, a “reﬂection of covert anticipation of stuttering.” {{ref|DeNil1995}}
*Ingham, 1996: “Present ﬁndings do not support recent suggestions that developmental stuttering is associated with abnormalities of brain blood ﬂow at rest.  Rather, our ﬁndings indicate an essentially normal functional brain terrain…”{{ref|Ingham1996}}
*Ingham, 1997: “Diffuse overactivity throughout the cerebral and cerebellar motor systems…Deactivation of a verbal production circuit between left frontal (BA47) and temporal (BA22) cortex that has been previously identiﬁed in normal speakers.”{{ref|Ingham1997}}
*Kalinowski, 1997: Some stutterers showed the greatest reduction in the temporal-parietal area, and others showing greatest reductions in the right hemisphere posterior sites.{{ref|Kalinowski1997}}
*Kroll, 1997: After ﬂuency shaping stuttering therapy there is increased left-hemisphere activity, although large areas of activation in the right hemisphere remain.{{ref|Kroll1997}}
*Watson, 1994: Abnormal right-hemisphere activity only in stutterers who also had language deﬁcits.{{ref|Watson1994}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Preliminary!

My description of HibernateSessionHandling is based on a Hibernate/Tapestry configuration described in [http://www.agileskills2.org/EWDT/ Enjoying Web Development with Tapestry]... I have adapted this to ZK with a set of classes to provide hibernate session support with almost no configuration. 

There is also a Spring/Hibernate solution for handling hibernate sessions, which works with a servelet filter. Spring offers also a lot more benefits (i know only from hearsay...) for hibernate and is probably a better solution... i don't know whether the Spring hibernate session handling could also be used for the ZK Ajax request/response cycle... i heard somebody is working on a description...


== Assumptions ==

'''the main rules for hibernate sessions in web applications (in my opinion... please correct me...):'''
*a Hibernate sessionfactory is an expensive resource... it's thread safe and there should be only one instance per Web application
*a Hibernate session is an inexpensive and non-threadsafe resource. 
*a Hibernate session can be seen as a single piece of work. There should be only one per HttpSession
*a hibernate session and transaction should normally be closed when the control is back to the client
*creating a database connection is a time consuming process... use a connection pool!
*dont access detached Hibernate POJOs (plain old Java objects) after a session is closed, since related data might not be retrieved from the database (lazy initialisation)!
*...

== How this solution works ==

The very first time a hibernate session is needed in the application a Hibernate session is requested with the call of static final HibernateSessionProvider.getHibernateSession(HttpSession) (@tomyeh... how to provide a zul shortcut???). This checks the attributes of the current HttpSession for a HibernateSessionOwner... when not available it creates one and stores it in the current HTTPSession. The constructor of HibernateSessionOwner checks the WebApp attributes for an attribute HibernateSessionCreator()... when not available it creates one and stores it in the attributes of the WebApp... so we have one instance of the HibernateSessionCreator in the web application, which is a wrapper for a hibernate session factory, which is used to create hibernate sessions... 
When the HibernateSessionOwner and -Creator are instantiated the getHibernateSession() asks the HibernateSessionOwner for an Hibernate session... SessionOwner gets it from the creator and manages it further on... The HibernateSessionOwner holds the session and provides it every time the session is needed again in the ongoing thread... To cleanup the Hibernate session when the thread ends, the HibernateSessionEventThreadCleanup class is used (and configured in web.xml), which implements the zk interface EventThreadCleanup... in the cleanup routine the threadDidDiscardService() of the HibernateSessionOwner of the current session is called, stops the transaction and closes the hibernate session...

== Configuration ==

== Working with the Hibernate session ==
With the above mentioned steps ZK is hibernate enabled... until now you can plug in your hibernate configuration and use it in your *.zul templates...

  	&lt;/rows&gt;
 	&lt;/grid&gt;
 &lt;/window&gt;

== Open Points ==
*Provide a shortcut to static final routines of HibernateSessionProvider (@Tom... HowTo?)
*Only one Thread per desktop... what about Hibernate session for multiple browser windows, but same HttpSession?
*Don't flush a session after Exception occurred... want to handle Exceptions derived from database constrains (e.g. unique...) &quot;nickname already assigned&quot;...
*...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The look==
This is a proposal for a new look for the book. I propose to hace 3 versions
* gui version
* text version
* printable (the whole book)
If you dont like this, we 'll change to have only a classical text version.
If you want to modify this look, tell me if you need help.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Database management as a subject in its own right is far too big to be dealt with in this book and would distract from the principal subject which is programming in VB Classic.  Nonetheless we can explain the basics of connecting to databases, retrieving information from them and so on.

The usual way to connect to a database from VB is to use ADO (ActiveX Data Objects).

Connecting to databases usually happens with a connection string. Here are some example connection strings to connect to some common database types

'''A'''

'''ACCESS'''

'''ODBC''' 
 
Standard Security 
 Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};Dbq=C:\mydatabase.mdb;Uid=Admin;Pwd=; 
 
 
Workgroup 
 Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};Dbq=C:\mydatabase.mdb;SystemDB=C:\mydatabase.mdw; 
 
 
Exclusive 
 Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};Dbq=C:\mydatabase.mdb;Exclusive=1;Uid=admin;Pwd=; 
 
 
'''Enable admin statements'''
To enable certain programatically admin functions such as CREATE USER, CREATE GROUP, ADD USER, GRANT, REVOKE and DEFAULTS (when making CREATE TABLE statements) use this connection string.  
 Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};Dbq=C:\mydatabase.mdb;Uid=Admin;Pwd=;ExtendedAnsiSQL=1; 
 

'''Specifying locale identifier'''
Use this to specify the locale identifier which can help with non-US formatted dates.  
 Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};Dbq=C:\mydatabase.mdb;Locale Identifier=2057;Uid=Admin;Pwd=; 
 
The above example uses the en-gb locale identifier (2057). 


===OLE DB, OleDbConnection (.NET)===
 
Standard security 
 Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\mydatabase.mdb;User Id=admin;Password=; 
 
 
With database password 
This is the connection string to use when you have an access database protected with a password using the Set Database Password function in Access.  
 Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\mydatabase.mdb;Jet OLEDB:Database Password=MyDbPassword; 
 
 
Workgroup (system database) 
 Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\mydatabase.mdb;Jet OLEDB:System Database=system.mdw; 
 
 
Workgroup (system database) specifying username and password 
 Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\mydatabase.mdb;Jet OLEDB:System Database=system.mdw;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword; 
 

DataDirectory functionality 
 Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=|DataDirectory|\myDatabase.mdb;User Id=admin;Password=; 
 

'''ACCESS 2007'''
Standard security
 Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=C:\myFolder\myAccess2007file.accdb;Persist Security Info=False;

With database password
 Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=C:\myFolder\myAccess2007file.accdb;Jet OLEDB:Database Password=MyDbPassword;

Datadirectory functionality
 Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=|DataDirectory|\myAccess2007file.accdb;Persist Security Info=False;



'''E'''

'''Excel Files'''
 ODBC
Driver={Microsoft Excel Driver (*.xls)};DriverId=790;Dbq=C:\MyExcel.xls;DefaultDir=c:\mypath;

Remark:
 SQL syntax &quot;SELECT * FROM [sheet1$]&quot;. -- i.e. excel worksheet name followed by a &quot;$&quot; and wrapped in &quot;[&quot; &quot;]&quot; brackets. 


OLEDB
 Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\MyExcel.xls;Extended Properties=&quot;Excel 8.0;HDR=Yes;IMEX=1&quot;;

'''Important note!'''

The quote &quot; in the string needs to be escaped using your language specific escape syntax.
 c#, c++   \&quot;
 VB6, VBScript   &quot;&quot;
 xml (web.config etc)   &amp;quot;
 or maybe use a single quote '.

&quot;HDR=Yes;&quot; indicates that the first row contains columnnames, not data. &quot;HDR=No;&quot; indicates the opposite.

&quot;IMEX=1;&quot; tells the driver to always read &quot;intermixed&quot; (numbers, dates, strings etc) data columns as text. Note that this option might affect Excel worksheet write access negative.
  
 SQL syntax &quot;SELECT * FROM [sheet1$]&quot;. -- i.e. Excel worksheet name followed by a &quot;$&quot; and wrapped in &quot;[&quot; &quot;]&quot; brackets.

Check out the [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\4.0\Engines\Excel] located registry REG_DWORD &quot;TypeGuessRows&quot;. That's the key to not letting Excel use only the first 8 rows to guess the columns data type. Set this value to 0 to scan all rows. This might hurt performance.  
If the Excel workbook is protected by a password, you cannot open it for data access, even by supplying the correct password with your connection string. If you try, you receive the following error message: &quot;Could not decrypt file.&quot;  
 
 
'''Excel 2007 Files'''

 Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=c:\myFolder\myExcel2007file.xlsx;Extended Properties=&quot;Excel 12.0 Xml;HDR=YES&quot;;

== updating bookshelf with new category engineering-automotive ==

Hi I found your wikibook, and just want to let you know that I added to the engineering bookshelf in a new category Automotive.  I found some other titles that I have put in there also.  I think we may be able to get quite a section going...  good luck with your work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Seeking Enrollment in Political Science Course ==

Hi, my name is Justin Herald. I am interested in enrolling in the Wikiversity School of Political Science. My email is justin.herald[at]gmail.com

[[User:Symphoniq|Symphoniq]] 03:32, 17 March 2006 (UTC)Symphoniq

==Wikiversity==
Ok, I'm willing to forget all the comments you've been deleting, if you just listen to one point. Wikiversity has already been through one round of getting approval from the board of the Wikimedia Foundation, having already been proposed for deletion from Wikibooks - yes, deletion. See the top of [[m:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal]] for details. In this, the board recommended that Wikiversity &quot;exclude online courses&quot; - that's right, no online courses. They also said &quot;no credentials&quot;.

Since then, however, there has been confusion about this, and I for one have been arguing that, while we might not want to go down the full e-learning route at the moment, we can still go about setting up learning activities around materials that we host on Wikiversity, instead of simply being a repository of materials. What I propose is that we set up &quot;study groups&quot; (or &quot;learning communities&quot;) around individual topics, where people can raise questions, discuss, and maybe use this for further research on the topic. This is my idea and the growing consensus of how learning takes place.

So, don't get me wrong - I think that the fact that you're getting the political science course off the ground is great. But I'm also recommending that you think about how to manage this course. Have you, for example, asked any of the potential participants what they want out of the course? Have you asked them what their experience is? Were you going to do that? How were you going to manage the question on [[Talk:Pos 1000]] about not being able to make it to online lectures? And on a pragmatic note, where are the materials for the course? These aren't accusations - they're just questions.

I'm also asking you, please, please, to listen to this. I'm trying to work with you here, but the more you ignore me, the less likely this is. Considering that I'm spearheading getting Wikiversity actually set up through the [[m:Special projects committee]], this is not good for you. If you've any questions, if you're not clear about anything, please just ask. Please don't delete, it's [[m:Incivility|not good]]. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 11:27, 23 March 2006 (UTC)


:Hi Gh0st, I'd just like to say that some of what I've said so far has been too strong and over the top. I want to apologise to you for coming in too aggressively on the Wikiversity course you're working on. I actually meant my comments to open a discourse, rather than set up a conflict, but in reality, I only succeeded in the latter.

:On a more positive note, I see that there is a steady interest in the course, and I wish you all the best with it. How is it going by the way? Have you done any group work or had any online lectures? [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 05:38, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== Jesus, Cormaggio! ==  

I realize that you are under thirty, a rising star with an education in education, and now selected by the Wikimedia Foundation power structure as their special representative less disliked than any other incorrigables at Wikiversity.  Personally, I did not care for the syllabus or outlined approaches of Gh0st's Poly Sci classes or apparent leadership style but would it be so difficult to simply advise him/her to title his activity a series of seminars and leave them alone to prototype some online learning?  If the newcomer [[user:Wikizach]] takes me up on prototyping some poly sci classes then the student body will have some options in at least one learning area at Wikiversity.  

Meanwhile I have found nothing promised at meta regarding submitting the proposal and getting our permanent URLs active.  Get your paperwork done and leave the harassing of other participants to us other mere participants.  How are you going to play mediator or leader when you are defining yourself as one side of the newly arising disputes that the Wikimedia Foundation has suckered you into taking on?  Do yourself a favor.  Go find out if Roberth or Maveric149 (former leaders in charge of proposal of Wikiversity now going on three years slow rolling by Board) and find out if they have hard feelings towards you being picked to take credit for leading their project into the promised land.  In fact, go consult JWSurf and MFinney regarding office politics in private.  Notice both of them are experienced managers and instructors.  Try not to threaten them with spurious charges of incivility or your new found status as the selected minion of the stacked Board's selected committee. 

Get our URLs active and turn on the web traffic.  If five or fifty fullblooded P'hd Engineers, PE show up to give real courses with official syllabus, exercises, lectures, etc. etc. or retired NASA people grumpy at never getting to design an actual useful spacecraft or technology you do not want to be marginalized as the idiot trying to enforce uninformed Board mandates all by your lonesome.  In case you missed it Wikiversity is an experiment.  Nobody really knows what is going to work.   We need to try some things and find out.  The Board has painted themselves into some corners with their premature announcements and promises regarding &quot;freeing the curriculum&quot; and some other idiocies aimed at separating the fiscal entity from the &quot;community&quot; in pursuit of cash donations they control.  When the dust settles do you want to be the villian scapegoated and outcast by the &quot;community&quot; of instructors, students, and participants who inevitably choose to do as they please rather than as the Board mandates for the Board's convenience or financial interests?  Keep in mind Wikiversity is slowly getting started in spite of mismanagement of the Board.  If the permanent URLs are not forthcoming soon how long do you suppose it will be ... nevermind.  That argument was old a year ago and the lack of available public student wikis still mystifies me.

Please consider writing a paragraph submission memo for the modified proposal and request some of the regulars show up and express support and state personal exceptions.  I personally will rewrite and repropose the alternative &lt;b&gt;Wikiversity is Not&lt;/b&gt; section:

Wikiversity is not a place to tell others what they cannot do or try.  Productive forking is encouraged, may the best learning community grow faster than its alternatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
==Dopaminergic Genes==
&lt;p&gt;Three genes associated with the neurotransmitter [[w:Dopamine|dopamine]] correlate with five disorders: [[w:ADHD|ADD/ADHD]], stuttering, [[w:Tourette's|Tourette's syndrome]], [[w:Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and [[w:Tic|tics]].{{ref|Comings1996}} All five disorders involve a combination of stress and movement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Persons with ADD/ADHD have normal brain activity when resting, but when they try to concentrate on a task, they have reduced prefrontal cortex blood flow, which reduces their ability to concentrate.{{ref|Amen}} Persons with ADHD (mostly children) then become hyperactive and can't sit still.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tics cause a muscle, often in your face, to move rapidly and uncontrollably. Stress usually makes the tic uncontrollable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Individuals with OCD repeatedly perform physical tasks, e.g., hand-washing. Stress usually makes this behavior uncontrollable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Individuals with Tourette's syndrome compulsively touch objects (e.g., floors or walls) or make stereotyped movements or noises. Stress usually makes the movements uncontrollable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stuttering is excessive speech-production muscle activity resulting in blocked, prolonged, or repeated sounds. Stress usually makes the stuttering uncontrollable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All five disorders manifest most strongly&amp;#151;and are most difficult to control&amp;#151;in high-stress situations. These disorders may all be stress reducers that work for a few moments but then cause greater stress, resulting in cyclical abnormal behaviors (see the section [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Stress-Related Changes|Stress-Related Changes]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do some individuals with these three genes develop stuttering, while others develop Tourette's, while still others develop other disorders, or no disorder at all? In a subgroup of individuals with Tourette's, a childhood automimmune &amp;quot;trigger&amp;quot; leads to Tourette's. A childhood streptococcal infection causes a child's immune system to attack brain cells in the putamen area.{{ref|Singer1998}} The putamen controls gross (large) muscle movements. Excessive dopamine in the putamen area of the brain is associated with Tourette's. The child recovers from the fever, but then develops Tourette's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculatively, a similar autoimmune disorder involving the left caudate nucleus speech motor control area could trigger childhood stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

==Stuttering Families==

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, researchers announced that almost half the family members stutter in several extended families in Cameroon, Africa. The lead researcher said, &quot;These families provide hope that we'll be able to identify the gene that appears to be at work to cause stuttering in these families.&quot;{{ref|Drayna2005}} &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1940 study investigated five generations of an Iowa family, with stuttering in all generations. In the third generation, three of four children in one family stuttered. When these children grew up, three moved to Kansas and lost contact with the sibling remaining in Iowa. Of the descendants of the woman remaining in Iowa, 40% stuttered. Of the descendants of the Kansas siblings, only 6% stuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researcher concluded that the Iowa family had a &amp;quot;tone&amp;quot; that was conducive to stuttering. The hypothesis was that this family believed that stuttering was inherited, so they anxiously watched their children looking for signs of stuttering, and this fear of stuttering in the parents caused the children to stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1960, another researcher studied the next generation of the family. Only 2% of these children stuttered, and the researcher reported that there had been a change in the familial assumptions and attitudes about stuttering.{{ref|Bloodstein1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1940, speech-language pathologists believed that stuttering was caused by parental reactions to normal childhood dysfluencies. The Iowa family &quot;proved&quot; what the speech-language pathologists believed. In 2005, speech-language pathologists believe that stuttering has a genetic cause, and the Cameroon families are expected to prove this hypothesis. In 1986, a speech-language pathologist re-examined the 1940 Iowa study and concluded that, &amp;quot;genetic transmission has been judged to provide an equally viable explanation for the data.&amp;quot;{{ref|Wingate1986}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 25 studies have investigated family patterns in the incidence of stuttering. The results vary widely. Most studies are contradicted by other studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 20% and 74% of stutterers say they have a relative who stutters. But other studies found that 1% to 42% of &lt;i&gt;non-&lt;/i&gt;stutterers said they have a relative who stutters.{{ref|Yairi1996}} In other words, many stutterers and many non-stutterers say they have relatives who stutter. One study found that if you stutter, you are about three times more likely to have a close relative who stutters.{{ref|Andrews1983}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of the families of stutterers failed to find simple Mendelian types of inheritance, such as sex-linked, autosomal dominant, or recessive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study of children aged 2 to 6 found that more than two-thirds of stuttering children have relatives who stutter. This study found that male and female children were equally likely to have relatives who stutter. This study also found that stuttering was more likely in first-degree relatives than in second- or third-degree relations.{{ref|Ambrose1993}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Twin Studies==

&lt;p&gt;A half-dozen studies of twins have found that concordance for stuttering (both twins either stutter or don't stutter, rather than one twin stuttering and the other not stuttering) is much more likely in identical twins than in fraternal twins. The exact numbers vary between studies, in part because some studies only looked at same sex twins (a male and female fraternal twin pair is unlikely to both stutter because males are more likely to stutter than females).{{ref|Yairi1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a study of 95 pairs of identical twins reared apart found 5 stutterers (2% of the subjects, the expected prevalence). None of their twins stuttered. This is in spite of finding similarities in talkativeness, pitch, and hoarseness, as well as tastes in clothing, books, etc. This suggests that stuttering is not genetic.{{ref|Bloodstein1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Relatives of Female Stutterers==

&lt;p&gt;Several studies have found that female stutterers are more likely than males to have relatives who stutter.{{ref|Yairi1996}} This suggested that the few females who stutter might have a stronger genetic component in their families. Analogously, men are more likely to be tall than women, but tall women are more likely to have tall relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, another study of adult stutterers &amp;quot;did not find that relatives of female [stutterers] were more likely to stutter than relatives of the male [stutterers].&amp;quot;{{ref|Janssen1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stuttering Related to Other Factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of the family incidence of stuttering have compared left-handed stutterers to right-handed stutterers, speech motor skills, anxiety, and reading ability. Familial differences were found only for speech motor skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two studies of birth or developmental trauma had contradictory results. A study of adults suggested that there are two causes of stuttering: genetic, and trauma or illness. A similar study of children who stutter reached the opposite conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two studies found that severe stutterers were no more likely than mild stutterers to have relatives who stutter. Two more studies found no familial differences between recovered and persistent stutterers.{{ref|Yairi1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Boltzmann distribution gives the probability of a system to be in a given state (specified by the coordinates and momenta of its constituents) as proportional to the exponential function of the energy of that state, in units of kT.

For calculating the exact probability for a given range of states, you must normalize the distribution, i.e., you must divide by the total integral for all states (be careful, not the same as &quot;for all energies&quot;).

Partition function is the name for this total integral. It is given an special name because, in fact, mathematically, you can derive a lot of information from this integral. For example: to calculate the mean value of a given function of the state, the standar formula of integrating the product of the function by the probability, and dividing by the partition function, is the same as the derivative of the logarithm of the partition function.

==Introduction==
&lt;!-- Amanda --&gt;
Protein interaction is crucial for every organism.  Most proteins function through interaction with other molecules, and often with other proteins.  Enzymes interact with their substrates, inhibitors interact with enzymes, transport proteins interact with structural proteins, hormones interact with receptors – and that’s just a few of the interactions that happen in a cell.  Some proteins are composed of more than one polypeptide chain, and the interactions between the different peptides are necessary for the whole protein to function.  Since they are so essential, protein-protein interactions are an important topic for scientists to understand.  


There are many characteristics of a protein-protein interaction that are important.  Obviously, it is important to know '''which proteins are interacting'''.  In many experiments and computational studies, the focus is on interactions between two different proteins.  However, you can have one protein interacting with other copies of itself (oligomerization), or three or more different proteins interacting.  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry '''stoichiometry'''] of the interaction is also important – that is, how many of each protein involved are present in a given reaction.  Some protein interactions are stronger than others, because they bind together more tightly.  The strength of binding is known as '''affinity'''.  Proteins will only bind each other spontaneously if it is energetically favorable.  '''Energy''' changes during binding are another important aspect of protein interactions.  Many of the computational tools that predict interactions are based on the energy of interactions.  

In recent years there has been a strong focus on predicting protein interactions computationally.  Predicting the interactions can help scientists predict pathways in the cell, potential drugs and antibiotics, and protein functions.  However, it has been an ongoing challenge to decipher those interactions.  Proteins are large molecules, and binding between them often involves many atoms and a variety of interaction types, including [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bonds hydrogen bonds], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic_interactions hydrophobic interactions], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_bridge_%28protein%29 salt bridges], and more.  Proteins are also dynamic, with many of their bonds able to stretch and rotate leading to different conformations.  Therefore, predicting protein-protein interactions requires a good knowledge of the chemistry and physics involved in the interactions.

This chapter discusses the characteristics of protein-protein interactions, how they are determined experimentally, and how they are predicted computationally.  It also contains a list of databases where you can explore known and predicted protein interactions.  The links above will lead you to the various sections.

==Diffusion==
*brownian motion
*rate of interaction, Z in the k_on equation


** reactions need interaction
** k_on of interaction is given by Z*rho*exp(-E/RT) where Z is the encounter rate (diffusion based), rho is the steric/geometric factor and includes the electrostatic &quot;stearing&quot; effect, E is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.
**Two regimes that are instructive to consider: rate limited and diffusion limited. Rate limited means that diffusion can be ignored, i.e. k_on=exp(-E/RT); and diffusion limited means that E \approx 0 so k_on=Z*rho
*How do proteins interact? i.e. diffusion
** Equation for Z (diffusion based encounter) for hard spheres and high concentration and when in large numbers is given by 4*pi*(r1+r2) where ri is the radius of protein [Look at Ferst's book]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here are some ways to say directions:

*Gā... - Go...
**...tō þǣre swīðran healfe - ...right
**...tō þǣre wystran healfe - ...left
**...rihte forþ - ...straight ahead
*Wend... - Turn...
**...in þā strǣte - ... down that street
**...tō þǣre swīðran healfe - ...right
**...tō þǣre wystran healfe - ...left
**...on bæċ - ...around/back

==Adjectives of position==
*ufeweard - upper part of
*neoðanweard - lower part of
Example: '''is se heals gréne neoðeweard and ufeweard''' ''the lower and upper parts of the neck are green''

==Adjectives of time==
The same adjectives could be used to describe time periods as well:
*ufeweard - latter part of
*foreweard - early part of
*Example: '''on foreweardne sumor and eft on ufeweardne hærfest''' ''in the early part of the summer and again in the latter part of autumn''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Frequency Polygon==
[[File:HistFreqPoly.JPG|thumb|326px|This is a histogram with an overlaid frequency polygon.]]
Midpoints of the interval of corresponding rectangle in a histogram are joined together by straight lines. It gives a polygon i.e. a figure with many angles.
it is used when two or more sets of data are to be illustrated on the same diagram such as death rates in smokers and non smokers, birth and death rates of a population etc
One way to form a frequency polygon is to connect the midpoints at the top of the bars of a histogram ‿with line segments (or a smooth curve). Of course the midpoints themselves could easily be plotted without the histogram and be joined by line segments. Sometimes it is beneficial to show the histogram and frequency polygon together.

Unlike histograms, frequency polygons can be superimposed so as to compare several frequency distributions.

The Earth has been placed out of order with the other planets because, by studying the Earth, we can become familiar with general principles that can thus be applied to other planets.

== Earth's Atmosphere ==

{{mergefrom|Electronics/Atmosphere}}

The Earth has been shrouded in a thin layer of gases for most of its history. However, the nature and composition of these gases has changed significantly over time.  At its initial formation, the Earth's first atmosphere was composed primarily of the light elements hydrogen and helium.  However, at the temperatures in the inner solar system, these atoms had sufficient energies to exceed Earth's escape velocity.  Earth's gravity was, therefore, not sufficient to hold these gases, which quickly escaped into space.

Earth's second atmosphere was generated by gases that had been trapped within the  rocks making up the body of the planet, but escaped due to volcanic activity, a process known as &quot;outgassing&quot;.  The components of this atmosphere were primarily carbon dioxide, water, and lesser amounts of nitrogen.  As the Earth cooled, however, much of the water vapor precipitated out of the air, and areas of liquid water formed on its surface. Much of the carbon dioxide dissolved into the liquid water.  Much of this carbon dioxide was later bound up in various aquatic life forms, and then deposited with the remains of those lifeforms in ocean sediment, eventually forming large limestone deposits.

As life evolved on the planet's surface, some of the remaining carbon dioxide was converted by these organisms into oxygen, through photosynthesis and similar processes.  This had the effect of further lowering carbon dioxide levels, leaving nitrogen as the primary constituent of the atmosphere, and adding in substantial amounts of oxygen.  Thus Earth's third atmosphere was formed as we know it today: primarily nitrogen,  oxygen, water vapor and various trace molecules in lesser amounts.

      <comment>/* data on usability of pie charts */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I am not a great fan of pie charts and think that others should be dissuaded from using them. 

1. Comparisons between pie charts are very difficult  (rotation
2. If the chart has more than 3 or 4 sections then the labeling is critical.  With more than 4 sections, the labels often collide (see the example graph).  Stacked bar graphs are considerably easier to read and compare.  

I will outline this in the comparative pie chart section.  [[User:Chrispounds|Chrispounds]] 01:05, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

== data on usability of pie charts ==

I'm not sure where it started - tufte or earlier, but there seems to be a dataless prejudice against pie charts.
wikipedia has several sources on how people percieve areas and angles and lines, but I havn't seen a study where some one asks users to evaluate the data in pie charts and some other form</text>

*:Why is this such a difficult task?  The formal proposal had a few to start with, and I would recommend a general slow growth on the number of different items, but it would still be a very focused book regardless.  Certainly like what was done with the languages, the developed sections would have prominence with lesser developed sections being pushed into the &quot;backwater&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:32, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Destroying a Session */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">HTML and PHP are &quot;stateless&quot; languages. Meaning that they are incapable of retaining a state between pages. To get around this serious limitation, we use sessions. With sessions, session variables are stored in a file on the web server and so are accessible across multiple pages.

== Starting a Session ==
Before we can start using session variables, we need to start a session. This needs to be done on every page that makes use of session variables. It is important to note that a session must be started '''before anything is outputted'''. Here is the code to start a session :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
session_start();
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Please make sure that there are NO SPACES before the &quot;&lt;?php&quot; (php starting tag), as that will return errors!

It is worth noting, that the way in which the server distinguishes between multiple sessions being implemented on it simultaneously is by session ID's. When a unique session is created, it is assigned a Session ID, which the browser retains, and is used to let the we server know which session to use.

== Writing Session Variables ==
Once a session is created, variables may be stored in the &lt;tt&gt;$_SESSION[]&lt;/tt&gt; array variable. Here is an example :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
session_start();
$_SESSION['user_name'] = &quot;Administrator&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Retrieving Session Variables ==
Once a session is created, and variables are stored, they may be retrieved from the &lt;tt&gt;$_SESSION[]&lt;/tt&gt; array. Here is an example :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
session_start();
if (isset($_SESSION['user_name'])){
   $user_name = $_SESSION['user_name'];
   print $user_name;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example starts a session, then checks if the session variable 'user_name' has been created (with the &lt;tt&gt;isset()&lt;/tt&gt; function), if it has, then it assigns its value to &lt;tt&gt;$user_name&lt;/tt&gt;, and prints it to the screen.

== Destroying a Session ==
To destroy a session, we use the &lt;tt&gt;session_destroy()&lt;/tt&gt; function. This is useful if we want to, for example, log a user off of a web-application. Thus we would use the following code :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
session_start();
session_destroy();
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that we first need to start the session before we destroy it. This is because the &lt;tt&gt;session_destroy()&lt;/tt&gt; function destroys the currently active session.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to get user input without using the command line, then you will use HTML forms. PHP has various functions and techniques for handling the input from HTML forms. In specific, we will use the special array variables &lt;tt&gt;$_GET[]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;$_POST[]&lt;/tt&gt;.

== HTML Forms ==
Before we start using these special variables, lets have a look at how to set up the HTML forms to interact with PHP. Here is a simple example form :

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;HTML Form Example&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;form_handler.php&quot;&gt;
      username : &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt;
      password : &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;GO&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example sets up a form with a &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; attribute. The `method` defines how the data from the form is to be transferred to the page defined by `action`. The `method` can either be ''GET'' or ''POST''. If ''GET'' is used, then all the form elements will be appended to the url of the target page (specified by the &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; attribute), in url encoded format (&lt;code&gt;target?attrib1=val1&amp;attrib2=val2&amp;attrib3=val3&lt;/code&gt; etc...)  These attributes are easily accessed in PHP by using the &lt;code&gt;$_GET[]&lt;/code&gt; array.

If the ''POST'' method is specified, then the data will be put into a special server variable, and accessed in PHP by using the built-in &lt;code&gt;$_POST[]&lt;/code&gt; array.

Note that in the HTML code, the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the INPUT tags are used as the reference strings in the &lt;code&gt;$_GET&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$_POST&lt;/code&gt; arrays, thus it is very important to always use unique values for the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

== GET ==
To retrieve &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; variables in the address url, we use the following method :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $username = $_GET['username'];
 $password = $_GET['password'];
 echo &quot;Username : $username \n Password : $password \n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Please note that &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; is not good to use for this example, because you will generally not want username and password details being displayed in the URL. Rather use POST for login details and authentication.

== POST ==
To retrieve &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; variables, we use the following method :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $username = $_POST['username'];
 $password = $_POST['password'];
 print &quot;Username : $username \n Password : $password \n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that when &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; is used, the posted data is completely invisible to the user.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can only do so much with storing information in files. When you need to store large amounts of data, and perform intensive number crunching on that data, there is nothing better than a good SQL database. In this section, we'll discuss connecting PHP to a MySQL database and perform queries and retrieve data back from the database.

== Opening a Connection to a MySQL Database ==
The first thing that we need to do before we can interact with any database, is to open up a connection to that database server. This is done by using the &lt;tt&gt;mysql_connect()&lt;/tt&gt; function, which returns a database handler, much like a file handler when dealing with files. The database handler is then used  to selecting the active database to use.

Here is the code to setup a connection to the database server, and to select a database to use : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $db = &quot;database1&quot;;
 $link = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;);
 mysql_select_db($db, $link);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Creating a Query ==
Once a connection to a database has been made, you will inevitably want to perform a database query. To create a query on the selected database, we use the &lt;tt&gt;mysql_query()&lt;/tt&gt; function. If you use a &lt;tt&gt;SELECT&lt;/tt&gt; query, then the data returned from that query will be passed to the &lt;tt&gt;mysql_query()&lt;/tt&gt; function, which will in turn return it to a variable which you can specify. In the following example, two queries are made, the first does not return any data, and the second does.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 // A Query without any returned data
 mysql_query (&quot;INSERT INTO `table1` ('val1', 'val2')&quot;);
 // A Query with returned data
 $query = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT * FROM `table1`&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

== Retrieving data from a SELECT Query ==
There are many methods for retrieving data from a &lt;tt&gt;SELECT&lt;/tt&gt; query.

If we take, for example, the following code :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 # --- Connect To Database ---
 $db = &quot;db1&quot;;
 $link = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;);
 mysql_select_db($db, $link);
 
 # --- Select Info from Database ---
 $result = mysql_query (&quot;SELECT val1, val2 FROM tbl1&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

To now retrieve the data from the &lt;tt&gt;$result&lt;/tt&gt; variable, we can use one of many methods. The recommended method, however, is to sequentially go through each row of the table, storing it into a one-dimensional array. We do this by using the &lt;tt&gt;mysql_fetch_row()&lt;/tt&gt; function, passing it the variable into which the result is stored. Here is a simple example :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)){
    foreach ($row as $field) {
       print &quot;$field . &quot;;
    }
    print &quot;&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This will simply output the result in table-like format.

Here is another example of using this method :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $counter = 0;
 while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)){
    $val1[$counter] = $row[0];
    $val2[$counter] = $row[1];
    $counter++;
 }
 $numRows = $counter;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example, simply splits the results up into multiple one-dimensional arrays, for easy manipulation.

== Closing a Database Connection ==
It is not always necessary to close a connection when you are finished, but it is advised. It is, however, necessary to close the connection to the database if you want to open up a new connection to a different database.

To close a connection to a database, we use the &lt;tt&gt;mysql_close()&lt;/tt&gt; function, as follows :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 mysql_close();
&lt;/source&gt;

== Error Handling ==
It is useful when debugging, and even when you just want to make sure that a database does not behave unexpectedly. Once a query has been created via the &lt;tt&gt;mysql_query()&lt;/tt&gt; function, any error messages generated will be stored in the &lt;tt&gt;mysql_error()&lt;/tt&gt; function. Here is  a sample code snippet to display a error message. However, when there is no error messages, a blank string is returned.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 print mysql_error();
&lt;/source&gt;

|The Hungarian language is spoken by about 10 million people in Hungary and about 3 million elsewhere, notably in the formerly Hungarian lands now part of Romania, Ukraine, Slovakia, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria, a number of other European countries, as well as in Canada and the United States.

The emigration of many Hungarian people after the First and Second World Wars and the civil war of October-November 1956 have spread it to most corners of the Western world. Unfortunately, like many minority languages, it has been regularly suppressed in post-Trianon countries such as Romania (Transylvania).

Although it is used by a relative minority in Europe, Hungarian can be a fantastic language to learn: it is unique, completely different from any other language in the world. Hungarian literature is thus truly exceptional and hard to translate. Nonetheless, its vocabulary and sounds have been used by authors such as Anne McCaffrey and J.R.R. Tolkien.

It is linguistically related to Finnish and Estonian, but these are more similar to each other than they are to Hungarian, and few demonstrably similar words remain.

|Üdvözlünk a magyar oldalon! A magyar nyelvet körülbelül 10 millió ember beszéli Magyarországon, és megközelítőleg 3 millióan más országokban, például Romániában, Ukrajnában, Szlovákiában, Szerbiában, Ausztriában és számos egyéb európai országban, valamint az Egyesült Államokban.

Az első és második világháború után, majd az 1956-os forradalom és szabadságharc után nagyon sok magyar emigrált, így a nyugati világ majd' minden szegletébe elkerült a magyar nyelv.

Sajnos, mint sok más &quot;kisebbségi&quot; nyelvet, a Trianon utáni országokban a magyar nyelvet is üldözték, mint például Romániában (Erdélyben).

Annak ellenére, hogy ezt a nyelvet egy viszonylagos kisebbség beszéli Európában, fantasztikus dolog megtanulni, mivel lényegesen különbözik minden más nyelvtől, így például a magyar irodalom is kivételes élményt képes nyújtani. A nyelv szavait, hangzását olyan szerzők is használták, mint Anne McCaffrey és J.R.R. Tolkien.

A magyar nyelv ugyanazon nyelvcsaládba tartozik, mint a finn és az észt, de e két utóbbi jobban hasonlít egymásra, mint (bármelyikük) a magyarra. Legfeljebb néhány szó hangzása hasonló.

You started the hive of pages called Wikilanguages, and it has recently been brought up at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] for deletion from Wikibooks.  The point here is that if you want this content to remain on Wikibooks, you will have to try and defend the reasons for starting it here.

I want to let you know that in general I support innovative ideas and concepts like this, and indeed in general I think Wikibooks ought to be a place for experimentation like this.  I've done things like this myself even.

There is a place to make suggestions for new projects for the Wikimedia Foundation, but there has also been some very valid criticism that little to no action takes place for suggestions like that.  For that reason I don't mind seeing some content like this on Wikibooks, provided active development is occuring in some form.

I realize that by the time you get back to seeing this message that the content may have been long ago deleted, and for that I apologize (in advance at the moment).  I really do value the contributions of Wikibooks contributors, especially when they come from academic environments.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:26, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Recording */ To [[GarageBand/Recording in GarageBand]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a read-up on the various buttons, panels, and controls that make up GarageBand's interface.
== Getting Started ==
After GarageBand has fully loaded, choose &quot;File &gt; New&quot;
[[Image:get_started.jpg|250px|thumb|This menu pops up when you choose to create a &quot;New&quot; file from the &quot;File&quot; menu.]]

# Here you fill in the name you want to give your new song. 
# With the drop menu you can choose the location you want to save your song file.
# You can set the tempo or speed of your song beforehand. The speed is measured in beats per minute and this amount is shown in the box below next to &quot;bpm&quot;. The tempo can be altered at a later point in production.
# Here you can set the time signature of your song, or, in other words, the beats per measure. Use the menu to choose between the different times. 'Note' that the time you choose will affect the number of loops you will be able to use in your project. If you are new to GarageBand, a 4/4 time is a good place to start.
# In addition, the tonality of your project can be chosen beforehand. This is another option that limits the number of loops you can use.
# When you are done with choosing your settings, click &quot;Create&quot; to start working on your new project.

== The Working Area ==
[[Image:working_field.jpg|600px|thumb|In this field of the GarageBand interface you can move around your loops and recordings, you can add new instruments, change their volumes and pan them to the left or to the right.]]

# In this column from top to bottom you see the different tracks or instruments used in the song. 
# This is the Mixer column in which you can use the knob to 'pan' the sound of this track to the left or to the right, or use the slider to raise or lower the track's volume. When you play the song back you will see the volume dials above the slider going up from green to yellow to red. The volume is best if this dial's maximum lies within the yellow zone and not in the red. 
# In this area you see all the loops and recordings that you are using in your song. Within this plane you can adjust your 'sound fragments' so they fit nicely with the other tracks by looping, shortening, lengthening and positioning them. 
# With this slider you can change the scale of the plane under number 3. Slide it to the right to see the loops and recordings in detail and to the left for a very global view of your song.
# This is the cursor. This is from where GarageBand plays back your song when you press &quot;play&quot;. Reposition it to make the song play from a different place or use the buttons in the 'buttons bar' below.
# In this example there are only 4 instruments in use, but still many more tracks can be added to this song. When recording you have to select the track you want to record in. To select the track, click on it and the instrument icon will illuminate like the 'Shaker' in the example picture.

'''When recording or mixing in GarageBand it is important to know what the buttons in the first column mean.''' 
[[Image:Gbbuttons1.jpg|150px|right]]
# This first button indicates that if you press record you will record for this track. Therefore, when you select a track this button turns on for that track.
# Use this button to mute this track.
# Use this button to single out this track. This mutes all the other tracks.
# Use this button to lock this track to prevent changes made to it.
# When this button is pressed a more detailed panning and volume-adjusting mode is shown. With this you can reduce the volume of that certain track  or raise it at any point in the song. This also counts for panning, though when learning the basics of GarageBand we can ignore this function.

==The Button Panel==
[[Image:Button_pnl.jpg|center|600px]]

# Use this button to add a new track to your project.
# This button opens up the detailed information on the track that is currently selected. 
# These buttons open the 'bottom panel'. The 'eye' will show the 'loops bank' and the 'scissors' open an even more detailed look at the time selected within the track for detailed sound editing. In this tutorial we only look at the 'loops bank.'
# This is the record button. When pressed GarageBand will start recording either what is played with a USB keyboard or what is plugged into the sound input of the computer such as a guitar or microphone.
# Use these buttons to move through your song. The first button will place the cursor at the start of your project. There are 'back' and 'forward' buttons that move the cursor either one measure back or forward. The middle button is the 'play' button. The last button can be used to loop certain sections. Feel free to try it out but this tutorial won't explain this function.
# This is a panel that shows at what measure or at what time the cursor is. To switch between time or measures click on the small clock or the musical note in the bottom left corner of this panel. This panel also shows the tempo of your project. By clicking on it a slider will open up with which you can change the tempo. 
# This slider shows the overall volume of the piece. Again, the best volume is in the range of the green/yellow area of the dials above the slider.

Visual Arts in the IB is a subject for those who enjoy art practice and independent work. The independent nature of the IB program is strongly reflected in the Visual Arts.  Generally the students use all of their class time to plan, create and critique their art work.  

Depending on the length of the class, this could be a very short amount of time.  This means that the majority of work for Visual Arts is done at home.  The major &quot;homework assignment&quot; is the Investigation Work Book (IWB), which is a journal where the student researches their theme, experiments with media, and reflects on their pieces and plans out new pieces they will create. Currently, for a HLA or SLA student, the studio work is 60% and the IWB is 40% of the grade. Similarly, an HLB or SLB student will have their IWB be 60% of the grade and their studio work is just 40%. The difference between HL and SL is considered in how many hours IB supposes that your work took you. An SL student will be expected to show fewer pieces and workbook pages.
 
The IB examiner looks for a strong correlation between the IWB and the student's work.  The unity of the student's portfolio is also a very important part of IB Visual Arts.  Although IB does not require a &quot;theme&quot;, there must be a focus of the art; change over time tracing the development of the student.  Having a theme in your work can be helpful though, and is encouraged by most teachers. Many students find that after they have started creating pieces, they can naturally find the focus of their portfolio.

Although students considering taking this course should evaluate their proficiency in various art techniques, skill is not the major focus.  Instead, IB Visual Arts is a class where the students are able to grow and develop themselves.  Despite what has been said, the course, especially at HL, does require some talent as well as many, many hours of hard work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
==Physical Studies==

&lt;p&gt;Many studies have found that stutterers have normal physiological characteristics, such as heart rate and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

==Psychological Studies==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Whatever the source of stuttering is, it is not amenable to the treatments I have developed.  I therefore refuse to deal with it further.”
&amp;#151;Sigmund Freud
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many studies have tried to tie stuttering to a psychological or personality problem. The only psychological trait common to stutterers is fear and anxiety around speaking tasks, such as ordering in a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

==Parental Attitudes and Behaviors==

&lt;p&gt;Many studies have tried to tie stuttering to parental attitudes and behaviors. The only trend is that poor, uneducated, dysfunctional families are more likely to have children who stutter. Likely the only parental behavior that contributes to childhood stuttering is not taking children to see a speech-language pathologist for therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

==Intelligence==
&lt;p&gt;College students who stutter are more intelligent than college students who don't stutter. However, any person with a disability has to be especially intelligent and motivated to attempt college work. This doesn’t mean that stutterers in general are more intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering among mentally-retarded individuals appears to be far higher than the general population.  In Down Syndrome, prevalences from 21% to 45% have been reported. This is likely because mentally-retarded children and adults are more likely to fail at therapy&amp;#151;stuttering therapies require intelligence and mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;

==Language Studies==
&lt;p&gt;Many studies have examined stutterers' language skills. Whether children who stutter started talking later has not been established. School-age stutterers have normal language skills, as measured by standard tests. However, advanced tests such as understanding words played backwards suggest that stutterers may have an auditory processing disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

==Recommended Books==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The CPU ''(At the Heart of the Process)''==
As far as computing power goes, the (CPU) Central Processing Unit is the most important component of a computer system. When you run your web browser, write your poems, doodle on Paint, etc. you're using a CPU. The CPU carries out each instruction of the computer's program in sequence, performs the required arithmetic and logical operations, and directs the (I/O) Input/Output operations of the system. In short, the CPU is almost literally the computer's &quot;brain.&quot;

Two typical components of a CPU are: the (ALU) Arithmetic Logic Unit, which performs arithmetic and logical operations, and the (CU) Control Unit, which fetches instructions in sequence from memory, then decodes and executes them, using the ALU if necessary.

Personal computers have a CPU contained in a single microprocessor chip socketed on the motherboard, bearing a heat-sink with its own fan to dissipate the considerable heat generated by modern high speed CPUs.

== General Overhaul ==

I started a general overhaul. By default I will not discuss anything but just do it (since apparently there are no active co-authors anyway). If you think I should discuss anything, just let me know. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:26, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

==Changed the front Page==

I changed it to, what I believe, to be a more appropriate flags of German Nation (just the main ones) and some common German sights. Even though the singers from before might be nice for whoever knows about them, but I don't know who they are, and I honestly believe that there is a lot more interest in German in terms of culture and travel opportunities. Hope nobody objects to the change.
*I Archived much of the discussion. The talk page was getting long, and much of it obsolete.
*broke link in [[Template:German/Contents]] from [[German/Contents]], to [[German]], officially making the contents page obsolete, consider deletion.--[[User:Danthemango|Danthemango]] ([[User talk:Danthemango|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Danthemango|contribs]]) 13:13, 19 January 2011 (UTC)

== Growing beyond the book format ==

My name is Ian and I'm from a project called Wikiotics, where we build free software tools for language instruction. We are starting to build collections of interactive language lessons that can serve as textbook replacements for students and this wikibook seems like a great place to start.

If there is anyone here who is interested in expanding this content beyond a traditional text-based book format or who would like to incorporate interactive lessons we build based on the outline of this book, just chime in here or contact us at contact AT wikiotics DOT org or in irc at #wikiotics on freenode. 

As example of the kind of new materials you can make with our tools, here are examples our current lesson types:
* Picture choice lesson (http://wikiotics.org/en/Introduction), 
* Re-mixable Podcast (http://wikiotics.org/user/ian/FSI-Mandarin-Module01-Unit01), 
* Text multiple choice lesson (http://wikiotics.org/en/WANY_Hospital_grammar) 
* new Storybook lesson [''coming soon''](http://laurent.dev.wikiotics.net/en/storybook1).

: If people are interested, one place to start might be our FSI conversion efforts. The US State Department's Foreign Service Institute made a series of public domain language courses back in the 70's to train consular workers going over seas. Those old audio tapes have been digitized and put online and we've begun cutting them into individual sentences so that they can be modernized and expanded without having to re-record whole episodes. You can see an example of where we have done this with the introductory Mandarin course here: http://wikiotics.org/group/fsi-import/Mandarin_lessons . Now we have a community member going through the PDF documents for the German course and breaking the dialogues and other written components into xml here: http://fsi-german-basic-course.yojik.eu/  

: If anyone is interested in building on that material, I would be happy to help with cutting up and uploading the German audio lessons into wikiotics. Usage has changed a bit since the 70's but the curricular design is still pretty standard and there is a lot of material there to work with.

== Hilfen beim Deutschlernen ==

;Tipp 1
Ich hoffe, die Autoren dieses Buches verstehen genug Deutsch, um das hier zu lesen. Man sollte den Schülern erklären, das die &quot;Sie&quot;-Form nicht nur die höfliche Form ist, sondern auch eine einfache Form ist, da das Verb meist in der Grundform gebraucht wird, so wie man es im Lexikon liest.
;Beispiel
:Ich gebe, du gibst, er gibt, wir geben...
:Sie geben
Bei der Anrede &quot;Sie&quot; hat man keine Probleme mit der Deklination (Veränderung der Vokale bei Verben). Man verwendet einfach die Form des Infinitiv (Grundform).

;Tipp 2
Bilde die Zukunft und die Vergangenheit mit &quot;sein&quot; und &quot;haben&quot;. Dann muss man sich weniger Formen einprägen. Der Deutsche nimmt es mit den Zeiten nicht so genau wie der Engländer.

;Beispiel
:kommen: ich komme, ich kam, ich gebe, ich gab, du gibst...
: ich bin gekommen, er ist gekommen, er war gekommen, du bist gekommen, du wirst kommen, er wird kommen
: ich habe gegeben, er hat gegeben, du hast es gegeben, du wirst geben, er wird geben
Wenn man die verschiedenen Zeitformen mit den Hilfswerben &quot;sein&quot; und &quot;haben&quot; bildet, braucht man nur diese Formen durch alle Zeiten zu lernen. Für das Hauptverb gibt es dann viel weniger Formen, die durch alle Personen gleich bleiben. Das ist in vielen Sprechsituationen einfacher. Dieses funktioniert auch mit vielen anderen Hilfsverben, wie beispielsweise &quot;können&quot;, &quot;möchten&quot;, &quot;dürfen&quot;, &quot;müssen&quot; etc.
;Tipp 3
Es gibt eine typische Lautverschiebung. 
:deutsch &quot;t&quot; = englisch &quot;d&quot; er hatte = he had
:deutsch &quot;b&quot; = englisch &quot;v&quot; ich habe = I have
Es gibt zwar wenige Ausnahmen, aber vieles versteht man ohne Probleme, wenn man einfach die oben genannten Buchstaben austauscht.

Ich verstehe zwar recht gut Englisch, und kann es auch ziemlich fließend sprechen, aber leider ist es nicht fehlerfrei, so dass ich mich nicht traue, die Kapitel selbst zu verfassen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you first start up Anim8or, after the splash screen goes away, you will get a grid
in front of you with a bunch of buttons surrounding it.

[[Image:Anim8or_User_Interface.jpg|Anim8or User Interface]]

Let's go over the buttons first.  Here are the set of buttons on the 
left of the screen when you first start Anim8or:

[[Image:UI_Overview_Object_Edit.gif|Object/Edit Toolbar]]

These set of buttons are part of the '''Object/Edit''' mode in 
Anim8or.  These tools allow you to create basic objects such as 
cubes, spheres, and other '''primitives'''.  You can also do basic manipulation 
on these objects such as rotation, moving the object, and scaling the object.  
We will now go over all these buttons to understand them more.

==NetBeans IDE 5.0  instruction==
# Launch NetBeans
# Make yourself familiar with the IDE by opening Help &gt; Help Contents and reading the material in Getting Started 
# Create a new project by File &gt; New Project.. (Ctrl+Shift+N)
# Under &quot;Choose a Project:&quot; select under Categories: General
# Select under Projects: Java Application
# Press Next
# Name the project name appropriately (e.g., xml1)
# Check &quot;Set as Main Project&quot; and un-check &quot;Create Main Class&quot;
# Save to the appropriate location
# Press Finish

# Create a new file by New &gt; File/Folder &gt; XML &gt; XML document
# Name the file (e.g., city)
# Press Next
# Select &quot;Well-formed Document&quot;
# Press Finish
# You should see the following skeleton XML file


&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

&lt;root&gt;

&lt;/root&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


# The goal is to create a simple markup file, rather than an XML file, so replace the section delimited by &lt;root&gt; and &lt;/root&gt; in the skeleton XML file with the lines in Table 1. After the change, the file should look like
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


# Check the markup file is well-formed by clicking on the single green downward point triangle on the XML tool bar above the document listing. It should pass the check. Alternatively, use Alt+F9 (Windows) or Ctrl+F9 (Mac).
# Delete the tag &lt;/city&gt; and check the file again. This time you should get an error indicating that an end tag is missing. &quot;XML document structures must start and end within the same entity.&quot; followed by the line number (where the error occurs) in brackets should appear in blue and underlined.


&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
NetBeans is an open source IDE that includes an XML editor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



===XML document:===

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XML Document.  
#Save your file as ‘city’ 
#Select XML Schema-Constrained Document as the document type. 
#Next, specify your schema location (Go to Browse, then select the schema just created) and root element name (tourGuide).  
#Copy and paste the above code into the NetBeans editor and save.
#Check the XML document to make sure it is well-formed (ALT-F9).  
To validate an XML document: 
#Right-click the document's node and choose Validate XML. 
If the XML file, city.xml, conforms to the XML schema provided, city.xsd, your Output Window should look like the following:

[[Image:WellForm.JPG|Output Window - Validity check]] 

Open this file, city.xml, in NetBeans.
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;ffffff&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 '''Summary: Being a file which contains XML code and syntax, the XML document is an entity of neatly organized elements and subelements.'''
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Netbeans Tips ====
The prefix &quot;xsi&quot; for attribute &quot;xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation&quot; associated with an element type &quot;Listing&quot; is not bound. 
      -Caused because line
       &quot;xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'&quot; is 
       missing from the top of the document.

cvc-elt.1: Cannot find the declaration of element 'Listing'.
      -Caused due to lack of extension(.xsd) at the end of the schema
       name.

cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'MuseumName'. One of '{&quot;&quot;:Museum}' is expected. [5] 
      -Caused due to lack of naming at the beginning and end of the
       variable naming section.

The element type &quot;MuseumName&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/MuseumName&gt;&quot;. 
      -Could be caused by a missing &quot;/&quot; in the end tag of one of the
       variables

===XML Schema===


Any XML document, including XML schema and XML stylesheet documents, can be checked to make sure they are “well-formed”. An XML document is said to be well-formed if it adheres to the XML syntax rules, as outlined in the Chapter 1, such as there must be exactly one root element, every start tag must have an end tag.  The well-formedness of an XML documents can be checked using an XML editor software, in this case, the NetBeans.
If any errors are detected, they are listed along with the line number in the Output window.  This location is not necessarily the line where the error occurred.  By double-clicking on any error message, you can go to the line in the XML document where the error was detected. 

Use NetBeans to create a new project:
#Go to File -&gt; New Project
Use NetBeans to create the above XML schema:

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XML Schema.  
#Save your file as ‘city’ (this gives the file an extension of .xsd). 
#Copy and Paste the above schema into city.xsd and save
To check an XML document to see if it is well-formed:
#Right-click the document's node (under files, city.xsd) and choose Check XML schema or press Alt-F9.  

If the XML schema, city.xsd, is well-formed, your Output Window should look like this:
[[Image:WellForm.JPG|Well Form XML Document]]

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;ffffff&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 '''Summary: The XML schema shows the structure and elements of an XML document.'''
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==== ''' Netbeans Tips ''' ====
Element type &quot;xsd:element&quot; must be followed by either attribute specifications, &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;/&gt;&quot;.
      -Caused by lack of &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;/&gt;&quot; symbol at the end of either the 
       specified line or the line there after.
The value of attribute &quot;name&quot; associated with an element type &quot;xsd:complexType&quot; must not contain the '&lt;' character. 
      -Often caused by lack of closing quotation around the variable 
       name on either the specified line or the line there after.
src-resolve.4.2: Error resolving component 'xsd:strin'...
      -Caused by invalid &quot;type&quot;, most likely misspelled.  Can be for 
       any &quot;type&quot;, not just &quot;string.&quot;
The element type &quot;xsd:sequence&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused because &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt; is not found in order to close 
       the statement.  
      -Also caused because the closing statements are out of order as
       they at the beginning of the Schema.

===XML Stylesheet===

Use NetBeans to create the above XML stylesheet: 

#Go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; XML -&gt; XSL Stylesheet  
#Save your file as ‘city’ 
#Copy and paste the above code into the NetBeans editor and save.
#Check the stylesheet to make sure it is well-formed (ALT-F9).

Note: The city example files (city.xsd, city.xml and city.xsl) can
be created using a text editor, and the results are displayed correctly
in a compatible web browser such as Mozilla 1.6. You will need to store
all of the files in the same directory and insert the following line
after line 1 of city.xml:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;city.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot;?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This associates the XSL Stylesheet with the XML file containing the
city data. Also, If you are using Netbeans, be sure to take off the xmlns line in the beginning which looks like xmlns='http://xml.netbeans.org/examples/targetNS', otherwise it will not display all data.


==== ''' Netbeans Tips ''' ====

The element type &quot;xsl:text&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused by either lack of end-tag or misspelling of the end-
       tag.

The element type &quot;xsl:for-each&quot; must be terminated by the matching end-tag &quot;&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;&quot;. 
      -Caused due to either lack of end-tag for the specified tag or 
       end-tags placed in the wrong order.

==Henry IV (1399- 1413)==
[[Image:henry4.JPG|thumb|190px|right|Henry IV]]
'''Henry IV''' was born on 3 April 1367 at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, which was why he was also known as Henry Bolingbroke. His father was the third son of King Edward III of England, John of Gaunt. After landing in Yorkshire in 1398, Henry had enough support to be declared king by parliament in 1399. As king, Henry consulted with parliament often, but he sometimes disagreed with them, particularly over church matters. Henry was the first English king to allow the burning of heretics.

Henry spent much of his reign defending himself against plots, rebellions and assassination attempts. Rebellions continued throughout the first ten years of Henry's reign. These included the revolt of Owen Glendower, who declared himself Prince of Wales in 1400, and the rebellion of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland.  The king's success in putting down these rebellions was due partly to the military ability of his eldest son, Henry, who would later become King. In 1406, English soldiers captured the future King James I of Scotland as he was going to France. James remained a prisoner of Henry for the rest of Henry's reign.

===Marriages and children===

In 1381, 18 years before becoming king, Henry married Mary de Bohun. They had two daughters and four sons, one of which was the future King Henry V of England. Mary died in 1394, and in 1403 Henry married Joanna of Navarre, the daughter of Charles d'Évreux, King of Navarre. She was the widow of John V of Brittany, with whom she had four daughters and four sons, but she and Henry had no children.

The later years of Henry's reign were marked by serious health problems. He had some sort of disfiguring skin disease, and more seriously suffered acute attacks of some grave illness in June 1405, April 1406, June 1408, during the winter of 1408-09, December 1412, and then finally a fatal bout in March 1413. Unusually for a king of England, he was buried not at Westminster Abbey but at Canterbury Cathedral, as near to the shrine of Thomas Becket as possible.

==Henry V (1413-1422)==
[[File:King Henry V From NPG.jpg|thumb|King Henry V.]]
'''Henry V''' was born in Monmouth in 1387. He was king from 1413 to his death in 1422 By the time Henry died, he had not only consolidated power as the King of England but had also effectively accomplished what generations of his ancestors had failed to achieve through decades of war: unification of the crowns of England and France in a single person.  

===Life before became King===

When Henry's father, Henry Bolingbroke, was exiled in 1398, Richard II took the boy into his own charge and treated him kindly.  In 1399 the Lancastrian revolution brought Bolingbroke. He was created Duke of Lancaster on 10 November 1399, the third person to hold the title that year. In 1403 the sixteen-year-old prince was almost killed by an arrow which became lodged in his face.  An ordinary soldier would have been left to die from such a wound, but Henry had the benefit of the best possible care, and, over a period of several days after the incident, the royal physician crafted a special tool in order to extract the tip of the arrow without doing further damage.  The operation was successful.

The Welsh revolt of Owen Glendower took up much of Henry's attention until 1408.  Then, as a result of the King's ill-health, Henry began to take a wider interest in politics.  From January 1410, he had practical control of the government. In 1413 his father died and Henry became king.

===Reign===

When he became king, Henry had to deal with three main problems: the restoration of domestic peace, the healing of rift in the Church and the recovery of English prestige in Europe. Henry tackled all of the domestic policies together, and gradually built on them a wider policy. From the first he made it clear that he would rule England as the head of a united nation. The heirs of those who had suffered in the last reign were restored gradually to their titles and estates. 

Henry then turned his attention to foreign affairs, in particular the war with France and his claim to be King of it. 25 October 1415 saw Henry score a great success in this campaign at Agincourt. The command of the sea was secured by driving the Genoese allies of the French out of the English Channel. Successful diplomacy saw the Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund, cease his support of Henry's French foes, whilst the Treaty of Canterbury helped end the rift in the Church.

With the French having lost the support of the Genoese and the Holy Roman Emperor, with these 2 allies gone, the war was renewed on a larger scale in 1417.  Lower Normandy was quickly conquered, and Rouen was cut off from Paris and besieged. The French were paralysed by the disputes of Burgundians and Armagnacs. Henry skilfully played them off one against the other, without relaxing his warlike energy. In January 1419 Rouen fell. By August the English were outside the walls of Paris. The internal disputes of the French parties ended with the killing of John of Burgundy by men loyal to the heir to the French throne. Philip, the new Duke of Burgundy, and the French court threw themselves into Henry's arms. After six months' negotiation Henry was recognised as heir and regent of France. On 2 June 1420, Henry married Catherine of Valois, the French king's daughter. Following his death, Catherine secretly married a Welsh courtier, Owen Tudor, grandfather of the future King Henry VII of England.

===Death===

Henry then made plans for a new Crusade began to take shape as the French situation became clearer. Henry visited to England in 1421, but returned to France after forces led by the Duke of Clarence were defeated at the Battle of Baugé. The hardships of the longer winter siege of Meaux broke down his health, and he died of dysentery at Bois de Vincennes on 31 August 1422. Had he lived another two months, he would have been crowned King of France. Henry was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his infant son, Henry.

==Henry VI (1422-1461, 1470-1471)==
[[Image:HenryVIofEngland.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Henry VI]]
'''Henry VI''' was born at Windsor Castle on 6 December 1421, the son of King Henry V. He was King of England from 1422, when he was nine months old. In 1423, parliament was called and a regency council was appointed. Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, Henry IV's youngest son, was appointed Protector and Defender of the Realm and the Church until the King came of age, but the Council had the power to replace him at any time. His duties were limited to keeping the peace and summoning and dissolving Parliament.
 
Henry was eventually crowned King of England in Westminster Abbey on 6 November 1429 a month before his eighth birthday, and as King of France at Notre Dame in Paris on 16 December 1431. However, during the rule of the regency council, much of the ground his father gained in France was lost.  A revival of French fortunes, beginning with the military victories of Joan of Arc, led to the French nobles preferring the French dauphin, who was crowned as King of France at Reims.  Diplomatic errors as well as military failures resulted in the loss of most of the English territories in France. 

Henry assumed the reins of government when he was declared of age in 1437. On gaining his majority, Henry VI proved to be a deeply spiritual man, lacking the worldly wisdom necessary to allow him to rule effectively.  Right from the time he assumed control as king, he allowed his court to be dominated by a few noble favorites, and the peace party, which was in favour of ending the war in France, quickly came to dominate.

===Marriage===

It was thought that the best way of pursuing peace with France was through a marriage with King Charles VII of France's niece, Margaret of Anjou. Henry agreed, especially when he heard reports of Margaret's stunning beauty. Charles agreed to the marriage on condition that he would not have to provide the customary dowry and instead would receive the lands of Maine and Anjou from the English. These conditions were agreed to in the Treaty of Tours, but the cession of Maine and Anjou was kept secret from parliament. It was known that this would be hugely unpopular with the English populace. The marriage went ahead in 1445 and Margaret's character seems to have complemented that of Henry's in that she was prepared to take decisions and show leadership where he was content to be led by her. In this much Margaret proved a more competent ruler than Henry ever was, even though she was only sixteen at that time. The issue of Maine and Anjou finally became public knowledge in 1446.

===Reign ===

The government's increasing unpopularity was due to a breakdown in law and order, corruption, the distribution of royal land to the king's court favourites, the troubled state of the crown's finances, and the steady loss of territories in France. In 1447, this unpopularity took the form of a Commons campaign against the Duke of Suffolk, who was the most unpopular of all the King's favourites was widely seen as a traitor, partly because of his role in negotiating the Treaty of Tours. Henry was forced to send him into exile, but his ship was boarded in the English Channel, and he was murdered. His body was found on the beach at Dover.

In 1449, the Duke of Somerset, who was leading the campaign in France, started more battles in Normandy, but by the autumn had been pushed back to Caen. By 1450, the French had retaken the whole province. Returning troops, who had often not been paid, added to the sense of lawlessness in the southern counties of England, and Jack Cade led a rebellion in Kent in 1450. Henry came to London with an army to crush the rebellion, but was persuaded to keep half his troops behind while the other half met Cade at Sevenoaks. Cade triumphed and went on to occupy London. In the end, the rebellion achieved nothing, and London was retaken after a few days of disorder, but the rebellion showed that feelings of discontent were running high.

In 1450, the Duchy of Aquitaine, held since Henry II's time, was also lost, leaving Calais as England's only remaining territory in France. By 1452, Richard, Duke of York, who had been sidelined by being made ruler of Ireland, was persuaded to return amd claim his rightful place on the council, and put an end to bad government. His cause was a popular one, and he soon raised an army at Shrewsbury. The king's supporters raised their own similar-sized force in London. A stand-off took place south of London, with the Duke of York giving a list of grievances and demands to the king's supporters. One of the demands was the arrest of the Duke of Somerset. The king initially agreed, but Margaret intervened to prevent it. By 1453, the Duke of Somerset regained his influence, and the Duke of York was again isolated. In the meantime, an English advance in Aquitaine had retaken Bordeaux and was having some success, and the queen announced that she was pregnant.

However, English success in Aquitaine was short-lived, and on hearing the news of the English defeat in August 1453, Henry slipped into a mental breakdown and became completely unaware of everything that was going on around him. This was to last for more than a year, and Henry failed even to respond to the birth of his own son and heir, Edward. The Duke of York, meanwhile, had gained a very important ally, the Earl of Warwick, who was one of the very influential and rich. The Duke York was named regent as Protector of the Realm in 1454, and the queen lost all her power. Somerset was held prisoner in the Tower of London. The Duke of York's months as regent were spent tackling the problem of government overspending. On Christmas Day 1454, however, Henry regained his senses.

===Henry's character===

Henry was kind and generous to those he cared about, giving away land and titles to his advisors. He dressed simply. He was keen on reading and 'book-learning' but did not like leading his country in battle.

Keen on the promotion of education, Henry gave generous grants for the foundation of both Eton College near Windsor, for the education of students from poor backgrounds, and King's College, Cambridge, where they could continue their education. Henry seems to have been a decent man, but completely unsuited to kingship. He allowed himself to dominated by the power-hungry factions which surrounded him at court and was later powerless to stop the outbreak of bloody civil war. It was too much for him to cope with, as his recurring mental illness from 1453 onwards showed.

===The Wars of the Roses===

Nobles who had grown in power during Henry's reign, but who did not like Henry's government, took matters into their own hands by backing the claims of the rival House of York, first to the regency, and then to the throne itself. After a violent struggle between the houses of Lancaster and York, Henry was deposed on 4 March 1461 by his cousin, Edward of York, who became King Edward IV. But Edward failed to capture Henry and his queen, and they were able to flee into exile abroad. During the first period of Edward IV's reign, Lancastrian resistance continued mainly under the leadership of Queen Margaret and the few nobles still loyal to her in the northern counties of England and Wales. Henry was captured by King Edward in 1465 and subsequently held captive in the Tower of London.

Queen Margaret was exiled, first in Scotland and then in France. However, she was determined to win back for her husband and son, and with the help of King Louis XI of France she eventually allied with the Earl of Warwick, who had fallen out with Edward IV.  Warwick returned to England, defeated the Yorkists in battle, set Henry VI free and restored him to the throne on 30 October 1470.  Henry's return to the throne lasted a very short time. By this time, years in hiding followed by years as a prisoner had taken their toll on Henry, who had been weak-willed and mentally unstable to start with. Henry looked tired and vacant as Warwick and his men paraded him through the streets of London as the rightful King of England. Within a few months Warwick had went too far by declaring war on Burgundy, whose ruler responded by giving Edward IV the assistance he needed to win back his throne by force.

===Death===

Henry VI was again held prisoner, this time in the Tower of London, and he was murdered there on 21 May 1471.  Popular legend has accused Richard III of his murder, as well as the murder of Henry VI's son, Edward. Each year on the anniversary of Henry VI's death, the Provosts of Eton and King's College, Cambridge, lay roses and lilies on the altar which now stands where he died. King Henry VI was originally buried in Chertsey Abbey. In 1485 his body was moved to St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. He was succeeded as king by Edward, son of Richard, Duke of York.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anise liqueurs''' have a predominately [[anise]], also known as &quot;licorice,&quot; taste.  It is commonly derived from aniseed, although it can also come from [[star anise]], [[fennel]], or [[licorice]], all of which have a similar taste, though none are related.  Many anise-flavored liqueurs will turn a milky white when cold water is added.  [[Anethole]] and other oils in these liqueurs are soluble in alcohol but not in water. When water is added the oils come out of solution and form tiny droplets that cloud the drink.  Although ice-cold water is often used, it is not recommended to add ice to the drink first or to put anise liqueurs in the freezer, as anethole has a high freezing point, causing it to crystallize and form a skin on its surface.

Though anise-flavored liquors are generally referred to as [[liqueurs]], several contain no sugar and are thus [[spirits]], including arak, raki, and absinthe.

==Absinthe==
[[Image:Absinthe-original.jpg|left|36px|]]
{{Wikipedia|Absinthe}}
::70% ABV (140º proof)
::Origin: Switzerland
::Flavor: Wormwood and anise
::Appearance: Green

Absinthe is a high-proof, anise-flavored liquor made by distilling herbs, including anise, fennel and grand wormwood (''Artemisia absinthium'').  It should be noted that absinthe is not a '''liqueur''' but a '''spirit''', as it does not contain sugar. It is included here as it is relates to several anise-flavored liqueurs such as Herbsaint and pastis.  The distillate is either colored with additional herbs--giving it its famous green color, artificially colored, or left clear.  Originally created in Switzerland, it's most known as a popular drink in France. 
 
Absinthe is typically served by slowly adding three to five parts ice-cold water to one part absinthe. This causes the drink to &quot;louche&quot; and turn a cloudy white.  Often a specially designed slotted spoon is placed over the glass and a sugar cube set on top.  The water is poured over the cube, dissolving it and sweetening the drink.

In cocktails and other mixed drinks, owing to its very pronounced anise flavor, absinthe is generally used in much smaller proportions compared to other spirits.  In most cases it is used similarly to a bitters, in dashes or as a rinse.

Absinthe was banned in a number of countries during the early twentieth century because of the supposed danger of poisoning, leading to such symptoms as convulsions, mental deterioration and death.  These effects were attributed initially to wormwood itself, and later believed to be caused by the toxic compound ''thujone'', a constituent of wormwood oil.  The ban was recently lifted in most countries including the US, allowing its production and sale once again, but manufacturers in Europe are required to comply with European Union laws on thujone levels. )&lt;ref&gt;''THUJONE - Separating Myth from Reality'',

Herbsaint was created by Reginald Parker and J.M. Legendre from New Orleans.  While in France during World War I they learned how to make absinthe which was banned not long after the start of the war.  After the repeal of prohibition Legendre used his knowledge to create Herbsaint as an absinthe substitute.  The Sazarac company bought his company in 1948 and kept the recipe the same until the 1970s when the proof was lowered, and artificial coloring was added.

==Pastis==
[[File:Pastis1.jpg|left|40px|]]
{{Wikipedia|Pastis}}
::40-45% ABV (80-90º proof)
::Origin: France
::Flavor: Anise
::Appearance: Yellow

'''Pastis''' is an anise-flavored liqueur and apéritif from France, typically containing 40–45% alcohol by volume, although there exist Ethanol|alcohol-free varieties.

When absinthe was banned in France in 1915, the major absinthe producers (then Pernod and Ricard, who have since merged as Pernod Ricard) reformulated their drink without the banned wormwood component, a heavier focus on the aniseed flavor using more star anise, sugar and a lower alcohol content creating pastis, which remains popular in France today.  Pastis has changed considerably since its first creation based on market preference.

Pastis is normally diluted with water before drinking (generally five volumes of water for one volume of pastis). The resulting decrease in alcohol percentage causes some of the constituents to become insoluble, which changes the liqueur's appearance from dark transparent yellow to milky soft yellow. The drink is consumed cold, with ice, and is considered a refreshment for hot days. Ice cubes can be added after the water to avoid crystallization of the anethol in the pastis. However, many pastis drinkers refuse to add ice, preferring to drink the beverage with cool spring water.

Although it is consumed throughout France, especially in the summer, pastis is generally associated with southeastern France, especially with the city of Marseilles, and with the clichés of the Provençal lifestyle, like pétanque.

This page is for treatment of CSF-positive disease.

==Introduction==
Neoplastic meningitis affects 4-15% of pts with solid tumors (carcinomatous meningitis), 5-15% of pts with leukemia or lymphoma, and 1-2% of pts with primary brain tumors. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histology. Breast, lung, and melanoma are the most likely to metastasize to the meninges. Small cell lung cancer also has a high chance of leptomeningeal involvement, but its overall incidence is lower.

Tumor most commonly involves the base of the brain (basilar cisterns) and the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, usually the cauda equina. 

==Signs and symptoms==
CN VI involvement is the most common cranial nerve affected, followed by III and IV. Trigeminal (sensory or motor), cochlear, and optic neuropathy are also common. Spinal symptoms include weakness, dermatomal pain or sensory loss.  Nuchal rigidity is rare.

==Diagnosis==
CSF examination is the most useful. Positive findings are: increased opening pressure (&gt;200 mm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), increased leukocytes (&gt;4 per mm^3), elevated protein (&gt;50 mg/dL), or decreased glucose (&lt;60 mg/dL). Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of malignant cells in the CSF.  Yield of finding malignant cells is increased by a 2nd lumbar puncture with a yield of &gt;80% (up to 45% are negative on initial exam).

MRI with contrast of the brain and spine.  Radionuclide studies to evaluate CSF flow.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis for all pts is extremely poor, with a median survival on the order of 4 months.

==Treatment==
Treatment may be intrathecal chemotherapy (through lumbar puncture or intraventricular, such as by Ommaya reservoir), radiotherapy, or systemic chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is indicated for bulky disease (chemotherapy only penetrates to 3mm depth of tumor nodules) and CSF flow abnormalities. Radiotherapy also indicated for palliation of symptoms, such as cauda equina syndrome or cranial nerve abnormalities.

Intra-CSF chemotherapy: methotrexate, cytarabine, and thiotepa. Sustained-release liposomal form of cytarabine (DepoCyt) results in cytotoxic levels in CSF for &gt; 10 days. Usually given 2-3x/week for induction, then weekly x 4 weeks (consolidation), then once a month (maintenance).

Systemic chemotherapy can penetrate into the CSF in areas of leptomeningeal metastasis where the blood-brain barrier is disrupted and will therefore reach a therapeutic level throughout the CSF, not just locally.  Also, high-dose systemic MTX or ara-C can penetrate adequately into the CSF.

'''''Radiation therapy:'''''
&lt;br&gt;30 Gy in 10 fractions recommended to symptomatic and bulky disease. 

'''''Guidelines:'''''
&lt;br&gt;Since prognosis is poor and systemic progression of disease is common, aggressive CNS treatment should not be offered for many patients.  However, breast cancer patients often have extended survival and should be offered aggressive treatment.

==Radiation technique==
'''''Helmet field:'''''
Technique: place isocenter 2 cm posterior to lens marker. This allows for quasi half-beam technique to reduce divergence to the lens. Inferior field edge at bottom of C2. 5 mm margin at cribriform plate and temporal lobe.

== 1. Define the following terms:==
;Endangered: A species which is at risk of becoming extinct because it is either few in numbers, or threatened by changing environmental or predation parameters.

;Extinct: A species that has died out completely.  When the last specimen dies, that creature is said to have become extinct.

;Habitat: A specific place or the natural conditions in which a given species lives.

;Biome: Any major regional biological community such as that of forest or desert.

;Food chain: A  food chain describes a single pathway that energy and nutrients may follow in an ecosystem.  They usually start with a primary producer and end with a top predator. Here is an example of a food chain:

::phytoplankton → copepod → fish → squid → seal → Orca

:This &quot;chain&quot; can be described as follows: Killer whales (Orca) feed upon seals, that feed upon squid, that eat small fish, that feed on copepods, that feed on microscopic algae. 

;Poacher: A person who illegally hunts an animal in order to kill it.

==2. Write Genesis 1:28 in your own words.==
Genesis 1:28 is presented below in several translations.  It might help to have your group read several versions of the text before they attempt to put the verse in their own words.

;NIV: God blessed them and said to them, &quot;Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.&quot;

;NKJV: Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”

;CEV: God gave them his blessing and said: &quot;Have a lot of children! Fill the earth with people and bring it under your control. Rule over the fish in the ocean, the birds in the sky, and every animal on the earth.&quot; 

;NASB: God blessed them; and God said to them, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.&quot;

==3. List four factors that have caused animals to become endangered.==
===Habitat loss===
The most common threat to endangered animals is the destruction of their natural habitat.  Deforestation one way that habitat is destroyed.  Rain forests are cut down for many reasons, including the sale of lumber, clearing for agriculture, or gathering wood for fuel.  Human encroachment into wild areas for development of agriculture, industry, and housing is another common cause for species endangerment.  Building dams can prevent many species of fish from swimming upstream to spawn, and this disrupts their lifecycle.  The construction of pipelines has a similar effect on land animals, preventing predators from accessing areas containing their prey, or isolating animals from other members of their species, thus reducing the amount of genetic material available to the population as a whole.

===Invasive species===
[[File:Snake browntree.jpg|thumb|Brown Tree Snake]]
An invasive species is a non-indigenous species (e.g. plants or animals) that adversely effect the habitats they invade.  They can endanger indigenous populations by preying on them or by out-competing them for resources such as food.

A good example is the Brown Tree Snake of Australia.  The Brown tree snake was a stowaway on U.S. military transport at the end of World War II. The slightly venomous, but rather harmless, snake came north to Guam and killed almost the entire native bird population on the previously snake‐free island. This snake has few predators on the island, although these do include pigs and monitor lizards; nowadays, Guam is one of the areas with the highest snake density in the world (an estimated 2,000 snakes/km²). Even so, this nocturnal tree snake is rarely seen by residents. They curl up and hide during the day, and move about on trees and fences at night.

At least eight Brown tree snakes have been found in the Hawaiian islands since 1981. Because they can cause the same amount of harm to Hawaii as they have done to Guam, the State of Hawaii makes concerted efforts to inform the public about the snakes, particularly at Honolulu International Airport.

===Poaching===
[[File:Seashell_vendor.jpeg|thumb|right|A seashell vendor in Tanzania sells seashells to tourists.]]

Many animals are endangered because of poaching.  Elephants are killed for their ivory.  Rhinoceroses are killed for their horns.  Bears are killed for their gallbladders.  Tigers and other large cats are killed for their skins.  

The dodo was an animal hunted to extinction by European hunters. It wasn't long after Dutch colonists settled on the island of Mauritius in the 17th century that the hapless dodo was driven extinct.  Since then, dodo researchers haven't had much to work with other than a handful of composite skeletons in museums and anecdotal reports from early mariners.  More has been written about this bird than practically any other, yet researchers practically know nothing about it.

===Pollution===
Pollution can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through contamination or sterilizing them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness. DDT played such a role in killing off bald eagles and other birds by thinning the egg shell walls of affected birds, thus lowering the survivability of offspring. Since this effect was discovered, DDT has been banned in many parts of the world and affected bird populations are recovering.

==5. List four things that are being done to save endangered animals.==
* Endangered Species Act for the USA.
* Environmental Preservation Laws.
* Recovery Plans.
* Control of Invasive Species.
* Breeding programs in zoos
* Reintroduction of species to an area.
* Treaties that ban the trade of products made from endangered species.

==6. List four activities you can do to help wild animals.==
===Raise Awareness===
The more people are aware of the problems faced by endangered animals, the more they are likely to do something about it.  Here are some suggested ways you and your club can help to raise awareness of endangered species:
* Make a &quot;Save the Animal&quot; poster and display it.
* Have a panel discussion Endangered Species vs Development.
* Make a bulletin board display.
* Make an Endangered Species craft project.

===Sustainable Use of Resources ===
One of the more obvious things to do is to refuse to purchase items made from endangered animals, such as ivory.  Even though the trade in these items poses a significant threat, there are more subtle things that we do that has an even greater impact.  We are not often faced with the option of purchasing a tiger skin or an ivory trinket, but we are often tempted to engage in other behaviors which are just as destructive.

Reduce your consumption levels.  Today's rate of consumption of natural resources is unsustainable.  Consumption of goods puts a stress on the environment, as ultimately, that is where all raw materials come from.  Avoid purchasing disposable items, and buy reusable items instead.  

===Boat Inspections===
If you own a boat or a personal watercraft, it is important to inspect it before you tranport it between different waterways.  The zebra muscle is an invasive species that is currently spreading west in the United States and Canada.  These creatures spread by &quot;hitching a ride&quot; on boats that are transported between non-interconnected waterways.  Inspecting your boats and removing all wildlife (plants and animals) from them can help prevent the spread of invasive species.

===Exotic Animals===
Do not buy or keep exotic animals.  The snakehead fish became infamous in the US because of their appearance in a pond in Crofton, Maryland in 2002. They are prohibited in several other countries like Australia because their introduction to new ecosystems may displace indigenous species. Humans have been introducing snakeheads to non-indigenous waters for over 100 years. In parts of Asia and Africa, the snakehead is considered a valuable food fish and is produced in aquacultures. Due to this fact it was introduced either on purpose (fisheries motivation) or by ignorance (as was the case in Crofton).

Sometimes exotic pets escape or are released into the wild when they are no longer wanted.  This can have a negative impact on native species in the area.  It is '''illegal''' to release exotic pets into the wild in most localities.

===Habitat Restoration===
*Hold an Arbor Day tree-planting party.
*Restore a riverbank by replanting native species (under proper and knowledgeable supervision) and picking up litter.
*Plant a garden at your school, church, or home to attract wild birds and butterflies.

===Data Gathering and Monitoring===
*Adopt a stream, wetland, or other waterway.  Monitor which species use the area and try to get an idea of how many individual animals are involved.  Distribute your findings.
*Participate in the Christmas bird count, a birdathon, or in a Feeder Watch.

==7. List ten endangered animals. Tell where they live and why they have become endangered.==
When teaching this honor to a group, you could go to the library ahead of time and check out several books on the various endangered animals, or on endangered animals in general.  You will need enough books so that each Pathfinder can have one (or they could share them in groups of two), and you need to make sure that you have information on at least ten endangered animals.  You could instead bring in a set of encyclopedias.  During class, pass the books around and have each Pathfinder look up the information on the animal featured in that book.  It is important that the Pathfinders do this research themselves rather than having it handed to them.  Below are some well-known endangered mammals (although mammals are not the only type of endangered animals).

==8. Do two of the following activities:==
===a. Visit a zoo or animal preserve that has one or more endangered animals in residence.  List what animal(s) you saw, where they normally live, and why they have become endangered.===
This activity is probably the one that your Pathfinders will enjoy the most.  If you choose to do this one and activity 'b', try to do activity 'b' first, as that will make this one more educational.  

If you choose to do this activity in conjunction with activities 'c' or 'd', do this activity first so that the Pathfinders may use the trip to the zoo to gather materials and information.

===b. Watch a video about an endangered animal. List what animal(s) you saw, where they normally live, and why they have become endangered.===
Below is a list of videos you might be able to use.  These have not been reviewed by the authors of this answer book so you may want to screen them before showing them to your Pathfinders.  If you have seen any of these, please edit this section with a review.

===c. Choose an endangered animal and write or give orally a short report about it.  Tell where it normally lives, why it has become endangered, what is being done to save it, and any other special details about this particular animal that you have learned.===

You may wish to do this activity after doing activity 'a' or 'b', as both of those will allow your Pathfinders to gather information, materials, and inspiration for completing their reports.

===d. Make a scrapbook about endangered animals. This may include newspaper articles, stories, pictures, stamps, or drawings. This may be a group project.===

If you choose this option, be sure to look over the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Scrapbooking|Scrapbooking Honor]] as well, as this activity could be used to meet requirement 9.  This option works best when completed after doing activity 'a'.  Be sure to have your Pathfinders each bring a camera to the zoo and take plenty of pictures.  Remind them that they should restrict the photos in their albums to  ''endangered'' animals. Also, if they are going to complete the Scrapbooking Honor, they will need enough material for 12 pages.

This option can be also completed without a trip to the zoo by using magazine clippings, drawings, or photographs downloaded from the Internet, etc.

===e. Do an environment circle. ===
With a group of 10-20 persons, form a loose circle with people evenly spaced within. Have each person represent something in the environment such as animals, grasslands, forests, etc. Then take a spool of heavy thread or string and connect each person to others in the circle. Have the leader start cutting the connections and start taking individuals out of the circle
and see how the remaining persons are affected by the loss. Help the group to
see that each thing in nature is very necessary to the survival of everything else
in nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ohm.png]]To help people remember Ohm's law of V = IR, have the student draw a triangle. Then put a horizontal line in the triangle. Finally, a vertical line. (I've attached a crappy, tossed together image that someone could do a better one of and put it on the main page.) Write V in the top space, I in the bottom left, and R in the bottom right. From there, just cover up the variable that the equation asks you to find, and the remainder of the triangle shows the formula. Try it. Cover up I and you'll get V/R. It helps my students (who don't have confidence in their algebraic skills) deal with rearranging equations. --[[User:Purpill|Purpill]] 22:46, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

'''Qualified Instructor Required'''
==Prerequisite==
Pathfinders working on this honor must first earn the '''Swimming - Intermediate''' honor.
{{ay prerequisite|Recreation|Swimming - Intermediate}}
==1. Satisfy the examiner that you have knowledge of different types of kayaks (Slalom, river, touring, sea); the uses for each and the equipment necessary for safe kayaking (helmet, life jacket, sprayskirt, bow and stern loops, flotation in kayak).==
=== Kayak Types ===
;Slalom Kayak: These are used in slalom racing.  A slalom race takes place on a whitewater course, and the kayaker must maneuver the kayak between several pairs of poles called &quot;gates&quot;.  Green-colored gates must be entered by paddling downstream, and red-colored gates must be entered by paddling upstream.  The minimum length of a slalom kayak is four meters, and the minimum width is 60 cm.  Slalom kayaks are usually built out of fiberglass or composite materials.  Light weight is a very desirable characteristic in these boats.

;River Kayak: These are used for playing in whitewater, or in &quot;rodeo&quot; competitions where the kayaker is judged according to the types of maneuvers made.  River kayaks are small kayaks, with lengths from 6 to 12 feet (2 to 3 meters).  River kayaks have features to make them easily maneuverable in whitewater, and to resist damage from running into rocks.  

;Touring Kayak: Touring kayaks are designed for use on lazy rivers, lakes, and bays.  They are generally more stable than river kayaks, but not quite as maneuverable.  They have more room for cargo than river kayaks, but not as much room as a sea kayak.  They are often used for fishing, for day trips, and for overnight trips. 

;Sea Kayak:A sea kayak is a kayak developed for paddling on open waters of lakes, bays, and the ocean. Sea kayaks are seaworthy small boats with a covered deck and the ability to incorporate a spraydeck. They trade off the extreme maneuverability of whitewater kayaks for cargo capacity, ease of straight-line paddling, and comfort for long journeys.  Sea kayaks are now used around the world for marine journeys from a few hours to many weeks, as they can accommodate one or two (occasionally three) paddlers together with room for camping gear, food, water, and other supplies. The sport of sea kayaking (sometimes called ocean kayaking) combines much of the appeal of hill-walking with a maritime aspect, few access issues and vast areas to enjoy.

=== Equipment ===
;Helmet: A helmet should be worn any time a kayak is taken into whitewater.  Whitewater is &quot;white&quot; because of rocks, and have the potential to seriously injure a person.  The greatest danger addressed by a helmet is that of striking the head on an underwater obstacle when overturned in fast moving current.  

;Life jacket:  Also called ''Personal Flotation Devices'' or ''PFD's'', these are possibly the most essential of safety gear available to a kayaker.  

;Sprayskirt:  The sprayskirt is a device that prevents water from entering the kayak.  It is worn around the waist and the &quot;hem&quot; of the sprayskirt is stretched around the cockpit of the kayak, making it watertight.  In the event that the kayak is overturned and the paddler cannot execute an eskimo roll, the sprayskirt must be &quot;popped&quot; from the cockpit.  It usually has a strap in the front for this purpose.  Once the sprayskirt has been popped, water will rush into the boat, and the paddler may swim out.  This maneuver is called a &quot;wet exit.&quot;  Without the sprayskirt, an eskimo roll is nearly impossible.

;Bow and stern loops:  These are loops of rope, webbing, or sometimes handles built-in to the ends of the boat.  They allow a person to grab the boat - an option sometimes necessary to either grab a kayak (and thus, the paddler) to pull it from danger, or for a swimmer to hang on to (for those times when they kayaker becomes a swimmer) and be towed to safety.

;Flotation:  Kayaks without flotation sink when filled with water.  Flotation is added to prevent this from happening.  A kayak that floats even when filled with water can be retrieved more easily, but more importantly, it can be used as something to hang onto if capsized.  Flotation also displaces water, so that if the kayak capsizes, it will not completely fill with water - this would make it quite heavy.  A swimmer in whitewater definitely wants to stay away from heavy items freight-training through a rapid, as these can pin a person against a rock or cliff wall, or even cause blunt force trauma.  If the capsized kayak remains afloat and does not become so heavy as to become a dangerous projectile, a paddler may attempt to re-enter it.

==2. Demonstrate an ability to enter and exit a kayak.==
The first step in all of these is to make sure you're wearing a lifejacket.  If you're going to paddle in swift water, put on your sprayskirt and helmet too.
===a. From a beach===
'''Entry:''' Place the kayak in the water where it is {{units|5 to 10 cm|2 to 4 in}} deep.  At this depth, the kayak will sit on the river (or lake, etc.) bottom when you get into it.  You want it to be in deep enough water so that it's easy to shove off, but not so deep that it doesn't sit stable on the floor.  Experiment with the best depth for you, because it will depend on the shape of the boat as well as your own weight and the weight of any cargo in the kayak.  Place the paddle across the front of the kayak and put one foot in the cockpit.  Sit down on the rear of the cockpit and grab the sides of the boat with both hands.  Swing the other leg into the cockpit and work your feet down into the bow.  Lower your bottom into the seat.  If you're using a sprayskirt, hook its hem around the rear portion of the cockpit rim and work it around to the front.  Then hook the front of the hem around the front of the cockpit rim.  Make sure you've got a good seal all the way around.  Finally, scoot the boat into deeper water, grab the paddle, and go.

'''Exit:''' Paddle onto the beach until the kayak stops.  Place your paddle across the front of the cockpit, pop the sprayskirt (if you're using one) and use your arms to lift your bottom out of the boat.  Sit on the rear cockpit rim, lift your knees and extract your legs.  Stand up, grab the kayak, and drag it further on shore.  Once you remove the weight of your body from the kayak, it will likely begin to float again, so if you don't pull it further onto shore, it may very well float away in the current.

===b. From a pier or landing===
'''Entry:'''

Put the kayak in the water alongside the pier and lay the paddle on the pier where you will be able to reach it once you're in the boat.  Sit on the pier and put your feet in the kayak, then turn your body towards the front of the boat and place both hands on the pier right next to one another.  Gently stand in the kayak while dividing your weight between your feet and your hands.  Bend the knees and lower yourself into the kayak while still holding on to the dock.  Work you knees into the cockpit, let go of the dock, and grab the paddle.  If you're using a sprayskirt, attach it to the cockpit.

'''Exit:'''

Paddle alongside the dock, place your paddle on the dock, and pop the sprayskirt.  Reach up to the dock and place your hands on it, using them to balance as you gently stand.  Shift your weight to your hands as you stand, and sit on the dock.

===c. From deep water===
'''Entry:'''

This is by far the most difficult way to enter a kayak, and this method is really only used when recovering from a mistake.  Swim alongside the kayak and pull your body, stomach down, on top of the kayak.  Carefully sit up and grab the gunwhales.  Swing your legs around and insert them into the cockpit.  Bail as much water out as you can before refastening the sprayskirt.

'''Exit:'''
If the kayak overturns while you are in it, do not panic.  Remember that you can hold your breath for several seconds and that you are '''not''' about to drown.  Calmly release the sprayskirt and push the kayak off your legs as if you were taking off a pair of pants.  Swim to the surface.

If you find yourself in a situation where you think you should exit a perfectly good kayak in deep water on purpose, rethink your situation.  You are almost never better off out of the boat.  If you decide that you really do want to exit, release the sprayskirt.  Place your hands on the cockpit rim and lift your bottom out of the boat.  Sit on the rear deck and lift your knees out.  Slip your legs into the water and swim.

Alternatively, you could just roll over and do the &quot;wet exit&quot; as described above, though this will cause the kayak to take on water, making it more difficult to re-enter.

==3. Demonstrate ability to complete the following strokes==
===a. Straight forward and backward paddle===
Grip the paddle tightly with your ''control'' hand (if you are right-handed, this is your right hand).  Your other hand should hold the paddle loosely.  To take a forward stroke, put the blade on the &quot;control&quot; end of the paddle in the water towards the bow.  Pull the control hand towards your hip, push the other hand forward and twist the torso.  The idea is to use the large muscles in the torso to power the stroke, not the arms.  As you take the stroke, press the foot on your control side into the foot pegs and try to point your feet in the direction you want to the kayak to travel (in reality, which ever way your feet point ''is'' the direction you will travel).  Draw the paddle to the stern and lift the blade out of the water.  You are now ready to take a stroke on the other side of the boat.  To do this, cock the wrist of the control hand as if you were accelerating on a motorcycle, and allow the paddle shaft twist in the other hand.  Then plant the forward blade in the water and take another stroke, again, using the torso to power the paddle, and pressing the foot into the foot peg.  To take a backwards stroke, reverse this process (except that pressing on the foot pegs will not really help).

===b. Left and right turn by forward and back paddling===
When you first learn to paddle a kayak, turning is easy - and often unintended.  To make a turn to the left, take a wide stroke on the right (meaning the blade of the paddle will pass though the water at a distance from the boat), and take a close stroke on the left (meaning the blade of the paddle will pass close to the boat's hull).  To turn right, reverse these two strokes.  

For a quicker turn, take a wide forward stroke on one side and a wide backward stroke on the other.  The kayak will turn in the direction of the backward stroke.

===c. Draw (sweep) stroke===
In this stroke, the paddle is planted in the water near the bow with the blade of the paddle parallel to the boat's center line (keel line).  The paddle is then swept 180° in a wide arc to the stern, where it ends up parallel to the center line again.  This is a turning stroke and can be done on either side, forward or reverse.

===d. Support stroke===
The support stroke is more commonly called a ''brace''.  This is done to steady the kayak or to prevent a flip.  

To do a ''low brace'', grip the paddle with both hands and raise the elbows.  You can imagine that you are gripping the handle of a bicycle pump and getting ready to inflate a tire - the hold is roughly the same, except that the hands are farther apart.  Then extend the paddle with the flat portion of the blade lying on the surface of the water and put some weight on it.  If the water is moving, you can actually put all of your weight on the blade.  The idea is to push down on the water, and it will push back on you, allowing you to right yourself.

A ''high brace'' is another support stroke, but executed improperly can lead to injury, usually a torn rotator cuff in the shoulder joint.  To do a high brace on the right, cock the right wrist so that the paddle blade rests flat on the water.  At the same time, bring the back of the left hand towards the forehead, put some weight on the blade and push off.  Do ''not'' raise the left hand higher than the forehead, as this is an excellent way to tear your rotator cuff.  It is better to just stick with the low brace, reserving the high brace for emergencies.

===e. Cross current paddling===
Cross current paddling is also called ''ferrying''.  This is a method of crossing a river (or a portion of a river).  Point the bow of the kayak upstream, but angled slightly so that it points ''slightly'' toward the bank you wish to cross to.  Then paddle forward against the current.  The forward strokes should offset the backward motion caused by the current, but you should achieve motion to the side since the boat is angled.  In swift current, you will have to work the paddle to keep the bow pointed in the right direction.  The river may try to spin you around, and if it succeeds, you will flush downstream rather than ferry across the current.  It's OK if you lose a little ground to the current, but be mindful of river conditions behind you.  The idea is to move to the side.

==4. Explain the steps involved in Eskimo rolling and demonstrate the proper method of doing this.==
Learning the Eskimo roll requires both instruction and practice.  The roll itself is the act of uprighting an overturned kayak by use of the paddle and body motion. Typically by lifting the torso towards the surface, flicking the hips to right the kayak halfway up and applying a righting force by means of the paddle while tucking close to the front or back deck.

Several styles of Eskimo roll are in use including the &quot;C-to-C&quot;, Sweep, Screw, and Extended Paddle (Pawlata). The roll styles in use vary both regionally and by type of kayak. In the USA, the C-to-C has traditionally been taught in the eastern half of the country while either the older screw or more modern sweep roll have been used in the western half.

The type of roll you should learn is the one that your instructor wants to teach you.  It is nearly impossible to learn how to roll without an instructor, and there are few people who know more than a few types of rolls.

There are many kayaking clubs all over the USA and Canada, and they frequently run &quot;rolling clinics&quot; in indoor swimming pools during the winter months.  Fees are usually low to cover the use of the pool, and club members often provide instruction for free.  

The following web sites have lists of paddling clubs that may be able to help you:

* http://www.americanwhitewater.org/affiliates/ - US listings

==5. Explain how to repair a hole in fiberglass==
===a. Permanently in a workshop (fiberglassing)===
To permanently patch a hole in a kayak using fiberglass you will need the following:
* Fiberglass cloth, enough to cover the hole.
* Epoxy Resin
* Mixing container
* Paint brush
* Squeegee (Can be made from a plastic jug).

First, cut the fiberglass (regular scissors work fine) to an appropriate size to cover the hole.  The patch should extend at least {{units|2.5 cm|one inch}} beyond the edges of the hole.  Cut another piece to cover the opposite side of the hole (you want to patch both the inside and the  outside of the boat).  Set the cloth aside and mix the epoxy.  Do not whip air into the epoxy mixture.  Lay one of the cloth pieces over the hole and apply the epoxy over it with the paint brush.  Use the squeegee to press the epoxy into the weave of the cloth.  Go over the cloth several times, but be careful to not move the cloth off the hole.  Allow the epoxy to set, and repeat the procedure two more times.  You will need three coats of epoxy to cover the hole.  Once the outside has been patched, turn your attention to the inside, using the same technique.  Finally, sand the patch inside an out, starting with 80 grit paper, proceeding to 100 grit, and ending with 220.  Finish the patch with spar varnish.

===b. Emergency repair on the riverbank (duct tape)===
If possible, pull the boat to shore, dry the affected areas as best you can with whatever dry stuff you can come up with, and expose the hole to the sun so it will dry.  Duct tape does not stick well to a wet hull, and the sun can dry a kayak surprisingly quickly on a hot day.  When the area is dry, apply duct tape over the hole and press it down well - especially around the edges of the tape.  Be sure to apply tape to both sides of the hole, that is, the inside of the boat as well as the outside.  If you only patch the outside, when water slops into the boat, it will find its way to the underside of the outer duct tape, loosen it, and your patch will come undone.

==6. After completing a minimum of 2 training sessions complete either&lt;br&gt;a. An overnight kayak trip &lt;br&gt;b. Two day trips (one including some white water)==
See requirement 4 for links to kayaking clubs.  Many of these offer training in the spring for a small fee.  You can also check with local outfitters for commercial training programs or for information on local clubs.  Clubs and outfitters will also be able to advise you on good rivers for an overnight trip or for a day trip including easy whitewater.

Where ever you decide to go for an overnight trip, you'll need to pack as if you were going on backpacking trip.  Actually, you will be able to pack a little more than on a backpacking trip, because a kayak can hold more gear than a backpack, and you don't have to carry it full time (there may be portages though, so don't pack too much).

For a day trip, you should have everyone bring a sack lunch.  This can be eaten on a calm section of a river or you can stop and eat on the river bank.  You should also leave dry clothes for everyone in a car at the takeout.

==Edward IV (1461-1470, 1471-1483)==
[[Image:Edward4.jpg|thumb|right|Edward IV]]
'''Edward IV''' was born on 28 April 1442 at Rouen in France. He was the eldest son of Richard, Duke of York, a leading claimant to the throne of England. Richard's challenge to the ruling family started the Wars of the Roses. When his father was killed in 1460 whilst pressing his claim to be king against Henry VI at the Battle of Wakefield, Edward inherited his claim.

Edward won the support of Richard Neville, the Earl of Warwick, whose nickname is &quot;The Kingmaker&quot;. Edward then defeated the Lancastrians in a number of battles. While Henry was campaigning in the north, Warwick gained control of London and had Edward declared king in 1461. Edward strengthened his claim with victory at the Battle of Towton in the same year, where the Lancastrian army was virtually wiped out.

===Marriage and children===

Edward was tall, strong, handsome, generous, and popular. Warwick, believing that he could continue to rule through Edward, wanted him to marry into a major European family. Edward, however, secretly married a widow, Elizabeth Woodville. They had ten children together. Under an act of Parliament of 1484, one year after Edward IV's death, all of Edward's children by Elizabeth Woodville were declared illegitimate on the grounds that Edward had been due to marry another woman, Eleanor Talbot, before he entered into marriage with Elizabeth Woodville. This claim was only made after all these parties had died. The act was repealed shortly after Henry VII became king. Edward also had many mistresses and had several illegitimate children.

===A series of conflicts===

Elizabeth's family had little land, which was where real power came from, but Warwick did not like the influence they now had. Warwick allied himself with Edward's younger brother George, Duke of Clarence, and led an army against Edward. The main part of the king's army (without Edward) was defeated at the Battle of Edgecote Moor, and Edward was later captured at Olney. Warwick tried to rule in Edward's name, but the nobles, many of whom owed their position to the king, were not happy. A rebellion forced Warwick to free Edward, who tried to make peace with Warwick and Clarence. This did not work and they rebelled again in 1470, after which Warwick and Clarence were forced to flee to France. There, they allied with Henry VI's wife, Margaret, and Warwick agreed to restore Henry VI to the throne in return for French support. They invaded in 1470. This time, Edward was forced to flee after Warwick's brother switched to the Lancastrian side, making Edward's military position too weak, and Henry VI was king once more.

Edward fled to Burgundy. The rulers of Burgundy were his brother-in-law Charles, Duke of Burgundy, and his sister Margaret of Burgundy. After France declared war on Burgundy, Charles helped Edward to raise an army to win back his kingdom. When he returned to England with a small force he avoided capture by saying that he only wished to reclaim his dukedom. This is similar to the claim Henry Bolingbroke made seventy years before. The city of York, however, closed its gates to him, but as he marched southwards he began to gather support, and Clarence reunited with him. Edward defeated Warwick at the Battle of Barnet. With Warwick dead, he ended the remaining Lancastrian resistance at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.  The Lancastrian heir, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, was killed either on the battlefield or shortly afterwards. A few days later, on the night that Edward re-entered London, Henry VI, who held prisoner, was murdered to make sure there was no remaining Lancastrian opposition.

Edward did not face any further rebellions after his restoration. The only rival left was Henry Tudor, who was living in exile. Edward declared war on France in 1475, which ended with the Treaty of Picquigny, under which he was immediately paid 75,000 crowns, and then received a yearly pension of 50,000 crowns. Edward backed an attempt by Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany, brother of the Scottish king, James III, to take the throne in 1482. Although Edinburgh and James III were both captured, the Duke of Albany went back on his agreements with Edward, and the English forces were pulled back. England did, however, recover the border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed.

===Death===

Edward fell ill at Easter 1483, and made some changes to his will, the most important being his naming of his brother, the Duke of Gloucester, as Protector after his death. He died on 9 April 1483 and is buried in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. He was succeeded by his twelve-year-old son, Edward. Edward IV's daughter, Elizabeth of York, later became King Henry VII's queen.

===Was Edward illegitimate?===

There have been many rumours that Edward IV was himself illegitimate, in which case he should never have been king. In his time, it was noted that Edward IV did not look much like his father. Before he became king in 1483, Richard III himself declared that Edward was illegitimate, and parliament even considered the matter. William Shakespeare, in his play, ''Richard III'', which was written over a hundred years later, also referred to the claim. To this day it is not known whether these rumours were true.

==Edward V (1483)==
[[Image:DelarocheKingEdward.jpg|right|thumb|150px|King Edward V and the Duke of York in the Tower of London]]
'''Edward V''' was born in sanctuary within Westminster Abbey on 4 November 1470, while his mother was taking refuge from the Lancastrians who were then in charge of the kingdom while his father, the Yorkist King Edward IV of England, was out of power. After his father returned to the throne, he was made Prince of Wales in June 1471 and appeared with his parents on state occasions. Edward IV had set up a Council of Wales and the Marches, and sent his son to Ludlow Castle to be its president. The prince was at Ludlow when news came of his father's sudden death. Therefore Edward became king on 9 April 1483, aged only 12.

His father's brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was given the role of Protector to his young nephews, Edward V and Richard, Duke of York. He caught up with Edward on his journey from Ludlow and took the princes to London.  Less than three months later, Richard took the throne himself after parliament declared Edward to be illegitimate.

After the two boys went to the Tower of London, they were never seen in public again.  What happened to them is one of the great mysteries of history, and many books have been written on the subject.  It is believed that they were killed, and the usual suspects are: their uncle, King Richard; Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham; and Henry Tudor, who later defeated Richard and took the throne as Henry VII.  

In 1674 some workmen remodeling the Tower of London dug up a box that had two small human skeletons in it. They threw them on a rubbish heap, but some days or weeks later someone decided they might be the bones of the two princes, so they gathered them up and put some of them in an urn that was buried at Westminster Abbey. In 1933 the bones were taken out and examined and then replaced in the urn.  The experts who examined them could not agree on what age the children would have been when they died or even whether they were boys or girls.

==Richard III (1483-1485)==
[[Image:Richiii.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Richard III]]
'''Richard III''' was born at Fotheringay Castle on 2 October 1452. He was the fourth surviving son of Richard Plantagenet, the 3rd Duke of York, who was a strong claimant to the throne of King Henry VI. He has been portrayed as having a withered arm, limp and a crooked back, but this is most probably an invention from many years later. Richard was King of England from 1483, when he effectively deposed his nephew, Edward V. A rebellion rose against Richard later that year, and he died at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. He is the last English king to die in battle, and he was succeeded by the winner of the battle, Henry Tudor.

===Marriage and children===

Richard spent much of his childhood at Middleham Castle in Wensleydale, under the care of his uncle, Richard Neville, the 16th Earl of Warwick (the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;), as Richard's father died when he was young. Following the Yorkist victory over the Lancastrians at the Battle of Tewkesbury, Richard married the widowed Anne Neville, younger daughter of the now dead 16th Earl of Warwick on 12 July 1472. Anne's first husband had been Edward of Westminster, son of Henry VI. Richard and Anne had one son, Edward Plantagenet, who was born in 1473. He died soon after being made Prince of Wales in 1483. Richard also had a number of illegitimate children.

===Reign of Edward IV===
During the reign of his brother, King Edward IV,  Richard was a loyal and skilful military commander. He was rewarded with large estates in Northern England, and given the title Duke of Gloucester and the position of Governor of the North, becoming the richest and most powerful noble in England. Richard continued to control the north of England until Edward's death. In 1482 Richard recaptured Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Scots, and was noted as being fair and just, making gifts to universities and the Church.

===Death and legacy===

On 22 June 1483, outside St Paul's Cathedral, a statement was read out on behalf of Richard declaring for the first time that he was taking the throne for himself. On 6 July 1483, Richard was crowned at Westminster Abbey. Except for three earls not old enough to be there and a few lesser nobles, the entire peerage attended his coronation. Richard was known as a devout man and an efficient administrator.  However, he was a Yorkist and heirless, and had ruthlessly removed many of his enemies but some, led by Henry Tudor, remained. Richard's enemies united against him and he fought them at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485, where he was killed. Henry Tudor succeeded Richard to become King Henry VII. Richard was buried at Greyfriars Church, Leicester, but his body was lost during the later Dissolution of the Monasteries. There is currently a memorial plaque on the site of the Cathedral where he may have once been buried. Since his death, Richard III has become one of England's most controversial kings. He was portrayed as a bad king by historians of the House of Tudor. He has now largely lost his notoriety, except in relation to the mystery surrounding the two Princes in the Tower.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Meso Compounds==
Meso (''same'', in Latin) compounds are common when dealing with chiral molecules.  Often on tests beginning students will be asked to identify which molecules are chiral and which are not, and a very common &quot;trick&quot; that instructors play is to put at least one meso compound in the list.

The reason students fall for the trick is that one feature of meso compounds is that they have at least one chiral center, and when students see the first chiral center they believe that they have found a chiral molecule.  This is not necessarily the case.  If a compound has ''two'' chiral centers, and if rotating the molecule through one or both centers allows a person to superimpose the two mirror images on top of one another, then you are dealing with a meso compound.

==Definition of Meso==
'''Meso''' is a prefix which, by strict definitions, indicates the presence of a 17th chiral center.  It comes from the Greek for &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;mid&quot;, and refers to the fact that the molecule can rotate about its middle.  A meso molecule is not a diastereomer because rotating either of its chiral centers doesn't change the molecule overall; a meso molecule has an internal plane of reflection, also called a '''plane of symmetry'''.

==Plane of Symmetry==
If, in a drawing of a molecule, you can draw a straight line from any part of the molecule to any other part of the molecule, and if the two halves of the molecule (as separated by the line) are identical, then the molecule is said to have an internal plane of symmetry.  

'''Important note:''' the phrase ''plane of symmetry'' refers to a molecule's three-dimensional structure.  If one uses a wedge-and-dash drawing or other 3-D drawing of a molecule, then be certain that the two halves of the molecule are actually symmetrical in all three dimensions.

Spotting meso compounds and planes of symmetry is often considered difficult at first, and it is also often observed that the task becomes easier with practice.

==Example of a Meso Compound== 
One of the isomers of tartaric acid is a meso compound:

[[Image:DL-tartaric_acid.png]]

If you rotate the molecule 180° you will have the same apparent stereochemistry.  Study this drawing until you can see for yourself that it is true, and if you have a modeling kit to be able to construct this molecule then the symmetry will be very apparent.

==Henry VII (1485-1509)==
[[Image:Henry7England.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Henry VII]]
'''Henry VII''', also known as Henry Tudor, was born at Pembroke Castle on 28 January 1457. He was King of England and Lord of Ireland from 22 August 1485 until his death on 21 April 1509. He was the founder of the House of Tudor. He was the only son of Edmund Tudor, who died two months before Henry was born. He spent much of his early life with his uncle Jasper Tudor.
When Edward IV returned to the throne in 1471, Henry VII was forced to flee to Brittany, where spent most of the next fourteen years. After his second cousin's revolt failed in 1483, Henry VII became the leading Lancastrian contender for the throne of England. With French help, Henry made an unsuccessful attempt to land in England but turned back after coming across Richard III's forces on the Dorset coast. Henry then gained the support of the in-laws of the late Yorkist King Edward IV and landed with a largely French and Scottish force in Pembrokeshire, and marched into England, with his uncle, Jasper Tudor, and the experienced Earl of Oxford. Henry's forces decisively defeated the Yorkists at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485 when several of Richard's key allies, switched sides or deserted the field of battle. Richard III himself died at the battle. This effectively ended the long-running Wars of the Roses, though it wasn't the final battle.

Henry then had to establish his rule. His own claim to the throne was limited, and there were a number of false claimants, or pretenders, to the throne. The main one was Perkin Warbeck, who pretended to be Richard, Duke of York, the younger of the Princes in the Tower. These pretenders were backed by disaffected nobles. Henry, however, succeeded in securing his crown.  He also strengthened his position by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter and heir of King Edward IV.

===Policies as king===

Henry VII restored the fortunes of the Exchequer by introducing efficiently ruthless mechanisms of taxation. He was supported by his chancellor, Archbishop John Morton, whose &quot;Morton's Fork&quot; made sure the nobles paid more taxes. Morton's Fork said of the nobles: one who lives frugally must be saving well, and so can give much money to the King. However, one who spends freely must have lots of extra money, and can afford to give generously to the king. By the time of his death, Henry had amassed a personal fortune of a million and a half pounds.

As well as coming to terms with the French, Henry VII made an alliance with Spain by marrying his son, Arthur Tudor, to Catherine of Aragon. He made an alliance with Scotland by marrying his daughter, Margaret, to King James IV of Scotland. And he made an alliance with the Holy Roman Empire, under the emperor Maximilian I.

Henry is also noted for starting the Court of Star Chamber. This revived an earlier practice of using a small (and trusted) group of the Privy Council as a personal court, able to cut through the red tape in the legal system and act swiftly. Serious disputes involving the use of personal power, or threats to royal authority, were dealt with by the Court.

===Later years===

In 1502, Henry's heir, Arthur, died. Henry's wife died in childbirth a few months later. Henry asked the Pope for permission to marry his second son, also called Henry to Catherine of Aragon to help him keep his alliance with Spain. The Pope agreed, but Henry changed his mind, and the marriage did not happen in Henry VII's lifetime. Although Henry VII himself made half-hearted plans to re-marry and get more heirs, this never came to anything. On his death in 1509, he was succeeded by his second, more famous son, Henry VIII. King Henry VII was buried at Westminster Abbey.

==Henry VIII (1509-1547)==
[[Image:Hans Holbein d. J. 049.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Henry VIII]]
Henry VIII was born at the Palace of Placentia at Greenwich on 28 June 1491. Henry VIII was the third child of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. Only three of Henry VII's six siblings, Arthur, Margaret and Mary, survived infancy. In 1493, the young Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. In 1494, he was created Duke of York. He was later appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, though still a child. When his brother Arthur died in 1502, Henry found himself heir-apparent to the throne and soon after, he was created Prince of Wales. When his father died in 1509, Henry became King of England and Lord (later King) of Ireland, positions he held till his death on 28 January 1547.

Henry is famous for marrying six times and for having more power than any other British monarch.  Notable events during his reign include the break with the Roman Catholic Church and the subsequent establishment of the independent Church of England, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and the union of England and Wales. He is known to have been an avid gambler and dice player. During his youth he excelled at sport, especially jousting, hunting and tennis. He was also a good musician, author and poet. Henry was also involved in the construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including Westminster Abbey.

===Early reign===

Henry's father had previously prevented him from marrying Catherine of Aragon. King Ferdinand II of Aragon, however, was eager for the marriage to take place, and Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon about nine weeks after he became king. Queen Catherine's first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage in 1510. She gave birth to a son, Henry, on 1 January 1511, but he only lived until 22 February. She had one more short-lived child and one stillborn one, and then in 1516, Queen Catherine gave birth to a girl, Mary, who was to survive into adulthood, and later become Queen Mary I.

===The King's Great Matter===

Henry VIII's accession was the first peaceful one England had witnessed in many years. But the English people were distrustful of female rulers, and Henry felt that only a male heir could secure the throne. Although Queen Catherine had been pregnant at least seven times (for the last time in 1518), only one child, the Princess Mary, had survived beyond infancy. In 1526, when it became clear that Queen Catherine could have no further children, Henry became determined to divorce Catherine, as he was very infatuated with Anne Boleyn.

Henry's long efforts to end his marriage to Queen Catherine became known as &quot;The King's Great Matter&quot;. Cardinal Wolsey and William Warham quietly began an inquiry into the validity of her marriage to Henry. Queen Catherine, however, testified that her marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales had never been consummated, and that there was therefore no impediment to her subsequent marriage to Henry. The inquiry could proceed no further, and was dropped.

Without informing Cardinal Wolsey, Henry directly appealed to Pope Clement VII, who did not agree to annul the marriage. Further attempts were made to persuade the Pope to consent. Eventually Henry effectively fired Wolsey and replaced other churchmen who were in key government roles with laymen. Power then passed to Sir Thomas More (the new Lord Chancellor), Thomas Cranmer (the Archbishop of Canterbury) and Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex (the Secretary of State). On 25 January 1533, Cranmer participated in the wedding of Henry and Anne Boleyn. In May, Cranmer pronounced Henry's marriage to Catherine void, and shortly afterwards declared the marriage to Anne valid. The Princess Mary was deemed illegitimate, and was replaced as heiress-presumptive by Queen Anne's new daughter, the Princess Elizabeth. (They were each heiress &quot;presumptive&quot; because the birth of a brother—a male heir—would make him the heir to the throne and put his sister in second place.) Catherine lost the title of Queen, becoming the Dowager Princess of Wales; Mary was no longer a Princess, but a mere Lady. Sir Thomas More, who had left office in 1532, accepted that Parliament could make Anne Queen, but refused to acknowledge its religious authority. Instead, he held that the Pope remained the head of the Church. As a result, he was charged with high treason, and beheaded in 1535. Judging him to be a martyr, the Catholic Church later made him a saint.

===Religious upheaval===

The Pope responded to these events by excommunicating Henry in July 1533. Religious upheaval followed. Urged by Thomas Cromwell, Parliament passed several Acts that sealed the breach with Rome in the spring of 1534. Parliament validated the marriage between Henry and Anne with the Act of Succession 1534. Opposition to Henry's religious policies was quickly suppressed. Several dissenting monks were tortured and executed. Cromwell, for whom was created the post of &quot;Vicegerent in Spirituals&quot;, was authorised to visit monasteries. It was claimed this was to make sure that they followed royal instructions, but really it was to assess their wealth. In 1536, an Act of Parliament allowed Henry to seize the possessions of the lesser monasteries (those with annual incomes of £200 or less). 

In 1536, Queen Anne began to lose Henry's favour. After the Princess Elizabeth's birth, Queen Anne had two pregnancies that ended in either miscarriage or stillbirth. Henry VIII, meanwhile, had turned his attentions to another lady of his court, Jane Seymour. Henry had Anne arrested on charges of using witchcraft to trap Henry into marrying her, of having adulterous relationships with five other men, of incest with her brother, of injuring the King and of conspiring to kill him, which amounted to treason. The charges were most likely false. The court trying the case was presided over by Anne's own uncle. In May 1536, the Court condemned Anne and her brother to death, either by burning at the stake or by beheading, whichever the King pleased. The other four men Queen Anne had allegedly been involved with were to be hanged, drawn and quartered. Anne's brother was beheaded soon after the trial ended The four had their sentences reduced to beheading. Anne was also beheaded soon afterwards.

Only days after Anne's execution in 1536, Henry married Jane Seymour. The Act of Succession 1536 declared Henry's children by Queen Jane to be next in the line of succession, and declared both the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them. The King was granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his will. Jane gave birth to a son, Edward, in 1537, and died two weeks later. After Jane's death, the entire court mourned with Henry for some time. Henry also considered her to be his only &quot;true&quot; wife, being the only one who had given him the male heir he so desperately sought.

At about the same time as his marriage to Jane Seymour, Henry granted his assent to the Laws in Wales Act 1535, which legally annexed Wales, uniting England and Wales into one nation. Henry also continued with his persecution of his religious opponents. In 1536, an uprising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace broke out in Northern England. Henry agreed to allow Parliament to address their concerns and he agreed to grant a general pardon to all those involved. He kept neither promise, and a second uprising occurred in 1537. As a result, the leaders of the rebellion were convicted of treason and executed. In 1538, Henry sanctioned the destruction of shrines to Roman Catholic Saints. In 1539, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown.

===Later years===
[[Image:Hans Holbein d. J. 026.jpg|right|thumbnail|Henry was shown the above picture of Anne of Cleves.]]
Henry's only surviving son, Edward, was not a healthy child.  Therefore, Henry wanted to marry again to ensure that a male could succeed him.  Thomas Cromwell suggested Anne of Cleves, the sister of the Protestant Duke of Cleves, who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England. Hans Holbein the Younger was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the King. After seeing Holbein's flattering portrayal, and hearing a complimentary description of Anne from his courtiers, Henry agreed to wed Anne. On Anne's arrival in England, Henry is said to have found her utterly unattractive, calling her a &quot;Flanders Mare&quot;. She was painted totally without any signs of her pockmarked face. Nevertheless, he married her on 6 January 1540. Soon, however, Henry wanted to end the marriage, not only because of his personal feelings but also because of political considerations. The Duke of Cleves had become involved in a dispute with the Holy Roman Emperor, with whom Henry had no desire to quarrel. Queen Anne did not try to stop Henry getting an annulment. She testified that her marriage was never consummated. The marriage was subsequently annulled, slightly more than six months after it began, on the grounds that Anne had previously been contracted to marry another European nobleman. She received the title of &quot;The King's Sister&quot;, and was granted Hever Castle, the former residence of Anne Boleyn's family, eventually outliving both Henry and his last two wives. Thomas Cromwell, though, fell out of favor for his role in arranging the marriage, and was later beheaded.

On 28 July 1540 (the same day Cromwell was executed) Henry married the young Catherine Howard, Anne Boleyn's first cousin. Soon after her marriage, however, Queen Catherine was soon found to have committed adultery against Henry. An Act of Parliament condemned her to death. Catherine's marriage was annulled shortly before her execution, which was on 13 February 1542.  She was only about eighteen years old at the time.

Henry married his last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in 1543. She argued with Henry over religion; she was a Protestant, but Henry remained a Catholic. She helped reconcile Henry with his first two daughters, the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth.  In 1544, an Act of Parliament put them back in the line of succession after Edward, though they were still deemed illegitimate.  The same Act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.

A rhyme to remember the fates of Henry's wives is &quot;divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived&quot;.

===Death and succession===

Later in life, Henry was grossly overweight, with a waist measurement of 54 inches (137 cm), and he possibly suffered from gout. Henry's increased size dated from a jousting accident in 1536. He suffered a thigh wound which not only prevented him from taking exercise, but also gradually became ulcerated and may have indirectly led to his death, which occurred on 28 January 1547 at the Palace of Whitehall. Henry VIII was buried in St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, next to his wife Jane Seymour. He was succeeded as king by his son Edward, but within a little more than a decade after his death, all three of his children sat on the English throne.

==Edward VI (1547-1553)==
[[Image:Edward_VI_of_England_c._1546.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Edward VI]]
Edward VI was born at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich on 12 October 1537. He was the son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. He was King of England and King of Ireland from 28 January 1547 until his death on 6 July 1553. Edward was England's first Protestant ruler. Although his father, Henry VIII, had broken the link between the English church and Rome, it was during Edward's reign that the decisive move was made from Catholicism to a form of Protestantism which came to be known as Anglicanism. 

Edward VI was an extremely sickly child. Edward's physical difficulties did not impede his education; indeed, he was a very bright child, able to speak Latin at the age of seven. He later learned to speak French and Greek.

===Under Somerset===

Henry VIII died on 28 January 1547. His will named sixteen executors, who were to act as a Council of Regency until Edward VI achieved majority at the age of eighteen (although it was agreed by the Council in 1552 that Edward would reach his majority at 16). These executors were to be supplemented by twelve assistants, who would only participate when the others deemed it fit. The executors were all inclined towards religious reformation, whose most prominent opponents, were excluded. Henry VIII also appointed Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, to serve as Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the King's Person during Edward VI's minority. Lord Hertford, who was Edward VI's uncle, was only supposed to act on the advice of the other executors. A few days after Henry VIII's death, Lord Hertford was created Duke of Somerset and appointed to the influential positions of Lord High Treasurer and Earl Marshal.

On 13 March 1547, Edward VI created a new Council of twenty-six members. The Council consisted of all the executors and assistants, except for Somerset and one other. The Duke of Somerset was no longer merely a &quot;first among equals&quot;; instead, he was allowed to act without the consent of the Council, the composition of which he was permitted to change at his whim. The Lord Protector thus became the real ruler of England; Edward VI was demoted to a ceremonial role. Another powerful influence on Edward VI was Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Both Cranmer and the Duke of Somerset began the process of creating a 'Protestant England'. Various Catholic rites were replaced with Protestant ones. The Duke of Somerset, however, did not encourage persecution.

One of the Duke of Somerset's primary aims was to achieve a union between England and Scotland. In late 1547, an English army marched into Scotland and took control of the Lowlands. In 1548, however, Mary, the daughter of the Scottish King James V, married the Dauphin, the heir-apparent to the French Throne, which strengthened the alliance between France and Scotland.

In 1549, there was an uprising by poor peasants. Taking advantage of this internal strife, the French formally declared war on England. The Duke of Somerset became extremely unpopular, and was deposed by John Dudley, Earl of Warwick. Warwick did not make himself Lord Protector, and encouraged Edward VI to declare his majority as soon as he was sixteen. In 1550, Warwick made peace with the peasants and with France, giving up all of England's possessions in Scotland without compensation.

===Under Warwick===

The rise of the Earl of Warwick saw the fall of Catholicism in England. Thomas Cranmer introduced the ''Book of Common Prayer'' for use in all Church services. All official editions of the Bible were accompanied by anti-Catholic annotations. Catholic symbols in churches were desecrated by mobs. Religious dissenters were often persecuted and burnt at the stake. In 1550 and 1551, the most powerful Roman Catholic Bishops, Edmund Bonner (the Bishop of London), Stephen Gardiner (the Bishop of Winchester) and Nicholas Heath (the Bishop of Worcester) included, were deposed. Their places were taken by Protestant reformers such as Nicholas Ridley.

Meanwhile, the Duke of Somerset, who agreed to submit to Lord Warwick, was released from prison and readmitted to the Privy Council. Within a few months, he found himself powerful enough to demand the release of other political and religious prisoners, and he opposed the religious Reformation. Warwick attempted to increase his own prestige. On his advice, Edward created him Duke of Northumberland and gave honours to his numerous supporters. The Duke of Northumberland began a campaign to discredit the Duke of Somerset. The people of London were informed that the Duke of Somerset would destroy their city; Edward was told that the Duke would depose and imprison him and seize his Crown. It was also suggested that the Duke of Somerset had plotted to murder the Duke of Northumberland. In December 1551, the Duke of Somerset was tried for treason on the grounds that he had attempted to imprison a member of the King's Council. The treason charge, however, could not be proven. Instead, Somerset was found guilty of participating in unlawful assemblies, but was still sentenced to death. The Duke of Somerset was subsequently executed in January 1552. On the day after the Duke of Somerset's execution, a new session of Parliament began. It passed the Act of Uniformity 1552, under which a second ''Book of Common Prayer'' was required for church services. Unauthorised worship was punishable by up to life imprisonment.

===Death and the succession===
The fragile health of the King did not improve. During the winter of 1552-53, Edward VI contracted a cold, which was made more serious as it was compounded by other illnesses. Doctors tried to help by administering various medicines, but their efforts left Edward in perpetual agony. By early 1553 Edward was dying, and, having been brought up a Protestant, did not wish to be succeeded by his Roman Catholic half-sister, Mary. 

At the same time, the Duke of Northumberland was eager to retain his own power. He did not believe he could do this through the two closest heirs, Mary and Elizabeth. Under Henry VIII's will, third in the succession was Lady Frances Brandon, the daughter of Henry's younger sister Mary. However, Northumberland feared that the Frances's husband, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, would claim the Crown as his own. He therefore chose to try to rule through the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter, the Lady Jane Grey and Jane was married off to Northumberland's younger son, Guilford Dudley. On 11 June 1553, Northumberland got senior judges to draw up a draft will for Edward. The plan was illegal for many reasons. The judges at first resisted, as it was treason to attempt to vary the laws of succession established in 1544. Edward, however, ensured their co-operation by promising a pardon. 

The first draft of the will excluded Mary, Elizabeth, the Duchess of Suffolk and the Lady Jane from the line of succession on the theory that no woman could rule England. The Crown was to be left to the Lady Jane's heirs-male. This plan, however, was not to Northumberland's liking, and the draft was changed to leave the Crown to Jane ''and'' her heirs-male. Mary and Elizabeth were excluded because they were officially illegitimate; the Duchess of Suffolk agreed to renounce her own claims.

Edward VI died in Greenwich on 6 July 1553, probably of tuberculosis, arsenic poisoning or syphilis. Edward VI was buried in Henry VII Lady Chapel at Westminster Abbey by Thomas Cranmer with Protestant rites on 9 August, while his half-sister Mary, who by then was Queen, had Mass said for his soul in the Tower. 

Edward VI's death was kept secret for a couple of days so that preparations could be made for Jane's accession. High civic authorities privately swore their allegiance to the new Queen, who was not publicly proclaimed until 10 July. But the people were much more supportive to Mary. On 19 July, Mary rode triumphantly into London, and Jane was forced to give up the Crown. Jane's proclamation was revoked as an act done under coercion; her succession was deemed unlawful. The Duke of Northumberland was executed, but the Lady Jane and her father were originally spared. In 1554, when Mary faced Wyatt's Rebellion, the Duke of Suffolk once again attempted to put his daughter on the Throne. For this crime, Jane, her husband and the Duke of Suffolk were executed.



==Mary I (1553-1558)==
[[Image:Mary I of England.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Mary I]]
Mary I (also known as Mary Tudor) was born at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich on 18 February 1516. She was the only surviving child of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. She was Queen of England and Queen of Ireland from 6 July 1553 (or 19 July 1553 if you count Lady Jane Grey as '''Queen Jane of England''') until her death on 17 November 1558. Mary is best remembered for her attempt to return England from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism. To this end, she had almost three hundred religious dissenters executed, giving her the nickname Bloody Mary. Her religious policies were in many cases reversed by her successor and half-sister, Elizabeth I.

===Early life===

Mary became an extremely well-educated child under the direction of her governess. She learned to speak Latin, Spanish, French and Italian. Other studies included Greek, science and music. In July 1520, when four and a half years old, she entertained some visitors with a performance on the virginals (a smaller harpsichord).

Even when she was a young child, Mary' marital future was negotiated by her father. When she was young, she was promised to the Dauphin, the heir to the French throne. After three years, the contract was ended. In 1522, Mary was instead contracted to her first cousin, the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. Within a few years, however, the engagement was broken off. In 1526, Mary was sent to Wales to preside over the Council of Wales and the Marches. It was then suggested that the Princess Mary wed, not the Dauphin, but his father Francis I, who was eager for an alliance with England. A marriage treaty was signed; that provided that Mary would marry either Francis or his second son, Henry, Duke of Orléans. Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII's chief advisor, however, managed to secure an alliance without a marriage.

Meanwhile, the marriage of Mary's parents ended with an annulment, which meant their marriage was formally declared void and Mary was deemed illegitimate. She lost the dignity of a Princess, becoming a mere &quot;Lady&quot;. She was expelled from the Royal Court, her servants were dismissed from her service, and she was forced to serve as a lady-in-waiting to her own infant half-sister Elizabeth. She was not permitted to see her mother, or attend her funeral in 1536 after she died from cancer. Her treatment and the hatred Queen Anne had for her was perceived as unjust. All Europe regarded her as the only true heir and daughter of Henry VIII, although she was illegitimate under English law. She only became fully reconciled with her father in the later years of his life.

In 1547, Henry died, to be succeeded by Edward VI. Edward was England's first Protestant monarch. Mary asked to be allowed to worship in private in her own chapel. After she was ordered to stop her practices, she appealed to her cousin, Emperor Charles V. Charles threatened war with England if the Lady Mary's religious liberty were infringed, after which the Protestants at court let her continue her worship.

===Reign===

After seeing off Lady Jane, Mary rode into London as Queen, triumphantly and unchallenged, with her half-sister, Elizabeth, at her side, on 3 August 1553. One of her first actions as monarch was to order the release of the Catholic Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner from imprisonment in the Tower of London, and Mary's first Act of Parliament retroactively validated Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, thereby legitimising the Queen.

Now 37, Mary looked at getting a husband to father an heir to prevent her Protestant half-sister from succeeding to the Throne. She agreed to a suggestion from her first cousin, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, that she marry his only son, the Spanish Prince Philip. The marriage was a purely political alliance for Philip, who strongly disliked her and was extremely unpopular with the English. Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the House of Commons asked Mary to consider marrying an Englishman. Insurrections broke out across the country when she refused. The Duke of Suffolk once again proclaimed that his daughter, the Lady Jane Grey, was Queen. Sir Thomas Wyatt led a force from Kent, and was not defeated until he had arrived at London's gates. After the rebellions were crushed, both the Duke of Suffolk and the Lady Jane Grey were convicted of high treason and executed. Since the rebellion was designed to put her on the throne, the Lady Elizabeth was imprisoned in the Tower of London, but was put under house arrest in Woodstock Palace after two months.

Mary married Philip on 25 July 1554 at Winchester Cathedral. Under the terms of the marriage treaty, Philip was to be styled &quot;King of England&quot;, all official documents (including Acts of Parliament) were to be dated with both their names and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. Coins were to also show the head of both Mary and Philip. Philip's powers, however, were extremely limited, and he and Mary were not true joint Sovereigns. The marriage treaty further provided that England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip's father, the Holy Roman Emperor, in any war. 

Mary fell in love with Philip and, thinking she was pregnant, had thanksgiving services at the diocese of London in November 1554. But Philip found his queen, who was eleven years his senior, to be physically unattractive and after only fourteen months left for Spain under a false excuse. Philip released the Lady Elizabeth from house arrest so that he could be viewed favourably by her in case Mary died during childbirth., but Mary wasn't really pregnant and was instead suffering from a phantom pregnancy.

Mary then turned her attention to religious issues, and she tried to reverse the split from the Roman Catholic Church that happened in Henry VIII's reign. Edward's religious laws were abolished by Mary's first Parliament and numerous Protestant leaders were executed. The persecution lasted for three and three-quarter years.

Philip inherited the throne of Spain when his father abdicated. He then returned to England from March to July 1557 to persuade Mary to join with Spain in a war against France in the Italian Wars. English forces fared badly in the conflict, and lost Calais, its last remaining French possession. Mary later lamented that when she lay dead the words &quot;Philip&quot; and &quot;Calais&quot; would be found inscribed on her heart.

===Death===

During her reign, Mary's weak health led her to suffer numerous phantom pregnancies. After such a delusion in 1558, Mary decreed in her will that her husband Philip should be the regent during the minority of her child. No child, however, was born, and Mary died at the age of forty-two of cancer at St. James's Palace on 17 November 1558. She was succeeded by her half-sister, who became Elizabeth I. Mary was interred in Westminster Abbey on 14 December, in a tomb she would eventually share with Queen Elizabeth.

==Elizabeth I (1558-1603)==
[[Image:Elizabeth1England.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Elizabeth I]]
Elizabeth I was born on 7 September 1533. She was Queen of England and Queen of Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death on 24 March 1603. Sometimes referred to as The Virgin Queen (since she never married), Gloriana or Good Queen Bess, Elizabeth I was the fifth and final monarch of the Tudor dynasty. She reigned during a period of great religious turmoil in English history.

Elizabeth's reign is referred to as the Elizabethan era or the Golden Age and was marked by increases in English power and influence worldwide. Playwrights William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson all flourished during this era. Francis Drake became the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe; Francis Bacon laid out his philosophical and political views; English colonisation of North America took place under Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Humphrey Gilbert. Elizabeth was a short-tempered and sometimes indecisive ruler. Like her father Henry VIII, she was a writer and poet. She granted Royal Charters to several famous organisations, including Trinity College, Dublin (1592) and the British East India Company (1600).

===Early life===
Elizabeth was the only surviving child of King Henry VIII by his second wife, Anne Boleyn. She was born in the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich. On her birth, Elizabeth was the heir to the throne. After Boleyn failed to produce a male heir, Henry had her executed. Elizabeth was two years old at that time and was also declared illegitimate and lost the title of princess. Thereafter she was addressed as Lady Elizabeth and lived apart from her father as he married his succession of wives. Henry's last wife Catherine Parr helped reconcile the King with Elizabeth, and she, along with her half-sister, Mary, daughter of Catherine of Aragon, was reinstated in the line of succession after Edward.

In terms of personality, Elizabeth was far more like her mother than her father: neurotic, glamorous, flirtatious, charismatic and religiously tolerant. However, from her father she did inherit his red hair. 

Henry VIII died in 1547 and was succeeded by Edward VI. Catherine Parr married Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, Edward VI's uncle, and took Elizabeth into her household. There, Elizabeth continued her education. She came to speak or read six languages: her native English, as well as French, Italian, Spanish, Greek and Latin. Under the influence of Catherine Parr and others, Elizabeth was raised a Protestant.

===Early reign===

In November 1558, on Mary I's death, Elizabeth ascended the throne. She was far more popular than her sister, and it is said that upon Mary's death, the people rejoiced in the streets. One of the most important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was religion. The Act of Uniformity 1559 required the use of the Protestant ''Book of Common Prayer'' in church services. Communion with the Catholic Church, reinstated under Mary I, was ended by Elizabeth. The Queen assumed the title &quot;Supreme Governor of the Church of England&quot;.

Many bishops were unwilling to conform to the Elizabethan religious policy. These were removed. She also appointed an entirely new Privy Council, removing many Catholic counsellors in the process. Elizabeth also reduced Spanish influence in England.

===Plots and rebellions===

At the end of 1562, Elizabeth had fallen ill with smallpox, but later recovered. In 1563, alarmed by the Queen's near-fatal illness, parliament demanded that she marry or nominate an heir to prevent civil war upon her death. She refused to do either, and in April, she ended the parliament. Parliament did not reconvene until Elizabeth needed its assent to raise taxes in 1566. The House of Commons threatened to withhold funds until the Queen agreed to provide for the succession.

Different lines of succession were considered during Elizabeth's reign. One possible line was that of Margaret Tudor, Henry VIII's elder sister, which led to Mary I, Queen of Scots. The alternative line descended from Henry VIII's younger sister, Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk. The heir in this line was Lady Catherine Grey, Lady Jane Grey's sister. An even more distant possible successor was Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, who could claim descent only from Edward III. Each possible heir had his or her disadvantages: Mary I was a Catholic, Lady Catherine Grey had married without the Queen's consent and the Puritan Lord Huntingdon was unwilling to accept the Crown.

Mary, Queen of Scots, had to suffer her own troubles in Scotland. Elizabeth had suggested that if she married the Protestant Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, then Elizabeth would make Mary her heir. Mary Stuart refused, and in 1565 married the Catholic Lord Darnley. Lord Darnley was murdered in 1567 after the couple had several disputes, and Mary then married the alleged murderer, the Earl of Bothwell. Scottish nobles then rebelled, imprisoned Mary and forced her to abdicate in favour of her infant son, who became King James VI of Scotland.

In 1568, the last viable English heir to the throne, Catherine Grey, died. She had left a son, but he was deemed illegitimate. Her heiress was her sister, the Lady Mary Grey, a hunchbacked dwarf. Elizabeth was once again forced to consider a Scottish successor, from the line of her father's sister, Margaret Tudor. Mary, Queen of Scots, however, was unpopular in Scotland. She later escaped from her prison and fled to England, where she was captured by English forces. Elizabeth was faced with a problem: sending her back to the Scottish nobles was deemed too cruel; sending her to France would put a powerful pawn in the hands of the French king; forcefully restoring her to the Scottish Throne may have been seen as an heroic gesture, but would cause too much conflict with the Scots; and imprisoning her in England would allow her to participate in plots against the Queen. Elizabeth chose the last option: Mary was kept confined for eighteen years.

In 1569 Elizabeth faced a major uprising, known as the Northern Rebellion. Pope Pius V aided the Catholic Rebellion by excommunicating Elizabeth and declaring her deposed in a Papal Bull. Elizabeth then found a new enemy in her brother-in-law, Philip II, King of Spain. After Philip had launched a surprise attack on the English privateers Sir Francis Drake and John Hawkins in 1568, Elizabeth assented to the detention of a Spanish treasure ship in 1569. Philip was already involved in putting down a rebellion in the Netherlands, and could not afford to declare war on England. Philip II participated in some conspiracies to remove Elizabeth. The first of these plots was the Ridolfi Plot of 1571. After the Catholic Ridolfi Plot was discovered (much to Elizabeth's shock) and foiled, Mary lost the little liberty she had remaining. Spain, which had been friendly to England since Philip's marriage to Elizabeth's predecessor, ceased to be.

In 1586, a further scheme against Elizabeth, the Babington Plot, was revealed by Sir Francis Walsingham, who headed the English spy network. Having put the court on full proof of the charge, Mary Stuart was convicted of complicity in the plot on foot of disputed evidence and executed at Fotheringhay Castle on 8 February 1587. In her will, Mary had left Philip her claim to the English Throne, and Philip set out his plans for an invasion of England. In April 1587, Sir Francis Drake burned part of the Spanish fleet at Cádiz, delaying Philip's plans. In July 1588, the Spanish Armada, a grand fleet of 130 ships bearing over 30,000 men, set sail across the English Channel from the Netherlands. Elizabeth encouraged her troops with a notable speech, known as the Speech to the Troops at Tilbury, in which she famously declared, &quot;I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a King, and of a King of England too&quot;. The Spanish attempt was defeated by the English fleet under Charles Howard, 2nd Baron Howard of Effingham, and Sir Francis Drake, aided by bad weather. The Armada was forced to return to Spain, with appalling losses on the north and west coasts of Ireland due to a storm which scattered the fleet and wrecked many of the ships. The victory tremendously increased Elizabeth's popularity.

===Death and succession===

Elizabeth I fell ill in February 1603, suffering from frailty and insomnia. She died on 24 March at Richmond Palace, aged 69. Elizabeth was buried in Westminster Abbey, immediately next to her sister Mary I. King James VI was proclaimed King of England as James I a few hours after Elizabeth's death. James I's proclamation broke precedent because it was issued not by the new Sovereign him or herself, but by a Council of Accession, as James was in Scotland at the time.

If you really want to see this project get developed, we are just two votes short for winning acceptance for the next Wikijunior book on [[Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter/2006-2nd Quarter Vote]], where the vote is going to end in just a couple of weeks.  This would give featured status to this book and make it one of the standard Wikijunior books that is likely to be translated into other languages besides English.

Also, welcome to Wikibooks, and I hope that you enjoy your experience here.  You seem to have some general experience on Wikimedia projects in general, and that involvement is also appreciated here on Wikibooks as well.  Generally I hate the standard welcome templates and try to welcome new users with a more personal greeting rather than trying to use a standard canned welcome message, that just seems too cold.

As for being involved with Wikiversity, that is a wonderful project as well, and it certainly needs some additional work to become something very interesting.  I havn't seen any foreign language courses taught through Wikiversity yet, so I'm especially interested in seeing just what you plan to do in that regard, although Wikibooks does have some interesting foreign language resources, including [[French]], that you might be interested in.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two past tenses in Turkish. One of them is ''görülen geçmiş zaman'' (''seen'' or ''direct'' past tense) and the other one is ''duyulan geçmiş zaman'' (''heard'', ''indirect'' or ''reported'' past tense). Their names may vary according to different sources. But the main point is that the first one is used for events that you have witnesssed, you have seen when the action was taking place, and the other one is used for actions that you haven't witnessed, you have heard from somebody else. ''Görülen'' means ''seen'' and ''duyulan'' means ''heard''.

== Seen Past Tense ==
Seen past tense is used for actions that the subject has witnessed, it is used for actions when the subject have seen the action taking place. For example, let's say you saw a car accident while walking in the street. When you tell people this event, you should use ''seen past tense'', and when people whom you told this event tell this event to another people, they should use ''learnt past tense'' as they didn't witness the action taking place but they heard from you.

== monter en ascenseur? ==

(Sorry I do not speak english very well)

I am a french native and I have never heard &quot;monter en ascenseur&quot;. We say &quot;prendre l'ascenseur&quot; but I don't know if all french people use the sentances &quot;prendre ascenceur&quot;. May be it is regional particularity.

In french: Je suis un francophone (habitant en france) et je n'ai jamais entendu &quot;monter en ascenseur&quot;. On dirai plutôt &quot;prendre l'ascenseur&quot; enfin je pense car c'est peut être un particularisme régional.
Voila si un autre francophone pouvait confirmer ou infirmer.

[[User:Gringoleblanc (french)|Gringoleblanc (french)]] 14:59, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

: I didn't write &quot;monter en ascenseur&quot; in the table, but I went head and checked in a French book. The book says, &quot;Les Briand montent toujours en ascenseur. Ils montent au troisième étage.&quot; But that book has been wrong in other sentences, and &quot;prendre ascenseur&quot; does sound more reasonable. I would also like another French speaker to confirm. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 20:15, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

== Chez moi ==

I am not a native french speaker or I would edit this myself, but, there are a few phrases in the section &quot;Chez moi&quot; that I haven't seen in the French wikibook up to this point (my apologies if I missed them). &quot;Salon&quot; isn't in the table of vocab. Other words/phrases are &quot;allongés,&quot; &quot;La maison est de plein pied et ne comporte pas d'étage,&quot; and &quot;nous y faisons pousser des fleurs&quot;.  It would be helpful if those were explained below the paragraph.


Moi aussi, je crois que c'est &quot;prendre l'ascenseur&quot;
Et en suite, le premier etage c'est toujours le deuxieme aux pays anglophones. Aux pays francophones, le rez-de-chausse
est le premiere etage.

I agree that it's &quot;prendre l'ascensuer&quot; and not &quot;monter en anscenseur&quot;
Plus, the &quot;premier etage&quot; is always the second floor in English-speaking countries. In French-speaking countries, the &quot;rez-de-chausse&quot; is the first floor.

Just to note that &quot;toute&quot; behaves strangely as an adverb here, in that is agrees with petite (the adjective it is modifying) when that is in a feminine form. So this would give &quot;la cuisine est toute petite&quot; in the singular and &quot;les cuisines sont toutes petites&quot;, in the plural, but &quot;le bureau est tout petit&quot; and &quot;les bureaux sonts '''tout petits'''&quot;.

=== Interrogative - Soru ===
This is a bit complicated. Look at the examples, notice that personal endings for 3rd person plural come before the interrogative particle &quot;mı/mi&quot;, while other personal endings come after &quot;mı/mi&quot;. Also &quot;mi&quot; changes according to the vowel harmony although it is written as a seperate word. If 1st personal ending come after mı/mi, -y- consonant should be added to make a connection between two vowels.

{{Turkish/Box||{{turkish/c|Verb stem}} (+ appropriate form of {{tr/suff|me|dash=no}}) + appropriate form of {{turkish/Suffix|ecek|dash=no}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; question particle {{tr/suff|mi|dash=no}} + {{turkish/c|personal ending}} &lt;small&gt;(personal ending comes before the interrogative particle in 3rd person plural)&lt;/small&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two past tenses in Turkish.  The first one is used when you saw the action and is called the &quot;seen&quot; past tense, second one is used when you transfer some information, and called the &quot;heard&quot; past tense.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

''Heard Past Tense'' &lt;br/&gt;
The suffixes -mış,-miş,-muş,-müş and the personal ending are added to the verb stem:

gelmek (to come):&lt;br/&gt;
gel-miş-im &lt;br/&gt; 
gel-miş-sin  &lt;br/&gt;
gel-miş &lt;br/&gt;
gel-miş-iz &lt;br/&gt;
gel-miş-siniz  &lt;br/&gt;
gel-miş-ler &lt;br/&gt;


anlamak (to understand), anlamışım, anlamışsın ,anlamış, anlamışız, anlamışsınız,anlamışlar &lt;br/&gt;
bulmak (to find): bulmuşum , bulmuşsun ,bulmuş, bulmuşuz, etc. &lt;br/&gt;
vermek (to give): vermişim, vermişsin, etc. &lt;br/&gt;
gitmek (to go): gitmişim, gitmişsin, etc. &lt;br/&gt;
göndermek (to send): göndermişim, göndermişsin, etc. &lt;br/&gt;
söz vermek (to promise): söz vermişim, söz vermişsin, etc.


To make a clear distinction between the &quot;seen&quot; and &quot;heard&quot; past tenses, think about this situation:  Suppose that TV reports indicate that a person named Ahmet has died.  On TV, they should say &quot;Ahmet Bey öldü.&quot; (Bey is like Mr. but in Turkish used after names not before surnames.) But if you only heard about it and are telling somebody else, then you should say &quot;Ahmet Bey ölmüş.&quot; because you did not witness the event -- you only saw pictures on TV, or heard reports, but you were not actually there when Ahmet died. 


Gelmişim or gelmişiz may sound a little weird as you could not hear what you did from somebody else because you know what you do if you are conscious. So we use them if we dont remember or dont know what we did and somebody else have told it to you. If you remember what you did after somebody reminds it to you you should use seen past tense. The second usage of '-mişim' or '-mişiz' is if you are talking about something that you are said to have done, but you know that it's not true, you should use heard past tense.


For example: Onu incitmişim (incitmek: to hurt) 


Meaning: (It's said that) I hurt him/her (I know I didn't do that, it's a rumor or somebody told me that I hurt him/her)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Negative Forms of Past Tense'''&lt;br/&gt;
The negative verb stem melts to the -dı (-di,-du,-dü) or -mış(-miş,-muş,-müş) suffix and retains its reduced form -m- of the negative verb suffix (-ma-, -me-, -mı-, -mi-).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      <comment>/* Conditional questions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Don't worry about the length of the lesson this time. Unlike [[../Lesson Two - I am...|last lesson]], this will just be a short, basic grammar lesson teaching you how to form questions in Turkish.

==Question words==
Before we can start asking questions, let's learn some question words:

*'''Ne?''' - What?
*'''Nerede?''' - Where?
**'''Nereden?''' - From where?
**'''Nereye?''' - To where?
*'''Ne zaman?''' - When?
*'''Neden?''' - Why?
*'''Hangi?''' - Which?
*'''Kim?''' - Who?
**'''Kimin?''' - Whose (is it)?
**'''Kime?''' - To whom?
*'''Nasıl?''' - How?
**'''Ne kadar?''' - How much?
**'''Ne kadar zaman kaldı?''' - How long left?

===Incorporation===
Let's try and incorporate these words into sentences.

*'''Senin adın ''ne''?''' - ''What'' is your name?
*'''Kumanda ''nerede''?''' - ''Where's'' the remote?
**'''''Nereden'' geldin?''' - ''Where'' did you come ''from''?
**'''''Nereye'' gidiyorsun?''' - ''Where'' are you going (''to'')?
*'''O evden ''ne zaman'' çıktı?''' - ''When'' did he leave the house?
*'''Sen ''neden'' kurabiyeyi kurabiye kavanozundan çaldın?''' - ''Why'' did you steal the cookie from the cookie jar?
*'''Bugün hangi elbiseyi giyineceğim?''' - ''Which'' dress am I going to wear today?
*'''O ''kim''?''' - ''Who'' is that?
**'''O ''kimin''?''' - ''Whose'' is that?
**'''O hediyeyi ''kime'' gönderiyorsun? - ''Who'' are you sending that present ''to''?
*'''Onu ''nasıl'' göndereceksin?''' - ''How'' are you going to send it?
**'''O ''ne kadar''dı?''' - ''How much'' was it?
**'''Evden çıktığına kadar ''ne kadar zaman kaldı''?''' - ''How long left'' until you leave the house?

Some of these examples are of the perfect (past) tense. We'll touch on those later.

==Conditional questions==
In other words, a question which could be answered either with a positive or a negative response (e.g. '''Did you go shopping yesterday?''').

In Turkish, it's a little different.

Let's use the verb '''gitmek'''-to go as an example for this demonstration.

'''Sen gidiyorsun''' is ''you're going''.

All you do to make it ''are you going?'' is this:

You add a -mı-, a -mi- or a -mu- in between the ''-yor-'' and the suffix (''-yum'', ''-sun'', etc.), depending on the vowel harmony, as so:

'''Sen gidiyor'' mu''sun?''' - Are you going?

However, it's different with some other people. Let's conjugate it fully:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=center
|-
!to go [[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|20px]]
![[Image:Flag of Turkey.svg|20px]] gitmek
|-
|Am I going?
|(Ben) gidiyor '''mu'''yum?
|-
|Are you going?
|(Sen) gidiyor '''mu'''sun?
|-
|Is he/she going?
|(O) gidiyor '''mu'''?
|-
|Are we going?
|(Biz) gidiyor '''mu'''yuz?
|-
|Are you (pl.) going?
|(Siz) gidiyor '''mu'''sunuz?
|-
|Are they going?
|(Onlar) gidiyor '''mu'''?, (Onlar) gidiyorlar '''mı'''?
|}

As you can see, the pattern applies to almost all cases, except for he/she, because it doesn't have a suffix. Therefore, all we do is add a ''mı'', ''mi'' or ''mu'' afterwards, but as a separate word.

Now that we've covered all of this, let's continue on to the next lesson. We'll learn more about questions later on.

      <comment>Rates of reaction are based on Concentration of substance, Pressure, Temperature, Catalyst and Surface area per volume ratio</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Faster reaction rates are achieved by increasing the probability of a successful collision. Particles require a certain level of energy, called '''activation energy''' or '''E&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''' before a successful collision can occur. &lt;p&gt;

Ways to measure rate of reaction:&lt;br&gt;
- measure volume of gas evolved at regular time intervals&lt;br&gt;
- measure rate of decrease in mass of reactant&lt;br&gt;
- measure time taken for a precipitate to appear&lt;p&gt;

Rates of reaction are based on five factors:&lt;p&gt;

1. Concentration of substance&lt;br&gt;
2. Pressure&lt;br&gt;
3. Temperature&lt;br&gt;
4. Catalyst&lt;br&gt;
5. Surface area (per volume ratio)&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;1. Concentration of reactant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Increased concentration of reactants = Increased rate of reaction&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the concentration of reactants increases, the number of '''reactant particles per unit area''' increases. This in turn increases the chances of successful collisions, increasing the rate of reaction.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;2. Pressure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Increased pressure = increased rate of reaction&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''This generally applies for gases only.'''&lt;br&gt;
When there is an increase in pressure, the '''volume containing the same number of particles is decreased''' and this increases the chances of successful collisions. Thus the rate of reaction is increased.
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;3. Temperature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Increased temperature = increased rate of reaction&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The molecules '''gain kinetic energy''' and '''move at a faster speed'''. Increased chances of successful collisions leading to a faster rate of reaction.&lt;br&gt;
More molecules may also '''attain activation energy''' and the number of successful collisions also increases. Thus increased temperature leads to a faster rate of reaction.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;4. Catalyst&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Use of catalyst increases rate of reaction.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt; A catalyst '''lowers the activation energy''' and so '''more particles can attain activation energy''', thus a faster rate of reaction.
&lt;br&gt;''' Only a small amount of catalyst is required.''' Increasing the amount of catalyst used will not increase the rates of reaction beyond a cerain point.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;u&gt;5. Surface area&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;big&gt;Increased surface area = increased rate of reaction&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A larger surface area per volume ratio '''increases the areas of contact''' between reactant particles. This increases the chances of successful collisions. Thus the rate of reaction is increased.&lt;p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Daibutsu of Todaiji 2.jpg|thumb|right|Daibutsu of Tōdai-ji.]] 

Buddhism originated in northern India in the 5th or 6th century BC. It was founded by a prince named Siddhartha Gautama (The Buddha) of a small kingdom that was evidently in what is now Nepal. He deserted his home and family and devoted himself to austerities and meditation in an effort to understand why the world was full of suffering and how one could find happiness in such a place. He eventually succeeded in his own estimation and began to preach his conclusions to others, and a movement came to form around him which continued to expand after his death. In general, one can say that there are two main varieties of Buddhism. The oldest collection of texts is written in a language called Pali. It is rather consistent internally and is believed to represent the actual teachings of the historical Gautama fairly closely.

Simply put, the message is that the cause of suffering is desire. We want things that we cannot have and we suffer. When we do get things that we want, we must worry constantly that they will be taken from us or lost, and we suffer. Above all, we suffer because of the cycle of birth and death. There is one teaching that is called &quot;the eye of truth,&quot; the simple fact that everything that has a beginning also has an end. We are born and it is certain that, if we manage to live long enough, we will grow old and feeble and die and we hate this and suffer. The only cure is to learn not to desire things. If you want nothing then you have everything that you want and you can be happy. The Pali Canon of texts makes no promises that accomplishing this is easy. Success essentially requires that you become what people would view as a saint, and not many are ever going to be capable of that.

Human nature being what it is this answer to the question of how to end suffering was not considered satisfactory by a great many people. The history of Buddhism over the centuries is essentially the history of providing additional paths that are easier to follow. This expanded view of Buddhism is associated with a second and much more highly varied body of texts written in Sanskrit over a period of several centuries after the completion of the Pali Canon.

==The Development of Early Buddhism==
At one time Buddhism was widespread in India and two of the ancient dynasties flirted with making it the state religion. However, the Hindu religion absorbed much of the philosophy of Buddhism and gradually diminished its scope, and then Buddhism in India was essentially destroyed when Islamic invaders swept through the areas where it was well established. 

As a movement, early Buddhism took the form of the body of those who strived to follow the path of Gautama and withdrew from ordinary society to seek understanding, and a body of lay people who understood and respected the message but knew themselves to be insufficiently strong to find happiness this way for themselves. They admired and supported those who were trying. Buddhism developed in a society where people widely believed in reincarnation, so the idea emerged that lay people, by supporting the &quot;sangha&quot;, the monks, would gain merit leading to an improved next incarnation, ultimately, perhaps, being born with the necessary determination to permit finally attaining enlightenment. A major early element of Buddhist literature is &quot;jataka&quot; stories, tales about previous incarnations of Gautama, showing the series of heroic moral actions that gradually qualified him for rebirth as Gautama, able to find enlightenment. A famous example often painted (including in Japan) is the occasion when he spotted a starving tiger and threw himself off a cliff to provide it with food.

If the entire human race were to find the same enlightenment as Gautama then it would quickly cease to exist, for no more children would be born. The original Buddhism was not a cheerful philosophy, and even the happiness of enlightenment might be better called the absence of pain rather than something positive. The later history of Buddhism is mainly made up of people trying to come up with a faster, easier, and perhaps more attractive way to salvation.

The results essentially fall into three categories. There is salvation through magic, there is salvation through faith, and there is salvation through good works. 

Salvation through magic takes such forms as reliance on magical objects, such as a relic of Gautama or some saint, on rituals, on the recitation of magical texts, on pursuing &quot;secret teachings&quot; embedded in complex ways in dense and difficult to read texts or learned directly from a teacher and so on. 

Salvation through faith turns to reliance on gods or god-like figures who can either aid people to to achieve enlightenment or even give it to them, or, more commonly, permit rebirth into a heaven where conditions are better than here and even weaker people can shut out the distractions of life and progress toward enlightenment. Many people are pessimistic enough to pray to gods who can at least help them avoid rebirth in a hell that is worse than here, and many others will settle for gods who can cure their diseases and slip them an occasional winning lottery number.

Salvation through good works is an extension of the idea of gaining merit by supporting monks. It encourages people to simply try to lead moral lives rather than immoral ones and promises that those who succeed will be rewarded upon death and rebirth. It tends to deny the efficacy of ritual and prayer alike. It often finds the donation of significant sums of money to temples to qualify as a highly moral action. In 587 before a life-and-death battle with the rival Mononobe clan, Soga no Imame and his ally Prince Umayado separately vowed to construct Buddhist temples if their side was victorious. Both delivered on their promises. This probably counts as a merging of types, combining the virtuous act of building a temple with the hope of favorable divine intervention.

==The Spread of Buddhism into Japan==
Buddhism became a missionary religion. It was carried from north India into south India, and then beyond to Ceylon and southeast Asia. This wave happened early and it is the Pali Canon and the relatively unreligious (in the usual sense) version of Buddhism that became established there, especially in the modern nations of Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, and Cambodia. There was a second wave that started several centuries later that carried Sanskrit Buddhism into Afghanistan first, and from there across much of central Asia and into China. Buddhism then developed in China for some time, developing new doctrines unknown in India, and was transmitted from there into Korea, Japan and Vietnam. The very latest of the missionaries from India carried a quite distinctive final type of Buddhism that became established in Tibet and Mongolia, passed through China without affecting it much but developed extensively in Japan, and somehow also reached Java. 

Buddhism became particularly firmly established in Japan, more so than it ever did in China, where there were already strong native philosophical and religious systems. There are several important sects that developed in Japan that are unlike forms of Buddhism found elsewhere in the world. Very recently some Japanese Buddhists have also become missionaries, and some Japanese sects have spread widely in the modern world. The most conspicuous are Zen and Nichiren Shoshu.

There is evidence that Buddhism was noticed in China as early as the first century BC, but it only became significant after the fourth century AD collapse of the Chin dynasty and the invasion of north China by numerous groups of central Asian barbarians, some of whom were Mahayana Buddhist. Several dynasties with Turkish ruling families devoted much wealth and energy to the propagation of Buddhism and they enjoyed considerable success. The T'ang dynasty had roots in this Turkish influenced north and in at least the first half of the dynasty Buddhism ranked as the primary religion. However, as in India, the native religion of Taoism and the native philosophy of Confucianism adapted and gradually began to squeeze Buddhism into a more subordinate position. However, even after ferocious persecution by the Communists, Buddhism is far from dead in China today.

Buddhism began to spread into Korea sometime in the 5th century and into Japan in the 6th century. The first (known) presentation of Buddhism to the Japanese rulers was by King Song of Paekche. The traditional date for this is 538. Song was in fact the first ruler of Paekche to seek to adopt Buddhism as the state religion. He informed his Japanese counterparts that Buddhism was a powerful source of magical protection for the state that would ward off calamaties like epidemics and foreign invasions, expressing the magical aspect of Mahayana Buddhism. This was certainly also important to the Chinese rulers who adopted Buddhism.

There can be little doubt that to a large extent the spread of Buddhism in Japan happened because it was Chinese and Japan was in a mode where it was trying desperately to become as Chinese as possible. The situation was not at all unlike a European barbarian ruler converting himself and his people to a very imperfectly understood Christianity in order to establish good relations with the late, Christian, Roman Empire. However, once Buddhism was established in Japan, people began to discover that it was more complicated and interesting than the way it was first presented. There is also the fact that the native religion of Japan did not have a philosophical layer to match Buddhism, nor did it concern itself with the happiness and cosmic fate of the individual. Buddhism had no competition in those areas except in comparatively recent times from Chinese Confucianism.

==The Spread of Buddhism in Japan==
The first active propagators of Buddhism in Japan were Soga no Umako and Prince Umayado (Shotoku Taishi). They built temples and paid for running them and training monks and nuns. It was not until about 50 years later that the first temple was built by an emperor, and it was another two generations after that before the government established two departments of religion, one to supervise Buddhism and the other Shinto. From that point, early in the Nara period, one may fairly say that Buddhism and Shinto jointly functioned as the state religion of Japan. Buddhism was in fact in the superior position from the Nara period into the nineteenth century. However, there was a revival of Shinto starting in the 17th century, and after 1885 Shinto displaced Buddhism as the only religion directly sponsored by the state. That status ended, of course, in 1945, and the two religions are on their own in recent Japan, along with numerous native and imported competitors. Modern Japan has produced an astounding number of &quot;new religions,&quot; some nominally Buddhist in origin, some Shinto in origin, and some just plain new.

At the time that Buddhism was introduced to Japan the Chinese recognized a considerable number of &quot;sects.&quot; This term should not lead to the assumption that these were necessarily popular movements. They were instead more philosophical tendencies or schools that were associated with reverencing certain texts from the Buddhist canon. Many Korean and not a few Chinese monks, and I believe one Cambodian and at least one or two Indian monks, came to Japan and settled there, usually bringing texts, and many Japanese were sent to China or Korea to study and when they returned they usually brought texts. Thus early Japanese accounts sometimes report the &quot;establishment&quot; of the same &quot;sect&quot; on three or four separate occasions, meaning that someone brought in texts and started to give lectures on them. Most of these early sects have disappeared in both countries.

==Nara Period Buddhism==

Probably the most important sect in the early Nara period was Hosso, which still exists in a small way, controlling two of the famous temples of modern Nara, Yakushiji and Kofukuji. It formerly also controlled Horyuji at the site of Shotoku Taishi's palace at Ikaruga and Kiyomizudera in Kyoto, but those two became independent after the Second World War. Hosso is rather typical of the sects of that era in that it was founded in China by a monk who returned from a visit to India with a quantity of texts heretofore unknown in China, which he proceeded to translate into Chinese and expound. It was therefore not truly a popular sect but rather the source of expertise on a collection of Sanskrit texts from India. The principal doctrine associated with the sect is the proposition that the universe which we appear to see about us is an illusion contructed by our minds, which are incapable of perceiving reality as it actually exists. In the light of quantum theory it is difficult to deny that this statement is entirely correct. The importance of Hosso in Japan comes from the fact that it brought to Japan, or trained in Japan, a number of impressive monks who possessed important practical skills in the areas of architecture and engineering. The monk Genbo who aroused the ire of Fujiwara Hirotsugu was the Hosso abbot of Kofukuji. From a devotional point of view Hosso is associated in Japan mainly with the worship of the Bodhisattva Maitreya (Miroku in Japan), &quot;the Buddha of the future&quot; or a messiah figure, who inspired some of the best art of the era (much of which was made in Paekche). The goal of the worshipper was to secure the intervention of Maitreya so that one could be reborn in a heaven where one could wait for the eventual transformation of the universe into a mode where even ordinary people might hope for enlightenment. Hosso eventually faded as a sect, but the sutras which it brought to peoples' attention continued to be studied in many others.

A similar sect of importance was Kegon. This was founded when a Hosso abbot invited a Chinese monk to give lectures on the Avatamsaka Sutra. This monk, known as Shinjo in Japan, then settled at Todaiji. The statue of Dainichi Nyorai which Shomu Tenno had constructed at Todaiji represents Vairocana, the central figure in Kegon. Vairocana stands for the doctrine closely related to those of Hosso that the universe is fundamentally empty and what we think we see is illusory. 

==Tendai and Shingon==

The basic philosophical tendency within Buddhism exemplified by Hosso and Kegon (and associated with the Indian monk Nagarjuna whose name is associated with many Mahayana sutras) is best known in Japan through the two sects that tended to dominate Buddhism during the Heian period, Tendai and Shingon. Both sects were founded by Japanese monks who travelled to China for study early in the 9th century. Tendai was founded by Saicho, postumously given the honorific title of Dengyo Daishi, and Shingon by Kukai, later proclaimed Kobo Daishi. This is as close as Japanese Buddhism comes to identifying saints. Tendai is named after the Chinese T'ien-T'ai. This was a specifically Chinese sect that intended to combine all flavors of Buddhism under one roof and proclaim them all to be different aspects of a single reality, with the Lotus Sutra as the centerpoint. It was the most important sect in T'ang dynasty China. Shingon is in contrast an outgrowth of the same thread of late Indian Buddhism (Mantrayana) that led to the present day Tibetan church, and was obscure in China. 

Saicho founded the monastery on Mount Hiei northeast of Kyoto named Enryakuji which remained one of the most powerful temples in the country until its destruction by Oda Nobunaga in 1571. The temple was rebuilt, much smaller than before, and is a major tourist attraction. Kukai, on the other hand, eventually became the abbott of Todaiji in Nara and later created the mountaintop monastery at Koyasan, south of Nara, yet another major tourist attraction today. He also presided over Toji, one of the main temples in Kyoto.

Unlike Hosso and Kegon, which tended to preach that enlightenment was so difficult that an ordinary person could only hope for a favorable series of rebirths, Tendai and Shingon offer practices within the reach of all that are entended to attain it in one lifetime. It was necessary to become a monk and to practice meditation as well as to participate in various rituals. For this reason it became the fashion in the Heian period for men of a religious turn of mind to become monks late in life after retirement from active participation in secular affairs. 

Shingon is explicitly &quot;esoteric&quot; in that it presents one layer of doctrine to ordinary believers but also possesses an inner, &quot;secret,&quot; doctrine that is only for the initiated. It is not so much that the public doctrine is a lie as that the public doctrine is fitted to what ordinary people are able to understand. Those who spend years studying may become able to comprehend the much more sophisticated secret doctrine. For example, the public is presented statues of a Buddha, Dainichi Nyorai, or Vairocana, for worship, but the esoteric doctrine holds that Vairocana is a symbol representing the entire physical universe. Every item on the complex mandala drawings that are displayed in temples represents some aspect of the universe, but none can be understood without knowing the key to its symbolism. Tendai is also referred to as an esoteric form of Buddhism because it holds that there are five different levels or layers of Buddhist doctrine corresponding to five different levels of comprehension. The very highest level of comprehension enables one to understand the Lotus Sutra. Since Tendai is explicitly eclectic it must inevitably accept the doctrines of Shingon as valid as one aspect of the complex intellectual world of Buddhism. In practice it would seem that most people in Japan who were not monks did not make much of the differences and considered Shingon and Tendai to be essentially the same thing, divided mainly as the result of the fact that Saicho and Kukai did not get along.

Buddhism is in its essence a religion of individual striving for understanding rather than a religion that sees its role as acting out age old ritual and standing as a link between man and his gods. All sects of Buddhism vary considerably from teacher to teacher. Every sutra in the collection of sutras has something different to say, every teacher in the collection of teachers has something different to teach. The idea of heresy is almost unknown in Buddhism. Reality is too difficult for any human to understand perfectly. Every doctrine contains errors because humans make errors. This is without doubt the reason why the spread of Buddhism in Japan did not require the extermination of the native religion as the spread of Christianity has required everywhere it goes. From very early Buddhists were willing to accept the Shinto gods as yet one more way of representing reality. Indeed, all of the forms of Buddhism that were transmitted from abroad to Japan had already cheerfully incorporated numerous Hindu dieties into their iconography. Why would they balk at the gods of Shinto? Shinto did not represent a solid basis for resisting Buddhism because Shinto was not a religion of doctrine and was also not a religion of salvation. It is almost exclusively a religion of ritual and the purpose of the rituals was to appease the powers of nature so that they would leave people alone to work out their fates. In other words, the purpose was much more to avoid calamities than it was to secure benefits.

&lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt;, in two or three places, tells stories that appear to show that early religious observances did not take place in a permanent location but were performed using temporary facilities that were dismantled afterwards. This is supported by Kofun period archaeology that finds sites where feasts were held in the open air using special pottery objects made for the ceremony and then smashed and dumped. There are several points in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; related to the question of where the sun goddess, Amaterasu Omikami, from whom the ruling clan was descended, ought to be worshipped. At first this happened within the palace of the ruler, but Sujin Tenno is stated to have felt that this was too terrifying and that he wanted the observances moved. The priestesses in charge wandered about from one place to another until some three generations later one wound up at Ise, which became the permanent home. However, when the Buddhists arrived and started building spectacular temples, Shinto responded by beginning to build permanent shrines. When the Fujiwara family provided the funds to build the Kofukuji temple in Nara, they also paid for the construction of the Kasuga Shrine, an easy stroll away. It became common to incorporate references to Shinto dieties in Buddhist temples and vice versa. However, differences remained. In the feudal period a Buddhist monk who wished to make a pilgrimage to a Shinto shrine was obligated to cover up his shaved head by wearing a wig. There were shops near popular shrines where people could buy them. This implies that a lot of monks wanted to visit Shinto shrines.

The intellectual freedom that characterizes Buddhism is an adequate explanation for the very large number of sects that have appeared everywhere, not least in Japan. I am not sure of the exact number, but I would venture to guess that there are at least 50 separate and distinct Buddhist sects in Japan. There is very little to prevent a preacher with a new idea from starting a new sect. However, the number of important sects is much smaller, and they can be grouped into families. For Japan before the 20th century, it is the consensus that the important sects are Tendai and Shingon, Amidism, which at first functioned as a part of Tendai in the later Heian period but then emerged as a family of related sects in the medieval period, and Nichiren which was a very peculiarly Japanese development unlike anything elsewhere in the Buddhist world, and Zen, which developed relatively late in China and became very successful among the warrior class of medieval Japan and then again in comparatively recent times.

Both the Tendai sect and the Nichiren sect focus on the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; or &lt;i&gt;Hokkekyo&lt;/i&gt;. This sutra preaches that all men can become Buddhas and ought to aspire to that. The method urged is a combination of good works, featuring charity and tolerance, and coming to understand &quot;the emptiness of all things.&quot; As mentioned above, Tendai specifically also recognizes all other writings in the Buddhist Canon and attempts to structure them into a hierarchy of understanding. Nichiren, which will be described later, differs in rejecting all other writings and accepting the Lotus Sutra only. The eclectic character of Tendai explains why the founders of nearly all significant later sects were educated in Tendai monasteries, where any flavor of Buddhist learning could be explored. Many Tendai temples, particularly Enryakuji, housed numerous teachers who favored different texts and taught different doctrines. Enryakuji was like a university with a dozen different departments. Tendai also explicitly worked to incorporate Shinto into the mix. The historical Buddha, known as Shaka in Japanese (from Sakyamuni) represents that aspect of the truth that can be expressed in simple language understandable by all men. Amida (Amitabha) represents a higher level that is associated, within Tendai, with meditation. Vairocana represents the highest level, not understandable at all by mere men, but only by those that have achieved the level of a Buddha themselves. Tendai recognizes four different categories of &quot;paradise,&quot; which is to say lands very different from our ordinary world into which men might be reincarnated. One can be achieved by ordinary men. The later specifically Amidist sects focus on this one. The second represents the paradise associated with those who achieve personal enlightenment in the manner taught by the Pali Canon. The third is for monks who have attained enlightenment according to the standards of the Sanskrit Canon and Bodhisattvas (who are essentially the same thing). The fourth is the phase of existence occupied by Vairocana and the very few who have attained the same level, who have themselves become Buddha. As a popular religion it was the Amidist element that attracted the most attention and which inspired a large proportion of the religious art. This offered the possibility that a person of limited ability might qualify for rebirth in a paradise rather than be forced to put in another term in this world, definitely not considered as the best of all possible worlds. 

Shingon, as mentioned, may easily be treated as hardly distinguishable from Tendai. However, the leading Tendai abbots were all in or near the capital and became powerful men intimately involved with politics. Enryakuji and other temples acquired their own military forces as the organs of the state withered away. In fact, Enryakuji waged war for many generations against another Tendai temple usually known as Miidera that was located only a few miles away, further down the mountain. Their differences were purely political and economic, not doctrinal. Shingon settled on Koyasan, located far away in the mountains and difficult to get to in early times. Today you can drive up the mountain in a car, but it is still a long journey from the urban centers of the Kinai. The esoteric nature of Shingon led to a situation where a monk could find complicated doctrines to study, but the common man could find things adapted to his understanding, such as magical interventions. There were rituals available for almost any purpose. Later religious reformers attacked this as base superstition, but it appeals to ordinary human nature. Shingon was also conspicuous in exerting its influence to protect Shinto shrines. It is rooted in three sutras that appeared in China late (about 725, it seems) and are very Indian. This follows into Shingon which incorporated many Hindu dieties and Sanskrit writing into its iconography. Kukai supposedly studied Sanskrit himself in China and assisted in developing a modified version of the script which is used in Shingon texts. Like Tibetan Buddhism it tends to emphasize hells which the evil will fall into as much as heavens which the virtuous might aspire to. Most images of hells found in Japanese art are of Shingon origin. 

All Shingon writings fall into the category of the public teaching, by the way. The secret doctrines are taught only orally. This makes them difficult to describe. However, from what I can find out they look quite a lot like Zen teachings. Zen in its pure form teaches that the aspirant is ultimately on his own since nothing significant about how to attain enlightenment or even what enlightenment feels like can be communicated by one person to another. The difference is that the secret doctrine of Shingon does give the monk significant clues which make it easier for him to discover his own path to enlightenment, which is what he must do. Hosso and Kegon taught that most people are utterly incapable of enlightenment no matter how many times they are reincarnated. Shingon and Tendai teach that all contain the essential nature of a Buddha and are capable of releasing it under the right circumstances. Kukai specified 10 different levels of understanding at which people would be found, and taught that improving yourself even one grade was a worthwhile enterprise. He put the teachings of Hosso at grade six, Tendai at grade 8, and Shingon, naturally, at grade 10. Passing through the previous nine stages merely eliminates errors, finally freeing one to understand the truth. It would appear that the final stage is the realization that you are, in fact, Vairocana.

Many Tendai temples survive, but it is no longer of significance as a popular religion. However, Shingon is still very visible with something like 3000 temples. It is often reckoned as being the third largest Buddhist sect and the only survivor from ancient times among the important sects. Buddhist temples in general may display one or more of a bewildering variety of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas and other sacred beings. Shingon temples have more of them than any others, including large numbers of Hindu dieties (most believers are probably unaware of their origin). I can easily locate mentions of Indra, Agni, Ganesha, Yama, Sarasvati, Varuna, Brahma, and Prithvi. Shingon is also closely associated with the numerous figures of the &quot;myo-o&quot; or heavenly kings, of whom Fudo is most frequently celebrated, represented as a fearsome looking persecutor of demons. A great many temples feature Kannon (Chinese Kuan-yin and Sanskrit Avalokitesvara) which today is almost certainly the central figure in popular worship. Indian statues are male, but the Chinese and Japanese ones are female. Kannon is the goddess of sympathy for those who suffer. The Bodhisattva Jizo is also very common. He also is Indian, Kshitigarbha. He also is a merciful diety with a focus on mercy for the dead. In Japan he has come to be especially associated with dead children. 

==Amida==

Amidism in Japan represents the mainstream of Buddhism as a religion of faith. Amitabha is a benevolent diety found only in Mahayana Buddhism outside India, including Tendai and Shingon temples in Japan. It is widely suspected that Amitabha is of Iranian origin and represents a sun god. This association is very clear in Amidist iconography in Japan, where Amida is often represented as the setting sun, shining in the face of the worshipper. Amithabha is linked to a theory of the transfer of merit that is rejected by much of Buddhism. If we view the process of gaining enlightenment as something like the accumulation of frequent flyer miles, then it is easy to see that a being that makes it all the way to Buddha-hood might accumulate far more points than were actually needed. Amitabha is willing to share. In Japan, Hosso, Kegon, Tendai, and Shingon all reject the transfer of merit. If you want to become a Buddha you are going to have to do it all by yourself. Tendai and Shingon, however, reverenced Amida but without allowing transfer of merit. Tendai considered that faith in Amida might give a person the confidence to realize some higher level of truth that he might not otherwise have attained. It was used as an aid to achieving the proper frame of mind for successful meditation. During the course of the Heian period the worship of Amida gradually became more and more important and by the late Heian period had become a major focus, especially among people who were not monks. The idea became widespread that devotion to Amida could lead to rebirth in a paradise known as the Pure Land, Jodo, in Japanese. Under the Tendai umbrella devotion to Amida was based on meditation, not prayer. 

The monk Genshin (942-1017) is usually considered the first who elevated Amidism to the level of a separate teaching and who at least approached the doctrine that the mere prayerful invocation of the name of Amida was sufficient to gain rebirth in the Pure Land. Genshin wrote a popular book and was a noted painter also, but he did not attempt to organize a sect. The first to do this was Ryonin (1072-1132). His sect is called Yuzu Nembutsu and it still exists but has always been small. A much more important pioneer was Honen (1133-1212) who was much impressed by Genshin's book. His goal was the salvation of all through rebirth in Amida's Pure Land through the recitation of the Amidist mantra &quot;namu Amida butsu&quot; referred to as the practice of nembutsu. In Honen's view the recitation of the nembutsu was in fact a magical act that would accomplish the goal even for a sinful man. He began preaching in 1175, and attracted the attention of emperors and aristocrats. He wrote several books and travelled about the country preaching. He did not disparage the older methods of seeking enlightenment or salvation, but said that the world had become so degenerate that it was unlikely that any of them would succeed. The only real hope was rebirth in the Pure Land, where conditions were such that all would be able to pursue enlightenment. The sutra that justifies the nembutsu approach says that 10 repetitions was enough, and Honen acknowledged that one recitation might be enough. However, his followers were encouraged to regard the recitation of the nembutsu as their main work in life, not to be placed second to anything else. I gather that one recitation with the proper mindset would get you in if you happened to die at that moment, but a few moments later your essentially sinful nature might have caused you to lose the focus of true faith and you are back in danger again. You could not recite the nembutsu too many times, and there were often organized sessions in which groups of people worked to achieve some goal of repetition. One million was considered a worthy target. One of the emperors was said to have achieved one million recitations twenty separate times. 

Honen was attacked on the grounds that if a sinful man could be saved merely by saying the nembutsu, why not lead a life of merry crime and  then repent on your deathbed? This was always a sticky point with the sect, but Honen replied that the faith had to be sincere, not a pretense, and that a man who sincerely regretted his sins would not lead a life of crime. Also, he said at times that one who is busy reciting the nembutsu in every spare moment is less likely to get into trouble than most. 

Honen was unusual in that he managed to provoke persecution by the Tendai sect and by the authorities, something almost unheard of in the Buddhist world. In 1204 Enryakuji hosted a conference which petitioned the Tendai chief abbot to condemn Honen's teachings. Honen responded by publishing an open letter in which he ordered his followers to refrain from disparaging other forms of religion and condemned the theory that those who are saved by faith may therefore practice all manner of sins without worry. Fujiwara Kanezane, the regent, was a close ally of Honen and nothing resulted from that petition. However, in the next year monks of Kofukuji (a Shingon temple) managed to get the government to punish some of Honen's disciples for misbehavior. Again Honen replied, and the nature of his replies make it pretty clear that the issue was one of whether or not Honen's teaching opened the way to excusing immorality. In 1207 the retired emperor Go-toba, the effective ruler of Japan at the time, had a falling out with some of Honen's disciples. The direct objects of his ire were executed and Honen was exiled. Fujiwara Kanezane was able to use his influence to gain Honen a relatively comfortable location for his time of exile. Influential men continued to look out for Honen's interests and advantage was taken of a general pardon issued on the occasion of the dedication of a new temple and Honen's exile was relaxed at the end of the year. He could go anywhere he wanted except back to the capital. Finally in 1211 he was allowed to return to Kyoto, but he died only a few months later. He had many disciples and there is a large Jodo sect today which follows Honen's views exactly. 

However, one of his disciples, Shinran (1173-1263), created a sect of his own that was spectacularly successful and became and has remained the largest Buddhist movement in Japan by a considerable margin. This is known as Jodo Shinshu or, one might say, Reformed Jodo. Shinran disposed of complexities and second thoughts and proclaimed a doctrine of salvation by faith alone. All magical power associated with the nembutsu is abolished as are all other paths to salvation. He also dispensed completely with the monastic tradition of Buddhism. He married and had children and Jodo Shinshu priests have been married men from the beginning. A Jodo Shinshu temple or church is the private property of the priest or preacher, who lives off of the offerings of his parishioners, much like a protestant preacher in the United States. 

The biographical traditions about Shinran are confused. He was descended from the aristocracy, was trained as a monk from childhood at Enryakuji, and became a disciple of Honen in 1201. Allegedly, Fujiwara Kanezane discussed with Honen an idea of his that it ought to be possible for a man to serve as a priest and yet lead an ordinary life as a husband and father, and he wished to marry his daughter to such a man. Honen was not shocked by this and recommended Shinran. Shinran took a year to think about, but finally accepted. Shinran and Honen were certainly close and Shinran was exiled in 1207 at the same time as Honen. He was sent north and Honen south. Both were allowed to return to the capital in 1211. Shinran, however, ignored the offer at first and embarked on a long missionary journey in the north among the common people. The particular focus of Shinran's preaching was always with humble people and not with the aristocracy. He is famous for the observation that the fact that a good man can be reborn in the Pure Land means that the chances of a wicked man are even better. The good man is likely to be held back from sincere faith by the consciousness of his own goodness, whereas the wicked man knows that he has only one chance, trust that Amida's vow covers the unworthy as much as the worthy. Shinran spent most of the remainder of his active preaching life in the country and only returned to Kyoto in 1230, conscious of approaching old age. He died shortly before what would have been his ninetieth birthday. 

Jodo Shinshu flourished in Shinran's day but became somewhat confused after his death. A main temple known as Honganji was constructed in Kyoto, but many rural congregations disliked the idea of being ruled from a main temple and went off in their own direction. The sect was radically transformed by the 8th hereditary head of Honganji, known as Rennyo (1415-1499). He was evidently a dynamic preacher and an effective organizer and he transformed the sect into a powerful organization. In the context of the times, when government was collapsing and chaotic civil wars errupted all over the country, the sect almost inevitably was sucked into politics. Rennyo resisted this, but unsuccessfully. In 1465 monks from Enryakuji, angry at the success of Rennyo in winning converts, raided Honganji and burned it down. Rennyo fled into the countryside, where he found a ready welcome among wealthy farmers. In the chaotic conditions of the day such men were heavily armed. In some places they functioned as low-level samurai in feudal regimes, called jizamurai, country samurai who lived in villages with humbler peasants. In other places where the feudal regimes were non-existent or weak, villages often formed leagues led by these rich peasants. Such leagues were able to raise militias for self defense. In several places such leagues took control of large parts of provinces. 

Rennyo won many converts among such men and the local Jodo Shinshu priest often held a position of leadership in the village. Where village leagues and the sphere of Jodo Shinshu converts overlapped Rennyo inevitably found himself involved in feudal politics and warfare. He strenuously resisted this, but it was impossible to avoid. His successors decided to go with the flow and Honganji itself eventually became a major political and military power. After leaving Kyoto in 1465 Rennyo settled at a place called Yoshizaki in Echizen province on the Japan Sea coast where he found numerous followers. Yoshizaki became engulfed in local warfare and Rennyo fled in 1471, eventually ending up back in Kyoto where a new Honganji was constructed. However, Rennyo's followers in the area around Yoshizaki responded differently. They formed a league and very quickly succeeded in taking over the entire province of Kaga, just north of the Yoshizaki site. They were able to hold Kaga for approximately a century, defending themselves successfully against strong feudal regimes in Echizen to their south (the Asakura clan) and Echu and Echigo to the north (the Uesugi clan). They had sufficient surplus power that they were able to send troops to Kyoto to help defend Honganji. One alternate name for Jodo Shinshu in this period was Ikkoshu, meaning the &quot;single minded sect&quot; or, perhaps better, &quot;the single path sect&quot; because the reference is that they taught salvation by faith alone ignoring all other means. The armed leagues of Honganji followers are known as Ikko Ikki, Ikko leagues. Kaga was only the biggest of them. There were many others scattered around central Japan, plus other similar leagues that were not associated with Honganji. One of the most powerful of them was actually run out of a Shingon temple at Negoro. A personal note: my doctoral dissertation is about the Kaga Ikko Ikki and Rennyo and particularly his period at Yoshizaki figures largely in it.

The Honganji in Kyoto was destroyed a second time as the result of the enmity of another new medieval sect, the Nichiren sect, and it moved to Osaka where a great castle was constructed on the site of the current Osaka castle. The osaka Honganji was a major player in the wars of unification that eventually led to the formation of the Tokugawa Bakufu. Honganji was noted as an early and successful adopter of firearms. All of the various types of Ikki were suppressed in the wars that reunified the country and eventually Osaka was left alone. It withstood a long siege and eventually negotiated a surrender. It was allowed to continue as a religious organization only and surrendered all temporal and military power. In 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered that the sect split in two (there were no doctrinal differences, merely two organizations) and move back to Kyoto where two new Honganji temples were built, an eastern one and a western one only a short distance apart. They are still there, a short walk from the Kyoto railway station. After 1868 the government attempted to suppress the eastern Honganji, converting it into a memorial for Shinran, as the temple was built on the site of his tomb. There was resistance and confusion and several new sects were spawned, whereas the western Honganji remained stable. The western Honganji remains the largest Buddhist organization in the number of its followers in Japan by a large margin. It is probable that Honganji attained that status in the lifetime of Rennyo and has held it continuously since. The largest Buddhist organization in the United States, the Buddhist Church of America, is part of the western Honganji.

==Nichiren==

Another very important Japanese sect of the same approximate age as the Jodo sects is that founded by the monk Nichiren (1222-1282). As were Honen and Shinran, Nichiren was trained at Enryakuji as a Tendai monk. Nichiren and his followers through the years are conspicuous for the animosity they bear for all other forms of Buddhism. Nichiren once claimed that anyone who says the nembutsu even once will be condemned to a long term in hell. He constantly demanded that the government suppress all other sects of Buddhism, which annoyed people sufficiently that he was exiled twice and came (by his own account) close to execution once. He believed firmly in the concept of a state religion which all must share. It is almost as if a medieval European pope was accidentally reborn on the wrong side of the world. Even today his followers are among the most aggressive of the worlds religions, putting great effort into missionary activities. 

After 10 years study at Enryakuji Nichiren conceived the idea of reforming Tendai to what he considered to be its pure form in 1253. He proclaimed the absolute authority of the Lotus Sutra &lt;i&gt;Myoho Renge Kyo&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Saddharmapundarika&lt;/i&gt; and put forth his own mantra to combat the nembutsu, &quot;nam myoho renge kyo&quot;. He was so assertive and violent that no monastery would put up with him and he wandered for a time and then set up his own hermitage near Kamakura. He worked mainly as in itinerant outdoor preacher and quickly acquired a reputation. In 1260 he wrote a book expounding his views and presented it to the Hojo Regent, the effective ruler of Japan in those days. The book says that to kill heretics is not murder and demands the extermination of the followers of Honen by the sword. Shinran is not mentioned, perhaps because he was not yet seen as the founder of a distinct sect. In later writings he attacked Zen and Shingon in the same mode. The Hojo regent was shocked by his extremism and members of the religions he attacked destroyed his hermitage. He was quickly arrested and banished to a remote location. However, he was soon released and returned to Kamakura. He refused to compromise, and set out on a series of successful preaching circuits. At the time of the first Mongol invasion he proclaimed that Japan would be destroyed unless it returned to the true religion. Many of his preachings contained violent attacks on named members of the Hojo clan. He was arrested in 1271 and sentenced to banishment. Allegedly his captors decided to execute him instead (a not uncommon eventuality) but he was saved at the last second by divine intervention. He was in fact banished to Sado Island, the Alcatraz of the time, where the worst offenders went (and were not treated well; being sent to Sado was really imprisonment under harsh conditions). 

He was released again after two years. He had friends, and the government offered to let him set up his own sect if he would only behave civilly towards the others. His response was to leave Kamakura and set up a small hermitage on the slopes of Mt Fuji. It was during this time that he established his first two temples, still the joint headquarters of the sect, at Minobu and Ikegami. He died at Ikegami in 1282. He had six chief disciples all of whom were experienced missionaries, and the sect grew steadily. It continued to be aggressive. It was behind the second destruction of the Kyoto Honganji, and in the 1530's fought a war against the Tendai sect (which it lost). It was just as disputatious internally and divided into many major, mutually antagonsistic, sects. One sect was banned by the Tokugawa government in 1614 for the same reason that the Christians were banned: refusal to tolerate the other sects and refusal to permit its members to obey the government's order that as a mere matter of convenience all Japanese had to register at the nearest Honganji temple to save the government the expense of having to conduct a census and keep marriage and death records.

The Nichiren sect is best known today for an entirely modern organization, Nichiren Shoshu Sokagakkai. This is an extremely energetic sect that proseletizes actively all around the world. Nichiren Shoshu, &quot;the true Nichiren sect&quot; was founded by one of Nichiren's disciples in a dispute with others not long after Nichiren's death. It is radically different in that it deposes Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha who is the central figure in the Lotus Sutra, and substitutes Nichiren himself as a savior figure. This sect survived, just barely, down to the end of the Second World War. Two men who had converted to the sect in 1928 formed Sokagakkai, a laymen's association. In typicial Nichiren fashion they got themselves thrown in jail for refusing to pay homage to the Ise Shrine, then required by the military dictatorship. One died in 1944, but the second, after his release, revived the movement and in the new environment after 1945 it (along with many other new movements) enjoyed great, even spectacular success. In 1953 it had 200,000 members and in 1959 4 million members. It is a tightly disciplined authoritarian movement which also formed its own political party. It was famous for a practice called &quot;shaku-buku&quot; which was a form of forced conversion. They would lure an unsuspecting person into a mob of followers who would then attempt to force an acknowledgement of conversion by bullying. I believe that this has been officially renounced. I confess to being rather ignorant of how Sokagakkai has evolved over the last fifty years, my image dates from the 1960's.

==Zen==
[[File:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg|thumb|upright| A woodblock print of Bodhidharma by Yoshitoshi, 1887.]]
The last significant subsection of Japanese Buddhism should be well known to all at least as a name, Zen. It claims descent from a rather mysterious Indian monk who is supposed to have migrated to China named Bodhidharma. He is mysterious because his biography has attracted a vast cloud of clearly mythical material. Many historians think he is imaginary. However, there are thousands of paintings of him. In Japanese he is Daruma, usually presented as a rather scruffy bum, often as a comic figure. It is claimed that Zen was preached in Japan at various times starting in 654, but if this is so it failed to catch on. The real founder in Japan was Eisai (1141-1215), who managed to visit China twice and study there. That was not easy in those days as there was no organized communication between Japan and China. Chinese merchant ships occasionally showed up. Ch'an was all the rage in China at the time and it is no surprise that it attracted his attention. Some claims are made that Eisai also brought back tea. This does not appear to be true, but he made it fashionable and introducted the tea ceremony, always associated with Zen. In China monks often drank tea to help them stay awake for midnight rituals and this eventually acquired ritual elements of its own. Eisai wrote a book about tea, and sought to persuade people that it was better to drink tea than sake. 

Eisai was a close contemporary of Minamoto no Yoritomo and was on good terms with him and his successors. In 1203 the Shogun Yoriie appointed him to the highest ecclesiastical title at the disposal of the Shogun. He was in Kamakura supervising the construction of a new temple when he died at the age of 75. There are several sects of Zen. The one introduced by Eisai is known as Rinzai. The second main sect of Zen is Soto, which was brought to Japan by Dogen (1200-1253), a disciple of Eisai, who also was able to go to China. Another important early figure was a Chinese monk named Doryu who came to Japan in 1247. He served as abbott in various temples. 

Soto is the most numerous branch of Zen and has no subdivisions (Rinzai has at least ten). It is the most conventional of the branches in that it avoids extravagance and stresses the need to follow standards of good conduct and morality. Rinzai tends to emphasize the importance of sudden enlightenment and does not consider what preceded it as of much significance. 

Despite Bodhidharma, it is not clear that there is any connection between Zen and India. There is no known reference to anything like Zen in any Sanskrit source, and when examined in a Chinese context there can be no doubt that it was considerably influenced by philosophical Taoism. Its tendency to reject all scripture and all organized teaching is about as un-Indian as it is possible to be. Zen was immediately attractive to the newly dominant warrior class of 13th century Japan. Its rejection of book learning meant that it could be followed by a busy man with little time for study. Its main requirements on its followers are discipline and determination, virtues that are appreciated by the military. The book by Suzuki Daisetzu &lt;i&gt;Zen and Archery&lt;/i&gt; explains this affinity perfectly. Indeed, I have been trying to use a Zen approach to help my golf swing. Don't think too much; empty your mind and let the body do what it knows how to do.

During the Hojo period there were five great Zen temples, three in Kamakura and two in Kyoto. Early in the Ashikaga period there were ten, five in each place. Zen was considerably more prominent in the Ashikaga period. The influential prelate Soseki (1271-1346) was able to see to it that a Zen monastery and temple was erected in every province of Japan and also to put the sect as a whole on a sound economic footing. Zen is associated with the best in painting, sculpture, and literature in that period. Unlike the Jodo and Nichiren schools Zen was an essentially aristocratic taste throughout this era. Zen never became a popular religion and during the civil wars it fielded no militias of musket firing peasants. 

Zen in many ways seems to follow the Hosso sect idea that the universe is simply too complex for humans to understand. Rational explanations will always fail. If someone is to achieve enlightenment it will have to come in some non-rational intuitive way. The early sects all taught meditation as the way to attempt this and Zen follows that path. It also, however, dispenses with the simplified versions of reality, the Cliff Notes that are supposed to give you a hint as to the right direction that the sutras all offer. That is the one single element that runs throughout Zen. If enlightenment comes it will be a surprise and it is just as likely that a teacher can cause it by hitting you in the head as by saying something. Some Zen teachers have implied that it is all accidental: you might be unexpectedly bitten by a rattlesnake, and you might unexpectedly get enlightened. However, most have taught that you have to work at it despite not knowing exactly what you are working for or how you are supposed to do it.

A Zen temple looks pretty much like any other Japanese Buddhist temple, down to the statues of Buddas and Bodhisattvas (excluding always Amida). Shaka, Kannon, and Jizo are commonly found. Modern Zen has three main divisions, sometimes counted as separate sects. Rinzai and Soto were present at the founding, Obaku was introduced in the 17th century. There is little if any difference in doctrine. Obaku resulted from the arrival of monks from Fujien who were fleeing the Manchu conquest of Ming China. When reading Chinese they use pronunciations influenced by the Fujien dialect. Otherwise it is considered identical to Rinzai. Soto Zen was counted as the second largest denomination in Japan after Honganji in the period before World War II (Shingon was third). Slowly, through the Tokugawa period and into the 20th century it acquired a substantial lay following. The popularity of the tea ceremony is a marker. The lay followers do not expect to attain enlightenment, but they admire the honesty and freedom from popular superstitions. Charles Eliot thought, and this seems reasonable to me, that Zen practioners tend to believe that what they are trying to do is essentially what Gautama accomplished before Buddhism existed, namely to find enlightenment entirely unaided: the hard way. I think it is fair to say that most Zen teachers would say that success is unlikely, but that the attempt makes you a better person. Lay people are taught that it is most important to confess your sins to the Buddhas, meaning yourself, as no confessor is involved, and practice good conduct, meaning generosity, polite speech, benevolence, following the golden rule, and gratitude. The only real doctrine is that all beings &quot;men, animals, plants, and trees&quot; can become Buddhas. Zen acknowleges no sutras or sacred writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
==Adaptation and Anticipation==

&lt;p&gt;In 1937, Wendell Johnson conducted a series of tests of adaptation and anticipation, in which stutterers repeatedly read a passage out loud:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johnson marked the stuttered words in the first reading. In the second reading, of an unmarked copy, the stutterer was asked to read only words on which he did not expect to stutter. This eliminated 98% of stuttering. The 2% of stuttering was on words which were stuttered in the first reading. In most cases, the stutterer afterwards said he knew he would stutter on the word, but failed to follow the instructions not to read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stutterer marked the words in the text on which he expected to stutter. He then read the passage out loud 15 minutes later, and a second time the next day. In both cases stuttering occurred on about 50% of the marked words, and on about 10% of the unmarked words. In 1975, Wingate repeated this experiment but altered the sequence of the words, and found little relationship between anticipated and stuttered words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johnson noted the stuttered words as each stutterer read a passage ten times repeatedly. Most subjects stuttered on the same words in each reading. This showed that developmental stutterers stutter on certain words, and say other words fluently. In contrast, some forms of neurogenic stuttering may have random stuttering on any word. Later researchers tried to make the subjects forget which words they'd stuttered on, by reading other material, or by waiting several weeks between readings. Stutterers continued to stutter on the same words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johnson increased stuttering by having the person read to an audience or by other means. Later, the person read out loud to one person. Stuttering increased on passages with cues associated with the audience reading, such a colored border on the page or a similar subject matter. Johnson theorized that the colored border reminded the person of previous stuttering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johnson blacked out the stuttered words in heavy pencil, and the stutterer skipped those words. For some subjects, this eliminated stuttering, but most subjects then stuttered on new words. These new stuttered words were adjacent to the blacked-out words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johnson had stutterers silently read a passage twice, several weeks apart, and mark words they expected to stutter on. Stutterers marked the same words each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson theorized that stutterers associate a word with past stuttering or failure (a cue). These studies show that certain words are stuttering cues for individual stutterers, just as certain speaking situations can cue an individual to stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1971, Rappaport and Bloodstein{{ref|Bloodstein1995}} repeated Johnson's fifth experiment, but divided subjects into two groups, and added a second test. In the second test, random words had been blacked out. The subjects who did Johnson's test first and then read the random test stuttered on the words adjacent to the blacked-out words. The subjects who read the random test first did not stutter on adjacent words. The stutterers were trained to stutter to a new cue&amp;#151;blacked-out words.&lt;/p&gt;

==Does Distraction Reduce Stuttering?==

&lt;p&gt;According to some speech pathologists, &amp;quot;Distraction methods can be used to eliminate stuttering temporarily&amp;quot;{{ref|Kuehn1994}}. But if distraction worked, stutterers would work a Rubik's cube or play a pocket video game whenever they wanted to talk fluently. Distraction does not reduce stuttering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction from speech-production muscle tension. This is believed to be the origin of secondary symptoms. Tensing non-speech muscles (e.g., eye blinking, foot-stamping) distracts attention from vocal tension. The stutterer may relax his speech muscles momentarily and the word pops out. But he will soon block again, and if he continues to do the secondary behavior it will become habitual. It will also become ineffective. Distraction from vocal tension is ineffective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction from anticipation of stuttering. Wendell Johnson showed that stutterers know which words they will stutter on. If this anticipation could be distracted, maybe the person wouldn't stutter on those words? A 1982 study had stutterers step on and off a 10-inch platform while reading out loud.{{ref|Bloodstein1995}} A 1985 study had stutterers manually track an irregular line on a rotating drum while speaking.{{ref|Bloodstein1995}} Neither distraction was able to reduce stuttering. Another study{{ref|James1981}} had nine adult stutterers take a 10-second &amp;quot;time-out&amp;quot; after disfluencies, while a control group of nine stutterers got random 10-second &amp;quot;time-outs.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Time-outs&amp;quot; after disfluencies reduced stuttering 46%. Random &amp;quot;time-outs&amp;quot; had no effect on stuttering, proving that &amp;quot;time-outs&amp;quot; do not reduce stuttering via &amp;quot;distraction.&amp;quot; These three studies show that distraction from anticipation is ineffective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction from the fear of stuttering. There are many stories of a stutterer being &amp;quot;too scared&amp;quot; to stutter (see the section below &amp;quot;Does Stress Increase Stuttering?&amp;quot;). This is a real and fascinating phenomenon, but has no practical value as a therapy for stuttering. For example, we could train a Rottweiler to attack you whenever you stutter. If you brought the dog with you everywhere you went, this might cure you of stuttering, but it would be a cure worse than the disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing attention to one aspect of speech may reduce attention to other aspects of speech. For example, speaking in a foreign accent requires careful attention to your articulation. Other examples of increased attention may be to relaxed breathing or to speaking slower. These techniques can be effective, but the effectiveness is from increased attention to a fluency-enhancing aspect of speech, not due to distraction or decreased attention to fluency-inhibiting aspects of speech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distraction causes stuttering, when stutterers use therapy techniques. When learning to use a new motor skill, the inhibition of other neuronal linkages is as important as the development of the target neural linkage: &amp;quot;Each motor engram is a pathway of excitation surrounded by a wall of inhibition.&amp;quot;{{ref|Kottke1978}} A golfer must keep her eye on the ball. Tennis pros are infamous for demanding silence from fans. Stutterers often say that they can use therapy skills in a clinical environment, but the distractions of normal conversations make fluent speech difficult.&lt;/li&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Under stress, people's voices change. They tense their speech-production muscles, increasing their vocal pitch. They try to talk faster. They repeat words or phrases. They add interjections, such as &amp;quot;uh.&amp;quot; These are &lt;i&gt;normal dysfluencies&lt;/i&gt;. A study found that under stress, non-stutterers went from 0% to 4% dysfluencies, for the simple task of saying colors. Stutterers went from 1% to 9%.{{ref|Caruso1994a}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;conventional wisdom&amp;quot; is that stutterers are always nervous or stressed out. Many psychological studies have proven that this isn't true. But stress has an important role in stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next fact is so obvious that you've probably never thought about how important it is. All stutterers can talk fluently. In relaxed, low-stress situations we can say any sound or word fluently. If you're a severe stutterer, there might not be many such situations. But there are some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other situations we stutter. How many paraplegics do you know who can walk in some situations, but not other situations? Or people who are blind with certain people, but not with other people? None that I've ever known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about this. Our brains are capable of producing fluent speech. We have all the speech motor programs necessary to produce any speech sound, fluently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have speech motor programs for producing dysfluent sounds. Stutterers have two sets of [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Open- and Closed-Loop Speech Motor Control#Open-Loop Motor Control|open-loop speech motor programs]]. Our brains &lt;i&gt;select&lt;/i&gt; one or the other set of speech motor programs, depending on &lt;i&gt;environmental cues&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#151;where we are or whom we're talking to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is like a person who grew up summers in Massachusetts and winters in Georgia. Such a person would have a set of speech motor programs to speak with a New England accent. And this person would have a set of speech motor programs to speak with a Southern accent. When she's in Massachusetts, hearing people speak with New England accents, her brain automatically selects the New England accent speech motor programs. In Georgia, her brain selects Southern accent speech motor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always have choices for handling stressful situations. Some choices trigger your brain to automatically select dysfluent speech motor programs. Other choices trigger your brain to select fluent speech motor programs. This chapter will teach you to make choices for handling stress that automatically select fluent, relaxed speech. You'll feel relaxed and speak confidently even when non-stutterers are stressed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Are Responses to Stress Psychological?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &amp;quot;conventional wisdom,&amp;quot; stuttering is a psychological disorder because stutterers generally speak fluently in low-stress situations, and stutter in high-stress situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many responses to stress are physical. E.g., &amp;quot;fight or flight&amp;quot; increased heart rate. Stress is considered to be a factor in the development of physical disorders, such as heart disease, and a primary factor in gastrointestinal disorders. Why is stuttering considered to be a psychological disorder, but stomach ulcers are considered to be a physical disorder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter presents how stuttering is a response to stress, and then presents psychological treatments for better handling stress. Although the presented treatments are psychological, I object to referring to responses to stress as psychological responses. You can treat responses to stress physically, such as with medications or using an anti-stuttering device. I've put those treatments into other chapters. Perhaps more than the other factors, responses to stress show that the factors that contribute to stuttering are complex and interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stuttering Reduces Stress&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Systolic blood pressure is an indicator of stress. Stuttering reduced stutterers' blood pressure 10%. In contrast, fluent speech, chewing gum, and sitting quietly each reduced blood pressure about 2%.{{ref|Perkins1973}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're thinking, &amp;quot;No way. Stuttering doesn't relax me. Stuttering doesn't feel like a massage and warm bath.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But think about it. Stutterers are, on average, disfluent on 10% of syllables. We say 90% of syllables fluently. But we don't say one hundred syllables fluently, and then finish a conversation with ten dysfluencies. Stuttering usually occurs on the first sound of the first word, in a stressful situation. I.e., your stress builds up as you anticipate speaking. You stutter, and this releases stress. You then say several syllables fluently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then stutter on another syllable, then say several more syllables fluently. Usually your speech improves over the course of the conversation, and your last few sentences are your most fluent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your blood pressure were monitored in such a conversation, it might look like this (this is speculative, not based on research):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:StutteringReducesStress.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuttering Reducing Stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your stress increases as you anticipate speaking. You block on the first syllable. This reduces your stress, and you speak fluently. Your stress builds up again, and you stutter again. This reduces your stress, and the cycle repeats until you're speaking fluently at the end of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Stuttering Isn't a Good Response to Stress&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering doesn't change the stressful situation. E.g., a highway patrol officer pulls you over for speeding. Stuttering won't make the officer think you weren't speeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering might make the situation worse. E.g., the highway patrol officer mistakes your stuttering for methamphetamine addiction. He handcuffs you and searches your car. This stresses you more, and you stutter more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering and stress are a vicious cycle. Stuttering reduces your stress for a few seconds, but then causes more stress. You get stuck in the cycle, unable to break free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another study measured &lt;i&gt;listeners'&lt;/i&gt; systolic blood pressure. Listening to stuttering made listeners feel stress.{{ref|Schwartz}} The listeners' increased stress may in turn increase the stutterer's stress. Again, stuttering and stress start a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter will show you that you have other choices for handling stress, instead of stuttering. These other choices reduce stress, instead of throwing you into an endless cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Distraction and Placebos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; believe that &amp;quot;Distraction methods can be used to eliminate stuttering temporarily.&amp;quot;{{ref|Kuehn1994}} But if distraction worked, stutterers would work a Rubik's cube or play a pocket video game whenever they wanted to talk fluently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two studies tried to distract stutterers from stuttering. In the first study, stutterers stepped on and off a 10-inch platform while reading out loud. In the second study, stutterers manually tracked an irregular line on a rotating drum while speaking. Neither distraction was able to reduce stuttering.{{ref|Bloodstein1995a}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distraction can cause stuttering. Stutterers often say that they can use therapy skills in a clinical environment, but the distractions of normal conversations make fluent speech difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; wrote, &amp;quot;if a stutterer were to forget that he was a stutterer, he would have no further difficulty with his speech.&amp;quot;{{ref|Bloodstein1996}} Another &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; wrote, &amp;quot;our beliefs about stuttering seem to be one of the main factors in stuttering severity.&amp;quot;{{ref|Neiders1997}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placebos are pills without medications, or, more generally, an inactive, nonspecific medical treatment that alters the beliefs of a patient. A study found that placebos did not reduce stuttering.{{ref|Prins1980}} Another study also found that placebos had no effect on stuttering&amp;#151;but the placebos caused terrible side effects! Reported placebo side effects included constipation, sexual dysfunction, dizziness, sweating, and tremors. The placebo was six times more powerful than the medication in the study, in producing side effects.{{ref|Stager1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises an interesting question. Placebos are effective treatments for almost every disease and symptom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Study after study showed that, for virtually any disease, a substantial portion of symptoms&amp;#151;roughly one-third, by most estimates&amp;#151;would improve when patients were given a placebo treatment with no pharmacological activity.  Patients simply believed that the treatment would help them, and somehow, it did.{{ref|Goleman1993}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#133;for a wide range of afflictions, including pain, high blood pressure, asthma and cough, roughly 30 to 40 percent of patients experience relief after taking a placebo&amp;#133;placebos seem to be most reliably effective for afflictions in which stress directly affects the symptoms&amp;#133;pain, asthma and moderate high blood pressure can become worse when the patient is upset&amp;#133;placebos may work in part by lessening the apprehension associated with the disease [because] the immune system falters under stressful conditions.{{ref|Brown1998}} 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering may be the only disorder that placebos have no effect upon! I.e., stuttering isn't affected by belief, and stutterers can't be &amp;quot;psyched&amp;quot; into fluency.  In contrast, heart disease, asthma, etc. appear to be physical diseases but are actually in large part psychological. Could stuttering&amp;#151;long believed to be psychological&amp;#151;actually have no psychological component?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Good Stress, Bad Stress &lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;We experience many forms of stress. Some forms of stress reduce stuttering. Other forms of stress increase stuttering. Still other forms of stress have no effect on stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Adrenaline and Fluency-Enhancing Stress&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;In World War Two, a severe stutterer regularly spoke fluently for mortar communication during combat.{{ref|Bloodstein1995b}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, a person physically threatened me for several hours. I've never been so fluent in my life! My voice was calm and relaxed as I tried to get the person to calm down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noradrenaline and adrenaline compete with dopamine for the binding sites on D4 receptors, and when bound, act as agonists. At the same time, through feedback inhibition, norepinephrine inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, which in turn inhibits the production of dopamine. Because dopamine in the striatal system increases stuttering (see [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Genes and Neurotransmitters|Genes and Neurotransmitters]], and adrenaline blocks dopamine, &amp;quot;fight or flight&amp;quot; situations that increase adrenaline reduce stuttering. {{ref|Newman1997}}
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stutterers report that when the adrenaline wears off, their stuttering increases.{{ref|Bloodstein1995c}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Physiological Stress&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Physical activities such as running or bicycling elevate heart rate, blood pressure, etc. Dropping a rock on your foot is another form of physiological stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise makes you breath harder, with your diaphragm. If your stuttering involves disordered breathing you may stutter more when exercising. On the other hand, if your speech-language pathologist trained you to speak with diaphragmatic breathing, exercise may improve your fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, physiological stress has no effect on stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Progressive relaxation&lt;/i&gt; trains you to relax all of your muscles, starting with your toes and ending with your facial muscles. Progressive relaxation has minimal effect on stuttering. Relaxation exercises only reduce stuttering when the focus is on relaxation speech production muscles (respiration, vocal folds, and the lips, jaw, and tongue articulators).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cognitive Stress&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Hearing or seeing several things at once, especially if the events contradict each other (&lt;i&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/i&gt;), increases stuttering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I can't stand talking to a person who's watching television. Or a person who's playing guitar, or picks up the phone to make a call while I'm trying to talk to him. I have a cousin who watches TV, plays guitar, and makes telephone calls, all at the same time, when I to talk to him. He thinks he's making efficient use of his time, but he wastes my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listeners should give their full attention to stutterers. Turning away to do something else, even if you say, &amp;quot;I'm still listening,&amp;quot; will increase the individual's stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a listener won't give you his or her full attention, consider whether the conversation matters to you. If not, walk away. Don't consider whether what you're saying is important to the listener. It's obviously not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Time Pressure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time pressure increases stuttering. At the beginning of this chapter I mentioned a study in which subjects were told to say colors.{{ref|Caruso1994b}} At first, &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; was written in red on a computer monitor. The screens came faster and faster, to increase time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, cognitive stress was added. E.g., the word &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; was written in yellow on a computer monitor. The subjects had to say &amp;quot;yellow,&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;red.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results were dramatic. Non-stutterers went from 0% dysfluent words, to 2% disfluencies with time pressure, then to 4% with time pressure and cognitive stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stutterers went from 1% stuttered words, to 3% with time pressure, to 9% with time pressure and cognitive stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling a stutterer to talk faster will have the opposite effect. Instead, tell stutterers to take all the time they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use time pressure to your advantage by limiting what you say. Tell most people to make a five-minute speech and they ramble on for ten minutes, without getting to the point. If you're asked to make a five-minute speech, get to the point in one minute, without the rambling. What you think is one minute will actually take two or three minutes, and then adding in stuttering will make it five minutes. Even when I stuttered severely I had professors compliment my presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Pragmatic Speech&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pragmatic speech is intended to cause another person to do a speciﬁc action. This might be telling a co-worker how to send a fax. Don't say, &amp;quot;Let me do it for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More stressful is asking someone to do something you want, when you're afraid that the person will say no. E.g., asking your boss for a raise, or asking an attractive person out on a date, or telling your housemate to wash the dishes. The listener is relatively powerful, and you're in a position of relative weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce stress, we usually try to make the question look casual. You &amp;quot;just happen&amp;quot; to run into the attractive person at the health club, and you &amp;quot;just happen&amp;quot; to have tickets to a show in your pocket, and you &amp;quot;casually&amp;quot; ask for a date. Or you wait until you've just landed a big sale for the company, and &amp;quot;jokingly&amp;quot; tell your boss that you deserve a raise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then you stutter, belying that this &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; conversation is stressful for you. Your listener recognizes your weak position and, if he or she has an ego problem, enjoys manipulating you. A powerful person with an ego problem manipulating you is a pretty good description of stress.
Instead, use other ways to reduce stress. First, don't make a big effort to set up a &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot;-seeming situation. The more effort you make, the more stress you'll feel that it's &amp;quot;now or never&amp;quot; to get a positive response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, use [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Famous People Who Stutter/British Royals and Commoners#Winston Churchill and Aneurin Bevan, Statesmen|Winston Churchill's strategy]] of preparing your points in advance (&amp;quot;I deserve a raise for three reasons&amp;#133;&amp;quot;), anticipating your listener's objections, and preparing responses to those objections.
Then use slow speech to explain each point. Pause between points. Use the pause to check that your breathing and vocal folds are relaxed. You'll sound confident and in control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, be willing to walk away. Is it the end of the world if your housemate doesn't wash the dishes, or you don't get a date? Visualize what you'll do and how you'll feel if the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Be an Anti-Mirror&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to mirror each others' speech patterns. A person speaks fast to you, so you talk fast. A listener jumps in before you finish your sentences, so you interrupt her sentences. A person gets angry at you, so you raise your voice and get emotional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those speech patterns increase stuttering. Instead, be an anti-mirror. The faster people speak to you, the slower you talk. Instead of interrupting, wait for the other person to finish speaking, then count to three before you start to talk.  If a person expresses anger, make your voice quieter, slower, and less emotional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Embarrassment and Uncertainty&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;We fear embarrassment. E.g., I'm about to call you Josh, when I think, &amp;quot;Wait, his name is Joel.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear is multiplied when we're speaking to more than one person&amp;#151;saying something embarrassing in front of an audience of a thousand people is more embarrassing than in front of one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of feedback increases our fears of embarrassment. I.e., when speaking on television we can't observe the reactions of listeners. You could say something stupid and never know it. You try to remember and analyze the last thing you said while you're saying something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you say something embarrassing, make a joke out of it. E.g., I was waiting for a woman I'd never met. She said she'd arrive at 6pm. At 6:05pm a woman parked in front of my house. I went out and said, &amp;quot;You must be Ariana.&amp;quot; She didn't say anything so I said it again. She responded that she wasn't Ariana. I said, &amp;quot;Oh my God, I'm so embarrassed,&amp;quot; in a humorous way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's always the &amp;quot;at my advanced age I can't remember names.&amp;quot; That's funny whether you're 90 or 19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds obvious, but there's a subtle point in there. Acknowledging embarrassment ends embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Establishing Status&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;We communicate status largely via speech. We feel anxiety when status is ambiguous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., you find a large, muscular hoodlum sitting on your car. Do you speak with firm authority, ordering the hoodlum off your car? Do you choose a friendly, buddy-buddy tone of equality? Do you meekly ask if the hoodlum could let you have your car back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering doesn't necessarily communicate low status. Embarrassment and anxiety about stuttering communicates low status. Calmly stuttering, while looking the hoodlum in the eye, establishes that you're not afraid to stutter and you're not afraid of the hoodlum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Moral Stress&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;You did something wrong. You didn't realize it was wrong at the time, but now you're suspected of this minor crime. You make up a lie to eliminate the suspicion. But your lie is caught. Now you're in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to preach whether &amp;quot;honesty is the best policy&amp;quot; or whether lying your way out of situations sometimes works. What I'll tell you is how to use stuttering to appear to be telling the truth. Interrogations start with &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; questions such as your name. But every stutterer blocks on their name! Get into some good dysfluencies on your name. Imagine yourself hooked up to a lie detector machine. Make the needle swing into the red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when you're asked the real question, pause, relax your breathing and your vocal folds, and slowly and fluently tell your story&amp;#151;truthfully or otherwise. A lie detector machine will indicate that you're telling the truth. A human listener will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Categorize Stress to React Rationally&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Movies show characters in stressful situations. When watching movies, name the type of stress a character experiences. Soon you should feel an inner voice say &amp;quot;moral stress,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;time pressure&amp;quot; when watching movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the same light bulb will switch on in your mind when watching people in daily life. When the light bulb switches on in situations stressful to you, you're on your way to eliminating this type of stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress causes you to react emotionally, not rationally. When reacting emotionally, you react one way. Different people have different emotional reactions, depending on their personality type. E.g., one person might react with outward anger, when another person reacts with inward shame. That doesn't matter. What matters is the automatic, single response to all stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting out of an emotion and into &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; enables you to see other possible responses, and select the best response. The light bulb switching on enables you to switch gears.&lt;/p&gt;

      <comment>/* Tone */ wording</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Tone=
Mac books are written for users with little to moderate computer experience, probably at home or on the client side of a large network. Therefore, Mac books should aim to be very light and relaxed. The way language is used should make reading a Mac book a fun activity in itself. Jokes should be subtle and not over-used. And above all, nothing should be done at the expense of clarity. A reader should be able to absorb everything with one read-through of the book. Repeat key concepts from section to section (in parentheses, perhaps) as a reminder.

=Lingusitic Conventions=
For the sake of consistency, follow these linguistic conventions:

*Use American spelling in all Mac WikiBooks.
*Use the serial comma.
*Avoid using elipses (...) to end sentences.

=Structure=
The organizational &quot;tree&quot; of a Mac WikiBook looks like this:

*Main Page
**Parts (optional)
***Chapters, Appendices, and Glossaries
****Sub-Chapters (optional)

Nest each one inside the one &quot;bigger&quot; than it.

==A Word on Parts==
Parts are used only in books covering suites of Applications. Instead of linking to chapters on the main page, these books link to parts. Each part is like a book in itself, containing an introduction and a table of contents linking to the part's own chapters and appendices. 

A perfect example of a book that uses &quot;parts&quot; is the [[iLife]] book. Each application gets its own part, and therefore its own table of contents and glossary. This vastly simplifies getting around the iLife book.

==A Word on Sub-Chapters==
Sub-chapters complexify things. Avoid using them if possible, but put them in if a chapter becomes huge and unwieldy on one page (such as a chapter that explains every single application in Mac OS X Tiger). Please do not put sub-chapters inside sub-chapters.

==Main Page==
Each WikiBook's must have a main page. This starts off with an Introduction section. The Introduction has, in this order:

# A section about the product(s) described in the WikiBook
# A section about the WikiBook itself, exlpaining what one is for new users and what the WikiBook does and does not cover
#: * Include the obligatory &quot;assumes knowledge of [[Mac OS X Tiger]] message&quot;.
# A section about how to use the WikiBook
#: *Nesting of Menu commands and files (copy verbatim from another WikiBook, if you'd like)
#: *Clarification of confusingly similar words (e.g. windows vs. Windows) and interchangable words (e.g. application and program)
#: *Explanation of each kind of Info Box or other special template used in the WikiBook.

The second section of the Main Page must is the table of contents, with links to all chapters, appendices, and glossaries. Coding tables of contents can be confusing. Follow this format exactly:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# [[Chapter 1]] {{stage short}}
#: Chapter 1 description
# [[Chapter 2]] {{stage short}}
#: Chapter 2 description
# [[Chapter 3]] {{stage short}}
#: Chapter 3 description
# Appendices
#:* [[Appendix A]] {{stage short}}
#:*: Appendix A description
#:* [[Appendix B]] {{stage short}}
#:*: Appendix B description 
# [[Glossary]] {{stage short}}
#: Glossary description&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

For an example of a perfect table of contents, see the [[Mac OS X Tiger]] WikiBook.

{{Info|'''NOTE:''' remember to tag every module with a stage indicator. Mark modules as {out of date} if they cover an older version of a piece of software.}}

=No Advertising!=
It's legitimate and helpful to mention an application (Freeware, Shareware, Open Source, or Regular), brand of hardware, or website, but this wikibook shouldn't be a platform for advertising, nor should any tutorial contained in it ever rely on a non-Apple product.

=Book, Not Encyclopedia=
Remember that Mac WikiBooks are books, not encyclopedias. Keep a casual tone. This book is supposed to be the Mac OS X user's best friend, not a dry encyclopedia of information.

=Images=
Put in color screenshots, product images, and diagrams in important places. Use them when necessary, but never frivolously, so the pages can load over a dial-up connection. Also make sure the screenshots do not show any &quot;haxies&quot;, themes, etc. Keep the screens uncluttered and familiar to the average user (for instance, use bundled Apple wallpaper, don't over-customize toolbars, and don't show any alternative icons). Also, when talking about a window or a menu, the screenshot should not include anything else. As a rule, full screenshots should be 830px wide.

Screenshots should be centered except when impractical, always appear as thumbnails, and be labeled in this format: &quot;Fig. 1 - Here is a caption, which is &quot;dry&quot; (not funny or interesting) and does not contain instructions.&quot;

{{Mac Note Box|Check our Image Directory for some great images you can use in your writing.}}

=Tables=
Tables should be used whenever appropriate.
*Table width should be set to 830px
*The border should be set to 0
*Cell Padding should be set to 3
*Cells should be either 4D804D (dark green) or B5E3B5 (light green)
*Tables should be labeled in this fashion &quot;Table 1. This is a simple caption.&quot;

=Info Boxes=
Use Info Boxes whenever they make sense. Use the following templates:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Mac Warning Box|Put Warning text here.}}

{{Mac Note Box|Put Note Text here.}}

{{Mac Trick Box|Put Trick Text here.}}

{{Mac Background Box|Put Background Text here.}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=WikiProject Templates=
These templates should be used to display affiliation with the Macintosh WikiProject.

*[[Template:WP Mac Module]] - Use this template at the top of all module's talk pages.
*[[Template:WP Mac Cleanup]] - Place this template at the top of all bad modules and their talk pages.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Advanced WikiBooks follow different guidelines than regular Mac WikiBooks. Only guidelines that are different appear below; all others are the same as their non-advanced counterparts.

=Tone=
Advanced Mac WikiBooks should have the same tone as a regular Mac WikiBook, but with fewer jokes, a slightly more dense style, and less repetition. Clarity is even more important as concepts get more and more complicated, and a lack of clarity is the fatal flaw for most books pertaining to this subject matter.

=Templates=
*Use [[Template:WP Mac Adv Module]] on talk pages for Advanced WikiBooks.
*Use [[Template:WP Mac Adv Cleanup]] on Advanced modules that need cleanup.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Add Live Bookmark by Icon==
&lt;br&gt;
Firefox's Live Bookmarks is one application of RSS. Here we are going to tell you how to use Firefox browser as your RSS reader. There are basically two different ways for user to feed RSS into Firefox. The first and easiest way is to add the feed directly. 
&lt;br&gt;

*When browsing a website with RSS feed, there will be a small icon showed on window.
*For Firefox version 1.5.0.1, a small icon will show on the right side of the URL location.
*The icon will change depending on the theme of your Firefox browser. The icon showed here is the default icon of Firefox.
*For different version of Firefox, the location of the icon might be differnt. In prior versions, the icon might be at lower-right corner of the window. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*Users click on the icon.
*A dialog window will show up. 
*Choose the location to put the Live Bookmark. Then click OK. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Firefoxrss3.PNG|right|thumb|500px|Add feed]]&lt;br&gt;
*Live Bookmark will show on the bookmark bar.
*When clicking on the icon, it will update to the latest news automatically.
*When you click on one topic, it will open one new window connecting to the website of the content.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Another Way to Feed RSS==
&lt;br&gt;
*Click on the Bookmark tag and choose Manage Bookmarks.

&lt;br&gt;
*In Bookmarks Manager, choose File -&gt; New Live Bookmark.
[[Image:Firefoxrss5.PNG|center|thumb|200px|Go to bookmark manager]]
&lt;br&gt;
*Copy the RSS site (an URL of a xml file) of the website you want.

&lt;br&gt;
*Paste the RSS link into Feed Location attribute.

&lt;br&gt;
*The Live Bookmark will show up at your Bookmarks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just started using vim.  I've been trying to setup my _vimrc file in windows, and have found it frustrating.  All I want to do for now is set a few environment variables, tabstop, wrap, expandtab.  But when I create a file with these settings, the text hilighting and other default settings are erased.  I think this document should show how to create a _vimrc file that leaves all default settings and allows you to add just your changes.
[[User:Golden Eternity|Golden Eternity]] 23:09, 19 March 2006 (UTC)Golden_Eternity

: While this a Book not a Forum I still give you a hint: Prehaps there is a syntax error in your _vimrc - this might prevent the system from reading succesive setups. Help in Fixes:

:# Try &lt;code&gt;:source %&lt;/code&gt; - this will read the file without the need to restart. 
:# Use &lt;code&gt;:messages&lt;/code&gt; after start - this will show last 10 errormessages and there should not be any after a fresh start ;-).

: (My guess) Maybe you are deactivating &quot;vimrc_example.vim&quot;. This file comes with Vim and has many useful defaults. If you create a _vimrc, you should :source vimrc_example.vim or copy the parts of it that interest you. -- anonymous

=== {{French/Section|Usage notes|supplementary-id=french-usage-notes}} ===
&lt;div id='french-usage-notes'&gt;
; ''Tu'' and ''vous''
: This is an important difference between French and English. English no longer distinguishes between the singular and the plural, formal version of ''you'', although ''thou'' used to be the informal singular version up to the Mid-nineteenth Century. In French, it is culturally important to know when to use {{French/Word|vous|IPA=/vu/ (''voo'')|audio=Fr-vous.ogg}} and when to use {{French/Word|tu|IPA=/ty/ (''tew'')|audio=Fr-tu.ogg}}.
: ''Vous'' is the plural form of ''you''. This is somewhat equivalent to ''you all'', ''you guys'', ''all of you'', except that it does not carry any familiarity when used with the plural. You'd use it to address your friends as well as when talking to the government at a press conference. ''Vous'' is also used to refer to single individuals to show respect, to be polite or to be neutral. It is used when talking to someone who is important, someone who is older than you are, or someone with whom you are unfamiliar. This is known as Vouvoiement.
: Conversely, ''tu'' is the singular and informal form of ''vous'' (''you'') in French.  It is commonly used when referring to a friend or a family member, and is also used between children or when addressing a child. If it is used when speaking to a stranger, it can be taken as disrespect. This is known as Tutoiement. As a rule of thumb, use ''tu'' only when you would call that person by his first name, otherwise use ''vous''. French speaking people will make it known when they would like you to refer to them by ''tu''. In French speaking Canada, the use of the singular ''tu'' is used everywhere, and can be considered a cultural difference from that of Europe and Africa. You can use the ''vous'' in Canada, but it won't affect your respect.

; ''Il'', ''elle'', and ''on''
: French pronouns carry meanings that do not exist in English pronouns. The pronoun ''it'' does not exist in French. ''Il'' replaces all masculine nouns, even those that are not human; the same is true with ''elle'' and feminine nouns.
: The French third person ''on'' has several meanings, but most closely matches the now archaic English ''one''. While in English, sentences with ''one'' as the subject sound old-fashioned, their French equivalents are quite acceptable. In everyday language, ''on'' is used, instead of ''nous'', to express ''we''; the verb is always used in the 3rd person singular. &lt;!--For example, to say &quot;We (are) meeting at 7 o'clock&quot;, you could say either ''“On se rencontre au cinéma à sept heures.”'' (colloquial) or ''“Nous nous rencontrons au cinéma à sept heures.”''--&gt;

; ''Ils'' and ''elles''
: While the third person plural ''they'' has no gender in English, the French equivalents ''ils'' and ''elles'' do. However, when pronounced, they normally sound the same as ''il'' and ''elle'', so distinguishing the difference requires understanding of the various conjugations of the verbs following the pronoun. Also, if a group of people consists of both males and females, the male form is used, even with a majority of females; however, this sensibly yields to overwhelming majority: given a group of only one male to thousands of females, the female form would be used.
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-usage-notes --&gt;

&lt;div id='french-verbs'&gt;
A verb is a word that describes an action or mental or physical state.

; Tenses and moods : French verbs can be formed in four moods, each of which express a unique feeling. Each mood has a varying number of tenses, which indicate the time when an action takes place. The conjugations in the present tense of the indicative mood, the present indicative, is discussed in the next section. There is one conjugation for each of the six subject pronouns.

; Infinitives : The infinitive form is the basic form of a verb. It does not refer to a particular tense, person or subject. The infinitive form of the verb is often used to identify it. In English, the infinitive form is ''to ___''. In French, the infinitive is one word. For example, ''parler'' translates to ''to speak'', ''finir'' translates to ''to finish'', and ''aller'' translates to ''to go''.

; Conjugation : French verbs conjugate; they take different shapes depending on the subject. English verbs only have one conjugation; that is the third person singular (''I see'', ''you see'', ''he/she '''sees''''', ''we see'', ''they see''). The only exception is the verb ''to be'' (''I am''; (''thou art''); ''you are''; ''he/she is''; ''we are''; ''they are''). Most French verbs will conjugate into many different forms. Most verbs are regular, which means that they conjugate in the same way. The most common verbs, however, are irregular.
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-verbs --&gt;

== {{French/Section|Grammar|To be|Être}} ==
''Être'' translates as ''to be'' in English. As in most languages, it is an irregular verb, and is not conjugated like any other verb.

=== {{French/Section|Vocabulary|Expressions|supplementary-id=french-etre-expressions}} ===
&lt;div id='french-etre-expressions'&gt;
Used as a noun, {{French/Word|l'être}} means ''the being'' or ''the creature''. Likewise, the phrase {{French/Word|l'être humain|IPA=/ɛ.tʁ‿y.mɛ̃/|audio=Fr-être-humain.ogg}} means ''the human being''.

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Expressions with être.ogg}}

|-
| Vous y êtes? ||  || Are you ready? || 
|-

=== Expressing agreement ===
''Tu es d’accord ou pas ?'', ''Tu es d’accord ?'', literally meaning ''You are of agreement?'', or simply {{French/Word|D'accord ?|IPA=/d‿a.kɔʁ/|audio=Fr-d’accord.ogg}} is used informally to ask whether someone agrees with you.

To respond positively, you say ''Oui, je suis d'accord.'' or simply ''D'accord'':
: {{French/Word|Oui, je suis d’accord avec vous.|en=Yes, I agree with you.}}
''D'accord'' corresponds to the English ''okay''.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Nationalities and jobs}} ==
When stating your nationality or job, it is not necessary to include the article:
: {{French/Word|Je suis australien(ne).|en=I am [an] Australian.}}
: {{French/Word|Je suis avocat.|en=I am [a] lawyer.}}
This is an exception to the normal rule.

There is both a masculine and a feminine form of saying your nationality&amp;mdash;for males and females respectively:
: {{French/Word|Il est australien.|en=He is [an] Australian.}}
: {{French/Word|Elle est australienne.|en=She is [an] Australian.}}

== {{French/Section|Vocabulary|Nationalities|Les nationalités|supplementary-id=french-nationalities}} ==
&lt;div id='french-nationalities'&gt;
Nationalities are not capitalized as often in French as they are in English. If you are referring to a person, as in an Arab person or a Chinese person, the French equivalent is ''un Arabe'' or ''un Chinois''. However, if you are referring to the Arabic language or Chinese language, the French would not capitalize: ''l'arabe'', ''le chinois''. If the nationality is used as an adjective, it is normally left uncapitalized: ''un livre chinois'', ''un tapis arabe''.

== Introduction==
*'''Mass Spectrometry Overview'''
Mass spectrometry is a technique in which gas phase molecules are ionized and their mass-to-charge ratio is measured by observing acceleration differences of ions when an electric field is applied. Lighter ions will accelerate faster and be detected first. If the mass is measured with precision then the composition of the molecule can be identified.  In the case of proteins, the sequence can be identified. Most samples submitted to mass Spectrometry are a mixture of compounds. A spectrum is acquired to give the mass-to-charge ratio of all compounds in the sample. Mass spectrometry is also known as 'mass spec' or MS for short.
Mass spectrometry throws light on molecular mechanisms within cellular systems. It is used for identifying proteins, functional interactions, and it further allows for determination of subunits. Other molecules in cells such as lipid components can also be defined.

A mass spectrometer is composed of several different parts: a source that ionizes the sample, the analyzer that separates the ions based on mass-to-charge ratio, a detector that &quot;sees&quot; the ions, and a data system to process and analyze the results. You can also measure relative abundance of an ion using mass spectrometry. Different compounds have differential ionization capabilities and therefore intensity of your ion is not a direct correlation to concentration.

Mass spectrometry can be a high throughput analytical method due to the ability for a mass spectrum to be measured rapidly and with minimal sample handling as compared to gel methods.

It is an analytical method which has a [[w:Mass_spectrometry#Applications|variety of uses outside of proteomics]], such as isotope and dating, trace gas analysis, atomic location mapping, pollutant detection, and space exploration

*'''History of Mass Spectrometry'''

The history of this technique finds its roots in the first studies of gas excitation in a charged environment, more than 100 years ago. This pioneering work led to the identification of two isotopes of neon (neon-20 and neon-22) via mass to charge ration discrimination by [[w:J.J Thomson|J.J Thomson]] in 1913. Over the next fifty years the fundamental basis of the technique was further developed. After the coupling of gas chromatography to Mass Spectroscopy in 1959 by researches at Dow Chemical, the full potential of the technique as a highly accurate, quantitative method for exploring compounds was realized, spurring a wave of developments which continue to the present day. The precision of mass spectrometry led to the discovery of isotopes.

&lt;br&gt;
*'''Implications of Mass Spectrometry for Proteomics Applications'''
The technique of mass spectrometry is a valuable tool in the field of proteomics.  It can be used to identify proteins through variations of mass spectrometry techniques. The most common first approach to proteomics is a bottom-up approach in which the protein is digested by a protease, such a trypsin, and the peptides are then analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting, [[w:Collision-induced_dissociation|collision-induced dissociation]], tandem MS, and [[w:Electron_capture_dissociation|electron capture dissociation]]. 
Once the peptides masses have been determined the mass list can be sent to a database, such as MASCOT, where the list is compared to the masses of all known peptides. If enough peptides match that of a known protein you can identify your protein. If the masses of your peptides do not match a known protein you can sequence your peptide by de novo sequencing using MS/MS methods; where you isolate your peptide and break it along the peptide bond backbone forming y and b ions from which you can determine the sequence. The advantages of the bottom-up approach are that the small size of tryptic peptide ions is easy to handle biochemically than entire protein ions because of their relatively small masses that are easier to be determine. Beside bottom-up approach, another approach is top-down. In top-down approach, the complete proteins are directly analyzed by using mass spectrometer without solution digestion as bottom-up does. The advantages of the top-down approach are that it can sometime provide the complete coverage of the protein. But since whole proteins are hard to handle biochemically compared to small peptide pieces, it makes top-down approach difficult to analyze.

Another use of mass spectrometry in proteomics is protein quantification.  By labeling proteins with stable heavier isotopes you can in turn determine the relative abundance of proteins. Companies now produce kits, such as iTRAQ [https://products.appliedbiosystems.com/ab/en/US/adirect/ab;jsessionid=h5NJJtQYRTsxJ87QQ1gvLQR10ytg61ntRqKBGJdvy2KhJ6zJJD5z!-1326983448?cmd=catNavigate2&amp;catID=600900&amp;tab=Literature (Applied Biosystems)], in order to do this at a high-throughput level.

One of the most powerful ways to identify a biological molecule is to determine its molecular mass together with the masses of its component building blocks after fragmentation. There are two dominant methods for doing this.  The first is electrospray ionization (ESI), in which the ions of interest are formed from solution by applying a high electric field. This is done by applying a high electric field to the tip of a capillary, from which the solution will pass through. The sample will be sprayed into the electric field along with a flow of nitrogen to promote desolvation. Droplets will form and will evaporate in a vacuumed area. This causes an increase in charge on the droplets and the ions are now said to be multiply charged. These multiply charged ions can now enter the analyzer. ESI is a method of choice because of the following properties: (1)The &quot;softness&quot; of the phase conversion process allows very fragile molecules to be ionized intact and even in some non-covalent interactions to be preserved for MS analysis. (2)The eluting fractions through liquid chromatography can then be sprayed into the mass spectrometer, allowing for the further analysis of mixtures. (3)The production of multiply charged ions allow for the measurement of high-mass biopolymers. Multiple charges on the molecule will reduce its mass to charge ratio when compared to a single charged molecule. Multiple charges on a molecule also allows for improved fragmentation which in turn allows for a better determination of structure. The second is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) in which the molecular ions of interest are formed by pulses of laser light impacting on the sample isolated within an excess of matrix molecules. This enables the determination of masses of large biomolecules and synthetic polymers greater than 200,000 Daltons without degradation of the molecule of interest. The advantages of MALDI are its robustness, high speed, and relative immunity to contaminants and biochemical buffers.

A type of mass spectrometer often used with MALD is TOF or Time of Flight mass spectrometry. This enables fast and accurate molar mass determination along with sequencing repeated units and recognizing polymer additives and impurities. This technique is based on an ultraviolet absorbing matrix where the matrix and polymer are mixed together along with excess matrix and a solvent to prevent aggregation of the polymer.
This mixture is then placed on the tip of a probe; then the solvent is removed while under vacuum conditions. This creates co-crystallized polymer molecules that are dispersed homogeneously within the matrix.
A pulsing laser beam is set to an appropriate frequency and energy is shot to the matrix, which becomes partially vaporized. In turn the homogeneously dispersed polymer within the matrix is carried into the vapor phase and becomes charged. To obtain a superb signal-to-noise ratio, multiple laser shots are executed. The shapes of the peaks are improved and the molar masses determined are more accurate. Fianlly,in the TOF analyzer the molecules from a sample are imparted identical translational kinetic energies because of the electrical potential energy difference. These ionic molecules travel down an evacuated tube with no electrical field and of the same distance. The smallest ions arrive first at the detector, which produces a signal for each ion. The cumulative data from multiple laser shots yield a TOF mass spectrum, which translates the detector signal into a function of time, which in turn can be used to calculate the mass of the ion.

In addition to these ionization techniques, highly powerful mass analyzers have been developed. These analyzers measure the mass/charge ratio of intact ionized biomolecules, as well as their fragmentation spectra, with high accuracy and high speed. The measurement of fragmentation spectra is called tandem MS or MS/MS. In conjunction with single stage MS (with intact precursor ions) tandem MS can be utilized to help elucidate a protein since the problem of elucidation will reduce to assembling the puzzle pieces of the fragmented protein.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Measuring stuttering is notoriously difficult. You can measure several aspects of stuttering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency of disfluencies. I.e., disfluencies per hundred words or syllables. The &quot;average&quot; stutterer is dysfluent on 10 percent of words. People who don't stutter are disfluent on about 2% of words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duration of disfluencies. The &quot;average&quot; disfluency lasts about 1 second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking rate, or word per minute. The average speaking rate for people who don't stutter is 167 words per minute (Darley, 1940). The average speaking rate for stutterers is 123 words per minute. The average stutterer speaks about 25% slower than the average non-stutterer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of disfluencies. Wendell Johnson developed eight categories of disfluencies in 1959. The first three are common to both stutterers and non-stutterers. The last five are stuttering disfluencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interjections (&quot;uh,&quot; &quot;er&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revisions (&quot;I was - I am going&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incomplete phrases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part-word repetitions (&quot;ba-ba-ba-baseball&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word repetitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phrase repetitions (&quot;I was I was going&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broken words (&quot;I was g - (pause) - oing home&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prolonged sounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preferred test questionnaire for measuring stuttering is the &quot;Stuttering Severity Instrument for Children and Adults,&quot; 3rd edition, by Glyndon Riley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study by Young in 1961 found that ordinary listeners judged stuttering to be &quot;severe&quot; when there were part-word repetitions, prolongations, broken words, and a new category, &quot;undue stress or tension.&quot; But many speech samples were judged &quot;severe&quot; with relatively few of these disfluencies, suggesting that there are yet more, unidenti fied types of stuttering disfluencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many electronic instruments that can measure aspects of stuttering. See &quot;Instrumentation For The Assessment And Treatment Of Stuttering&quot;, by Klaas Bakker (1996) and &quot;Automatic Recognition of Dysfluencies&quot; (Howell, 1997).&lt;/p&gt;

==Problems Measuring Stuttering==

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences between judges. Different people listening to the same tape will hear different numbers of disfluencies, even if they are trained speech pathologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counting normal disfluencies. Everyone has normal disfluencies. Does having lots of normal disfluencies make a person a stutterer? Or is stuttering something different? Should normal disfluencies be counted as stuttering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children vs. adults. Children stutter in different ways than adults: some disfluencies are normal for children but are abnormal in adults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden stuttering. Some stutterers can substitute words and appear to never stutter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking conditions. Some stutterers can read out loud perfectly fluently. Others stutter most severely when reading. Some stutterers are most fluent in conversation. Others are most disfluent. Some are most fluent in stressful situations, on telephones, etc., while others are the opposite. You can't judge how severely a person stutters from a single speaking situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal or psychological stuttering is difficult to quantify. For many stutterers the internal effects of stuttering are greater than their physical symptoms. Several stuttering therapies focus on improving the self-esteem and overall communication skills of stutterers, with little or no attention to improving physical fluency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different people stutter in different ways, and each person has multiple ways of stuttering. There is no single behavior common to all stuttering. Be skeptical when anyone claims that a therapy reduced stuttering 85%, etc. Ask how stuttering was measured, under what conditions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;blockquote&gt;   I am a mother of a stuttering thirteen-year-old boy. Stuttering really had never bothered him until this year. It is very frustrating for him to talk on the phone. His friends call all the time but he has refrained from talking on the phone because his stuttering seems to get worse. My husband and I have noticed him withdrawing from his peers. We have always had an active role with his stuttering. He has been to a lot of speech-language pathologists and we have also tried the CAFET [biofeedback computer] system. This was helping him. Unfortunately the closest center was more than two hours away. After one year it was too stressful on him missing too much school. Because of this we had to stop. Since then he has wanted nothing to do with speech-language pathologists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents of teenagers who stutter tell similar stories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The teenager has been seeing his school's speech-language pathologists for five or even ten years. His speech isn't improving. He wants to discontinue speech therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He's fluent in the speech-language pathologist's office, but stutters everywhere else.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The parents have taken him to other speech clinics, without success.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He used to have good speech attitudes, saying whatever he wanted. Now he fears and avoids certain words or speaking situations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;His social behavior has changed. He's withdrawing from social contacts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously he saw himself as being like most other kids, doing the same things as other kids. School-age boys' social activities, e.g., baseball, don't demand much talking. Now he thinks of himself as a stutterer, different from other teenagers. Teenagers' social activities, e.g., dating or getting an after-school job, are harder for a stutterer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your teenager is an adult, in terms of stuttering. He should be doing adult stuttering therapy. This can include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Psychological stuttering therapy, training fluent speech (physical) skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A support group for teenagers who stutter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;An intensive speech therapy program or a summer camp for teenagers who stutter. (Google [http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=speech+camp+for+teens+who+stutter&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 &amp;quot;speech camp for teens who stutter.&amp;quot;])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

==Develop a Passion==

&lt;p&gt;In the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Famous People Who Stutter|Famous People Who Stutter]], you'll learn that many celebrities developed their talents during high school as a result of stuttering. E.g.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;James Earl Jones, Bruce Willis, and Nicholas Brendan overcame stuttering through acting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Carly Simon developed her skills as a singer and a songwriter because she couldn't talk about her feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a teenager feels passion for an activity, he or she can focus with greater intensity than adults. Your job, as a parent, is to help your teenager focus on a speech-positive activity, instead of focusing on video games or memorizing Black Sabbath lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help your teenager become passionately involved in activities that require talking, improve his fluency, and develop his social skills. Such activities include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Singing.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Acting.&lt;/li&gt; 
        &lt;li&gt;Sports.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Debating.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Foreign languages.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Organizing a teenage stuttering support group.&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;A [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/High School Science Projects|science project]] about stuttering.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

==Involve Peers in Speech Therapy==

&lt;p&gt;Are your teenage clients less than enthusiastic about speech therapy? Well, duh, if you're a speech-language pathologist then you're at least 25! You might even be over 30! Why would a teenage want to talk to someone your age?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, have a teenage stutterer bring a friend to speech therapy. He'll talk to his friend about skateboarding or video games or other stuff you're clueless about. Better yet, you can train the friend to give your client a  [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Automatic, Effortless Fluency#My Romantic Disaster of 1996|subtle reminder]] when he needs to slow down or get back on-target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or role-play the teenager asking a peer out on a date. He can ask her for her telephone number by saying that his speech therapist wants him to practice making telephone calls. I used to do something like this: I met a girlfriend by telling her that my speech therapist wanted me to introduce myself to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paramount in teenagers' minds is connecting to peers (other teenagers), e.g., being seen as &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; by their classmates. Use speech therapy as way to connect to peers and your teenager will want to do speech therapy. E.g., instead of (thinking of himself as) being seen as a boy who stutters, help your teenager think of himself as a boy who's not afraid to ask girls for their telephone numbers and ask them out on dates.&lt;/p&gt;

==Learn American Sign Language==

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I took four years of German in high school and college. The classes were taught in a conversational style. Being unable to talk, I learned nothing. No one suggested that I study American Sign Language instead. I could have been 100% fluent in that! Being good at something would have improved my self-esteem. In contrast, I felt like the stupidest person in the German classes. And if I learned sign language I would've made friends in the deaf community, or maybe worked part-time as a sign language interpreter.&lt;/i&gt;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 02:12, 28 March 2006 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask your child whether he or she likes school. In first and second grade, girls see school as where they socialize with their friends, via quiet verbal communication and cooperation. In contrast, boys see school as where they're told &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to play with their friends, via physical interaction such as running around or showing off their physical abilities. This difference makes school more stressful for boys, with effects on their speech.&lt;/p&gt;

==Why Do More Boys Than Girls Stutter?==

&lt;p&gt;Among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter about two to one, or less.{{ref|Yairi2005a}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more girls recover fluent speech, and more boys don't.{{ref|Yairi2005b}} By fifth grade the ratio is about four boys who stutter to one girl who stutters. This ratio remains into adulthood.{{ref|Craig2002}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why boys are more likely to stutter, and less likely to recover, isn't certain. Boys generally have more diseases and disorders, for reasons having to do with the Y chromosome. Boys generally have more speech disorders because girls are better at speech and language, and especially at using speech and language for social purposes. Speech and language are more stressful for boys, so boys prefer to interact physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At five for girls and seven for boys, children's brains go through a massive adrenaline shift. After this shift, the child is able to socialize with other children in groups. Before this age, playing with more than one or two friends can be a stressful experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was apparent to me at my nephew's sixth birthday party. One of his presents was a slinky. I showed his friends how to make the slinky walk down stairs. Three girls sat together at the top of the stairs and took turns. One girl could easily make the slinky walk down the stairs. This was harder for the second girl, but she could do it. The third girl couldn't do it at all. But they cooperated and encouraged each other. Two boys wanted to try it. But they couldn't get to top of the stairs without wrestling each other and falling back down the stairs. I wouldn't allow wrestling on the stairs, so they'd run around the living room chasing each other. Then they'd come back to play with the slinky, but start wrestling on the stairs again.&lt;/i&gt;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 02:10, 28 March 2006 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At five, girls are ready to start school. Boys are wild animals until seven. School can be stressful for boys who aren't ready for school. The most stressful part of school for boys may be the communication demands. Girls are using communication to make friends. Girls' communication skills and social skills develop together. In contrast, boys may not be ready to socialize with 25 other children, in a building with hundreds of other children. Some children are in school and day care for twelve hours, without time to relax or to be alone&amp;#151;that'd stress me out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your five- or six-year-old son stutters, and you don't think he's ready for school (e.g., he vomits or wets his pants at school), consider keeping him home another year, or look into a co-op school where a parent can attend school with him, or let him attend school but don't put him in daycare for another six hours each day.&lt;/p&gt;

==SLPs vs. Parents vs. Computers==

A large study found that speech-language pathologists training parents to do speech therapy with their children was more effective than the speech-language pathologists doing therapy with the children. The study also found that computer-based stuttering therapy, with minimal involvement from speech-language pathologists, was the most effective treatment of all.

&lt;p&gt;A study of 98 children, 9 to 14 years old, compared three types of stuttering therapy. The three types of therapy were:{{ref|Craig1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Intensive &amp;quot;smooth speech&amp;quot; fluency shaping trained relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing; a slow speaking rate with prolonged vowels; gentle onsets and offsets (loudness contour); soft articulation contacts; and pauses between phrases. The children did this therapy in a speech clinic for 35 hours over one week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Home-based &amp;quot;smooth speech.&amp;quot; This was similar to the first group, but parents were included, and encouraged to continue therapy at home. Therapy was done in a speech clinic for six hours once a week for four weeks (24 hours total).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Electromyographic biofeedback. The children used an EMG biofeedback computer system about six hours a day for one week (30 hours total). The EMG system monitored the child's speech-production muscle activity. The children were instructed to tense and then relax their speech-production muscles. The goal was to develop awareness and control of these muscles. The children then worked through a hierarchy from simple words to conversations, while keeping their speech-production muscles relaxed. After mastering this while watching the computer display, the children did the exercises with the computer monitoring but not displaying their muscle activity. The speech pathologists did relatively little with the children: &amp;quot;Constant clinician presence was not necessary as the computer provided feedback as to whether the child was performing the skills correctly.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth (control) group didn't receive any stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each therapy program, all three therapies reduced stuttering below 1% on average. The control group had no improvement in fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year after the therapy program, the percentage of children with disfluency rates under 2% were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;48% of the children from the clinician-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;63% of the children from the parent-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;71% of the children from the computer-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results for children with disfluency rates under 1% were even more striking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10% of the children from the clinician-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;37% of the children from the &amp;quot;parent-based&amp;quot; program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;44% of the children from the computer-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;I.e., the computers were most effective, the parents next most effective, and the speech-language pathologists were least effective in the long term. At the 1% disfluency level, the computers and the parents were about &lt;i&gt;four times&lt;/i&gt; more effective than the speech-language pathologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years later, all three groups had average stuttering reductions between 76% and 79%. This may have been due to the more dysfluent children receiving additional speech therapy.{{ref|Hancock1998}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Motivation for Speech Therapy==

&lt;p&gt;The father of a ten-year-old stutterer wanted to do everything to help his son. On the advice of his son's speech-language pathologist, the father bought a top-of-the-line electronic stuttering therapy device. The speech-language pathologist trained the father to use the device. The father worked with his son thirty minutes every evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two months, the father returned the device for a refund. The son was 100% fluent when practicing with the device. The kid had no interest in using slow, relaxed speech the rest of the day. Stuttering didn't stop the boy from playing baseball or doing other things boys do. In the world of seven- to twelve-year-old boys, talking isn't an important activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But your seven- to twelve-year-old son's good self-esteem can be a double-edged sword. It's hard to get school-age boys motivated to do speech therapy. This makes it more important that parents do speech therapy with their child in every conversation. Ask your child's speech-language pathologist what your child should be doing (e.g., slow speech with stretched vowels). Have your child use therapy skills on every sentence he says to you. Be your child's therapy helper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Advice for Parents, by Magdalene Lima, SLP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a speech-language pathologist in private practice and formerly a public school therapist for nine years. My suggestions to parents of children with speech problems are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do some research in these areas. Check out the communication disorders websites.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go to your school speech-language pathologist with what you know and ask her what she thinks. The best approach is to treat her as the professional she is in a non-critical way with the attitude that you just want to understand all the treatments available for your son. Offer to help get information to her if she doesn't have it. Let her know you understand the position she is in and that you are on her team. This will get you much further in getting the appropriate services for your child than fighting your school.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If your insurance covers it or you have the funds, find a good private pediatric speech and languageclinic in your area and AT LEAST have an evaluation done. Just that information alone could really help the school SLP. If you can afford private therapy, get it. The main difference in service is that your child will receive individual therapy with a clinician that has the time and resources needed to provide the highest quality therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a former school speech-language pathologist, my skills and knowledge didn't suddenly change when I switched over to private practice. The setting changed, and that makes a huge difference. I now serve 30 clients rather than 75, I see them all individually, and I am paid more than in the schools. In the hours I don't see clients, I am busy researching, giving parent support, writing regular and detailed reports, and planning innovative therapy rather than going to bus duty, lunch duty, hall duty, faculty meetings that don't really apply to me and filling out massive amounts of government-required paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is The Problem Ability or Setting?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to those of you who think the worst of the public school speech-language pathologist: I'd like you to stand in her shoes for a minute. In the last three years of my public school experience my caseload became unmanageable. I had 75 students, including a severely and profoundly handicapped class, four autistic students and all other students in speech from grades K-5 at that school. I begged, cried and pleaded for help from my supervisors. I KNEW I could not provide the quality of service each and every one of these students and their families deserved. However, the answer was always: get creative, we don't have money in the budget. Please understand, in my situation, it was not a lack of caring, lack of skill or ability&amp;#151;there was absolutely nothing I could do. I became angry and frustrated at our administration. Why didn't they provide the training, time, personnel and support we needed to provide services to these students?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Speech Pathology: A Growing and Diverse Field&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disorders in our field and the therapies that have now been developed have become extremely specialized. In the schools I was expected by parents to be an expert in the following fields: stuttering, swallowing disorders, voice disorders, articulation disorders including tongue thrust, cleft palate, phonological process disorders as well as motor speech disorders, autism and PDD, traumatic brain injury, ADHD, language and learning disabilities, hearing impairments and social and pragmatic communication disorders. Excuse me, do you realize that just as physicians receive a basic foundation in medicine, so do speech-language pathologists receive a basic foundation in all of the above disorders. You graduate from college and through your experience and personal growth and research, you become an expert in a few areas. It would be virtually impossible for one person to have the time and energy it would take to become an expert in all those areas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why our field is moving towards specialty certifications. What will public schools do then? I guess they will have to hire the specialists that their individual students require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Many and Varied Problems in the Schools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more our district began hiring speech assistants (speech practitioners who are not required to meet the standards of education, clinical practicum and experience needed to be fully certified and licensed) to handle huge caseloads with minimal supervision from licensed speech-language pathologists. There is a shortage of qualified speech language pathologists willing to go into public school therapy when there are much more lucrative and attractive positions available in other settings. As I talked with administrators, I soon became aware of the pressure being applied to them from the state, parents and other agencies to meet all these educational requirements. For every parent who complains there is not enough money to provide quality special education services in the school, there is another parent complaining that their gifted and talented child is not being given the education THEY deserve because of all the money being poured into special education programs. Or what about the parents of children in sports programs, they have THEIR list of complaints. Everyone thinks that their cause is totally justified because they are arguing for their children, and nothing can convince anyone that their child doesn't deserve the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the public school system to go into private practice and now my problem is solved&amp;#151;I love my work and I'm giving quality services to clients with fantastic results! However, what's your solution? My final and personal resolution to this whole issue, is that in many cases&amp;#151;not all, but many&amp;#151;I truly feel that schools are doing the very best they can with the resources available to them to provide the services that our children need. However, sometimes, parents are right, it's not enough. So what are we going to do? Is every parent in America with a complaint going to file suit against the local school district? If this happens, our schools will begin focusing on preventing lawsuits rather than on how best to serve and educate our children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Work With Your Administration/Educators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all it takes is going to an administrator, such as the Director of Special Education, and pleading your case. Also give your specific suggestions at your child's IEP meeting. You'd better have some research and documentation to back up the necessity of your suggestions. The attitude and manner in which you present yourself is of utmost importance, if they perceive you are willing to make compromises and work with them they will be more willing to stick their neck out for you. Suggest specific things such as the district paying for an outside assessment, or hiring a consultant temporarily who can lend their expertise to your child's case. Get over any intimidation you feel in asserting yourself with these people, they are just people with children and jobs and stresses just like you. What they say to you is never written in stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying you shouldn't fight extreme injustice or abuse. I'm saying it's a huge system with a lot of variables involved. The fight is societal and governmental&amp;#151;usually not your local educational facility. Become involved politically in your state with your speech and hearing association&amp;#151;they always have a branch that is lobbying for legislation to improve speech services in the schools. Meanwhile, you have a child that has needs for quality services in the area of speech pathology, do the best you can to get that service, whether it be private therapy through insurance or private pay, or school therapy, don't stop looking until you find what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YOU take responsibility to research, learn things for yourself and communicate with those who affect your child's education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

==1. Museum information==
* a. Create an XML schema to describe a museum (use elements of the museum entity defined in the last chapter, and add to it a country element).  Specify a set of acceptable values as a country and its calendar with date, opening time, and closing time.
* b. Using the schema, create an XML document and populate it with data for two museums with at least 5 different dates in the calendar for one museum and 7 different dates for the other museum.
&lt;/font&gt;

==2. Currency codes for tourist guides==

* a. Help the guides by creating a valid and well-formed XML schema describing currency codes (e.g. EUR for Euros). The currency code element should consist of three characters. Along that the country's name (e.g. Germany) and the name of the currency (e.g. Euros) should be included. Create a XML document in which some currency codes are listed.

==3. The spa finder==

* a. the XML schema - the Spa Finder lists many spas, each spa serves many activities, and each activity is offered at many days and times by different practitioners. 
   * the information found for each spa - NAME,OWNER, PHONE, CITY, STATE, ADDRESS, STARTED IN, TYPE OF SPA 
   * the information found for each service - SERVICE, DESCRIPTION, PRICE 
   * the information found for each offering of a service - DAYS, TIMES, PRACTITIONER, FLOOR, ROOM 
* Extra- you could use enumeration for the SERVICE, listing some pre-determined services (ie. European Facial, Avocado Facial, Hot Stone Massage, Reflexology, Accupressure, Yoga, TaiChi).

*b. the XML document - fill in the data for 3 spas with at least 3 services each and at least 2 offerings of each service.

==4. Movie Database==

* Create an XML schema to depict a relationship between movie genres, movies, and actors/actresses.
* Choose two genres (drama, horror, action, etc.), two movies in each, and several actors/actresses from each.  
* Using the schema, create a document and populate it with the chosen information.
* Create an XML stylesheet to present the data for easier readability. Reference the stylesheet in the document.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Oliver Bloodstein wrote in his book &lt;i&gt;A Handbook on Stuttering&lt;/i&gt; of &quot;ample evidence&quot; that stuttering is especially prevalent among persons with mental disabilities. Stuttering seems to be especially common among persons with Down Syndrome. There is some debate about this, as the stuttering symptoms among the developmentally-delayed can be different from stuttering in adults of normal intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developmentally-delayed individuals tend to have other speech and language problems as well. A speech pathologist treating a mentally-retarded person will probably use more than just stuttering therapies. There are books devoted to this, such as Communication Strategies for People with Developmental Disabilities: Issues for Theory and Practice, edited by Ken Linfoot, Ph.D. (1995, Baltimore: Brookes Publishing Company, $33, 800/638-3775).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugene Cooper suggests that &quot;reducing the number of abstract concepts the clinician uses&quot; is paramount in treating mentally-retarded stutterers. He also emphasizes that therapy should focus on helping mentally-retarded stutterers &quot;identify and express their feelings and attitudes about the problem.&quot; Too often, speech pathologists act as if mentally-retarded persons lack feelings and emotions, as well as intelligence. Cooper also writes that the stutterer should be &quot;capable of verbalizing the goal of the procedure and their desire to achieve that goal&quot; (Cooper, 1986)- good advice with any stutterer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the person likes to play video games, you may want to try some of the speech therapy computer games.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; [[Radiation Oncology/Peds/Brain tumors]]


'''Supratentorial PNETs'''
*Account for &lt;5% of pediatric CNS tumors
*Patients typically present with symptoms related to increased ICP
*Embryonal tumor composed of undifferentiated/poorly differentiated neuroepithelial cells, which can differentiate along neuronal, astrocytic, ependymal, muscular, or melanotic lines
**Distinct neuronal differentiation = cerebral neuroblastoma
**Ganglion cells present = ganglioneuroblastoma
**Arising in pineal region = [[Radiation_Oncology/CNS/Pineal|pineoblastoma]]
*Typically more aggressive nature compared to medulloblastoma (infratentorial PNET), with rapid progression
**German HIT trials: 3-year PFS ST-PNET PFS 49% vs standard-risk medulloblastoma 78% on same protocol
**CCG 921 trial: 5-year PFS ST-PNET M0 53% vs. medulloblastoma M0 71%; M+ 29% vs. 52% on same protocol
*Different genetic alterations in ST PNET vs. medulloblastoma
*May occur anywhere in the CNS
*Historically treated on same protocols as [[Radiation_Oncology/Medulloblastoma|medulloblastoma]]; treatment strategy now comparable to high-risk medulloblastoma
**Historically, POG has viewed PNET and medulloblastoma as different entities, while CCG was reporting them together 
*Based on German HIT 87/92 trials, RT cannot be eliminated in young (&lt;3 years) patients, even with intense chemotherapy, and delay should be &lt;6 months. Similarly, in CCG and POG protocols, infants treated with only chemotherapy tended to progress and die of the disease


Poor prognostic factors:
*Disseminated disease at diagnosis (M+)
*Young age &lt;3 
*Non-cerebellar (medulloblastoma), non-pineal (pineoblastoma) primary 


==Studies==
*'''CCG 99701''' (Ongoing)
**Phase I/II. Feasibility of concurrent/maintenance chemotherapy. Central primitive embryonic tumors (PNET, ATRT, Medulloblastoma, Ependymoblastoma, Medullomyoblastoma, Spongioblastoma, Medulloepithelioma, Neuroblastoma, Pineoblastoma). No M4 disease. RT CSI 36/20 followed by tumor boost to 53-58.6 Gy in 1.8 Gy/fx, with concurrent carboplatin/ vincristine, followed by maintenance vincristine/ cyclophosphamide or cisplatin/ vincristine/ cyclophosphamide


*'''HIT-SKK87 and HIT-SKK92''' (1987-1992, 1992-1997) 
**''HIT-SKK87'': Low-risk (complete resection, M0) and age &lt;2.5 received maintenance chemo only until RT at 3 years or progression. High-risk (subtotal resction, M+) and age 2.5-3 induction chemo / maintence chemo until RT at 3 years or progression
**''HIT-SKK92'': Post-op chemo x3 cycles first, then if CR no RT. If PR and &lt;18 months, then more chemo, if PR and &gt;18 months, then RT.  
**RT given as CSI 35.2/22 Gy + 20/10 Gy boost; if no residual disease, reduced to CSI 24 Gy + PF boost to 55 Gy
**'''2006''' PMID 16575007 -- &quot;Role of radiotherapy in supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor in young children: results of the German HIT-SKK87 and HIT-SKK92 trials.&quot; (Timmermann B, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Apr 1;24(10):1554-60.)
***Total 29 children enrolled on both. No RT given in 15 children.
***3-year outcomes: OS 17% and PFS 15%. RT only positive predictive factor
**Conclusion: Outcomes unsatisfactory. Omission of RT jeopardizes survival, even when intensive chemo given. Suggest limiting delay of RT to maximum 6 months

*'''German HIT 88/89 and HIT 91''' (1991-97)
**Pilot (HIT 88/89) followed by randomized (HIT 91). Trial enrolled pts with supratentorial PNET, medulloblastoma, and anaplastic ependymomas. All treated with extensive resection. In HIT 88/89, pts treated postoperatively with chemo x2 cycles (Ifosfamide, etoposide, MTX, cisplatin, cytarabine) -&gt; RT (CSI 35.2 Gy + PF boost 20 Gy). In HIT 91, randomized to 1) immediate RT (35.2 + 20) followed by maintenance chemo x8 cycles (CCNU, cisplatin, vincristine), or 2) chemo -&gt; RT (same as HIT 88/89).
**'''ST PNET subset, 2002''' PMID 11821469, 2002 &amp;mdash; &quot;Role of radiotherapy in the treatment of supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors in childhood: results of the prospective German brain tumor trials HIT 88/89 and 91.&quot; (Timmermann M et al. J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb 1;20(3):842-9.)
***Subset analysis of 63 children with ST PNET. 67% incomplete resection. 7 children RT to tumor site only, 2 children no RT, 15 children major RT violations. Median F/U 2.6 years
***3-yr OS 48.4%. Progression in 38 pts, LR in 27 pts. 3-year PFS correct RT 49% vs. major protocol violation RT 7% 
***Conclusion: Preirradiation chemo increases risk of recurrence. Volume should encompass whole CNS to 35 Gy with boost to at least 54 Gy

**'''Pilot HIT 88/89''' PMID 9743957 -- &quot;Preradiation chemotherapy of children and young adults with malignant brain tumors: results of the German pilot trial HIT'88/'89.&quot; (Kuhl J, Klin Padiatr. 1998 Jul-Aug;210(4):227-33.)
***RT delayed median 23 weeks
***5-year OS: medulloblastoma 57%, ependymoma 62%, malignant glioma 36%, ST PNET 30%
***Conclusion: Well tolerated and efficacious. Based on this, HIT 91 developed

*'''CCG 921''' (1986-1992)
**Randomized. 427 children &lt;21 years, with medulloblastoma, pineoblastoma, ependymoblastoma, central neuroblastoma, PNET, or malignant ependymoma, with unfavorable features. For ST-PNET required M+ staging. Children age &gt;1.5 years (n=328) received post-op CSI with Arm A) vincristine, lomustine, prednisone vs. Arm B) ''8-in-1'' (cisplatin, procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone, hydroxyurea, cytarabine). RT: age &gt;3 received CSI 36 Gy, boost to 50.4-54 Gy spine mets and 54 Gy primary brain site; age &lt;3 received CSI 23.4 Gy with boost to 45 Gy. Children age &lt;1.5 years (n=99) were not randomized and received only Arm B
**'''Infants failures; 2005''' PMID 16007595 -- &quot;Patterns of treatment failure in infants with primitive neuroectodermal tumors who were treated on CCG-921: a phase III combined modality study.&quot; (Hong TS, Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Oct 15;45(5):676-82.)
***Infant (&lt;1.5 years) subset of 65 patients (19 supratentorial, 46 posterior fossa.)
***Outcome: 5-year relapse rate M0 64% vs. M+ 71%. ST-PNET subset M0 64% vs. M+ 100%. Relapses within 2 years
***Conclusion: despite aggresive chemo, infents have high rates of treatment failure
**'''Older kids failures; 2004''' PMID 15337557 -- &quot;Patterns of failure in supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors treated in Children's Cancer Group Study 921, a phase III combined modality study.&quot; (Hong TS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Sep 1;60(1):204-13.)
***ST-PNET subset of 44 patients, age &gt;1.5 years. Compared to medulloblastoma treated on same protocol
***Outcome: 3-year PFS M0 53% vs. M+ 14% (SS); 5-year relapse rate 47% vs. 71%. Worse relapse rate compared to medulloblastoma: M0 47% vs. 29%, M+ 71% vs. 48%
***Pattern of failure: M0 11% in spine; M+ 43% in spine
***Time-course: 80% within 2 years
***Conclusion: High rate of failure, M+ patients doing particularly poorly
**'''3-years; 1995''' PMID 7602359 -- &quot;Prognostic factors and treatment results for supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors in children using radiation and chemotherapy: a Childrens Cancer Group randomized trial.&quot; (Cohen BH, J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jul;13(7):1687-96.)
***ST-PNET subset of 55 patients, age &gt;1.5 years. 
***Outcome: 3-year OS 57%, PFS 45%; pineal PNET better at 73% and 61% (SS); stage M0 PFS 50% vs. M+ 0%. No difference between chemo arms
***Toxicity: 8-in-1 arm worse
***Conclusion: No difference between chemo arms; M0 and pineal site better outcome
**'''Infants; 1994''' PMID 8040673 &amp;mdash; &quot;Survival of infants with primitive neuroectodermal tumors or malignant ependymomas of the CNS treated with eight drugs in 1 day: a report from the Childrens Cancer Group.&quot; (Geyer JR et al. J Clin Oncol. 1994 Aug;12(8):1607-15.)
***Infant (&lt;1.5 year) subset of 82 children (46 posterior fossa, 15 ependymoma, 11 nonpineal ST-PNET, 8 pineoblastoma, 2 ATRT. Received Arm B only (8-in-1), RT omitted in most cases
***3-year PFS: ST PNET 55% vs. medullo 22% vs. ependymoma 22% vs. pineoblastoma 0%. Median time-to-progression 6 months
***Conclusion: OS is poor, a subset remained disease-free with chemo only
***Comment: Results inferior compared to Baby POG, probably due to less intensive chemo, but ~20% long-term survivors with chemo only

*'''Baby POG I''' (1986-90)
**Prospective. 198 children &lt; 3 yrs (132 &lt; 2 yrs, 66 age 2-3 yrs), bx proven malignant brain tumors (low-grade astro excluded), treated with maximal surgery, postop chemo (CTX/VCR followed by cis/etopo) for 2 yrs (if age &lt; 2 at dx) or 1 yr (age 2-3) or until disease progression, followed by RT. 
**Histologies: medulloblastoma 31%, ependymoma 24%, PNET 18%, malignant glioma 9%, brain-stem glioma 7%, other 9%. 27% M+.  GTR in 38% of cases.
**RT for medullo, PNETs, anaplastic ependymoma, or subarachnoid seeding CSI 35.2 Gy + boost to primary to 54 Gy. RT for ependymoma, gliomas local to 54 Gy. If no residual disease after chemo, reduced RT to CSI 24 Gy and primary site 50 Gy. Infants &lt;2 years 90% of dose 
**'''1993''' PMID 8388548 -- &quot;Postoperative chemotherapy and delayed radiation in children less than three years of age with malignant brain tumors.&quot;  (Duffner et al., N Engl J Med.  1993; 328(24):1725-31)
***Response rate: best in medulloblastoma, glioma, ependymoma. Poor/no response in brain-stem gliomas and embryonal tumors
***CR to chemo PFS comparable those with GTR PFS
***Conclusion: Chemo effective in infancy. If GTF, chemo alone provided excellent control. No clinically important neurotoxicity. However, cannot recommend for embryonal tumors
**'''10-years, 1999''' PMID 11554387 &amp;mdash; &quot;The treatment of malignant brain tumors in infants and very young children: an update of the Pediatric Oncology Group experience.&quot; (Duffner PK et al. Neuro-oncol. 1999 Apr;1(2):152-61.)
***ST PNET (17 children): 5-year OS 27%. Failures early
***3-year survival: GTR 100% vs. STR 11%
***Conclusion: Some children may have prolonged survival</text>

==Epidemiology==
*5-10% of pediatric brain tumors
*Primarily in infants and children &lt;5 years
*Approximately 200 pediatric cases per year in USA

==Location==
*Glial tumors that arise from ependymal lining of the ventricular system 
*May occur anywhere in the ventricular system or spinal canal
*90% are in the brain
**1/3 supratentorial
**2/3 infratentorial, many arising from the 4th ventricle
**Up to 50% may infiltrate into the brainstem
*10% in the spine
**Myxopapillary ependymomas are found almost exclusively in the conus and filum terminale and are the most common spinal tumors in this location.
*Location differs with age:
**In young children: 90% intracranial, typically roof of 4th ventricle
**In adolescents/adults: 75% spinal canal


==Patterns of spread==
*Spread is primarily local
**In 50% of pts with posterior fossa tumors, a &quot;tongue&quot; of tumor may extend through the foramen magnum well into the cervical region
*Risk of leptomeningeal seeding is 5-10%


==Presentation==
*Since majority occur in 4th ventricle, symptoms are related to obstruction and subsequently increased intracranial pressure
*In spinal ependymomas, presentation is typically with sensory deficits (compared with astrocytomas, which tend to present with pain and motor symptoms)


==Workup==
*MRI of brain and spine: typically well-circumscribed, with displacement rather than invasion of brain parenchyma
*CSF cytology


==Pathology==
*Myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO grade I)
*Subependymoma (WHO grade I)
*Ependymoma (WHO grade II)
**Cellular
**Papillary
**Clear cell
**Tanycytic
*Anaplastic ependymoma (WHO grade III)


==Treatment Overview==
*No randomized studies
*Surgery is primary management
*Adjuvant RT is considered standard of care, although highly selected series report good outcomes with surgery alone
*Because recurrences tend to be local, RT is typically GTV plus 1-1.5 cm margin (per Perez, 4th edition)
*5-year OS 50-65%, PFS 25-45%
*Recurrences typically local; median time to failure 1-2 years. About 20% isolated distant recurrences


===Surgery===
*Extent of surgery most important predictor of outcome
**5-year OS with GTR: 70-80%
**5-year OS with STR: 25-45%
*Gross total resection (GTR) achievable depending on location, overall 30-50%:
**Supratentorial lesions: GTR ~80% 
**Infratentorial lesions: GTR &quot;lower&quot; rate (per Perez, 4th edition), BNI rate 70%
**Spinal lesions: GTR close to 100%


*'''Barrow Neurological Institute; 2005''' (1983-2002) PMID 15871504 -- &quot;Is gross-total resection sufficient treatment for posterior fossa ependymomas?&quot; (Rogers L, J Neurosurg. 2005 Apr;102(4):629-36.)
**Retrospective. Posterior fossas ependymomas, no subependymomas or CNS dissemination. GTR in 71%. RT in 13/32 GTR and 12/13 STR. RT fields CSI + boost (n=6), rest posterior fossa or localized fields. Median F/U 5.5 years
**Local control: Median LC: GTR alone 6.6 years vs. GTR+RT not yet reached; 10-year LC: GTR alone 50% vs. GTR+RT 100% (SS) vs. STR+RT 36% (SS), GTR alone comparable to STR+RT
**10-year OS: GTR alone 67% vs. GTR+RT 83% vs. STR+RT 43% (all NS)
**Conclusion: Adjuvant RT significantly improves control after GTR

*'''BI Medical Center, NYC; 1998''' PMID 9755311 -- &quot;Treatment of intracranial ependymoma by surgery alone.&quot; (Hukin J, Pediatr Neurosurg. 1998 Jul;29(1):40-5.)
**Prospective. 10 patients. Children &gt;3 years, s/p GTR 
**Outcome: 7 free of disease, 3 recurred (2 salvaged with surgery and RT). No deaths. Overall median PFS 4 years, and OS 4.2 years
**Conclusion: Deferral of RT after GTR of supratentorial ependymoma safe; recurrence salvageable


===Radiation===
'''''Role of post-operative RT:'''''
*Historically, ependymoma was believed to disseminate throughout the neuraxis, and CSI became the standard management approach
*However, more recent retrospective studies have shown that failure is primarily local in &gt;90%
*Benefit for post-operative RT is based on retrospective studies. 5-yr EFS 45% vs 0% and 51-70% vs 13% PFS.


'''''Dose response:'''''
&lt;br&gt;Evidence of a dose response above 45-50 Gy.

'''''RT volume:'''''
&lt;br&gt;No evidence of need for extended-field or craniospinal radiation.
&lt;Br&gt;CTV margin around resection cavity is generally 1 cm.

'''''Hyperfractionation:'''''
&lt;br&gt;In one study (POG 9132), HF RT produced better event-free survival for pts with incomplete resection. Dose was 69.6 Gy at 1.2 Gy BID.

==Subependymoma==
*Uncommon variant of ependymal tumors
*Histologically clusters of ependymal cells in an astrocyte-based matrix
*Clinically slow growing, with extremely low [[w:Ki-67_(Biology)|Ki-67]]
*Many discovered incidentally at autopsy
*Clinically symptomatic tumors present with CSF obstruction
*Gross total resection alone frequently leads to cure, but perioperative mortality can be high
*Role of adjuvant RT is not clear


==Anaplastic Ependymoma==
*'''HIT-SKK87 and HIT-SKK92''' (1987-1992, 1992-1997) 
**''HIT-SKK87'': Low-risk (complete resection, M0) and age &lt;2.5 received maintenance chemo only until RT at 3 years or progression. High-risk (subtotal resction, M+) and age 2.5-3 induction chemo / maintence chemo until RT at 3 years or progression
**''HIT-SKK92'': Post-op chemo x3 cycles first, then if CR no RT. If PR and &lt;18 months, then more chemo, if PR and &gt;18 months, then RT.  
**RT given as CSI 35.2/22 Gy + 20/10 Gy boost; if no residual disease, reduced to CSI 24 Gy + PF boost to 55 Gy
**'''2005''' PMID 16300848 -- &quot;Role of radiotherapy in anaplastic ependymoma in children under age of 3 years: results of the prospective German brain tumor trials HIT-SKK 87 and 92.&quot; (Timmermann B, Radiother Oncol. 2005 Dec;77(3):278-85.)
***Total 34 children enrolled. No RT given in 13 children, preventive RT in 9, salvage RT in 12 
***3-year outcomes: PFS 27%, OS 56%. Positive predictive factors: higher age, M0, GTR, RT. If no RT, only 3/13 survived
**Conclusion: Delaying RT jeopardized survival. Predominant failure primary tumor site; RT of neuraxis should be omitted in localized disease


==Spine Ependymoma==
*Rare tumors
*Gross total resection (~50%) leads to long-term control in &gt;90%
*Subtotal resection can recur in 50-70% without adjuvant therapy; with adjuvant RT local control 60-100%
*RT dose seems to show a threshold effect, with worse control &lt;45 Gy. However, radiation myelopathy becomes concerning &gt;55 Gy, and with pediatric patients possibly as low as 40 Gy
*Field size is unclear, but commonly is +/- 2 vertebral bodies. In sacrum, need to cover nerve roots, so inferior edge at S4/S5 and lateral edges to SI joints


*'''Kaiser Permanente; 2007''' (USA) PMID 17689025 -- &quot;Outcomes in treatment for intradural spinal cord ependymomas.&quot; (Volpp PB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Nov 15;69(4):1199-204. Epub 2007 Aug 6.)
**Retrospective. 23 patients (17 surgery alone, 5 surgery + RT, surgery + RT + chemo). Mean RT dose 45 Gy
**Outcome: 9-year OS 64%, LC 96%
**Recurrences: surgery alone:  12% recurred (1/17 locally, 1/17 distally). CMT 33% recurrence (both out-of-field)
**Conclusion: En block total resection primary treatment, RT reserved for unfavorable characteristics (residual tumor, anaplastic features, piecemeal resection)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The supine is a verbal noun. In ordinary verbs it is formed by adding -tum to the present stem, with the modification of e to i in the second conjugation (mone- &gt; moni-)

When a  supine is translated to  English, the suffix -tum turns into -tion. Here are some examples.

    sedeo	I sit	sessum	session
    informo	I inform	informatum	information
    traho	I pull	tractum	traction
    moveo	I move	motum	motion
    dico	I speak	dictum	diction


There are lots of words in Latin that end in -um; the supine is just one of them.

MAY TRE YA

OM TRE YA OM

YA OM MAY YA

HUM

OM YA HA HUM

Buddhism as a form
moves from realization to crystallization

Diamond teachings and other hardening's are the
inevitable outcome

In Tantra developments a concentrated relationship with an
idealized Guru, Christ or Prophet should
exist with a mature understanding of the fiction our
mind creates.

The power and inspiration is real
The source comes from our own creation

This fundamental difference between
external reality and projected fantasy
may lead to obsessive inclination and manipulation

If you can click your fingers and your deity
is gone, then you are awake. Otherwise you are
trapped by a benign demon of your creation.

In Buddhism, Truth is seen as personal and therefore ranges from belief in many gods to One God through to agnosticism and atheism. God is not a central issue in Dharma (Buddhist doctrine) being outside of genuine independent experience or comprehension. Of greater concern is one's actual knowable (and redeemable) situation. In other words how to improve the current experience for oneself and others without recourse to the fantasy of future lives, heavens, purelands or other escapist delusions for the spiritually fragile. 

Spiritual faculties are discriminative
without labels of personal preference
Real perceptions express the positive
in their inherent nature

As well as the obvious recognizable effects
of the enlightened there is also the hidden or invisible legacy:

1. Improved and new behaviour:

a. social cohesion

b. psychological health

c. dispersion of negative into appropriate channels

2. New thoughts and ways of thinking

a. encouragement of learning

b. improvement of human aspiration and potential

c. development of deeper understanding on all levels

3. Collection, concentration and dispersal of virtue

a. the store of goodness is attracted and accumulated

b. personal contact disperses the quality throughout

c. the sum total of goodness is increased

== Jguk activities ==

I have removed the &quot;Help&quot; section from the sidebar temporarily whilst it is tidied up so as to be useful.

I have also removed the &quot;Random module&quot; function as it doesn't really work for a wikibook. If we could make it direct to something at random that doesn't have a slash in it, then I'd support its return, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 10:01, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:I agree that it would be nice to point at a random Wikibook, not just a random Wikibook module.  I left it in earlier due to a suggestion on Staff Lounge that perhaps it shouldn't be removed.  Thanks, Jguk, for '''being bold''' on this issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:46, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

I have been bold and added a new [[Wikistudy]] and [[Wikiprofessional]] section to the Sidebar. If you wish to discuss this, please do so on the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]]. Many thanks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

== Adding Cookbook ==

Should the [[Cookbook]] not go in the navigation box? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:28, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
:This is an interesting idea, as I believe the Cookbook is becoming more and more like a sister project (such as Wikijunior and Wikiversity have been) than simply another Wikibook.  Still, this is the slippery slope that I want to avoid, as it doesn't seem reasonable to have every (even the &quot;best&quot;) Wikibook on the sidebar.  How much is too much?
:I would also strongly recommend bringing this up instead in the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] if you really feel that this book belongs here, to try and get some other supporters of the idea to come forth and at least bring up valid points in support of adding the Cookbook or not. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:38, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiversity removed ==

...on request of the wikiversitans. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:03, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== How to add &quot;Create a Book&quot; menu in SideBar ==
I added the collections extension to my mediawiki, and I get the &quot;PDF version&quot; link in the toolbox sidebar, but I am not getting the &quot;Create a Book&quot; menu.  What do I need to do to get this?

Thanks!

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: addtion → addition using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">While the true chords provided by harmonica is very limited, a player can play ''any'' chords as an '''arpeggio'''; that is to play the notes of the chord one after another. That being said, combine with the fact that some of the notes are close together and at the same direction already, allow one to play chords and rhytmn easily.

For example, On a C chromatic, in addition to the native C major chord and D-minor-7th chord: 
*G Major chord: blowing the hole 3, then draw on 4 and 5.
*F major chord: drawing on hole 2 and 3, then blow on 4. F major-7th chord can thus be construct with the addition of blowing hole 5 too.

However, some musicians, especially blues musicians, merely &quot;suggest&quot; the chord. For example, even in second position on a blues harp, there's no dominant-major (V) chords available (in the case of a C harp, the D major chord). So what they did are the following:
*An octave on 1-4 draw to suggest V-chord
*A 4-5 draw  (D-F) to suggest a maj7 chord rooted on the V.
Some will also do that for other chords even if it's available... For example, for G major chord on C diatonic, play only B-D (draw hole 3 and 4)

In terms of playing as a rhythm section, one approximate the chord by playing the notes of the chord in succession: for example, on a chromatic, when playing a G maj7th, one can go like this:

  /   /-----/    /   /-----/
 3+ (4-5) (5-6) 3+ (4-5) (5-6)

Also, even with arpeggio, and have access to all the notes of the chords, a blues/jazz musician may not even play all notes of the rhytmn. For example, a standrad 12-Bar blues have the following:

 I7  / I7  / I7 / I7   /
 IV7 / IV7 / I7 / I7   /
 V7  / IV7 / I7 / I7-V7/

May be played like this:
 2  3  4  3  / 2  3  4  3  /  2  3  4  3  / 2  3  4  3  /
 1+ 2+ 3+ 2+ / 1+ 2+ 3+ 2+ /  2  3  4  3  / 2  3  4  3  /
 1  2' 3&quot; 2' / 1+ 2+ 3+ 2+ /  2  3  4  3  / 2  3  2' 1  /

Note that this use a normal major chord to simulate a seventh chord.

----

== Proposition ==

This page whilst fulfilling a useful and required role is also responsible for some decisions which are stifling creativity. I would therefore suggest that it becomes the object of a wiki research project to ensure creativity and reviewers are suitably encouraged and accomodated [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 16:13, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: Users of this site are continuously trying to make it better. It would be more helpful if you could give some suggestions for new policies. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Templates on this page ==

Both the VfD and speedy deletion pages appear on this page, which causes the page itself to be listed as VfD. Is there a way to include the templates without this happening? Should we just copy and paste the contents instead of including the templates? [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:08, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I added these templates yesterday because it helps newbies understand what's going on with the templates.  In answer to question on surpressing the categories, no, there is no way, and the demonstration of the candidates for speedy deletion template requires the use of the template because of the |reason thing.  But it's not a big problem, they've done it on Wikipedia for a long time and I thought it wouldn't hurt us here.  If you'll notice, I mentioned on the categories pages that neither of these are actually being considered for deletion- as I hope any admin would know anyway.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 20:01, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Hmm, it still seems a little sloppy. Why can't we just copy and paste the contents instead of actually using the templates themselves? (Also, remember it's just HTML generated in the end, the |reason thing is a red herring-- perhaps you don't know what I'm getting at?) The only disadvantage of copy and paste (which would *look* exactly the same as it does now) would be that if one changes, the other will need to change too. This seems far less of a problem than having the page actually be listed for deletion. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:22, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::Fixed. The categories will still contain the templates, but there's no reasonable way around this - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Images by [[User:Siegfried Petry]] ==

* All images by [[User:Siegfried Petry]] that can be converted to HTML and TeX. There appear to be hundreds of them, so it will be a long time before these can be deleted. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 21:36, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)
** Not all of them can, but many could. One can look for them here: [[Special:Contributions/Siegfried_Petry]] -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 22:31, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== [[Special:Lonelypages|Orphaned pages]] ==

There are more than 500 orphaned pages, and many of them should be deleted. Some are not in English, so I can't judge. I deleted all pages in French among them. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 14:49, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

'''Keep, keep keeeeep! Your list is bogus!''' I see 3 copies of the perfectly-good [[Cookbook:Egg_Roll|Egg_Roll]] recipe in that list. Something is '''not''' right about that list. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:20, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I spotted something that appears 5 times, all identical. Soppose there are 6 copies in the database, 5 of which are counted as orphans. So you delete 5... but in doing so, wipe out the copy with the most recent history. Maybe you even corrupt the database worse than it is already. As for the egg roll, that may be partly my doing, caused by the wiki telling me that the page is empty when I save it for the first time. So of course I hit the back button and try again, figuring that some database connection somewhere got dropped the first time. So that's at least 2 serious bugs right there, falsly (?) reporting that a fresh module has no data and allowing the addition of multiple modules with the same name. It would be very unwise to touch this mess without first investigating what is going wrong with the wiki database and other code. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:46, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Why is this even listed here? It's not a specific page or book to be deleted.
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:38, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: Read what Yann said. &quot;many of them should be deleted&quot;. Some of them may be speedy deletes, which needs to be brought to immediate attention. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:08, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Candidates for speedy deletion ==

Sorry, I'm confused about one thing.. should candidates for speedy deletion be listed on this page or is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Delete|reason..}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; enough? - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 04:20, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

:It's always helpful to list it on this page too, so there can be a discussion (if neccessary). Also, this page is read more than the page that lists all pages with the Delete template. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:05, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

::I've changed policy to remove this requirement. There's no need to list speedies on this page, since the whole point of them is for deletions which don't require a vote. Should an admin be uncertain as to whether or not to delete a speedy, they should personally add it to the VfD list, and change the 'delete' template inclusion to a 'vfd' one. It's probably wiser to use a speedy deletion tag even if the page doesn't break policy, but that you suspect it would be unilaterally voted to be deleted. An admin can easily promote it to a full VfD if they think you're wrong. This should save a lot of time. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Transwiki and votes ==

I'm a bit confused on the &quot;Pages to be transwikied.&quot; I don't see anybody voting on them? And neither any one of them seems to be signed? There is a lot of pages listed under the different languages, are there no administrators working on them? Or are there just a lot of books written in other languages(?) It's hard to get an idear on how long the different books has been listed there, because they are not signed. [[User:RoceKiller|RoceKiller]] 22:43, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

:That's just an open note that tells users that these articles are written in other languages, and thus must be moved out of the English wikibooks and into the ones for the approprate languages, as per the transwiki policy set out on meta (I think it's at [[m:Transwiki]]).  The reason that little work has been done is that we are patiently waiting for MediaWiki 1.5 where new features will make the transwiki process will be largely painless (currently it's a cut-and-paste job, and legal restrictions make moving page histories more difficult to deal with).  If you want to do transwiki, you are of course more than welcome. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 01:49, 29 May 2005 (UTC)

::There's no real need to debate these for any length of time.  Stuff that isn't in English should be moved to the appropriate place, and that list is just a simple way to keep track of which ones need to be moved where. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:11, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::Sorry to beat a dead horse, but the transwiki list is starting to be a nuisance. :) I'm not familiar enough with other languages and other languages' Wikis to help, so I can only bug people to ask if there is any progress in this area. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 7 July 2005 06:46 (UTC)

: These entries seem to be beyond the scope of VfD, so I've moved them all to [[Wikibooks:Pages to be transwikied]], and linked from here. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== Deletion of images ==

I've listed a few images for speedy deletion. The actual image has been removed form the image page (this is the big step, because it's not undoable), but the image page has remained intact. So, does the image page get deleted eventually, or does it remain forever? If they are never deleted, then I'll simpy remove them from the speedy deletion list. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 05:03, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: After watching the same images for a few days, I've come to the conclusion that it does no harm. One, any image uploads in the future with the same name will simply override whatever's inside there with no warning, so no big issue there.. (well there is, but still.) Two, if nothing is linked to it, it becomes orphaned and nobody but us ghosts will know of it. 

: Given the lack of response to this query, I'll housekeep this next week (after you have a chance to read this), to keep the Talk Page manageable. - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 7 July 2005 06:49 (UTC)

== better Vfding system ==

I think now that Wikibooks is getting bigger we need a proper Vfd system like Wikipedia with subpages and all. As it is the archive is going to become unmanagable. Of course I know that means more work is required with Vfd bots and all, but the benefits would surely outweigh the difficulties. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:50, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

*I'm not familiar with Wikipedia's process for this, but I'll check it out. In the meantime, I've made a few changes to the page that should hopefully speed things up while minimizing the length of the VfD page. The archive page is currently still as before, but I like the idea of having separate pages for each controversial page. This way it could serve as a complete history for why the page exists or not (i.e. roll up VfD and VfU into the same page). The downside is that it's gonna require a lot more maintenence to keep several pages where before there was only one. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:10, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

*True, but soon entire '''books''' will be put up for deletion and not just individual modules.  We must have clear [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions|naming conventions]] before we can deal with splitting up VFD into a separate CFD, RFD, IFD, etc. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 19:06, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
**Ah, hm, now that's a problem. Perhaps if you nominate the core of a Wikibook that counts as deletion for the rest of it as well, whereas if you nominate a page you only delete it and its subpages? Hm. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:56, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
***That makes sense to me. When we delete just a module, we sometimes also delete the images too. I suppose the only exception to the &quot;recursive delete&quot; plan would be if multiple books link to, say, an image that actually is valid. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:51, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

== Deprecation of voting ==

Moved from [[User talk:Uncle G]] - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:19, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

Any particular reason you felt the need to revert my attempt to tidy up this section?

Rather than rolling back your edit in an adversarial fashion, I shall instead justify my edit with a brief summary of the way in which VfD sections are normally formatted, to preserve the clarity of this somewhat contentious process. This will soon become part of [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] to prevent edit wars, and minimize the time it takes for admins to sort all this nonsense out (they don't get paid for this y'know), unless you have a better idea. 

The first conceptual subsection should indicate the reason why the page is contentious enough to warrant a VfD, signed by the user who believes it to be the case. Discussions on this reasoning should be carried out in this subsection using the standard talk-page paradigm (i.e. signed, indentated paragraphs). Signing comments is important for context, and so that users don't have to trawl thru the edit history to work out who said what. This section is arguably most important, since, at any time, an admin may decide that the page obviously falls within the criteria for speedy deletion, and just delete it without continuing the vote. This is largely to prevent redundant voting on pages that just say &quot;sdlsdkjfsldk&quot; or similar nonsense.

The second conceptual subsection should be used for voting. This can go on in parallel with the discussion in the first subsection. Only registered Wikibooks users are eligable to vote. To clearly separate actual votes from mere discussion, these should be bullet-pointed. For clarity, the first word or word-phrase should represent that user's vote, and should be emboldened, so that when the voting process ends, an administrator can quickly count up the votes. If the emboldened vote is at the end of the paragraph, they make get overlooked. Usually this vote is one of either &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;Keep&quot; optionally followed by a justification, but other alternatives have been allowed such as &quot;Move&quot; or &quot;Transwiki&quot; (interpreted as &quot;Move/Transwiki and delete from original location), with a more appropriate location suggested. Each vote must be signed or it will not be counted. It is customary for other users to use the 'indented bullet' format to comment on another user's vote, or perhaps elaborate on their own. Again, these comments should be signed.

The third conceptual subsection is reserved for when a decision has been made by an admin. They will append a non-bullet-pointed paragraph to indicate the resolution of the process. This is usually something like &quot;Deleted&quot;, &quot;Kept&quot;, &quot;Moved&quot;, possibly emboldened for clarity, optionally followed by a reasoning for their subsequent actions, and signed.

The rest of the process is already documented in [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]].

Comments? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:48, 2 August 2005 (UTC)
*You're question is the wrong question.  The ''right'' question is why ''you'' felt the need to alter the words of other people's comments, and felt that what you were doing (which involved making grammatical nonsense of a sentence) was in fact &quot;tidying up&quot; at all.  It wasn't &quot;tidying up&quot;.  It was altering comments to support a bad idea.&lt;p&gt;The &quot;way in which VFD sections are normally formatted&quot; is simple mimicry of the way that Wikipedia does it, and on Wikipedia what you are proposing is widely seen to be ''exactly wrong'' and a terribly bad idea.  (There are a couple of pages on Meta dealing with the wrongness of focussing simply on votes, too.)  To repeat an oft-said mantra from Wikipedia VFD: '''It's not about the votes.'''  Deletion discussions are ''discussions'', to determine a consensus.  The discussions are not &quot;mere&quot;, as you term them.  They are the most important parts. Emphasizing the votes at the expense of the rationales is exactly wrong.  My votes go after my rationales for that very reason, and I encourage other editors to put the rationales first, and administrators to ''read the rationales''.  This is exactly the reverse of the direction that you are pushing for, which encourages administrators to not read the discussions at all and to simply count boldfaced words instead.&lt;p&gt;If you want to deal with sockpuppets, then don't try to make Wikibooks into a democracy.  Mimic Wikipedia some more, instead.  On Wikipedia, administrators have the leeway to ''optionally'' discount votes.  The [[Wikipedia:WP:GVFD|Guide to VFD]] states outright that &quot;administrators will discount any obviously bad faith contributions to the discussion when closing the discussion and making a decision. In contrast, a user who makes a well-argued case based upon the deletion policy and in a civil manner may well sway the discussion despite being anonymous.&quot; [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 00:51:31, 2005-08-03 (UTC)

Okay. I just realised my post was somewhat self-contradictary...

# The first conceptual subsection...This section is arguably most important...
# The second conceptual subsection...separate actual votes from mere discussion...

...but this is a result of iterative editing while I actually re-think my position on the fly. Pretend I didn't use the word 'mere'. To clarify, I strongly believe the discussion part to be more important than the voting, so perhaps we're in agreement after all. Hopefully discussions will serve to create better policy which could ultimately deprecate the whole voting concept. I'd already alluded to this in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]], and I already made changes to [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] to make it clearer when things can be deleted without a vote. I'm thinking of starting a new VfD for the page [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] itself. Perhaps it should be renamed [[Wikibooks:Requests for policy clarification]]. Do we really need voting at all? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:20, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

: In fact I just looked up [[w:Wikipedia:Sock puppet]], a concept which had occurred to me already. I just didn't realise there was a common word-phrase for it. This would tend to imply that voting is fundamentally flawed with the current MediaWiki software, so perhaps it should be deprecated completely. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:40, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - ''Short version:'' VfD useful even if votes not considered in a 50% + 1 context (which they should not be). ''Long version:'' In the collectives that I have worked in, there is often a call for a straw poll, which is done before extensive discussion on a particular matter. This is the quick way to determine consensus, and the VfD could be seen in this light. On the other hand, a collective meeting is synchronous and wikibooks is (very) asynchronous and discussion occurs anyway. I do believe that if there is a clear consensus via votes to delete/keep, that should be sufficient. If there is a split, examining the discussion is required. A major problem of consensus decision-making is that it tends to favor the status quo, and in a place like wiki(books|pedia|etc) where there is tons of unregulated input, this can get messy since the status quo is whatever random shit somebody made into a module. Given that, I believe that the admins should have some amount of discretion in deletions even when there is not a clear consensus (as in wikipedia, by examining the quality of viewpoints in the discussion). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:42, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''- I think this provides a very useful purpose, and is a &quot;gut check&quot; to see if a book really should be removed or kept.  Notable successes include [[How To Build A Pykrete Bong]] and [[Making an Island]], where they were overwhelmingly confirmed as being a part of Wikibooks.  [[21 Century Math]] was a good example of something that got deleted that really never should have been here either.  The long and short of it is that perhaps a discussion about the distinction between the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}} tag and the {{VfD}} tag&lt;/nowiki&gt; could be discussed, and a stronger policy distinction should take place.  Perhaps the delete tag should be used more often?  Other tags could also be implemented that would take care of some issues, or perhaps into seperate discussion, such as a particular module with a copyright violation (no need for a VfD... just delete the page history of the violating content), NPOV criticism (put into a list of books that need to be revised... or simply deleted but after nobody is willing to do the revision), and Wikipedia fork violation (where the discussion should take place ''within'' the Wikibook discussion page itself before thrown onto the VfD page).  A larger variety of content objection tags might help clean up some of the mess. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:08, 3 August 2005 (UTC)
**Wikibooks actually ''has'' a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Template:cleanup|cleanup]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag already.  It is possibly underused because ''it isn't documented anywhere'', and because it gives no opportunity for an editor to be specific.  I'll be bold and document it for you.  Imitating the Wikinews cleanup tag, instead of the Wikipedia one, is also a good idea.  That way, you won't ''need'' a &quot;larger variety of tags&quot;.  I'll be bold and do that for you, too. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 22:07:06, 2005-08-03 (UTC)
*Several points:
**Less should be read into the discussions that have very recently sprung up on Wikipedia than you are reading.  The discussions are in fact ''old'' ones, that have been discussed and re-discussed many times.  They are simply being recycled on fresh discussion pages by Wikipedia editors who have patently not read [[w:Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion]] and its (copious) archives.  They have resulted from a Wikipedia editor actually deleting Wikipedia's deletion discussion area (a disruptive act for which xe has subsequently been roundly condemned), taking another Wikipedia editor's hyperbolic talk page comments involving disrupting Wikipedia to make a point at face value and actually enacting them  (which I don't believe was that latter editor's intention).
**To state something that is stated in Wikipedia VFD discussions (mainly when people come to it nominating things to be merged): ''Don't nominate something for deletion that you don't in fact want deleted.''  You don't actually ''want'' [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] deleted, so you shouldn't really have nominated it.  The correct place for a discussion of altering the way that this page works ''is'' its talk page, ''not'' here, and gradual discussion has indeed been happening there since July.  Don't follow the bad example of the aforementioned disruptive Wikipedia editor.
**This shouldn't be about being different to Wikipedia.  ''All'' of the WikiMedia projects have deletion discussion areas.  They have various names, but they are all similar in concept.  This is because the concept is the same across all of the projects.  Deletion is performed by administrators following, as best they can, official policy and consensus.  That doesn't change.
*I strongly suggest ''not'' having this discussion here, speedily closing this nomination where no deletion is actually desired, and instead simply continuing the discussions that have been ongoing on [[Wikibooks talk:Votes for deletion]]. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 22:07:06, 2005-08-03 (UTC)
**Personally, I'd be happy if the page did get deleted, since it is not lending itself to creating policy to prevent the same few arguments cropping up again and again. The reason I said it would more likely be moved is that it was my suspicion that other users would not want it deleted, so I have moved this section here. Problem is now, this page will most likely be ignored for the next 50 years. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:32, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

'''Keep''': The proposal for an alternative is a non-proposal. It is nonsense to talk about changing the existing system when: (1) no real alternative has been discussed yet, or even presented; and (2) the faults with the existing system aren't clear or spelled out. Comments like &quot;Do not add anything more to that section&quot; are not helpful: a discussion of a specific replacement needs to be carried out. I propose a new page gets created to talk about the alternative. After that discussion is had, then we should vote to do the replace or not. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:34, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

: Not quite. The obvious point is that since only admins can perform deletions, then admins merely need to execute deletion policy as decided by the community. Thus to get something deleted, the community should modify [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] to cover some sort of generalized case which includes the thing they want deleted. Why is the community so petrified to change policy?

: e.g. Instead of nominating, [[Neo]], just add a new bullet-pointed criterion to [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Speedy deletions]] such as:

:* Books about constructed languages

: After all, you're not actually objecting specifically to just [[Neo]], but '''any''' book with a similar scope. The current VfD page itself can just live in [[Wikibooks talk:Deletion policy]], which is conceptually what [[WB:VFD]] is discussing after all.

: [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:44, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

::I think the existing policy and system we have works well. I'll agree that it has its flaws, but I'm not going to pretend that there is a flawless system that we can use instead. With your suggestion this is what would likely happen: (1) someone wants a specific book deleted; (2) they infer a general rule that would include that book, but none of the books they want to keep; (3) the discussion on that new, general rule would turn into a debate effectively about keeping that one specific book or not. In order words, I don't think we'd ever think exactly about general rules; and it wouldn't be that different than what we're doing already. It's nice to have congress, but what they do needs to be checked by the supreme court. We can't just legislate deletion policies and leave it up to only admins to execute it.

::Perhaps what you'd like to see instead is more activity on the speedy deletion side? I.e., deletion of material that an admin can objectively determine does not fit the speedy criteria? Whatever the case, there is high value in having discussions about specific books: generally the truth comes out and minds change. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]]

:::Okay. Perhaps it's apathy, not fear. So perhaps I should take on the task of widening the criteria for speedies. I'll have a look through all past VfDs, summarize the reasoning behind each decision, and add it into policy. I just find VfDs extremely predictable, and thus a waste of time. I just wish someone else would help out to write these policies. Really, we want less of them, not more, and they need to be clear and simple, else they'll be ignored. I thought my recent changes to [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] were much clearer. Thinking about it, isn't [[WB:WIN]] conceptually similar to [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]. Maybe I should merge them? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:02, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

::::Done. See [[Wikibooks talk:Deletion policy#Policy merge]]. It also occurs to me that the most important policy docs should be those which cover the functions which only admins can perform (i.e. deletion, blocking, user renaming and page protecting). - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:03, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

== Delay policy from when a Wikibook is created to VfD ==

[[User:Withinfocus]] brought up a very valid point that I think has been completely overlooked so far in the past.  In particular, with the Harry Potter discussion, the discussion over the VfD status for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] was started by a malcontent trying to stir up trouble in the first place.  In this case [[User:Kappa]] has only two edits:  Placing the &lt;nowiki&gt;'''{{VfD}}'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag on the [[Harry Potter plots]] page and then the subsequent creation of the section for this Wikibook's VfD discussion.

In short, I consider the actions of this person to be tantamount to social vandalism and something that should be discouraged in the future.  If somebody does this in the future, the VfD discussion should simply be removed altogether (perhaped archived, but I think that is too kind) and the VfD tag removed from the Wikibook as well.  I'm not trying to set a specific number of edits that are necessary, but I do believe that a nomination for VfD status should come from a registered user who has at least some experience and time here on Wikibooks, specifically to avoid this situation in the future.

I also suggest that perhaps in the future we give a certain amount of time to a Wikibook from immunity from a VfD simply to give the authors a chance to try and put some content in or even reorganize the Wikibook.  Give these authors a good faith 1 month to get up to basic standards (including blatant violations like a copyright violation or forking from another project or even within Wikibooks).  Content in more established Wikibooks is free to be removed, but if you have a problem with the organization of the new Wikibook it should be done within that Wikibook, preferably on the talk pages of that Wikibook first.  If you are going nowhere with the organization, then it should be moved to a VfD discussion.

Blatant vandalism of course will never be tolerated and should be punished as usual.  A good faith effort to produce a new Wikibook, particularly by new users, should be given extra lattitude.

The Vote for Discussion page is a very powerful tool, and can be abused if not done properly.  In retrospect, this whole discussion about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] should never have happened in the first place, at least on the VfD pages.  It is also a lousy way to encourage new users to try and contribute to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:31, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

:I agree that there should be one month of immunity towards a VFD. The Muggles' Guide has been around less than a week and has already received heated debate over its structuring. There hasn't been enough time to even receive commentary on its specific structural attributes. A user came here to VFD it and left. That is unfair to persons like me who had actual intentions to do work before VFD was blasted on it. I have significant reluctance to work on the book since I now see it as having a chance at deletion. Book-writing motivation could be greatly increased if books could have a time of &quot;stewing&quot; where comments can be received before a VFD (i.e. please share your thoughts on structure at the Guide's main [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|talk page]]). -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 14:05, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

:This sounds like a good plan. I should note that a new user (one with even zero edits on a registered account) can always post a request for a more experienced user to put it up to VfD. Or, to encode it another way, requests for VfD from zero-edit users need to be seconded by a user with more useful edits first. There have been times that I simply removed a VfD tag because it was done by a vandal. I mean, think about that as a form of vandalism: you just put a VfD tag on there, and suddenly everyone is wasting time trying to defend it.

:We should also have standards for what counts as a VfD. If someone &quot;doesn't like&quot; the book then that would not be good enough. If someone can't even provide a cogent reason for why the book should be up for deletion that that would not be good enough either. We should keep in mind precedent, too: For example, there were good reasons to delete Getting a Girl, and I think any policy should secure the Cookbook as a valid wikibook. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:47, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

::This is mainly to &quot;codify&quot; for admins what should happen, and to give a '''heads-up''' about a possible vandal attack avenue that I wouldn't have anticipated.  If an admin wants to, they could take a discussion section and &quot;freeze it&quot; by throwing it into a template and then placing protection on the template, with a note that this discussion is &quot;frozen&quot; until the required time has elapsed.  Or even outright removal if necessary.  The idea that a VfD should be seconded is an outstanding idea.  I think any user names that have &quot;red letters&quot; (no user page) should also be suspect, but that can't always be depended on either.  I have seen some Ass Pus attackers put in a user page (although for what reason, I don't know other than to piss off somebody trying to clean up their c****).  Excuse me, I just dealt with one last night, and it seems to be more regular all of the time.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:16, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

:::Have we move-protected all the important pages now? I remember the page move attacks (e.g. renaming Staff lounge to Staff Toilet or something) were the most tedious to repair. On the VfD vandalism: someone put up the Vegan Cookbook for deletion, which I quickly removed... they kept trying to put it back up saying &quot;it really *is* up for deletion!&quot; but did not provide any valid reason for even deleting it. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 17:52, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

speaking as someone with about 4 edits to my credit here (though maybe 500 on 'pedia now),I shall put in my penneth. Pedia seem very eager to delete things at the drop of a hat. I expect they do have a valid problem with the numbers of articles to be processed, but I presume that is a lot less of a problem here. Presumably people must set up books just for the hell of it, and might realise that it is even more fun if they get a months grace. But even so, my instinct there and here is to give people a chance to do something before instantly zapping it. Requiring seconder(s) for a delete vote sounds good.[[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 20:05, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:I've updated [[WB:DP]] to state that only pages which have existed on the DB for more than one week may be added to VFD. If this should not work out, then we can increase the time to one month. Note this does not affect speedy deletions. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:46, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Buddhist Philosophy}}

[[Introduction to Philosophy/What is Buddhist Philosophy?|What is Buddhist Philosophy]] gives an introduction to some key points developed here. [[w:en:Buddhism|Buddhism]] will be explored from some of its less known attributes: 

* Its influence on medicine and healing. 
* Buddhist Cosmology. 
* The teachings of Buddhist rasayana. 
* The development of a secular religion.
* Non theistic ethics and morality  

=== History ===
Buddhism often traces its religious foundation to the life and inspiration of the Shakyamuni Buddha. Buddhism has been associated with peacefulness towards others, including animals (especially the monkey), and an emphasis on meditation. Many words originally largely associated with Buddhism are now part of Western usage, for example: Zen, karma, mantra, nirvana.

=== What Led to the Buddha's Enlightenment? ===
The semi-mythological nature of the Buddha's life is also reflected in many Sufi tales of princes who gave up their kingdoms to follow paths of spiritual unfolding, although these stories are much much later and as such were probably influenced by the Buddha story (for an important academic analysis of the Buddha story, see 'Suttas as History' by Jonathan Walters in ''History of Religion,'' University of Chicago). The Buddha was born to the ruler of a small kingdom in Nepal and led a sheltered life. After seeing the four signs, he resolved to leave his life of ease and find the cause of overcoming of dissatisfaction or dukkha. After study, ascetic and meditative practices, the Buddha developed an understanding or realization. The rest of his life was spent in transmitting this realization.

Buddha expressed his philosophy when he said: &quot;I teach only two things, O disciples, the fact of suffering and the possibility of escape from suffering.&quot;

Buddha inspired the famous &quot;Four Noble Truths&quot; and &quot;Eightfold Path,&quot; which allows people to achieve '''nirvana'''.  What is nirvana? Before this is answered, you must understand the concept of '''karma'''.  Buddhist Philosophy states that everything is subject to the law of karma.  Buddha taught that positive actions build up karma, and negative ones detract from it.  Buddhists try to achieve good karma, and free themselves from bad karma by living a morally sound life, and by following Buddhism.  Nirvana is the state of being free from mental defilements (klesha), which are chiefly hate, desire and ignorance; ignorance being the cause of all of them. With the cessation of kleshas, all forms of suffering cease, and a state of bliss and equanimity is attained. According to Buddhist philosophy, life is part of a cycle of suffering called Samsara.  If one achieves good karma, and follows the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, then this cycle will end, and rather than being subject to the law of karma, they will be free of it, and will live in a state of eternal happiness.

=== What Were the Four Signs? ===
The Buddha led a leisured and protected life within a royal palace and fathered a child. When he, against advice, left the palace, he encountered four signs of human suffering:

# An old person
# A sick person
# A dead person
# A wandering ascetic

Siddartha was affected by what he saw, and resolved to find out why there was suffering, the cause of the suffering, and how to end one's suffering.

The Sanskrit word &quot;karma&quot; literally means &quot;action&quot;. Hetu is the Sanskrit for &quot;intention&quot; and phala designates &quot;effect&quot;. Karma may be either &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; and both categories of actions have their respective effect.

=== What are the Four Noble Truths? ===

# Existence entails discomfort, or suffering. (dukkha) All worldly life is unsatisfactory and disjointed.
# The cause of this (dukkha) is attachment, craving or desire. (tanha)
# The cessation of dukkha (Nirodha) There is a way out of suffering, which is to eliminate attachment and desire.
# The way leading to the cessation of dukkha (Marga): The path that leads out of suffering is called the Noble Eightfold Path

Buddha taught that in order to achieve nirvana (Nirodha), man must free himself from his ego, and give up all desires.  Buddha claimed that by having so many desires (such as wanting pleasure, wealth, happiness, security, success, long life, etc.), man condemns himself to suffering, and will never escape the cycle of rebirths.

Buddhism believes that suffering is self-created.

''Four leading Western Buddhist teachers each explore the meaning of one of The Four Noble Truths for the contemporary audience.'' - [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/beliefs/fournobletruths.shtml]

=== What is The Eight Fold Path? ===

# '''Right View/Understanding'''
# '''Right Thoughts'''
# '''Right Speech''', abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, &amp; from idle chatter. (''Sutta Nipata'' 45.8)
# '''Right Action''', abstaining from taking life, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from unchastity. (''Sutta Nipata'' 45.8)
# '''Right Livelihood''', there is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood (''Sutta Nipata'' 45.8). Basically this means not selling guns, living creatures, poisons, and others which may harm any being.
# '''Right Effort'''
# '''Right Mindfulness'''
# '''Right Concentration''', meditation

=== What are the Three Jewels? ===
The crowning achievements of the Buddha were

# The Buddha ~ His lifetime of gaining wisdom, understanding and awakening
# The Teaching (Dharma) ~ The oral teachings and transmission 
# The Community (Sangha) ~ The group of awoken teachers or disciples of the Buddha

== The Thirty-One Realms (''Bhumi'' 31) ==

Buddhism knows about 31 types of realms, where beings lived. Human realm is one of the 31 realms, where human (''manussa bhumi'') is included in the happy realms (''sugati bhumi''). The realms are divided into four main divisions, which are
# The suffering realms (''apaya bhumi''), consists of the '''Hell''' (''niraya''), the ''asura'', the ''peta'', and animals. Beings are being reborn here because of their bad actions in their past lives.
# The happy realms (''sugati bhumi'') or the realms of sense (''kama bhumi''), which consists of the human realm and the six realms of gods (the meaning of 'god' should be distinguished with the meaning of 'God'). Beings are being reborn here as the result of their good deeds (mainly by practicing generosity, self-constraint/virtue, and meditation).
# The form realms, where beings who have successfully practiced meditation to the level of ''rupa-jhana'' are being reborn. 
# The formless realms, where beings who have successfully practiced meditation to the level of ''arupa-jhama'' are being reborn.

=== What are the Six Realms? ===

The six realms are the six possible states of existence for sentient beings. There is an immense variation in the beings of each realm, but these beings will all share certain characteristics. We re emerge in these states according to our  karma. The 'lower realms' is a term used to refer to the states of hell, hungry ghosts (pretas) and animals. These three states are severely restrictive in the ability of a sentient being trapped in them to attain liberation, and because of this their suffering in Samsara is prolonged. The most basic reason for refuge is to attain a dwelling  that avoids these realms. 

==== The Heavenly, or Deva Realm ====

These are the realms of existence inhabited by the devas ('shining ones'), and are marked by experiences of bliss and pleasure for long period of time. 

This is separated into two main states of existence - that of form and that of no-form. The deva realms are correlated to the eight jhanas/dhyanas, which are eight distinct meditative states. The first four of which are marked by an awareness of form -  such as the mediator's body, and the last four are entirely mental experiences, where sensory input to the material senses is no longer felt. 

Beings gain rebirth in these realms by a combination of right conduct and/or deep meditative experience during life. 

Beings in such a realm have immense lifespans, especially in the higher states, and their perception of time is similarly different to humans - with their perception of a 'day' sometimes thousands of human years. 

Being reborn in such a state is seen as being ultimately useless since it is temporary, and there is no apparent reason to work towards liberation from Samsara. When the karma of a sentient being living in such a state begins to run out, they usually have very little merit relating to pleasurable existences remaining in their mind-stream, and are usually born in one of the three lower realms. As they die, they become clearly aware of this, and such an experience is said to be worse than all the suffering that could be experienced in any of the other realms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Buddhist Philosophy}}

: A form of mind stilling and insight-building &quot;exercises&quot; normally associated with sitting but also noticeably and traditionally practiced in walking, standing, and lying positions, during tantric rituals and eventually in everyday activity (this is considered &quot;Mindfulness&quot;). 

Some techniques involve focusing on the breath as the object of meditation as in ''anapanasati'' (in and out-breath). ''Anapanasati'' is a form of ''Samatha'' meditation (calm abiding). This slows the mind's distracted nature, and allows a clearer awareness of phenomena, since they are apprehended without the mind's pre-conceptions getting in the way. The Samatha is learnt and applied by followers of other religions to deepen and augment their experience, especially in religions such as Hinduism. It is used for [[w:relaxation|relaxation]], stress reduction, psychological relief, and well being, and is increasingly encouraged for its psychological and physical healing potential.

Meditation techniques are often separated into two categories, 'Formless' and 'Concentrative'.  In concentrative meditation, the meditator attempts to focus his or her thoughts on a particular task, such as the contemplation of a particular object or the repetition of a series of sounds called a 'Mantra'.  In formless meditation, one does not simply let one's mind wander, but instead attempt to remain present in the moment without subjecting it to analytical scrutiny.

Another commonly used categorization of meditation techniques in Buddhism is ''[Vipassana][ http://www.vipassanahawaii.org/introtomindfulnessmeditation] [http://www.vipassanahawaii.org/conceptandreality]'' (insight meditation) and ''samatha'' (calm meditation). In every Buddhist meditation, there has to be two factors: concentration and wisdom. The difference between 'vipassana' and 'samatha' meditation is that in the former wisdom is the main factor while in the latter concentration is the main one. But it should be understood that these two factors must coexist in a meditation. What is meant by wisdom here is the understanding of the nature of the object. For example, when practicing ''anapanasati'' (awareness to the in-and out breath), fully knowing when the breath goes in and out (without interval) is concentration, while knowing whether it is gross or calm, long or short is the wisdom. 

One of the first written Buddhist meditation techniques appears in the Anapanasati Sutta.  This text, part of the Pali canon, describes a method that begins by using the breath to still bodily emotions and ultimately culminates in full realization.  Given the importance accorded to the contemplation of the breath in early Buddhist texts, the practice has become central to most schools of Buddhism.  Focusing on the breath as the object of meditation combines a little of both the concentrative and formless approaches to meditation.  One can remain closely aware of the breath, as in concentrative meditation, or simply use consciousness of the breath to restrain the mind when it starts to wander.

Some schools, however, teach other methods of concentrative meditation that either replace, or are used in combination with, contemplation of the breath.  Some teach students to fix their consciousness on an object, such as a flower or an image of the Buddha.  Other forms of Buddhist meditation involve directed mental activity, in which one actively ponders or analyzes certain Buddhist philosophical doctrines.  Still others involve visualization exercises thought to stimulate the movement of psychic energies within the body.

One of the most often emphasized aspects of Buddhist practice is the integration of the experience of meditation into our everyday consciousness.  To this end, some schools recommend meditating with the eyes open, and most include some form of walking meditation as part of their recommended practices.  Exact meditation techniques vary from school to school and are often hotly debated.  Yet all agree that meditation loses its value if the lessons and experiences of sitting are not integrated into our day to day lives.

It is important to note that the terms 'concentrate' and 'focus' are frequently used in English descriptions of meditation, but these can be highly misleading. The aim is not to have a tightly focussed mind holding on to a particular object, but to have a loose awareness of the object that doesn't meander away. External phenomena are not actively blocked out, but the mind unwaveringly holds gently to the object being meditated on. Meditation is not about entering another dimension or being out-of-control, meditation is about focussing all of our consciousness in one point, continuously. This is a form of a very great concentration, which when highly developed, have the power to burn the darkness and illusion of things, so that we come to see 'things as they really are'. To see 'things are they really are' is the main goal of Buddhism.


== Stages of Concentration ==

There are three stages of concentration (or commonly two, but here we will use three stages for completeness):
* ''Parikamma'' (introductory stage), when we start sitting to meditate, the mind is still gross, this is the introductory practice.
* ''Upacara'' (access concentration), when we are able to concentrate our mind to the object, for as long as we want, without any interval when our mind gets unconcentrated.
* ''Appana'' (deep concentration), or commonly known as ''Jhana''. This level is hard to describe, because ''Jhana'' is something beyond the world of sense (''kamavacara-bhumi''). The difference between the stage of ''appana'' and that of ''upacara'' is that the ''upacara'' stage is weak. It can easily be destroyed by internal or external distractions (for example: sound). But ''appana'' stage is strong. The ''upacara'' stage is like a baby learning to walk, but ''appana'' is like an adult who can walk steadily.

: Most of the 9 early schools of Buddhism have been lost. Therevada, the tradition of 'The Elders' is one surviving model. Schools such as Zen trace their roots through, Ch'an and the Indian monk Bodhidharma, who was a patriarch of the Dhyana school of direct meditation.
: Tantra and other forms of Esoteric Buddhism trace their heritage to earlier or other lineages of enlightened Buddhas.

=== Theravada ===
Theravada (pronounced -- more or less -- &quot;tay-rah-VAH-dah&quot;), the &quot;Doctrine of the Elders,&quot; is the school of Buddhism that draws its scriptural inspiration from the texts of the Pali Canon, or Tipitaka, which scholars generally accept as containing the earliest surviving record of the Buddha's teachings. For many centuries, Theravada has been the predominant religion of continental Southeast Asia (Thailand, Myanmar/Burma, Cambodia, and Laos) and Sri Lanka; today Theravada Buddhists number over 100 million worldwide. In recent decades Theravada has begun to take root in the West. ''''definition from Accesstoinsight''''

=== Ch'an and Zen (禅宗) ===
Started from the Dhyana school by the conglomerate, legendary Bodhidharma whose attributed works include:
# [http://hjem.get2net.dk/civet-cat/zen-writings/teachings-of-bodhidharma.htm#outline The Outline of Practice]
# [http://hjem.get2net.dk/civet-cat/zen-writings/teachings-of-bodhidharma.htm#bloodstream The Bloodstream Sermon]
# [http://hjem.get2net.dk/civet-cat/zen-writings/teachings-of-bodhidharma.htm#wake_up The Wake-Up Sermon]
# [http://hjem.get2net.dk/civet-cat/zen-writings/teachings-of-bodhidharma.htm#breakthrough The Breakthrough Sermon]
The lineage of this school comes from a legendary sermon of the Buddhas which consisted of raising a flower, leading to the instant 
understanding of one attendee who then founded what was to become Zen.

=== Shingon ===
Japanese school of esoteric Buddhism started by Kukai who studied esoteric Buddhism in China from 804 to 806. He developed his own synthesis of esoteric practice and doctrine, centred on the cosmic Buddha Vairocana, held to be identical with the Shinto sun goddess Amaterasu. 

Kukai combined the cosmic Buddha Vairocana with the Ultimate Reality, thus producing a composite figure embodying all being. 

Most notable treatise is the Sokushin-jobutsugi (The Doctrine of Becoming a Buddha with One's Body During One's Earthly Existence). 

Two sacred mandalas presenting diagramatically the two aspects of Vairocana, the Diamond World (kongo-kai) and Womb World (taizo-kai) are placed on Shingon altars.

=== Pure Land ===
Pure Land Buddhism is based upon the Pure Land sutras first brought to China circa 150, which describe Amitabha, an ancient Buddha. This concept, personified or otherwise, can be translated variously but is usually shortened to &quot;Amituo&quot; or &quot;Amitofo&quot; in Chinese (阿彌陀佛, Mandarin wg O1 Mi2 T'o2 Fo2), &quot;Amida&quot; in Japanese and &quot;Amito&quot; in Korean.

Although the Infinite Life Sutra, or Longer Pure Land Sutra, was translated in to Chinese by the royal Kuchean monk Po-Yen as early as 258, the Pure Land school first became prominent with the founding of a monastery upon the top of Mount Lushan by Hui-yuan in 402. It spread throughout China quickly and was systematized by Shan-tao (613-681). The philosophy spread to Japan and slowly grew in prominence. Honen Shonin (1133-1212) established Pure Land Buddhism as an independent sect in Japan, known as Jodo Shu. Today Pure Land is the dominant form of Buddhism in Japan.

Contemporary Pure Land traditions see the Buddha Amitabha preaching the Dharma in his buddha-field (sa. buddhakchetra), called the &quot;Pure Land&quot; (zh. 净土, pinyin jìngtǔ, jp. 浄土 jodo) or &quot;Western heaven&quot; (zh. 西天), a region offering respite from karmic transmigration. In such traditions, entering the Pure Land is popularly perceived as equivalent to the attainment of nirvana.

In fact, the main idea behind Pure Land Buddhism is that nirvana is no longer practical nor possible to attain in our present day. Instead, devotion to Amitabha will gain one enough karmic merit to go to the Pure Land (reminiscent of Heaven) from which Nirvana will be easier to attain, because in this paradise there are no negative experiences so no new negative karma is created. Existing negative karma would disappear.

Some Pure Land Buddhists have taught that in order for a devotee to be reborn in Amitabha's Western Paradise, they should chant or repeat a mantra or prayer to Amitabha as often as possible to reinforce a proper and sincere state of mind (ex: J. Namu Amida butsu). This fairly simple form of veneration has contributed greatly to its popularity, especially in Japan.

=== Yogācāra ===
Yogacara (also known as Cittamatra) is a philosophical school that has its origins in India with the monk Asanga who worked alongside his brother, arya Vasubandhu to compile a set of texts on teachings passed to him from the Bodhisattva Maitreya. 

The teachings have several important elements to them that have influenced many schools of practice, especially the Zen schools and the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. 

The first important aspect of Yogacara, which lead to its alternative name ''Cittamatra'' (&quot;mind only&quot;) is the relation of phenomena (dharmas) to the mind. The Yogacarins point out that the only way we know of the existence of phenomena is from a subjective perception of them. It is only through the six senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch and thought) that a human is aware of anything. In a similar way to the Idealists such as Bishop Berkeley, the Yogacarins ask &quot;how do we know there's actually an objective world 'out there'? What is its relation to the mind?&quot;

Buddhist philosophy of the mind normally breaks the mind and body into eighteen parts, called the dhatus. We are aware of six different kinds of phenomena. These are objects of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch and thought. Objects of thought include discursive thoughts, emotions etc. The mind that perceives these can therefore be broken down into six 'sense-minds', one for each sense object. In addition, there are six organs of perception; the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind-organ. 

The yogacarins state that the object sensed and the respective sense-organs are intimately linked, and in fact arise from the same cause.

The analysis of how they arise is linked to another important concept the Yogacara introduced; the storehouse consciousness (alayavijnana). This answers the question of ‘where are karmic seeds (bija) stored before coming into fruition?’ Since there is a delay between most actions and their corresponding results, the mental karmic seed that will produce a result in the future must reside somewhere. The storehouse consciousness is the Yogacarin’s answer to this. The alayavijnana is where the collection of seeds resides, and also answers the questions relating to the eighteen dhatus. A single karmic seed that comes into fruition grows from where it is stored in the mind-stream’s alaya, and produces ‘’both’’ the sense consciousness and the object it is consciousness. In this way the eighteen dhatus grow from the alaya and therefore all parts of being arises from their own storehouse consciousness under the influence of the karma they have accrued. 

In addition to the seven parts of the mind (six senses, plus alaya) the Yogacarins posit another part of the mind, the conceptual mind: the ‘’manas’’. This is the parts of the mind-stream that intellectualise and discriminate phenomena in an incorrect, ignorant way, and sees phenomena as being objectively real and separate from the being that perceives them. 

One more important concept taught by the Yogacara is the three levels of truth. There can be said to be three levels of understanding. The first is the completely erroneous view of phenomena having self nature - an objective, permanent nature that is not dependent. The second view, which is correct according to the relative truth of how things function, is that phenomena are subject to dependent origination. All phenomena arise from causes; the mechanism by which this happens is therefore the fruition of the seeds held in the alayavijnana. Then there is the third level of truth, which is the ultimate nature of reality according to the Yogacara. This is that consciousness is the ultimate nature of things, since it is consciousness that gives rise to them. There is nothing that does not ultimately come from consciousness. This is the Yogacara interpretation of emptiness. 
 
There are several misconceptions about the Yogacara school. The first is that all things exist in some kind of cosmic consciousness. This is the view of some Hindu schools, for example, but it is not the Yogacara view. Each mind-stream has its own separate alaya, and the extent to which the experiences of any two beings overlap (which is an important question with relation to the six realms of existence) is due to the extent that the karma of those two beings. Similar karmic patterns in the mind produce an experience that is similar. 

The second is that the school is a completely Idealistic one; that physical reality doesn’t exist at all. This is incorrect, since on the relative level they do exist. It is their origin that is tied to the mind; as no object arises without the storehouse consciousness producing it alongside the sense organs and sense consciousnesses to perceive it.

{{CompactTOC}}
=Glossary=
=A=
'''Arisings''' - What comes up in meditation or disturbs ones stream of consciousness.

'''Amitaba''' - A Buddha venerated by all Mahayana schools, particularly Pure Land. Represents the True Mind. Alternately spelled &quot;Amitahba&quot;.

'''Anatta''' - A state where no soul or consciousness exists. 

'''Arahat''' - Buddhist equivalent of a saint. One who has attained liberation from cyclic existence.  Alternately spelled &quot;arhat&quot;.

'''Avalokitesvara''' - Buddhist embodiment of compassion. Kwan Yin. Chenresig. Dalai Lama. 

'''Attachment''' - Root cause of suffering

=B=
'''Buddha Nature''' - The potential of any sentient being which permits them to attain Buddhahood.       

'''Buddha''' - &quot;The Awakened One&quot;. &quot;The Enlightened one&quot;.

'''Bardo''' - The intermediate existence between death and the next rebirth. 

'''Bhikkhu''' - Mendicant/A male ordained into the Buddhist order. A monk. 

'''Bhikkhuni''' - Female equivalent of &quot;Bhikkhu&quot;. A female ordained into the Buddhist order. A nun.

'''Bodhi''' - Perfect knowledge or wisdom.

'''Bodhicitta'''

'''Bodhisattva''' - Anyone who has the aspiration to save oneself and others.

=C=
'''Causality''' - the notion that indicates the apparent nature of things - one or more phenomena are caused by one or more phenomena, and cause themselves one or more phenomena. Any phenomena appears to have causes and effects. See Dependant Arising and Emptiness below.

'''Citta''' - Mind or heart, the terms being synonymous in Buddhism.

'''Compassion'''

'''Conventional Truth''' - This indicates that the notions and objects and generally all phenomena is only conventional, it ultimately does not exist. But in order to explain this to beings that rely on notions and objects, it is necessary to use notions and objects. Therefore, as a base to understanding the lack of an established nature for all phenomena, it is said that the phenomena exist - but only as conventions between beings, as learned habits of interpretation of perceptions and memories. See Causality, Dependant Arising, Emptiness on this page.

=D=
'''Dana''' - giving, gift, alms-giving, alms, generosity, charity, benevolence, liberality, donation.

'''Dharini''' - Extended mantra used in esoteric branch of Buddhism .

'''Dakini'''

'''Dependant Arising''' - indicates that any phenomena that appears to exist arises in dependence with causes (and conditions, which can be seen as causes as well). This proves that none of the objects, beings, notions, perceptions, etc. we consider to exist has an established existence, but it is a non-separable &quot;part&quot; of a &quot;flow&quot; that is the whole Existence. The notions of &quot;part&quot;, &quot;flow&quot; and &quot;Existence&quot; are also subject to this dependent arising. There is no single phenomena that can be established independently, completely separate from all other phenomena. See Causality and Emptiness on this page.

'''Deva''' - A shining one, god, deity

'''Dharma''' - The Doctrine, The Law, nature, the Truth.               

'''Dukkha''' - Suffering, misery, woe, pain, ill, sorrow, trouble, discomfort, unsatisfactoriness
            
'''Dhyana''' - The practice of concentration.

'''Diamond Sutra''' - part of the Prajnaparamita Sutra shows that all phenomenal appearances are not ultimate reality but rather illusions, projections of one's own mind.

=E=
'''Emptiness''' - in the Buddhist context, corresponds to the Sanskrit word &quot;shunyata&quot;. It indicates the fundamental nature of all phenomena, which are empty of any conceivable notions and characteristics. It indicates that ALL that appears to exist is void of ANY kind of existence. For the humans' sake, in order to make this notion more understandable, it is sometimes said that the Reality exists only as a concept in a being's mind - which is somewhat similar to saying it doesn't exist at all in any way that one may believe it exists. In the human world this can be easily proved by observing that all phenomena are causally determined by others, and their form and/or status is defined in relationship with others, and so on, without being able to determine a single phenomena which can serve as an independent base for definitions. See Causality and Dependant Arising above.

=J=
'''Jhana''' - meditation, trance, ecstasy, absorption, a state of serene contemplation attained by meditation.        

'''Jnana''' - trancendental, non-conceptual wisdom.
=K=
'''Karma''' - Movement of the mind, producing actions of body, speech or thought

'''Kalpa''' - An aeon, world cycle.

'''Lobha''' - Greed, covetousness.                                 

'''Loka''' - the World, a world, plane of existence. 
=M=           
'''Mantra''' - literally: &quot;thing that protects the mind&quot;. A sequence of syllables for training the mind and meditating on Buddhas/Bodhisattvas, and in esoteric teachings, for shaping the flow of the subtle winds (prana) in some forms of yoga.

'''Metta''' - Loving kindness,good will, friendliness.
=N=
'''Nirvana''' - the extinction of the fires of greed, hatred and ignorance. A state of having destroyed all kleshas.

'''Non-duality''' - the real nature of things. The impossibility to establish ANY phenomena as separate and independent, and therefore to separate completely one &quot;this&quot; and one &quot;other&quot;, without finding any common cause or a link between them, no matter how deep we search.

'''Non-self''' - the notions of Emptiness and Dependent Arising also apply to what we consider to be our &quot;self&quot;. This self is also causally determined by causes in the past. Moreover, the non-duality can also be applied to the selves. This finding is particular to the Buddhist religion, and a central point in its Doctrine. It is the finding that destroys egoism, since this is based on the concept of self, which is invalid. Greed and hatred are also useless since they have no base to rely on.

=P=
'''Pali Canon''' - Form of agreed written tradition constructed 400 years after Buddhas death from oral stories , comprising the Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidamma pitaka.

'''Papa''' - evil, wrong action, demerit, bad.

=== Who are the Hinayana? ===
: Hinayana is a term meaning &quot;smaller&quot; or &quot;lower&quot; vehicle.

: In order to be classified as following Hinayana, a practitioner must be practicing in order to achieve the nirvana of the hearer (shravaka) or solitary realiser (pratyekabuddha). The motivation of bodhicitta, the wish to attain Buddhahood for the sake of all beings, is absent in these schools, although it may be mentioned in relation to those who actually attained buddhahood. When the aim is buddhahood, a practitioner is following Mahayana. 

: There are two main divisions of the Hinayana, the Sautrantika (sutra-ists) and the Vaibhashika (detailists), as compared to the two main divisions of the Mahayana: Yogachara and Madhyamika. The philosophies of the Hinayana schools are collected in the Abhidharmakosha (Compendium of Higher Knowledge) by master Vashubandhu, the brother of Asanga. 

: The term 'Hinayana' is often thought to refer to the Theravada school, which developed historically from the Sthaviravada, and the main texts of which are preserved in the Pali language. This is frequently a source of contention, as the term, especially among Western practitioners, has negative connotations. In the Tibetan tradition, among others, the Hinayana is considered a vital and important stage of practice, and one to be thoroughly learnt before embarking on the Bodhisattva path. Indeed, the fourteenth Bodhisattva vows is to refrain from disparaging the Hinayana. To do so is to have committed a root downfall. 

: Neither the term Hinayana, or Shravakayana as it is sometimes called, are terms that are considered &quot;politically correct&quot; to use, but unfortunately a proper history of the developments of the Buddha's teachings is not possible without their use.

=== Western Developments ===
: The Beat poets of the 40's and 50's popularised Zen in particular but the roots of Buddhism in the West can be traced back to the Theosophical movement in Great Britain, to earlier esoteric orders and the medieval mystery plays of Europe.

=== Future Developments ===
Integrated and adaptive systems introduced into the core values suggest the need for a new dharma revelation of the future. Traditionally this new Buddha is known as the Maitreya. Meanwhile many utilize the traditional and simple pragmatism of Buddhism to enhance their life experience. Buddhism is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end.

=== Medicine and Healing ===

The medicine Buddha practices and the body strengthening of Shaolin are two widely known healing methods.

=== Buddhist Cosmology ===  
=== Buddhist Rasayana ===  
=== The Development of a Secular religion === 
=== Non Theistic Ethics and Morality ===

      <comment>/* The Eightfold Path */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Buddhist Philosophy}}

=== The Eightfold Path ===

1. '''Right Understanding''' (or ''Right View'', or ''Right Perspective'')

&quot;And what, monks, is right understanding? Knowledge with regard to suffering, knowledge with regard to the origination of suffering, knowledge with regard to the stopping of suffering, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the stopping of suffering: This, monks, is called right understanding.

2. '''Right Thought''' (or ''Right Intention'', or ''Right Resolve'')

&quot;And what is right thought? Being resolved on renunciation, on freedom from ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right thought.

3. '''Right Speech'''

&quot;And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, abstaining from divisive speech, abstaining from abusive speech, abstaining from idle chatter: This, monks, is called right speech.

4. '''Right Action'''

&quot;And what, monks, is right action? Abstaining from taking life, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from unchastity: This, monks, is called right action. 

5. '''Right Livelihood'''

&quot;And what, monks, is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This, monks, is called right livelihood.

6. '''Right Effort''' (or ''Right Endeavour'')

&quot;And what, monks, is right effort? 
'''(i)''' There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen. 
'''(ii)''' He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen. 
'''(iii)''' He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen. 
'''(iv)''' He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen: This, monks, is called right effort. 

7. '''Right Mindfulness'''

&quot;And what, monks, is right mindfulness?
 
'''(i)''' There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself -- ardent, aware, &amp; mindful -- putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. 
'''(ii)''' He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves -- ardent, aware, &amp; mindful -- putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. 
'''(iii)''' He remains focused on the mind in &amp; of itself -- ardent, aware, &amp; mindful -- putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. 
'''(iv)''' He remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves -- ardent, aware, &amp; mindful -- putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. This, monks, is called right mindfulness. 

8. '''Right Concentration'''

&quot;And what, monks, is right concentration? 
'''(i)''' There is the case where a monk -- quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities -- enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. 
'''(ii)''' With the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, one-pointedness of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation -- internal assurance. 
'''(iii)''' With the fading of rapture, he remains in equanimity, mindful &amp; fully aware, and physically sensitive of pleasure. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' 
'''(iv)''' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress -- he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This, monks, is called right concentration.&quot;

=== Buddhism's world view ===
Buddhists believe in vast number of realms, which could be categorised into the six realms of samsara, which are the:
* Heavenly realm 
* Demi-god realm
* Human realm
* Animal realm
* Hungry ghost realm
* Hell realm

Contrary to most other cultures which looked towards heaven as the ultimate spiritual destination, Buddhists regard the human realm as the highest regarded realm of the six. Although the human realm does not appear special at first glance, it contains all the states of consciousness in the universe, from hellish suffering to divine ecstasy.

Among the lower realms, the animals are unable to intellectually understand the teachings, and the hungry ghosts and hell dwellers are gripped by pain and suffering. As for the realms above, the demi-gods are dominated with violence and jealousy, and are antithetical to the teachings of the dhamma. The heaven dwellers constantly indulge in the fruits of their past kamma, and do not concern themselves with the future.

For this reason, life in the world of human beings is known as &quot;the precious human rebirth&quot;. Born close to the pivot point of happiness and suffering, human beings have a unique capacity for moral choices with long-term significance.

Enlightenment as an arhat can be attained from the realms of the Śuddhāvāsa deities. A bodhisattva can appear in many different types of lives, for instance as an animal or as a deva. Buddhas, however, are always human.

=== Summary ===
* There is '''dukkha''', a quality of being unstable, subjected to change, and therefore imperfect, or unsatisfactory.

* Dhamma can refer either to the teachings of the Buddha which are conducive to spiritual improvement, or constituent factors of the worldly realm.

* '''Karma''' explains that our actions bear consequences, both good and bad. In other words, you are responsible for your actions.

* The Buddha teaches the doctrine of '''dependent origination''', which states that phenomena arise together in a mutually interdependent web of cause, effect and conditions. Therefore, all phenomena are insubstantial and empty of inherent property. (e.g., A cup loses its property as a cup when it breaks.)

* '''Nibbāna''' refers to the highest spiritual attainment, where the mind is liberated, and no longer clings to worldly phenomena.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a short tutorial, in order to explain to the new users how to quickly add an article to the Acoustics Wikibook.

== Before contributing ==
The first thing to do is to define the subject of your article. Please make sure that your subject is not already present on this Wikibook. You will also have to check the table of contents of the main page to determine the category (Fundamentals, Applications, ...) in which you want your article to appear. If you need to, it's also possible to create a new category.

== How do I create my page ? ==
You will have to edit the main page of the Acoustics Wikibook (check the tabs on the top of the page). Then add a line in the chosen category, following the example of the existing links. Click &quot;save page&quot; and go back to the main page. You are to see the broken (red) link you've just created. Just click on it, and here you are. You've just created your first page, which is, for the moment, blank.

== How do I create my page title ? ==
The first step is to download this model, which is used for every single page's title.

[[Image:acoustics title logo.JPG]]

You'll have to open it with the painting software of your choice (Microsoft Paint for example), then write your article's title on the model. Save it and upload it (see the upload section of Wikibooks).
Add it to your page via the tool boxes.

== How do I add images to my page ? ==
You'll have to check the copyrights status of your file, then upload it (only generic domains). Add it to your page with the tool boxes, or by following an existing page's example.

'''Procrastination''' or &quot;task aversion&quot; is the irrational delay of an intended course of action, even while expecting to be worse off for the delay (compare [[wikt:temporize|temporisation]]).  The procrastinator deviates from the task, usually in favor of another more enjoyable (or less unenjoyable) activity.  This behavior is pervasive throughout society - everyone procrastinates to some degree - but some people are so chronically affected as to be severely debilitated.

Procrastination is typically caused by the association of pain or discomfort with the prospective course of action; that is: stress.  This may be physical (such as that experienced during hard labor or vigorous exercise) or psychological (such as in the form of frustration or anxiety). The task or the situation requiring the task may be perceived as dangerous, painful, overwhelming, difficult, tedious, uncomfortable, or boring; basically, unenjoyable; that is: stressful.  Once habitualized, procrastination can be triggered at any time.  Procrastination can also be a symptom of a serious psychiatric disorder such as [[w:clinical depression|depression]] or ADHD ([[w:attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]]), and may be greatly reduced when the underlying condition is properly treated.

Traditionally, in the field of psychology, procrastination has been associated with [[w:perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]] (a tendency to negatively evaluate one's own performance). However, research indicates that perfectionists are not any more likely to procrastinate, though they feel worse about it when they put things off. {{fact}} 

The word '''procrastination''' comes from Latin, ''Pro'', &quot;in favor of&quot;, and ''Cras'', &quot;tomorrow&quot;.

Some of the Consequences:

*'''Lost opportunities:''' for example, somebody else buys the car the procrastinator wanted because they put off making a simple phone call.  Or somebody else patents an invention the procrastinator thought of first, because they never got around to patenting it themselves.

*'''Tardiness:''' being late to meetings, showing up late at special events, and being late to pick up a date.  Missing the beginning of the movie at the theater, and getting bad seats, because the procrastinator did not leave the house on time.

*'''Missed deadlines:''' from failing a school assignment by not turning it in on time to missing a flight at the airport because the procrastinator talked on the phone too long.

*'''Irresponsibility towards others:''' like failing to keep promises because they kept getting put off until later.  Or causing others to be late for their commitments because the procrastinator didn't pick them up on time.

*'''Lack of preparedness:''' such as when the basement floods unnecessarily because the procrastinator kept putting off installing a sump pump.

*'''Poor performance:''' failing an exam, because the student waited until the night before the test to begin studying.

*'''Career troubles:''' repeatedly missing deadlines on projects at work, making promotion unlikely and potentially leading to getting demoted or fired.

*'''Unnecessary expenses:''' like having to pay late fees because the procrastinator didn't pay the bills on time even though they did have the money.  Or having a huge liability from an automobile accident because the person at fault wasn't covered because they put off paying their insurance bill.

*'''Financial difficulties:''' such as the inability to pay the bills due to putting off generating new sales or finding new customers for the business.

*'''Medical problems:''' like having to make a painful visit to the dentist to have cavities filled or teeth pulled because the patient kept putting off brushing their teeth.  Or having a heart attack because the victim kept delaying the start of their personal health program.

*'''Dissatisfaction about oneself'''.

*'''Dissatisfaction of others about one's procrastination'''. A spouse may even end the marriage because their partner put off getting a better paying job as promised.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Overcoming Procrastination}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Procrastination can be seen as both a behavior and the lack of a behavior.  The behavior is the act of turning away and doing something else in place of what the procrastinator should be doing.  The lacking behavior is of course the task or activity that the procrastinator should be working on, such as homework.  There are three ways to procrastinate:  skip it, do it last, and escape.  

#'''Skipping it:''' here, even though the task is foregone forever, it is the program that is being put off.  When a person skips brushing their teeth, they are putting off their whole &quot;keep the teeth clean so they won't get cavities&quot; program.  It's like they are saying &quot;I'll start brushing my teeth tomorrow.&quot;
#'''Doing it last:''' easiest / most pleasant tasks tend to be done first.  When there's a big job to do, and a long list of things to accomplish in order for that job to be completed, the tendency is to work on the simplest tasks.  As long as the items on the list are getting done, the job ''feels like'' it is being completed, and the procrastinator lulls themself into a false sense of security.  This approach becomes a problem when all the easy chores are done but there isn't enough time left to complete the hardest tasks because they were put off until last! Also, new alternative tasks may come up again and again, so that the main task is never started.
#'''Escape:''' the procrastinator instead does something they enjoy doing, choosing short-term gratification over long-term gain, at the cost of the benefits that they would receive from doing the task they put off.  This takes their mind off the (stressful) task that they should be doing, or the situation they should be dealing with.  This can lead to a pattern of addiction, where the more the procrastinator escapes, the more guilty they feel about not doing what they are supposed to be doing, creating more stress to escape from, leading them to continue the alternate activity so they don't have to think about it.

But procrastination isn't necessarily the mere lack of doing something, it is something that is causing the procrastinator not to do it.  In this sense procrastination isn't the behaviors done or not done, but is a behavior unto itself. As a distinct behavior, procrastination can be characterized in several ways...

=== Procrastination as poor judgement ===

At the core of procrastination is a faulty decision.  Either the decision is made not to do something that should be done, or the decision is made to do something else.  Since that is the wrong decision, and the person is aware of it but follows it anyway, that is poor judgment. A term for acting against one’s better judgement is [[Wikipedia:Akrasia|akrasia]].  If the person makes the decision out of course with no thought to the outcome, then they are acting without thinking, and that too is poor judgement.

:'''Poor judgement and laziness'''

:Rest and relaxation is important to maintain health and to occasionally distance oneself from one's work so it can be seen more clearly or from a different perspective.  But relaxation can be taken too far, and when it is, it's called [[w:laziness|laziness]].  When resting beyond the need to maintain health interferes with responsibilities or life dreams, that is another example of poor judgement. There is much debate as to whether a value judgement such as laziness can be attributed to the procrastinator, since in many cases the procrastinator wishes to be active and productive but is held back by an inability to follow through.

:'''Poor judgement and leisure'''

:While [[w:leisure|leisure]] and [[w:recreation|recreation]] go hand-in-hand with rest and relaxation, and can provide therapeutic refreshment of body and mind, it becomes too much of a good thing when it interferes with what a person should be doing.  [[w:Play (activity)|Playing]] is useful for learning and can provide exposure to new things, and is an important component of open-mindedness, but when it is engaged in to the detriment of things needing to get done, it is yet another manifestation of poor judgement.  The procrastinator has chosen doing what they want to do over what they ''have'' to do.  It is often necessary to let work come before play.  But leisure doesn't have to be sacrificed completely: there's a section about scheduling fun breaks below.

=== Procrastination as being distracted ===

When something isn't enjoyable, it is very easy for a person to get distracted from a pending task. In this case, a procrastinator may feel blameless. The more susceptible a person is to [[w:distractions|distraction]], the more prone the conditions are for procrastination.

If a person allows himself or herself to be distracted, and the distraction is not warranted (that is, it isn't more important than what what was being done), then that person has implicitly made the decision to procrastinate by choosing to do something other than what was intended.

The less thought that goes into making choices, the harder it is for a person to avoid the consequences of procrastinating. The more distracting elements (people, toys, etc.) there are in a person's immediate environment, the more opportunity there is for poor choices to occur.

=== Procrastination as a phobia ===

An irrational aversion to something is a [[w:phobia|phobia]].  Not only can phobias cause procrastination, a phobia can be a component of procrastination itself and therefore go unnoticed as a phobia.  A strong and irrational aversion to something is usually a sign of a phobia.

=== Procrastination as bad habit ===

When the decision to avoid a task is repeated automatically—even when it is the wrong decision—making the wrong decision becomes habit; the decision maker has acquired a habit of making bad decisions.  Keep in mind that a decision is implicit to every action taken, even if the person taking the action did not consciously decide anything.

Since habits are repetitive in nature, a habit cannot usually be overridden by a single decision: it takes a new habit to do this.  A simple decision could easily be overwhelmed by the force of habit and therefore may need to be implemented as a habit itself before it can compete effectively with the old habit.

=== Procrastination as a complex ===

Unfortunately, procrastination isn't simply a habit, it is a complex pattern of recurring behaviors including emotions, thoughts, and actions.  Many of these are habitual, and in order to get rid of them, each one needs to be replaced, circumvented, or deactivated by new habits; though not necessarily on a one-to-one ratio: sometimes a single habit can replace several others.

=== Procrastination as a symptom ===

Procrastination can be the result of a more serious underlying condition such as [[w:clinical depression|depression]] or [[w:Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]].  See below. &lt;!-- What? There's nothing there. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Overcoming Procrastination}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Procrastination is always based on a dysfunctional worldview, such as that &quot;short term relief or pleasure is better than sacrifice for long-term rewards,&quot; along with irrational disregard for negative consequences.  The procrastinator fails to engage in the appropriate course of action either due to a [[w:distraction|distraction]] of some sort or an inadequacy in their own behavior.  Various distractions and incompetencies that can cause procrastination include, but are not limited to:

* Addiction 
* Anxiety and fear
* Arrogance, pride 
* Aversion
* Bad habits
* Discouragement 
* Disorganization 
* [[w:Distraction|Distraction]] 
* Family problems
* Fear of failure 
* Feeling overwhelmed 
* Frustration
* Guilt
* Ill-conceived goals and unconscious motives
* Indecision 
* Lack of awareness
* Lack of morals
* Lack of time management skills 
* Low ambition 
* Low frustration tolerance 
* Low self-esteem 
* Low tolerance to stress
* Objective conflict (competing goals)
* Paranoia
* Perception of difficulty 
* Phobia
* Poor attitude 
* Poor self-control skills
* Poor study skills
* Rebellion
* Resentment 
* Self-centeredness
* Self-deception
* Uncertainty

=== Expectancy-Value Theory ===

:''Laziness pays off today, work only tomorrow.''

In motivational psychology, a mathematical formula can be used to determine what task should be pursued first. According to [http://www.tcw.utwente.nl/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20clusters/Public%20Relations,%20Advertising,%20Marketing%20and%20Consumer%20Behavior/Expectancy_Value_Theory.doc/ this model], we complete first those tasks which have the highest &quot;usefulness&quot;-value. This model is able to explain why we would rather be watching our favorite television program than writing the soon to be due term paper from your hardest college class, and it says that ''everybody'' is procrastinating, although each of us to differing degrees.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;U=\frac{P\times V}{D}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where

:U = the usefulness of the task.
:P = Probability of profiting from the task
:V = Value of the profit gained from the task
:D = Delay between doing the task and receiving the reward for it

This formula is saying that, we (generally speaking) tend to prefer (depending on an individualized perception and perspective, that can not be fully generalized but can be normalized in test trials):
*immediate rewards over delayed benefits
*bigger rewards over smaller prizes
*sure rewards over rewards that are only probable

The important question now is: Under what circumstances would someone put off their work? If the increase in U would be significant (e.g. when P, V or both values are high), every procrastinator stops procrastinating. By introducing an additional factor to the equation (S, the sensitivity of the subject toward the delay between action and reward), the behavior of different people could be compared.

&lt;!-- ATTENTION:  be careful to keep the outline structure of headings below intact.  The structure of this entire section has been mapped out according to its introduction, and planned subtopics and unfinished material have been placed within comment delimiters until they are ready. 

PLEASE LEAVE THE HEADINGS INTACT, because some of us know what they mean and what will eventually go there (not that we're putting this off, or anything!).  If you can figure it out, by all means fill-in those sections.  And feel free to add your own, as that's what being a Wikipedian is all about.  Let's work together on making this a great article.

Keep in mind that Wikipedia articles are descriptive rather than prescriptive.  So please keep instructionalization to a minimum.  We're explaining what methods are in use in the world, not what to do specifically.  As encyclopedists, it's not our place to give advice, but to present the available options.  This isn't the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy!
--&gt;

One would think that the solution to procrastination (not doing it) is its exact opposite:  doing it!  That the cure is doing the very thing that is being avoided. 

[Note: We must be careful using the word &quot;cure&quot; in regard to  procrastination.  We ought to think of procrastination itself as a cure.   Trying to &quot;cure&quot; procrastination is identical to trying to cure a fever.  Fever is the body's attempt to &quot;cure&quot; an infection.  A physician tries, instead, to eliminate the infection.  Likewise, procrastination is an attempt (if misguided) to &quot;cure&quot; a personal difficulty.  The underlying problem, for which a person uses procrastination as a solution, must be the focus. Curing procrastination--or concentrating on procrastination, then, distracts and delays an efficacious solution to the true emotional problem.] 

Well it is, and then some.  Since procrastination is the cause of not doing (rather than merely the lack of action), simply doing that which is being procrastinated may not be psychologically possible while the mental obstacle or technical problem causing the procrastination is in place.  Also, as explained above, procrastination can be a powerful psychological force in its own right.  Therefore, the procrastinator needs to get over, go around, or somehow plow through these mental barriers in order to get on with it.  This is dependent upon the very nature of procrastination itself...

In essence, procrastination is a form of incompetence. To cure it is to eliminate it.  Since incompetence is the opposite or lack of competence, ''the only way to eliminate it is to replace it with competence.'' 

'''Personal competence''' comprises five elements: emotional strength, well-directed thought, time-management skills, control over habits, and task completion abilities.  Therefore, most strategies for overcoming procrastination are based on improving these five skill areas, and involve: improving emotional control and adjusting one's underlying attitude, focusing attention and thinking rationally, learning executive (self-management) procedures like planning and scheduling, learning habit-changing methods, and acquiring better task completion and problem solving skills. &lt;!-- Each of these areas are dealt with in this order below.  Note: Reading the Wikipedia article on &quot;procrastination&quot; instead of doing work is a perfect example of procrastination. --&gt;

=== Increasing emotional control ===

To the extent that procrastination is an emotional problem, acquiring control over emotions brings the problem under control.  Emotions are invoked by perception, which in turn is dependent on attitude, stress tolerance, and moods (which are simply sustained emotions that become trends).  Therefore, by rebuilding or improving these foundations, emotional strength can be increased to handle the problems and opportunities encountered everyday, emotional or otherwise.  There are  both psychological and physiological methods of doing this.

==== Attitude adjustment ====

Personal attitude is the foundation of an individual's emotions.  If a person believes that the world is out to get them and that they have been dealt a losing hand in life, they are likely to walk around with a frown on their face feeling sorry for themselves or being mad at everyone else, saying things like &quot;why try anything at all, it won't matter anyways&quot;.  But, on the other hand, if they believe that they have a great many things to be thankful for, that the world is a great place, and opportunity abounds, then they are more likely to work hard and greet everyone with a smile just because they feel good about themselves and others too.  

Attitude isn't a static set of personal beliefs that a person is stuck with for the rest of their life.  Attitude is an approach: at anytime, anyone can decide to look on the bright side of things, or not.  The former engenders hope, enthusiasm, and joy, while the latter invites fear, loathing and misery.  The choice on how to perceive the world is up to each person.  Below are some of the perceptions of which a positive attitude may be comprised...

*'''A positive mental [[w:attitude|attitude]]''' inspires ongoing action, especially when it includes a strong [[w:work ethic|work ethic]]. Adopting an '''uplifting personal philosophy''' can provide the basis for such an attitude, especially when it emphasizes the importance of [[w:Forty-nine character virtues|virtues]].  This usually entails pondering the [[w:meaning of life|meaning of life]] to determine what is important in life, and what approach to take.  A positive outlook on life engenders positive emotion in life, which in turn inspires action.
*'''Dream envisioning''' is daring to imagine the desired future.  The stronger it is (through repetition) and the more detailed its outcome is, the more compelling the dream becomes as a road map for action.  Making dreams come true is what success is all about, and a well-envisioned dream which remains &quot;in view&quot; at all times is one of the most powerful motivators there is.  That's why visionaries are called visionaries.  To live a life's dream is to think about it all the time, to continually think about everything ''in terms of'' that dream.
*'''Determining self-worth''' on one's own rather than by the opinions of others makes for a more stable emotional base.  Psychologists are divided between endorsing unconditional self-love, personal potential, and earned self-worth as the best approach through which to evaluate one's self-worthiness.  With unconditional self-love personal value is inherent: the individual holds themself in highest regard regardless of their actions, which is believed to provide the best environment to nurture the psyche for personal growth (&quot;I am great because I exist&quot;).  When personal potential is the benchmark, it is one's personal skills and traits which matter, which focuses value on one's personal inventory (including ambition and willpower) in preparation for accomplishment (&quot;I am capable of great things therefore I am worthy&quot; and &quot;I can accomplish anything I put my mind to, therefore I am worthy&quot;).  While in the earned self-worth model, self-worth is used as part of a reward structure:  one must do great deeds if one is to see themself as great (&quot;I have done great things, therefore I am worthy&quot;).  But all three of these approaches to self-imaging work better than caving in to the criticisms of others.
*'''Maintaining a positive mental voice''' means refraining from self-criticism, keeping critiques directed upon actions and strategies rather than one's person, and replacing self-putdowns with uplifting self-encouragement. The main character in the children's tale [[w:The Little Engine That Could|The Little Engine that Could]] provides a perfect example of this approach.  While everyone else told the Little Engine that he would never make it up the mountain track, the Little Engine kept telling himself &quot;I think I can, I think I can&quot;, even in the face of overwhelming odds, until his belief in himself carried him through.  Then, on his way down the other side of the mountain he shouted in victory &quot;I knew I could, I knew I could, I knew I could!&quot;  Now that's attitude in motion!
*'''Rebounding after a defeat''', like getting back in the saddle after falling off the horse, is usually better than giving up and not trying anything that big again.  Volitional depression&lt;!-- I don't know what the professional term for this is --&gt;, a fancy term for discouragement, is where a person, after a big failure (like losing a fortune on the stock market, a divorce, going bankrupt, or a failed start-up company) retreats into themself or into an addiction (like drugs, becoming obsessed with the [[w:internet|internet]], collecting things, or engaging in sex as often as possible) instead of taking on another big project to go after success yet again.  The resilience to get back up after a failure and go for &quot;it&quot; again is much more conducive to success, and as a character trait is diametrically opposed to procrastination.  The average successful entrepreneur fails six times before making it big.  Keeping this in mind makes getting started again a lot easier, because it is a reminder that interim failure is temporary and is just part of the learning process of achievement -- winners keep going.
*'''Counting blessings''' - One aspect of ‘looking on the bright side’ is inventorying opportunities, skills, and strengths, rather than bemoaning problems, inadequacies, and weaknesses.  Seeing a situation as a ‘glass half full’ rather than a ‘glass half empty’, is the more inspiring approach. It is easy to take everpresent things for granted, while complaining about things that are missing. Remember the saying “I felt really bad that I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet!”  Appreciating those things that are usually taken for granted makes for a much better starting point than feeling sorry for oneself, plus it increases awareness of what resources there are to work with.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The article has been cleaned-up to this point.  Beyond this point, the second-person colloquialisms need to be rewritten in the Wikipedia third-person style. (Move this marker down the article as this chore gets further completed).  Thanks.  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--&gt;
*'''Building on strengths''' - Make a list of all the things you already master.  Ask yourself how you got to be an expert in doing these things - and then, try to explain the differences between your &quot;can't-dos&quot; and &quot;can-dos&quot;. To what feelings and circumstances are they attached? You may be able to apply the same approaches you used on acquiring your current skills to attain the new skills you need.
*'''Building self-confidence''' - The only one source of self-confidence is enjoying success. But, the problem is that often you can only succeed against other people, e.g. by having equal or better marks than others. The problem is that you did procrastinate for such a long time that you are like a child which is learning to walk - but having put off the walking courses, it can only succeed when compared against a much younger baby. Stop comparing yourself with others - set your own goals! Get to know other people who find themselves in a like situation; you can learn from them that they did not fare better by comparing themselves with successful people.
*'''Being progressive''' helps to put down your old feelings and habits. Remove old things from your room or apartment - they ''are'' associated with your old personality. If you possess something that vigorously reminds you of a sad, unlucky era - then get rid of it.

Another way to beat procrastination is by leading a healthy lifestyle. An unhealthy lifestyle makes a person much more susceptible to stress, which leads to feelings of being overwhelmed, which can lead to procrastination.  By making a few adjustments to their lifestyle, like how much they exercise, a person can greatly increase how much stress they can handle...

==== Increasing stress tolerance ====

Some people are more susceptible to stress than others. In other words, those others are more tolerable to stress than those susceptible. The greater your tolerance, the more stress it takes to get you down.  Stress falling below one's tolerance threshold is &quot;no big deal&quot;, and is easy to deal with. What many don't realize is that this tolerance level is adjustable -- it can be strengthened...

*'''Vigorous cardiovascular exercise''' increases resistance to stress, boosts the immune system, and improves oxygen supply to the brain and general mental performance (including intellectual performance, ability to focus, memory, etc.).  Such exercise include walking, speed walking, running, swimming, biking, hiking, and aerobics.
*'''Good nutrition''', including nutrient supplementation, improves cognitive performance, boosts the immune system, and provides the brain with the precursors necessary for it to make the stress-coping neurotransmitters it needs.  '''Abstaining from poor nutrition''', such as by cutting down on sweets and sugar drinks, reduces hyperactivity, difficulty focusing, and obesity (which hampers the immune system, general performance, and proclivity to exercise).
*'''Relaxation methods''' such as [[w:fractional relaxation|fractional relaxation]], [[w:progressive relaxation|progressive relaxation]], trance induction, and meditation reduce the effects of stress: tension and anxiety. The ability to remain calm and worry-free in the face of stressful situational factors is called self-composure.  The ability to stay tension-free during a stressful situation, including using only as much energy and muscle tension required to complete motions, is called relaxed poise.  Combined together, these skills are called grace under pressure.

==== Enhancing mood control ====

Emotions, including moods, drive behavior.  But our moods are our responsibility, and concerning each of them we can choose to feel that way or not.  We can feel like throwing a tantrum and putting things off, or we can feel like doing something useful...

*'''Being alert to one's own moods''' is preferable to not paying attention to what one is feeling (and consequentially to what one is doing because of these moods).  The first step to changing a mood is to be aware of it.  Here is a simple ABC of bad moods to keep a look out for: '''a'''ngry, '''b'''ored, '''c'''ranky, '''d'''readful, '''e'''asily distracted, '''f'''rustrated, '''g'''rumpy, '''h'''urt, '''i'''ll-tempered, '''j'''ustified, '''k'''icked, '''l'''azy, '''m'''ean, '''n'''osy, '''o'''bsolete, feeling like '''p'''utting it off until later, feeling like '''q'''uitting, '''r'''obbed, '''s'''elfish, '''t'''ired, '''u'''sed, '''v'''exed, '''w'''hipped, &lt;!--'''x''', --&gt;feeling like '''y'''elling at someone, '''z'''eroed in on (or '''z'''eroed out).  When you spot one, you can catch yourself, and change your emotional approach: your mood.
*'''Positive filter''' is to retain the positive thoughts and actions and ignore or keep out the negative ones. Negative thoughts tend to build up and often become pervasive in one's life. When we continuously encourage positive thoughts and suppress negative ones, we develop a better outlook towards life and ourselves.
*'''Changing expression''' (such as one's facial expression) can change a person's mood.  When you feel good, you smile.  Conversely, and very useful for lifting one's own spirits is the fact that smiling (on purpose) generally makes people feel good. This is referred to in psychology as the 'facial feedback' hypothesis.  And smiles are contagious, so others can catch them from you, and in turn, you can catch &quot;smilitis&quot; back from them.  It's a synergistic arrangement.  And when we're feeling good, we are much more likely to feel like getting started.
*'''Adjusting taste''' is changing how you feel about something, like learning to love what you hate.  This is accomplished by changing how you think about it: dwelling on the benefits and good traits of an activity may lead to actually liking it.  Finding fun ways to do it, like turning it into a game, may also make it more enjoyable.
*'''Self-psyching''', or &quot;psyching yourself up&quot;, is the self-administered pep-talk.  You are your own coach delivering the motivational speech before the big game.
*'''Managing fear''' - One way to overcome fear is to face it.  Usually, the more exposure one has to a stressful stimulus, the more used to it he gets.  This is called desensitization.

=== Improving thinking ===

If you've ever wondered &quot;What was I thinking?!&quot; after doing something really stupid (like putting off a very important project to the last minute, or playing when you should have been studying), maybe you weren't thinking at all.  Or maybe your reasons weren't very good, because you didn't put enough thought into them.  These problems are the result of a lack of concentration.  The solution to distractions and opportunities competing for attention involves improving concentration and how one  concentrates: acquiring better focusing and decision-making abilities.  Here also, there are psychological and physiological approaches.

==== Paying attention ====
&lt;!--
[needs opening paragraph]

I’m not convinced that these drugs’ nootropic properties have been properly scientifically substantiated. - IvarTJ
--&gt;
*'''Improving attention span''' can be as easy as taking nutrient supplements called [[w:nootropics|nootropics]].  Below are a few nutrients which generally increase a person's ability to concentrate and enhance cognition in other ways as well, such as improving reasoning capacity and memory,{{citation needed}} and which are available for sale at nutrition shops, drug stores and online, and are often available at grocery stores:
**'''[[w:DMAE|DMAE]]''' (dimethylaminoethanol) - originally available as a prescription drug called Deaner, used for helping hyperactive children concentrate, DMAE is now available as a nutrient over the counter. [http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2004/nov2004_aas_01.htm]
**'''[[w:Choline|Choline]]''' - the precursor to acetylcholine, one of the brain's primary [[w:neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]] essential for higher cognitive processes including reasoning and memory.
**'''[[w:Pantothenic acid|Vitamin B-5]]''' - used as a cofactor in the brain's production of acetylcholine and essential for that process. Also a key component of the [[w:Krebs cycle|Krebs acid cycle]], an important step in the [[w:aerobic metabolism|aerobic metabolism]] of carbohydrates into chemical energy in the form of ATP ([[w:Adenosine triphosphate|Adenosine triphosphate]]), and thus capable of increasing energy available to brain cells, improving mental stamina. 
*'''Focusing and refocusing''' - 
{{sectstub}}
*'''Presence of mind''' -- It's not a coincidence that International Brain Awareness Week follows National Procrastination week.
{{sectstub}}
*'''Removing, or getting away from, distractions''' -- distractions often cause people to procrastinate, by presenting the option to do something else, or by triggering deviations.  To prevent this from happening, minimize the chance of distractions occurring:
**'''Sometimes the thing causing the distraction can be removed.'''  If it is the TV or a video game, you can either turn it off, wear earplugs and/or hearing protectors, or go somewhere where you cannot hear it.  If you find yourself turning the TV or video game on and watching or playing when you really shouldn't, then perhaps the most effective approach would be to get rid of the TV and video game console (including the game cartridges) by giving them away, or taking them to the dump.  If it is a computer video game that has you hooked, maybe you can unload the program from your computer, and if that doesn't deter you, perhaps you can break the game disk!  Sometimes removing the source of the distraction isn't an option, usually when other people are involved...
**'''If the distraction isn't allowed to be removed''', or if the distractions are caused by people, such as by family or roommates, maybe you can find somewhere quiet in which to continue your project.  If there isn't anywhere in your home, then consider somewhere outside, in your car, at the library, etc.  For some people, renting an office or apartment for a place to escape to, or moving out and living alone are options to consider.
**'''Remove distracting thoughts'''. Perhaps you just can't begin your work because your mind is infested with distracting or energy-consuming thoughts, e.g. about a conflict with a friend or a &quot;better&quot; idea on how to use your time. Make a list of all these subjects - written down, you don't forget all your precious ideas and you can concentrate on them later. Never work on these thoughts first - they are the reason why you are procrastinating! If your hindering thoughts are too strong to have them removed or postponed by yourself, get the help of a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist.

==== Thinking rationally ====
&lt;!--
[needs opening paragraph]
--&gt;

*'''Thinking it through''' -- this is reasoning through an intended course of action, going over why each step needs to be done, and predicting what benefits will likely result if they are completed.  Also, making a mental list of the consequences that will be suffered if the tasks are not completed is part of this exercise.  The virtual carrot and the stick. The goal here is to work out one's reservations and talk oneself into doing what needs to be done, taking care not to get stuck in transition (such as setting a time limit).
*'''Consciously deciding what to do''' means switching off one's auto-pilot and actively applying intelligence with presence of mind: being aware of what you are doing and why, while remaining alert for opportunities to adapt and improve one's approach.  Don't just go through the motions, actively think about what you are doing. 

==== Improving problem solving skills ====

Try one or more of the techniques given in the [[w:Problem solving#Some Problem Solving Techniques|problem solving]] article.

=== Acquiring self-management skills ===
Since the tendency to procrastinate on a project is roughly proportional to the difficulty of the project, and since its difficulty is relative to our skill in handling such projects, it follows that improving our self-management and organizing skills (e.g. by breaking the project down into small parts) decreases relative difficulty of the project and therefore also reduces its likelihood of intimidating us into procrastinating it. Simply put, simple jobs aren't scary.  The more skilled you are at handling projects, the easier such jobs become.  

Self-management systems provide simple procedures to help focus efforts and may assist you in mastering your projects and your situation.  Nobody plans to fail, but many people fail to plan.  Self-management systems help to keep plans in clear focus.  Following are some components of a typical self-management system...

==== Goal vision ====
This is a form of goal setting, but more involved.  It entails choosing the goal and writing down the goal statement as usual.  Then the goal is mentally envisioned as vividly as possible, in as much detail as possible, as often as free time allows, and in every spare moment that becomes available.  The more the goal is thought about and the actions for achieving it mentally rehearsed, the more likely the goal will become a driving force of the person's behavior.  This method is best suited for important projects and life goals.

==== Planning ====

*Goal setting - write down your goal statement.  Be as detailed as you can.
*Setting selection criteria - what features must your plan have to be successful?  These are the plan's selection criteria.
*Generating strategies - figure out as many ways as you can that the goal could be achieved.  Research it if needed.  These are the action plans to choose from.
*Selecting a course of action - based on your selection criteria, pick a strategy, your plan of action.
*Develop the chosen plan in more detail - detail the plan down to the task level.
*Putting the plan into action - see below.

Also, see the article on [[w:goal (management)|managing goals]].

==== Scheduling ====
Schedules help organizing your daily and weekly life. Though some people profit more than others from a scheduled working life, two things are common to good schedules: They are be both feasible and flexible.

A feasible schedule allows you, for example, to begin working without forcing yourself to get up early. When studying for an important exam, beginning to study at 9 AM each morning is feasible. It allows you to stay up until midnight, depending on your sleeping needs, and lets you enjoy the social life in the evening. A typical student is mentally able to learn 6-8 hours per day for an exam, so he or she should schedule this amount of study time maximally.

A flexible schedule is a schedule which is immune to disturbances. You should schedule your work around such things as mealtime (in order not to be interrupted by colleagues which want to have dinner with you) or your favorite TV program which you may or may not watch. If you are working and a relative or a neighbor asks for your help, your schedule should allow for catching up with the lost time.

This said, a good schedule meets your abilities and provides enough reserve time. A schedule which you cannot trust is one you should not follow. In case of failure, you pay with your precious time.

==== Capturing tasks on a general to-do list ====

A general [[w:task list|to-do list]] is a place to store tasks until you are ready to schedule them.  It is typically a note pad that you keep handy (or a computer file that you keep open) for recording tasks as you think of them, to get them down in a central list where they won't be forgotten and can be easily referred to later.  Tasks are regularly chosen from the general to-do list for inclusion in a more specific daily task list (see below).

==== Prioritizing tasks ====

Each task has a relative importance (cutting the grass is less important than studying for an exam).  Tasks also have an expected duration (cutting the grass takes less time than studying for an exam).  Most tasks are also time-sensitive (cutting the grass is flexible whereas studying must be complete before a fixed time).  Prioritizing is the skill of reconciling these often conflicting attributes to determine which task ought to be performed first.  In the context of a college exam, you could prioritize items as follows:
*A: mandatory subjects. Knowing these certainly gives you a sufficient mark.
*B: items which improve your understanding of the &quot;A&quot; topics. Studying them gives you probably, but not certainly, a good mark.
*C: all other things. These will be studied last.

In an environment where more than one task is undertaken at once, and completion of some tasks is a prerequisite for starting other tasks, then a [[w:Critical path|Critical path]] is formed of tasks which have the highest priority.

==== Making and using a daily task list ====

At the end of the day, before you go to bed, or at the very beginning of the day, just after you wake up, prepare a to-do list for the day.  List all the tasks you need or plan to get done that day.  Place the tasks in order of priority, or grade their priority in the left-hand column with numbers.  Throughout the day, focus on executing each task on the list, one task at a time, highest priority tasks first. When you accomplish one of the items on the list, you ''check'' it off or ''cross'' it off.  


An alternative method is a task list, where each task is in a category of urgent/not urgent and important/not important. Take a sheet of paper and draw a 2x2 column table so that you have four each corresponding categories.

→ Whatever is in the category urgent/important: do it now, by yourself.

→ Whatever is in the category not urgent/important: delay/procrastinate (and enjoy), till category one is empty

→ Whatever is in the category urgent/not important: try to find someone to do it for you or at least help you do it.

→ Whatever is in the category not urgent/not important: forget it or accomplish one of these tasks as a gratification for a 
task completed in the first category, as these tasks have a tendency to be of the type &quot;cut grass&quot;, &quot;have barbecue&quot;, &quot;buy stuff I really like&quot; etc..


The traditional method is to write these on a piece of paper with a [[w:pen|pen]] or [[w:pencil|pencil]], usually on a note pad or clip-board.  Loose hole-punched paper is often used to allow such lists to be inserted into loose-leaf binders for record-keeping.  However, numerous software equivalents are now available, and many popular [[w:e-mail|e-mail]] clients include task list applications, as do most [[w:Personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

This is information about a wiki which one can edit as a personal organiser and store on the computer using just one file [[w:Tiddlywiki|A wiki-style possible personal organiser]]

==== Keeping a journal ====

Making a record of what you have done (while you are doing it) can help you evaluate your performance and spot trouble-areas in your abilities and behaviors, like procrastinating.  If you keep notes on task completion on your daily task lists, those can serve as your journal.  Simply make note of situations that arose that you handled, and any tasks or significant activities that you did that were not on the list.

=== Changing habits ===

In one sense, procrastination is the habit of not getting started.  It is not an action, so much as the lack of an action.  It is not a habit, so much as the lack of a habit:  the habit of getting started.  If one acquires the habit of getting started, then not getting started is no longer an issue.  Another word for &quot;get started&quot; is initiate.  It is the exact opposite of procrastinate, as long as it is applied to the right task, and not an evasion.

At the same time, an ongoing problem of procrastination is a complex of bad habits.  Luckily, old bad ways can be replaced by new good ways.  Acquiring new good habits through self-training is key to eliminating the bad habits of evasion and putting things off.

==== The 21-day principle ====

There are commercial workbooks available concerning this &quot;21-day rule&quot;, especially from Essi Systems, which provides workbooks. In general: If one can maintain a new habit for 21 days, the chances that this new routine would be forgotten are dim. This alludes to the [[w:detox|detox]] or deprivation methods in curing drug dependencies.&lt;!-- Other meanings concern the 21-day rule in the state of Virginia, which is a judicial matter... --&gt;

==== Identifying specific behaviors to change ====

==== Practicing replacement behaviors ====
&lt;!--
[needs opening paragraph]
--&gt;
*Scheduling time for practice

*Practicing new behaviors - mentally rehearse doing the task, and physically rehearse starting the task.

==== Quitting behavioral addictions ====

&lt;!--
Sometimes evading a task leads to addiction to another activity.  Initially it may be engaged in to forget one's troubles, but then becomes nearly obsessive/complusive in nature.  Even if they aren't acquired in this way, behavioral addictions can still cause procrastination by drawing the individual away from more important tasks.  

As with quitting cigarettes, going cold turkey is the most effective method of quitting.
*Video games - break the disks, erase the files. 
*Internet - cancel the ISP account.

=== Completing tasks ===

The above strategies are aimed at preventing procrastination, or replacing it while on &quot;down-time&quot;.  But no defense is infallible, and because the opportunities, temptations, and tendencies to put things off may occur at any time and place, due to a myriad factors, this calls for a collection of front-line coping and problem-solving methods to deal with these factors head-on.  Like a &quot;tackle&quot; box for tackling tasks and situations, right here, right now...

==== Snapping out of it ====

Procrastination is really nothing more than confined thinking.  All you see is the tiny little box you are trapped in, and all you can think about is how to escape.  But in reality, you are already free.  Free to work on your life's dreams, free to plan, free to achieve.  The trick to overcoming procrastination is to look to the horizon of your life (your dreams), travel there, and enjoy the journey along the way.  Focus on that always, and procrastination fades away like an early morning fog.

==== Maintaining perspective ====

Thinking about your dreams in terms of what you are willing to do right now, rather than what you'll do or be someday is a call to action.  Transformation is an active process.  You are on a journey this very moment.  The question is, are you on the right journey?  If you aren't going anywhere, or you are heading in the wrong direction (towards failure because you are putting things off), simply adjust course, and live the life you want to live. And if that means making a sacrifice, then go for it! Put in the time and effort required, using all the methods you've learned about above, all the while keeping in mind what it is you are working towards.  Always look to the horizon: focus on your dreams, how to make them come true, and actually make them come true one moment and one task at a time.

==== Maintaining grace under pressure ====
The most effective way to overcome fear is to face it. Veterans are generally more stable under combat conditions simply because they've been through it before. One method for overcoming fear of heights is practicing climbing ladders, for instance.  Stepping up to the first rung, repeated over and over, then two, repeated, and so on, proceeding to the next level only after mastering the one before.

Thrill activities may be good training in this regard. [[w:Roller-coaster|Roller-coaster]] rides, [[w:river rafting|river rafting]], and [[w:skydiving|skydiving]] can all lower sensitivity to perceived threats. Once you've jumped out of an airplane a few times, asking someone out on a date may not seem that intimidating anymore. Perhaps an easier way of getting over fear of talking to boys or girls is talking to them every chance you get.

Some drugs which are purported to cure phobias or treat anxiety have side effects that defeat the purpose if not used with extreme caution. [[w:Propranolol|Propranolol]], for instance, a [[w:beta blocker|beta blocker]] which helps to turn off the fight-flight response has the side effect of causing depression, because it is also an [[w:acetylcholine|acetylcholine]] [[w:inhibitor|inhibitor]].

==== Tending the task list at all times ====
The task list doesn't do any good if it is not referred to, or if it is not updated frequently.  Once using a task list and completing the items on it have become habit, placing a task on the list practically ensures it getting done.  Relying continuously on this key tool is a core management skill and executive process.  It is a standard method of operation in business for getting things done, and is a central component of competence.  Frequently forgetting to do something may be a consequence of not writing it down (and keeping track of it) in the first place.

==== Focusing on one task at-a-time ====

*'''Find the highest priority task''', and then concentrate yourself on that one task and ''forget'' all the others. Only when you have finished the first, move on to the next item on the list.

*'''Do something, but plan your time''': Do not just &quot;do something&quot;, but do something in a defined time frame. Wash the dishes for exactly 15 minutes, and write a letter for 30 minutes. Control your time with a timer (most modern [[w:cell phone|cell phone]]s have one); and fulfilling a (dreaded) task is a lot easier if you know how much time you'll spend.

==== Removing uncertainty ====

Often, a person will hesitate on or avoid a task because he or she just doesn't know where to begin.  How to complete the task isn't obvious, therefore making the task undoable in its present form. The key here is task selection.  Switch to the task's prerequisites: whatever other tasks need to be accomplished before this one can be started.

If you don't know what to do or how to do it, then your default task is to figure it out. If you don't know enough to solve a problem, then finding and learning the required information are the default tasks.

==== Dividing and conquering ====

*'''Breaking a project down''' into its component pieces and subpieces will eventually reach a level of detail where the specific actions that need to be taken can be seen.  Once action has started on a specific task, [[w:Flow (psychology)|flow]] may take over and the project may seem like it takes on a life of its own and actually becomes fun.  And time flies when you're having fun.
*'''Take bite-sized morsels''' -- rather than sit down to &quot;write your book&quot;, write one page.  Writing one page is easy.  When you are done with that page, then you can set about writing the next page. In general, try to plan your work in such a fashion that you've accomplished ''something'' in a 30 or 60 minute's time, not only ''a little bit of something''. Or, said in a better example: Instead of just learning hours and hours of chemistry, you specialize on a subject - like &quot;I have problems understanding pH values, so I'll read the relevant chapter about it. Then I make a pause.&quot; In this approach, you ''know'' that your ordeal has become manageable.

==== Easing into the task ====

You're faced with a task that will take you 20 hours, and you just aren't relishing it.  Seen as one big step, the chore is rather ominous.  Instead of approaching it like this, try committing to 5 minutes.  Now the pressure is off.  Five minutes is easy.  During that five minutes you will likely see that your evasion was pointless, and that the activity isn't as bad as you thought it was.  Once you begin a task and work on it for awhile, the initial stress goes away, and you are very likely to feel like continuing.

==== Stopping at the point of diminishing returns ====

*'''Avoiding [[w:perfectionism|perfectionism]]''' saves a lot of time. Try to do ''sufficient'' works, not perfect ones - a start is a start. [[w:Perfectionist|Perfectionist]]s aren't any more likely to put things off than other procrastinators, but they are likely to spend much more time putting the finishing touches on a task than they need to. By avoiding perfectionism and by striving for &quot;good&quot; or at least &quot;sufficient&quot; work, you lower the bar of your expectations. The lower the bar, the greater the chance that you succeed - and having success is the only thing in the world that can give you a better self-esteem.

==== Feedback and record keeping ====

*'''Check off tasks as they are completed''' -- in the left-hand margin of your task list, use check-marks to keep track of which tasks you have completed.  This provides a visual indicator of progress.

==== Scheduling breaks ====

Most people will, under normal circumstances, work at their best if they take a 10 minute break from their work each hour. Also make limits on your total daily work - when you're learning for an exam, you ''can't'' learn more than 6 to 8 hours a day. Being a good student or co-worker does not force you to suffer from overworking or sleeplessness. If you can't adhere to a maximal working time per day, then you should learn to begin earlier instead of trying to work faster.

&lt;!-- Perhaps recommend using [[w:melatonin|melatonin]] as a way to *force* sleep when one is done studying, instead of say turning on a video game for half an hour and winding up playing half the night. --&gt;
A lot of scientific work has shown that good learning - be it practical work that needs fine motorics of your hands or learning for a college exam - requires [[w:sleep|sleep]], as the brain seems to fine-tune and rearrange what you've learned the day before. Try it out: Learn to [[w:juggle|juggle]] balls or other [[w:Egg (food)|objects]]; and when you begin the next learning period the day after, you magically appear to have less trouble in spite of the fact that you did ''not'' practice during the night.

Remember: Like a musician has to ''play'' so that you ''hear'' the [[w:Rest (music)|rest]]s, you should work to let the pauses appear like pauses. &quot;I didn't work&quot; alone does not constitute a rest from work. It is the conscious doing of &quot;anti-work&quot; - when you did read texts to learn, then you don't read anything during your pause. When you worked half a day in your office, then escape your prison to enjoy the break.

==== Self-rewards ====

Another method of self-motivation is self-administered rewards - a method which reminds of [[w:reinforcement|reinforcement]] in psychology.  In this approach, even the smallest accomplishment deserves an appropriate reward, due ''after'' a task is completed, not ''before''. There are several approaches:

*'''Applying a reward structure''' for spending given amounts of time working on a chore.  For five hours of doing something you otherwise detest, make yourself a fine meal. For twenty hours, you go out for a movie, etc. You can even display your rewards symbolically: Take a post-it note, write down your reward, and with checkboxes define how many hours you want to work to achieve that reward. And remind yourself not to do the rewarding thing until you've filled all the checkboxes.
*'''Assigning someone else to give out the rewards''' helps remove the temptation of taking the reward anyway.  Of course they shouldn't be expected to provide the rewards - they should be unbribable, impartial people who effectively judge your efforts.

You should make a clear difference between the rewards and all the other things you receive (e.g. your meals at the cantina or watching the TV news). A good reward is something you enjoy and something you don't get every day. If the borderline blurs, a reward is no reward anymore; and so you tend to procrastinate even more because you get the &quot;reward&quot; anyway.

If you exercise a reward system strictly without cheating, there is a high chance that you'll be conquering your procrastination - this is because you get more and more accustomed to working and because you are needing less and smaller rewards over the time.

==== Recruiting peer support ====

*'''Do your work in a group''' and start being used to tell your colleagues what you did and what you did not do. Start having friends you care for - and then, begin to fulfill their expectations. This works best if you are working together - being lazy on the group work often means losing your colleagues. Get a feeling for teamwork and that everyone has to fulfill their part. Working in a team is exciting, too. There are always ideas stemming from other minds, and by using them you can extend the scope of your own work without expending a lot of your own energy.

*'''Form a group of Procrastinators Anonymous.''' You surely heard of other people who are &quot;lazy&quot;. Now: Try to contact them. Suffering from procrastination means that one often is not respected by others; and so they are very shy to tell you about their problems. Telling others that you have a problem is the first part of ''any'' cure; it connects your inner world to the perception of your friends and family members. Telling others about your problems raises the expectations of your fellow human beings, and last but not least fulfilling expectations is something very rewarding.

Seeking professional help should always be considered in addition to the above options.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Overcoming Procrastination}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

When procrastination grows so prevalent that it becomes a personality trait, its severity is said to be chronic.  In this form of procrastination, the problem has become a generalized habitual self-destructive pattern.  Putting tasks off has become a core habit.  The chronic procrastinator cannot get anything accomplished on time, resulting in serious career struggles, persistent financial problems, and a diminished quality of life.  Chronic procrastination may cause psychological disability and dysfunction in many dimensions of life, and may result in a persistent sense of [[w:shame|shame]] and low [[w:self-esteem|self-esteem]].  It may be that the procrastinator never learned the habit of completing tasks from his or her parents, and since some scientists assume that every form of [[w:behaviour|behaviour]] is a [[w:Learning|learned]] one, such an environment could have coined his or her habits.  The solution is for the procrastinator to rebuild his behavior complex upon the foundation of a new core habit of taking action.  Unfortunately, the procrastinator is prone to procrastinate from this too, so the condition of chronic procrastination usually continues until the procrastinator cannot bear it any longer, and seeks out help or spontaneously realizes the willingness and determination to change his or her ways.

Many individuals who consider themselves &quot;chronic procrastinators&quot; are actually suffering from an underlying mental health problem such as [[w:clinical depression|depression]] or Attention Deficit Disorder ([[w:Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]]).  These individuals often do not understand why they cannot &quot;get it together&quot;, and can become resigned to a life of struggle, frustration, and underachievement.  There is, unfortunately, widespread ignorance about this constituent to procrastination, even amongst mental health professionals, some of whom see procrastination as simply a &quot;bad habit&quot;. 

In addition, some people are predisposed to [[w:monotropism|monotropism]], a condition associated with [[w:autism|autism]] in which there is a tendency to allocate attention to one task at a time, and to be less able than usual to multi-task or allocate segments of time for different priorities as may be needed.  This may stem from many causes, including [[w:obsession|obsession]]al disorders and [[w:Asperger syndrome|Asperger syndrome]].  To these individuals, tasks perceived as less important or less urgent may be excessively deferred behind other tasks which receive undue attention or priority.

These disorders can be treated with medication and [[w:psychotherapy|psychotherapy]], whereby the individual can learn new behaviors and achieve a greatly improved quality of life.  Thus it is important for people who chronically struggle with debilitating procrastination to see a trained [[w:psychotherapy|therapist]] or [[w:psychiatry|psychiatrist]] to see if an underlying mental health issue may be present.

=== Procrastination and addiction ===

Severe procrastination, and the intense desire to escape from it, can lead to [[w:addiction|addiction]]s such as [[w:internet addiction|internet addiction]] or [[w:computer addiction|computer addiction]].  In this instance the individual has a compulsion to elude reality by surfing the web or playing video games (see [[w:Game addiction|Game addiction]]) or looking at pornography (see [[w:Pornography addiction|Pornography addiction]]).

Some of these relatively new phenomena are already being considered as valid psychiatric diagnoses by mental health professionals.

== Overview ==

Used in the form &quot;'''''Locomotor''''' object&quot;, e.g. &quot;Locomotor trunk&quot;, this causes the named object to lift up and move as though the wizard casting the spell were carrying it.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This spell is used numerous times in the books; it is used whenever a wizard needs to carry a large load at about a walking pace. When the spell is cast on an object (usually a trunk), the object lifts, and follows the spell-caster. 

== Analysis ==

The Locomotor spell seems to be speed limited: in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] uses this spell to bring Harry's trunk downstairs to where the rest of the Advance Guard are waiting; but it is then strapped to a broom for the high-speed journey to London, which probably means that the Locomotor spell is not strong enough to keep the trunk with Tonks at speed. It is apparently capable of lifting things up stairs, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] uses this spell to help him carry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Sybill  Trelawney]]'s trunks back up to her tower room, after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] sacks her in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Curiously, despite the apparent similarity to the spell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Locomotor Mortis|Locomotor Mortis]], first seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 13|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], the latter is the Leg-Locker jinx, meaning that the &quot;locomotor&quot; in that case must refer to the victim's legs. Clearly there must be some mental component that changes the effect from that of causing a body to move, as we would expect from a casual inspection of the jinx. We also note that the equivalent for moving a body, as seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 19|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mobilicorpus|Mobilicorpus]].

==1. Why is it important to read the labels in garments before laundering them? ==
The labels often include the manufacturer's recommended washing instructions as well as the types of material the garment is made from.  Instructions often include:
*Wash temperature
*Rinse temperature
*Ironing temperature, and sometimes ironing method (such as &quot;on the reverse side,&quot; or &quot;through a cloth&quot;).
*If the article is only suited for dry cleaning
*Drying method (tumble dry, drip dry, lay flat, etc.)

== 2. What is the proper way to prepare clothes for washing? ==
Remove all items from all pockets, zip up any zippers, fasten snaps and cover Velcro.  Also tie any strings back so they won't get tangled in the agitator or with other garments.  Remove any pins, your name tag, and the &quot;scribe&quot; or &quot;captain&quot; tag from your Pathfinder uniform before washing it.  Brush off any caked-on dirt.  Turn permanent press and garments with silk screened patterns (such as your field uniform) inside-out.  This will help the permanent press items from gathering lint, and it will protect the silk screening from wear.  

Place small items (such as a toddler's socks) and hosiery in a mesh bag before putting them in the washing machine.  This will prevent small items from being flushed out with the rinse water, and it will help prevent runs in hosiery.

Separate your laundry into like items:
* Whites from colors
* Color-fast from colors that may run
* Durables from delicates
* Very dirty from lightly soiled
* Lint givers (towels, sheets, flannels) from lint takers (corduroy, permanent press)

Wash these types separately, because each of the types of loads listed above need different settings on the washing machine.  Finally, pretreat any stains with a stain remover.

== 3. What types of clothes should be washed in hot, warm, and cold? ==

== 4. What precaution should be used when using chlorine bleach? What are the advantages of powdered oxygen bleach? Why should chlorine bleach and ammonia never be mixed? ==
'''Precautions:''' Bleach is a powerful chemical.  It can burn your skin, and it can dissolve cloth.  Do not get it on your skin; if you get it on your skin, wash it off right away.  If you spill it on your clothing, rinse immediately.  If too much bleach is used on cloth, the cloth will disintegrate.  Bleach will remove dye, so it must not be used on anything other than white cloth.

'''Powdered Oxygen Bleach:'''  The greatest advantage offered by powdered oxygen bleach is that it removes stains without the use of toxic chemicals.  For some stains, it works even better than chlorine bleach.  It brightens fabrics and can be used on upholstery and carpet.  It is non-toxic to humans and animals, and it breaks down into environmentally friendly components when the oxygen is released (the release of oxygen is what removes stains).

'''Mixing Bleach and Ammonia:''' Bleach and ammonia should '''NEVER''' be mixed because doing so causes a chemical reaction that releases poisonous gases.  The primary gas released is chlorine gas which was used as a chemical warfare agent during World War I.  Chlorine gas is ''highly'' toxic.  Other gases that can be released include nitrogen trichloride (which can explode in your face), and hydrazine (a component of rocket fuel).

== 5. What precautions should be taken when using liquid fabric softeners? ==
Liquid fabric softeners leave an invisible residue on the garments which prevents static cling, softens the fabric, and imparts a light fragrance.  It should only be used in the rinse cycle when no soap is present in the water, because it will react with soap and leaving a sticky, visible residue which resembles lint.  If your washing machine has a fabric softener dispenser use it and the fabric softener will be added at the right time in the cycle.  Otherwise, you must add it yourself at the beginning of the rinse cycle.  Be careful to not pour it directly on clothing, but rather into the water.

== 6. Know how to remove the following stains: ==
*'''Blood:''' If the blood is fresh, wipe it up with a sponge soaked in cool, salted water.  Then rinse with clear water.  If the blood is dried, use diluted hydrogen peroxide (one part peroxide, nine parts water).

*'''Chewing gum:''' Scrape off as much as possible first.  This is easier if you cool the gum down with ice cubes first, as that makes the gum brittle rather than gummy.  If the item is washable, apply a little kerosene or dry cleaning fluid and rinse it off.  You may have to repeat this several times.

*'''Crayons:''' Place the stained item in the freezer and leave it there until the crayon freezes.  You can then literally break the crayon stain out of the garment.  If there is any residue left after this, place the item on a paper towel or a blotter.  Then place a second paper towel (or blotter) on top of the item.  Apply a warm iron.  This will melt the crayon, and the paper towels should soak up the stain.  Change the paper towels as often as is necessary.

*'''Grass:''' If the garment is white, you may soak it in a solution of chlorinated bleach, then rinse and launder.  Otherwise, apply methylate alcohol (wood alcohol) to the stain, rinse in warm water, and then wash.  

*'''Grease:'''  Scrape away as much of the grease as you can.  Rub petroleum jelly into the stain, and then wash with a laundry powder or liquid detergent.  You can also try a spot removing product.

*'''Fruit:''' Try to remove the stain before it dries by rinsing it in cold water.  Otherwise, soak white garments in a chlorinated bleach solution.  For colored garments, treat with sodium percarbonate or a warm borax solution.  

*'''Ink:''' Place a paper towel under the stain and then spray the stain with hairspray.  Hairspray breaks up many types of ink, and you will want the paper towel there to catch the ink and not allow it to stain another part of the garment.  Hairspray may discolor the fabric though, so test in an inconspicuous place first.

*'''Rust:'''  Sprinkle the stain with salt and rub it in.  Then wet it with lemon juice and place it in the sun.  Keep the stain moistened with lemon juice until the stain disappears.

*'''Grape fruit:'''  Blot the stain first to remove any juice that's still there.  Then lightly dab the stain with cold water.

== 7. Why must stains be removed before laundering? ==
Putting a stained garment in a dryer will set the stain, making it even more difficult to remove.  ''Always'' remove stains before laundering.

== 8. How are woolen and wool like garments laundered? ==
Soak the garment in cold water for about 15 minutes.  You can use shampoo instead of detergent, or you can use detergent specially formulated for wool.  You can then change the water and soak the garment in clean water for another 15 minutes, or you can put it in a washing machine.  If you decide to put it in a washing machine, make sure to select a setting that will ''not'' agitate the load.  Also, be sure to use cold water.

Do ''not'' wring the wool out, and do not hang it up to dry.  You can roll it in a dry towel, or just lay it flat to dry, but be careful not to stretch the fabric while it is wet, or it may become misshapen.

== 9. Why is it important to remove garments from a dryer immediately when the cycle is complete? ==
When a garment is still hot from the dryer, hanging it immediately will prevent it from getting wrinkled.  If you forget to remove the garments from the dryer wrinkles will start to  set, try throwing a damp washcloth into the dryer with the clothing and run the dryer for a few minutes.  This ''may'' reduce the wrinkling.

== 10. What points are to be considered in selecting a washing machine, dryer and iron? How should these items be cared for? ==
The primary concern when selecting a washing machine or a dryer is financial.  Remember that the initial cost of the appliance is only a ''part'' of its operating cost though.  Buying an energy efficient appliance - even if it is more expensive - can save you a lot of money in the long run.

Another factor to consider is the amount of laundry you intend to do with the appliances.  If you are going to do laundry for a family of six, you will need a larger machine than if you are going to do laundry for a family of two.  

When selecting an iron, look for features that enhance safety.  Many irons today will shut themselves off automatically if left idling for too long.  

Wipe down your appliances regularly, and use appliance touch-up paint to repair any chips in the finish.  An untreated chip will lead to rust which can destroy your appliance.  Also be sure to clean out the lint trap of your dryer between every load, and clean the exhaust duct regularly.  Lint build-up in the exhaust duct is a fire hazard.

Do not iron over silkscreen designs, as this will melt the paint on the garment and stick to the iron.  This residue is extremely difficult to remove from an iron, and if left there, will transfer to any other garments you use it on.

== 11. Know what type of materials should be dried only on the lowest heat setting of a dryer. ==
Some items should not be dried in a dryer at all.  Particularly, any item containing foam rubber should not be placed in a dryer except on a no-heat setting, as it can easily burst into flame.

Knits and delicates (such as silk and nylon) should only be dried on the lowest heat settings.

== 12. Show a blouse or shirt that you have properly ironed. ==
The most obvious garment to show is your class A uniform.  This requirement can be met before a club inspection or on a campout (assuming the uniform has been washed by the Pathfinder ahead of time).

== 13. Properly launder and fold clothes for your family for one week. ==
The regular launderer in your family will thank you for this.  Make sure you tell that person &quot;You're welcome!&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">PHP was traditionally used to help web administrators automate various mundane tasks and to add dynamism to the web pages. However, PHP (in its modern incarnation) is capable of much more. It is now being used in ways traditional programming languages are used. It is now possible to remove PHP applications from the constraints of the Internet server. Now, PHP is being used to write GUI applications as well as command line applications. We shall now look at writing PHP applications for the command line.

==Getting the PHP-CLI==
If you are running Linux, you should get the corresponding package for the [http://www.php-cli.com PHP-CLI]. In Debian, it is just a matter of typing:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$&gt; apt-get install php5-cli
&lt;/source&gt;

In Windows, the CLI should be included with the PHP files. Refer to http://www.php-cli.com/ and http://www.php.net for more help.

==Initial Considerations==
We start off our command line applications with the following line :

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/php
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: You do not include this line in Windows!

This should be the first line of the file, as it tells Linux which interpreter to use for the file.

The next thing you should do, is to make the file executable. This is done by the following Unix command :

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
chmod +x filename.php
&lt;/source&gt;

==Getting Keyboard Input==
In order for us to retrieve keyboard input from the command line, we will need to use a little trick. Basically, we create a file handler to a special file called the Standard Input.

Here is the code to create this file handler :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$stdin = fopen(&quot;php://stdin&quot;, 'r');
&lt;/source&gt;

We can now use &lt;tt&gt;$stdin&lt;/tt&gt; just as if it were a normal file that we had opened for reading. (We obviously could not write to it, as it is Standard INPUT)

Here is a useful function to get user input :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 function getinput(){
    $stdin = fopen(&quot;php://stdin&quot;, 'r');
    $input = fgets($stdin, 1024);
    $input = trim($input);
    fclose($stdin);
    return $input;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Output Formatting==
The main consideration to make when formatting output in command line programming as opposed to generating HTML output is that a new line is not created by a &lt;tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag, in fact, any HTML tags you put into the output, will simply be displayed as plain text.

In order to create a new line in the command line, we need to use a control character, \n . Another useful function when doing command line programming is this :

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 function output($message){
    print $message.&quot;\n&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Recap of Section 1.3 ===


In the previous section, we discussed how adding a damping component (e. g. a dashpot) to an unforced, simple spring-mass system would affect the response of the system.  In particular, we learned that adding the dashpot to the system changed the natural frequency of the system from   to a new damped natural frequency , and how this change made the response of the system change from a constant sinusoidal response to an exponentially-decaying sinusoid in which the system either had an under-damped, over-damped, or critically-damped response.

In this section, we will digress a bit by going back to the simple (undamped) oscillator system of the previous section, but this time, a constant force will be applied to this system, and we will investigate this system’s performance at low and high frequencies as well as at resonance.  In particular, this section will start by introducing the characteristics of the spring and mass elements of a spring-mass system, introduce electrical analogs for both the spring and mass elements, learn how these elements combine to form the mechanical impedance system, and reveal how the impedance can describe the mechanical system’s overall response characteristics.  Next, power dissipation of the forced, simple spring-mass system will be discussed in order to corroborate our use of electrical circuit analogs for the forced, simple spring-mass system.  Finally, the characteristic responses of this system will be discussed, and a parameter called the amplification ratio (AR) will be introduced that will help in plotting the resonance of the forced, simple spring-mass system.

=== Forced Spring Element ===

Taking note of Figs. 1, we see that the equation of motion for a spring that has some constant, external force being exerted on it is...

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat{F} =  s_M \Delta \hat{x}\qquad (1.4.1) \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;   

where &lt;math&gt; s_M \,&lt;/math&gt; is the mechanical stiffness of the spring. 






Note that in Fig. 1(c), force &lt;math&gt;\hat{F}&lt;/math&gt; flows constantly (i.e. without decreasing) throughout a spring, but the velocity &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; of the spring decrease from  &lt;math&gt;\hat{u_1}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\hat{u_2}&lt;/math&gt; as the force flows through the spring.  This concept is important to know because it will be used in subsequent sections.  


In practice, the stiffness of the spring &lt;math&gt; s_M \,&lt;/math&gt;, also called the spring constant, is usually expressed as &lt;math&gt; C_M = \frac {1}{s_M}\, &lt;/math&gt; , or the mechanical compliance of the spring.  Therefore, the spring is very stiff if &lt;math&gt; s_M \,&lt;/math&gt; 
is large &lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \; C_M  &lt;/math&gt; is small.  Similarly, the spring is very loose or “bouncy” if &lt;math&gt; s_M \,&lt;/math&gt; is small &lt;math&gt; \Rightarrow \; C_M  &lt;/math&gt;  is large.  Noting that force and velocity are analogous to voltage and current, respectively, in electrical systems, it turns out that the characteristics of a spring are analogous to the characteristics of a capacitor in relation to, and, so we can model the “reactiveness” of a spring similar to the reactance of a capacitor if we let &lt;math&gt; C = C_M  \,&lt;/math&gt; as shown in Fig. 2 below.



&lt;math&gt; Reactance\ of\ Capacitor:\ X_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C} \qquad (1.4.2a) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Reactance\ of\ Spring:\ X_{MS} = \frac{1}{j\omega C_M} \qquad(1.4.2b) &lt;/math&gt;



=== Forced Mass Element ===


Taking note of Fig. 3, the equation for a mass  that has constant, external force being exerted on it is...



&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \hat{F} = M_M \hat{a} = M_M \hat{\dot{u}} = M_M \hat{\ddot{x}} \qquad  (1.4.3)   &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;





If the mass &lt;math&gt; M_M \, &lt;/math&gt; can vary its value and is oscillating in a mechanical system at max amplitude &lt;math&gt; A_M \, &lt;/math&gt; such that the input the system receives is constant at frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega \, &lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt; M_M \, &lt;/math&gt;  increases, the harder it will be for the system to move the mass at &lt;math&gt; \omega \, &lt;/math&gt;  at &lt;math&gt; A_M \, &lt;/math&gt;  until, eventually, the mass doesn’t oscillate at all .  Another equivalently way to look at it is to let &lt;math&gt; \omega \, &lt;/math&gt; vary and hold &lt;math&gt; M_M \, &lt;/math&gt;  constant.  Similarly, as &lt;math&gt; \omega \, &lt;/math&gt; increases, the harder it will be to get &lt;math&gt; M_M \, &lt;/math&gt; to oscillate at  &lt;math&gt; \omega \, &lt;/math&gt;  and keep the same amplitude &lt;math&gt; A_M \, &lt;/math&gt;  until, eventually, the mass doesn’t oscillate at all.  Therefore, as &lt;math&gt; \omega \, &lt;/math&gt; increases, the “reactiveness” of mass &lt;math&gt; M_M \, &lt;/math&gt;  decreases (i.e. &lt;math&gt; M_M \, &lt;/math&gt;  starts to move less and less).  Recalling the analogous relationship of force/voltage and velocity/current, it turns out that the characteristics of a mass are analogous to an inductor.  Therefore, we can model the “reactiveness” of a mass similar to the reactance of an inductor if we let &lt;math&gt; L = M_M \, &lt;/math&gt;  as shown in Fig. 4.





&lt;math&gt; Reactance\ of\ Inductor:\ X_L = j\omega L \qquad (1.4.4a) &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; Reactance\ of\ Mass:\ X_{MM} = j\omega L_M \qquad(1.4.4b) &lt;/math&gt;




=== Mechanical Impedance of Spring-Mass System ===



As mentioned twice before, force is analogous to voltage and velocity is analogous to current.  Because of these relationships, this implies that the mechanical impedance for the forced, simple spring-mass system can be expressed as follows:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \hat{Z_M} = \frac{\hat{F}}{\hat{u}} \qquad (1.4.5) \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


In general, an undamped, spring-mass system can either be “spring-like” or “mass-like”.  “Spring-like” systems can be characterized as being “bouncy” and they tend to grossly overshoot their target operating level(s) when an input is introduced to the system.  These type of systems relatively take a long time to reach steady-state status.  Conversely, “mass-like” can be characterized as being “lethargic” and they tend to not reach their desired operating level(s) for a given input to the system...even at steady-state!  In terms of complex force and velocity, we say that “ force LEADS velocity” in mass-like systems and “velocity LEADS force” in spring-like systems (or equivalently “ force LAGS velocity” in mass-like systems and “velocity LAGS force” in spring-like systems).  Figs. 5 shows this relationship graphically.







=== Power Transfer of a Simple Spring-Mass System ===

From electrical circuit theory, the average complex power &lt;math&gt; P_E \,&lt;/math&gt; dissipated in a system is expressed as ...


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; P_E = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{Re}\left\{ \hat{V}\hat{I^*} \right\} \qquad (1.4.6)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
                                    

where &lt;math&gt; \hat{V}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \hat{I^*}\;&lt;/math&gt; represent the (time-invariant) complex voltage and complex conjugate current, respectively.   Analogously, we can express the net power dissipation of the mechanical system &lt;math&gt; \hat{P}_E\,&lt;/math&gt; in general along with the power dissipation of a spring-like system &lt;math&gt; \hat{P}_{MS}\,&lt;/math&gt; or mass-like system &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}_{MM}\,&lt;/math&gt; as...


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \hat{P}_E = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{Re}\left\{ \hat{F}\hat{u^*} \right\} \qquad \qquad \qquad (1.4.7a)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \hat{P}_{MS} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{Re}\left\{\hat{F} \left( \frac{j\hat{F}\omega}{s_M} \right)^* \right\} \qquad (1.4.7b) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \hat{P}_{MM} = \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{Re}\left\{\hat{F} \left( \frac{\hat{F}}{j \omega M_M} \right)^* \right\} \qquad (1.4.7c) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



In equations 1.4.7, we see that the product of complex force and velocity are purely imaginary.  Since reactive elements, or commonly called, lossless elements, cannot dissipate energy, this implies that the net power dissipation of the system is zero.  This means that in our simple spring-mass system, power can only be (fully) transferred back and forth between the spring and the mass.  But this is precisely what a simple spring-mass system does.  Therefore, by evaluating the power dissipation, this corroborates the notion of using electrical circuit elements to model mechanical elements in our spring-mass system.


=== Responses For Forced, Simple Spring-Mass System ===


Fig. 6 below illustrates a simple spring-mass system with a force exerted on the mass.






This system has response characteristics similar to that of the undamped oscillator system, with the only difference being that at steady-state, the system oscillates at the constant force magnitude and frequency versus exponentially decaying to zero in the unforced case.  Recalling equations 1.4.2b and 1.4.4b, letting   be the natural (resonant) frequency of the spring-mass system, and letting &lt;math&gt; \omega_n \,&lt;/math&gt; be frequency of the input received by the system, the characteristic responses of the forced spring-mass systems are presented graphically in Figs. 7 below.



&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Figs.7}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



=== Amplification Ratio ===

The amplification ratio is a useful parameter that allows us to plot the frequency of the spring-mass system with the purports of revealing the resonant freq of the system solely based on the force experienced by each, the spring and mass elements of the system.  In particular, AR is the magnitude of the ratio of the complex force experienced by the spring and the complex force experienced by the mass, i.e. 


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{AR} = \left| \frac{s_M \hat{x}}{M_M \hat{a}} \right| = \left| \frac{s_M \hat{x}}{M_M \hat{\dot{u}}} \right| = \left| \frac{s_M \hat{x}}{M_M \hat{\ddot{x}}} \right|  \qquad (1.4.8) \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


If we let &lt;math&gt; \zeta = \frac{\omega}{\omega_n} &lt;/math&gt;, be the frequency ratio, it turns out that AR can also be expressed as...

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{AR} = \frac{1}{1 - \zeta^2} \qquad (1.4.9)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; .


AR will be at its maximum when &lt;math&gt; \left| X_{MS} \right| = \left| X_{MM} \right| \,&lt;/math&gt;.  This happens precisely when  &lt;math&gt; \zeta^2 = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt; .  An example of an AR plot is shown below in Fig 8.

==Introduction==
The importance of flow excited acoustic resonance lies in the large number of applications in which it occurs. Sound production in organ pipes, compressors, transonic wind tunnels, and open sunroofs are only a few examples of the many applications in which flow excited resonance of Helmholtz resonators can be found.[4] An instability of the fluid motion coupled with an acoustic resonance of the cavity produce large pressure fluctuations that are felt as increased sound pressure levels. 
Passengers of road vehicles with open sunroofs often experience discomfort, fatigue, and dizziness from self-sustained oscillations inside the car cabin. This phenomenon is caused by the coupling of acoustic and hydrodynamic flow inside a cavity which creates strong pressure oscillations in the passenger compartment in the 10 to 50 Hz frequency range. Some effects experienced by vehicles with open sunroofs when buffeting include: dizziness, temporary hearing reduction, discomfort, driver fatigue, and in extreme cases nausea. The importance of reducing interior noise levels inside the car cabin relies primarily in reducing driver fatigue and improving sound transmission from entertainment and communication devices. 
This Wikibook page aims to theoretically and graphically explain the mechanisms involved in the flow-excited acoustic resonance of Helmholtz resonators. The interaction between fluid motion and acoustic resonance will be explained to provide a thorough explanation of the behavior of self-oscillatory Helmholtz resonator systems. As an application example, a description of the mechanisms involved in sunroof buffeting phenomena will be developed at the end of the page.

=Feedback loop analysis=
As mentioned before, the self-sustained oscillations of a Helmholtz resonator in many cases is a continuous interaction of hydrodynamic and acoustic mechanisms. In the frequency domain, the flow excitation and the acoustic behavior can be represented as transfer functions. The flow can be decomposed into two volume velocities.

Figure 1 shows the feedback loop of these two volume velocities. 

&lt;center&gt;'''''Figure 1'''''&lt;/center&gt;

=Acoustical characteristics of the resonator=

==Lumped parameter model==
The lumped parameter model of a Helmholtz resonator consists of a rigid-walled volume open to the environment through a small opening at one end. The dimensions of the resonator in this model are much less than the acoustic wavelength, in this way allowing us to model the system as a lumped system.

where re is the equivalent radius of the orifice.

Figure 2 shows a sketch of a Helmholtz resonator on the left, the mechanical analog on the middle section, and the electric-circuit analog on the right hand side. As shown in the Helmholtz resonator drawing, the air mass flowing through an inflow of volume velocity includes the mass inside the neck (Mo) and an end-correction mass (Mend). Viscous losses at the edges of the neck length are included as well as the radiation resistance of the tube. The electric-circuit analog shows the resonator modeled as a forced harmonic oscillator. [1] [2][3]

&lt;center&gt;'''''Figure 2'''''&lt;/center&gt;

V: cavity volume

&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;: ambient density

c: speed of sound

S: cross-section area of orifice

K: stiffness

&lt;math&gt;M_a&lt;/math&gt;: acoustic  mass

&lt;math&gt;C_a&lt;/math&gt;: acoustic  compliance


The equivalent stiffness K is related to the potential energy of the flow compressed inside the cavity. For a rigid wall cavity it is approximately:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; K =(\frac{\rho c^2}{V})S^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The equation that describes the Helmholtz resonator is the following:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; S \hat{P}_e =\frac{\hat{q}_e}{j\omega S}(-\omega ^2 M + j\omega R + K) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hat{P}_e&lt;/math&gt;: excitation pressure

M: total mass (mass inside neck Mo plus end correction, Mend)

R: total resistance (radiation loss plus viscous loss)


From the electrical-circuit we know the following:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; M_a = \frac{L \rho}{S} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; C_a = \frac{\pi V}{\rho c^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; L ' = \ L + \ 1.7 \ re &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The main cavity resonance parameters are resonance frequency and quality factor which can be estimated using the parameters explained above (assuming free field radiation, no viscous losses and leaks, and negligible wall compliance effects) 


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \omega_r^2 = \frac{1}{M_a C_a} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; f_r = c 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{S}{L' V}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


The sharpness of the resonance peak is measured by the quality factor Q of the Helmholtz resonator as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q = 2 \pi \sqrt{V (\frac{L'} {S})^3} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;math&gt; f_r&lt;/math&gt;: resonance frequency in Hz

&lt;math&gt;\omega_r&lt;/math&gt;: resonance frequency in radians 

L: length of neck

L': corrected length of neck 

From the equations above, the following can be deduced:

-The greater the volume of the resonator, the lower the resonance frequencies.
 
-If the length of the neck is increased, the resonance frequency 
decreases.

==Production of self-sustained oscillations==
The acoustic field interacts with the unstable hydrodynamic flow above the open section of the cavity, where the grazing flow is continuous. The flow in this section separates from the wall at a point where the acoustic and hydrodynamic flows are strongly coupled. [5]

The separation of the boundary layer at the leading edge of the cavity (front part of opening from incoming flow) produces strong vortices in the main stream. As observed in Figure 3, a shear layer crosses the cavity orifice and vortices start to form due to instabilities in the layer at the leading edge.

&lt;center&gt;'''''Figure 3'''''&lt;/center&gt;

From Figure 3, L is the length of the inner cavity region, d denotes the diameter or length of the cavity length, D represents the height of the cavity, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; describes the gradient length in the grazing velocity profile (boundary layer thickness).

The velocity in this region is characterized to be unsteady and the perturbations in this region will lead to self-sustained oscillations inside the cavity. Vortices will continually form in the opening region due to the instability of the shear layer at the leading edge of the opening.

=Applications to Sunroof Buffeting=
==How are vortices formed during buffeting?==
In order to understand the generation and convection of vortices from the shear layer along the sunroof opening, the animation below has been developed. At a certain range of flow velocities, self-sustained oscillations inside the open cavity (sunroof) will be predominant. During this period of time, vortices are shed at the trailing edge of the opening and continue to be convected along the length of the cavity opening as pressure inside the cabin decreases and increases. Flow visualization experimentation is one method that helps obtain a qualitative understanding of vortex formation and conduction.

The animation below, shows in the middle, a side view of a car cabin with the sunroof open. As the air starts to flow at a certain mean velocity Uo, air mass will enter and leave the cabin as the pressure decreases and increases again. At the right hand side of the animation, a legend shows a range of colors to determine the pressure magnitude inside the car cabin. At the top of the animation, a plot of circulation and acoustic cavity pressure versus time for one period of oscillation is shown. The symbol x moving along the acoustic cavity pressure plot is synchronized with pressure fluctuations inside the car cabin and with the legend on the right. For example, whenever the x symbol is located at the point where t=0 (when the acoustic cavity pressure is minimum) the color of the car cabin will match that of the minimum pressure in the legend (blue).


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:theplot.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;


The perturbations in the shear layer propagate with a velocity of the order of 1/2Uo which is half the mean inflow velocity. [5] After the pressure inside the cavity reaches a minimum (blue color) the air mass position in the neck of the cavity reaches its maximum outward position. At this point, a vortex is shed at the leading edge of the sunroof opening (front part of sunroof in the direction of inflow velocity). As the pressure inside the cavity increases (progressively to red color) and the air mass at the cavity entrance is moved inwards, the vortex is displaced into the neck of the cavity. The maximum downward displacement of the vortex is achieved when the pressure inside the cabin is also maximum and the air mass in the neck of the Helmholtz resonator (sunroof opening) reaches its maximum downward displacement. For the rest of the remaining half cycle, the pressure cavity falls and the air below the neck of the resonator is moved upwards. The vortex continues displacing towards the downstream edge of the sunroof where it is convected upwards and outside the neck of the resonator. At this point the air below the neck reaches its maximum upwards displacement.[4] And the process starts once again.

==How to identify buffeting==
Flow induced tests performed over a range of flow velocities are helpful to determine the change in sound pressure levels (SPL) inside the car cabin as inflow velocity is increased. The following animation shows typical auto spectra results from a car cabin with the sunroof open at various inflow velocities. At the top right hand corner of the animation, it is possible to see the inflow velocity and resonance frequency corresponding to the plot shown at that instant of time. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:curve.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

It is observed in the animation that the SPL increases gradually with increasing inflow velocity. Initially, the levels are below 80 dB and no major peaks are observed. As velocity is increased, the SPL increases throughout the frequency range until a definite peak is observed around a 100 Hz and 120 dB of amplitude. This is the resonance frequency of the cavity at which buffeting occurs. As it is observed in the animation, as velocity is further increased, the peak decreases and disappears.
In this way, sound pressure level plots versus frequency are helpful in determining increased sound pressure levels inside the car cabin to find ways to minimize them. Some of the methods used to minimize the increased SPL levels achieved by buffeting include: notched deflectors, mass injection, and spoilers.

=Moving Coil Transducer=
The purpose of the acoustic transducer is to convert electrical energy into acoustic energy. Many variations of acoustic transducers exist, although the most common is the moving coil-permanent magnet transducer. The classic loudspeaker is of the moving coil-permanent magnet type.


The classic electrodynamic loudspeaker driver can be divided into three key components:

1) The Magnet Motor Drive System

2) The Loudspeaker Cone System

3) The Loudspeaker Suspension

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:loud_speaker.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 1 Cut-away of a moving coil-permanent magnet loudspeaker&lt;/center&gt;

==The Magnet Motor Drive System==
The main purpose of the Magnet Motor Drive System is to establish a symmetrical magnetic field in which the voice coil will operate.  The Magnet Motor Drive System is comprised of a front focusing plate, permanent magnet, back plate, and a pole piece.  In figure 2, the assembled drive system is illustrated.  In most cases, the back plate and the pole piece are built into one piece called the yoke.  The yoke and the front focusing plate are normally made of a very soft cast iron.  Iron is a material that is used in conjunction with magnetic structures because the iron is easily saturated when exposed to a magnetic field. Notice in figure 2, that an air gap was intentionally left between the front focusing plate and the yoke. The magnetic field is coupled through the air gap. The magnetic field strength (B) of the air gap is typically optimized for uniformity across the gap. [1]

&lt;center&gt;Figure 2 Permanent Magnet Structure&lt;/center&gt;

When a coil of wire with a current flowing is place inside the permanent magnetic field, a force is produced. B is the magnetic field strength, l is the length of the coil, and I is the current flowing through the coil.

&lt;math&gt;F = Bli&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Magnet2.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 3 Voice Coil Mounted in Permanent Magnetic Structure&lt;/center&gt;

The coil is excited with the AC signal that is intended for sound reproduction, when the changing magnetic field of the coil interacts with the permanent magnetic field then the coil moves back and forth in order to reproduce the input signal.  The coil of a loudspeaker is known as the voice coil. 

&lt;center&gt;Figure 4 Photograph - Voice Coil&lt;/center&gt;

==The Loudspeaker Cone System==

On a typical loudspeaker, the cone serves the purpose of creating a larger radiating area allowing more air to be moved when excited by the voice coil.  The cone serves a piston that is excited by the voice coil. The cone then displaces air creating a sound wave.  In an ideal environment, the cone should be infinitely rigid and have zero mass, but in reality neither is true.  Cone materials vary from carbon fiber, paper, bamboo, and just about any other material that can be shaped into a stiff conical shape.  The loudspeaker cone is a very critical part of the loudspeaker. Since the cone is not infinitely rigid, it tends to have different types of resonance modes form at different frequencies, which in turn alters and colors the reproduction of the sound waves. The shape of the cone directly influences the directivity and frequency response of the loudspeaker.  When the cone is attached to the voice coil, a large gap above the voice coil is left exposed.  This could be a problem if foreign particles make their way into the air gap of the voice coil and the permanent magnet structure.  The solution to this problem is to place what is known as a dust cap on the cone to cover the air gap. Below a figure of the cone and dust cap are shown.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:loud_cone.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 6 Cone and Dust Cap attached to Voice Coil&lt;/center&gt;

==The Loudspeaker Suspension==
Most moving coil loudspeakers have a two piece suspension system, also known as a flexure system.  The combination of the two flexures allows the voice coil to maintain linear travel as the voice coil is energized and provide a restoring force for the voice coil system. The two piece system consists of large flexible membrane surrounding the outside edge of the cone, called the surround, and an additional flexure connected directly to the voice coil, called the spider.  The surround has another purpose and that is to seal the loudspeaker when mounted in an enclosure.  Commonly, the surround is made of a variety of different materials, such as, folded paper, cloth, rubber, and foam.  Construction of the spider consists of different woven cloth or synthetic materials that are compressed to form a flexible membrane. The following two figures illustrate where the suspension components are physically at on the loudspeaker and how they function as the loudspeaker operates. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:loud_suspension.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 7 Loudspeaker Suspension System&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:loudspk.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Figure 8 Moving Loudspeaker &lt;/center&gt;

==Modeling the Loudspeaker as a Lumped System==
Before implementing a loudspeaker into a specific application, a series of parameters characterizing the loudspeaker must be extracted. The equivalent circuit of the loudspeaker is key when developing enclosures. The circuit models all aspects of the loudspeaker through an equivalent electrical, mechanical, and acoustical circuit. Figure 9 shows how the three equivalent circuits are connected. The electrical circuit is comprised of the DC resistance of the voice coil, Re, the imaginary part of the voice coil inductance, Le, and the real part of the voice coil inductance, Revc. The mechanical system has electrical components that model different physical parameters of the loudspeaker. In the mechanical circuit, Mm, is the electrical capacitance due to the moving mass, Cm, is the electrical inductance due to the compliance of the moving mass, and Rm, is the electrical resistance due to the suspension system. In the acoustical equivalent circuit, Ma models the air mass and Ra models the radiation impedance[2]. This equivalent circuit allows insight into what parameters change the characteristics of the loudspeaker. Figure 10 shows the electrical input impedance as a function of frequency developed using the equivalent circuit of the loudspeaker.

==Noise in Hydraulic Systems==
Hydraulic systems are the most preferred source of power transmission in most of the industrial and mobile equipments due to their power density, compactness, flexibility, fast response and efficiency. The field hydraulics and pneumatics is also known as 'Fluid Power Technology'. Fluid power systems have a wide range of applications which include industrial, off-road vehicles, automotive system and aircrafts. But, one of the main problems with the hydraulic systems is the noise generated by them. The health and safety issues relating to noise have been recognized for many years and legislation is now placing clear demands on manufacturers to reduce noise levels [1]. Hence, noise reduction in hydraulic systems demands lot of attention from the industrial as well as academic researchers. It needs a good understanding of how the noise is generated and propagated in a hydraulic system in order to reduce it.

== Sound in fluids ==
The speed of sound in fluids can be determined using the following relation.

&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt {\frac{K}{\rho}} &lt;/math&gt;
where K - fluid bulk modulus, &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt;- fluid density, c - velocity of sound

Typical value of bulk modulus range from '''2e9 to 2.5e9 N/m2'''. For a particular oil, with a density of '''889 kg/m3''',
 
speed of sound &lt;math&gt; c = \sqrt {\frac{2e9}{889}}= 1499.9 m/s &lt;/math&gt;

== Source of Noise ==
The main source of noise in hydraulic systems is the pump which supplies the flow. Most of the pumps used are positive displacement pumps. Of the positive dispalcement pumps, axial piston swash plate type is mostly preferred due to their controllability and efficiency. 

The noise generation in an axial piston pump can be classifeid under two categories 
(i) fluidborne nose and

(ii) Structureborne noise

==&lt;center&gt;Fluidborne Noise (FBN) &lt;/center&gt;==

Among the positive displacement pumps, highest levels of FBN are generated by axial piston pumps and lowest levels by screw pumps and in between these lie the external gear pump and vane pump [1]. The discussion in this page is mainly focused on '''axial piston swash plate type pumps'''. An axial piston pump has a fixed number of displacement chambers arranged in a circular pattern separated from each other by an angular pitch equal to &lt;math&gt; \phi = \frac {360}{n} &lt;/math&gt; where n is the number of displacement chambers. As each chamber discharges a specific volume of fluid, the discharge at the pump outlet is sum of all the discharge from the individual chambers. The discontinuity in flow between adjacent chambers results in a kinematic flow ripple. The amplitude of the kinematic ripple can be theoretically determined given the size of the pump and the number of displament chambers. The kinematic ripple is the main cause of the fluidborne noise. The kinematic ripples is a theoretical value. The actual '''flow ripple''' at the pump outlet is much larger than the theoretical value because the '''kinematic ripple''' is combined with a '''compressibility component''' which is due to the fluid compressibility. These ripples (also referred as flow pulsations) generated at the pump are transmitted through the pipe or flexible hose connected to the pump and travel to all parts of the hydraulic circuit. 

The pump is considered an ideal flow source. The pressure in the system will be decided by resistance to the flow or otherwise known as system load. The flow pulsations result in pressure pulsations. The pressure pulsations are superimposed on the mean system pressure. Both the '''flow and pressure pulsations''' easily travel to all part of the circuit and affect the performance of the components like control valve and actuators in the system and make the component vibrate, sometimes even resonate. This vibration of system components adds to the noise generated by the flow pulsations. The transmission of FBN in the circuit is discussed under transmission below.

A typical axial piston pump with 9 pistons running at 1000 rpm can produce a sound pressure level of more than 70 dBs.

==&lt;center&gt; Structureborne Noise (SBN)&lt;/center&gt;==

In swash plate type pumps, the main sources of the structureborne noise are the fluctuating forces and moments of the swas plate. These fluctuating forces arise as a result of the varying pressure inside the displacement chamber. As the displacing elements move from suction stroke to discharge stroke, the pressure varies accordingly from few bars to few hundred bars. This pressure changes are reflected on the displacement elements (in this case, pistons) as forces and these force are exerted on the swash plate causing the swash plate to vibrate. This vibration of the swash plate is the main cause of '''structureborne noise'''. There are other components in the system which also vibrate and lead to structureborne noise, but the swash is the major contributor.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Pump_noise.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt; ''' Fig. 1 shows an exploded view of axial piston pump. Also the flow pulsations and the oscillating forces on the swash plate, which cause FBN and SBN respectively are shown for one revolution of the pump. '''&lt;/center&gt;

==Transmission==

==='''FBN'''===

The transmission of FBN is a complex phenomenon. Over the past few decades, considerable amount of research had gone into mathematical modeling of pressure and flow transient in the circuit. This involves the solution of wave equations, with piping treated as a distributed parameter system known as a transmission line [1] &amp; [3].

Lets consider a simple pump-pipe-loading valve circuit as shown in Fig. 2. The pressure and flow ripple at ay location in the pipe can be described by the relations:


&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac {}{} P = Ae^{-k x} + Be^{-k x}&lt;/math&gt; .........(1) &lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; Q = \frac {1}{Z_{0}}(Ae^{-k x} - Be^{-k x})&lt;/math&gt;.....(2)&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} B &lt;/math&gt; are frequency dependent complex coefficients which are directly proportional to pump (source) flow ripple, but also functions of the source impedance &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} Z_{s}&lt;/math&gt;, characteristic impedance of the pipe &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} Z_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and the termination impedance &lt;math&gt;\frac {}{} Z_{t}&lt;/math&gt;. These impedances ,usually vary  as the system operating pressure and flow rate changes, can be determined experimentally.

&lt;center&gt; '''Fig.2 Schematic of a pump connected to a hydraulic line '''&lt;/center&gt;





For complex systems with several system compenents, the pressure and flow ripples are estimated using the transformation matrix approach. For this, the system compenents can be treated as lumped impedances (a throttle valve or accumulator), or distributed impedances (flexible hose or silencer). Various software packages are available today to predict the pressure pulsations.

==='''SBN'''===

The transmission of SBN follows the classic source-path-noise model. The vibrations of the swash plate, the main cause of SBN, is transferred to the pump casing which encloses all the rotating group in the pump including displacement chambers (also known as cylinder block), pistons and the swash plate. The pump case, apart from vibrating itself, transfers the vibration down to the mount on which the pump is mounted. The mount then passes the vibrations down to the main mounted structure or the vehicle. Thus the SBN is transferred from the swash plate to the main strucuture or vehicle via pumpcasing and mount. 

Some of the machine structures, along the path of transmission, are good at transmitting this vribational energy and they even resonate and reinforce it. By converting only a fraction of 1% of the pump structureborne noise into sound, a member in the transmission path could radiate more ABN than the pump itself [4].

==Airborne noise (ABN)==
Both FBN and SBN , impart high fatigue loads on the system components and make them vibrate. All of these vibrations are radiated as '''airborne noise''' and can be heard by a human operator. Also, the flow and pressure pulsations make the system components such as a control valve to resonate. This vibration of the particular component again radiates airborne noise.

==Noise reduction==


The reduction of the noise radiated from the hydraulic system can be approached in two ways.

(i) '''Reduction at Source''' - which is the reduction of noise at the pump. A large amount of open literature are availabale on the reduction techniques with some techniques focusing on reducing FBN at source and others focusing on SBN. Reduction in FBN and SBN at the source has a large influence on the ABN that is radiated. Even though, a lot of progress had been made in reducing the FBN and SBN separately, the problem of noise in hydraulic systems is not fully solved and lot need to be done. The reason is that the FBN and SBN are interlated, in a sense that, if one tried to reduce the FBN at the pump, it tends to affect the SBN characteristics. Currently, one of the main researches in noise reduction in pumps, is a systematic approach in understanding the coupling between FBN and SBN and targeting them simultaneously instead of treating them as two separte sources. Such an unified approach, demands not only well trained researchers but also sophisticated computer based mathematical model of the pump which can accurately output the necessary results for optimization of pump design. The amplitude of fluid pulsations can be reduced, at the source, with the use of an hydraulic attenuator(5). 

(ii) '''Reduction at Component level''' - which focuses on the reduction of noise from individual component like hose, control valve, pump mounts and fixtures. This can be accomplished by a suitable design modification of the component so that it radiates least amount of noise. Optimization using computer based models can be one of the ways.

[[Image:MarimbaGloriaAntiguena.jpg|right|thumb|Marimba Band &quot;La Gloria Antigueña&quot;, Antigua Guatemala, 1979]]
One of my favorite instruments is the marimba.  Like a xylophone, a marimba has octaves of wooden bars that are struck with mallets to produce tones.  Unlike the harsh sound of a xylophone, a marimba produces a deep, rich tone.  Marimbas are not uncommon and are played in most high school bands.

Now, while all the trumpet and flute and clarinet players are busy tuning up their instruments, the marimba player is back in the percussion section with her feet up just relaxing.  This is a bit surprising, however, since the marimba is a melodic instrument that needs to be in tune to sound good.  So what gives?  Why is the marimba never tuned?  How would you even go about tuning a marimba?  To answer these questions, the acoustics behind (or within) a marimba must be understood.

==Components of Sound==

What gives the marimba its unique sound?  It can be boiled down to two components:  the bars and the resonators.  Typically, the bars are made of rosewood (or some synthetic version of wood).  They are cut to size depending on what note is desired, then the tuning is refined by shaving wood from the underside of the bar.  



===Example: Rosewood bar, middle C, 1 cm thick===

{|class='wikitable'

The equation that relates the length of the bar with the desired frequency comes from the theory of modeling a bar that is free at both ends.  This theory yields the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; Length = \sqrt{\frac{3.011^2\cdot \pi \cdot t \cdot v}{8 \cdot \sqrt{12}\cdot f}}&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the thickness of the bar, v is the speed of sound in the bar, and f is the frequency of the note. For rosewood, v = 5217 m/s.  For middle C, f=262 Hz. Therefore, to make a middle C key for a rosewood marimba, cut the bar to be: 

&lt;math&gt; Length = \sqrt{\frac{3.011^2\cdot \pi \cdot .01 \cdot 5217}{8 \cdot \sqrt{12}\cdot 262}}= .45 m = 45 cm&lt;/math&gt;
|}


The resonators are made from metal (usually aluminum) and their lengths also differ depending on the desired note.  It is important to know that each resonator is open at the top but closed by a stopper at the bottom end.

===Example: Aluminum resonator, middle C===

{|class='wikitable'
|
The equation that relates the length of the resonator with the desired frequency comes from modeling the resonator as a pipe that is driven at one end and closed at the other end.  A &quot;driven&quot; pipe is one that has a source of excitation (in this case, the vibrating key) at one end.  This model yields the following:

&lt;math&gt;Length = \frac {c}{4\cdot f}&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the speed of sound in air and f is the frequency of the note. For air, c = 343 m/s.  For middle C, f = 262 Hz. Therefore, to make a resonator for the middle C key, the resonator length should be:

&lt;math&gt; Length = \frac {343}{4 \cdot 262} = .327m = 32.7 cm &lt;/math&gt;
|}


===Resonator Shape===
The shape of the resonator is an important factor in determining the quality of sound that can be produced.  The ideal shape is a sphere.  This is modeled by the Helmholtz resonator.  (For more see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Acoustics_of_pipes%2C_enclosures%2C_and_cavities_at_low_frequencyHelmholtz Helmholtz Resonator page])  However, mounting big, round, beach ball-like resonators under the keys is typically impractical.   The worst choices for resonators are square or oval tubes.  These shapes amplify the non-harmonic pitches sometimes referred to as “junk pitches”.  The round tube is typically chosen because it does the best job (aside from the sphere) at amplifying the desired harmonic and not much else.  

As mentioned in the second example above, the resonator on a marimba can be modeled by a closed pipe. This model can be used to predict what type of sound (full and rich vs dull) the marimba will produce.  Each pipe is a &quot;quarter wave resonator&quot; that amplifies the sound waves produced by of the bar.  This means that in order to produce a full, rich sound, the length of the resonator must exactly match one-quarter of the wavelength.  If the length is off, the marimba will produce a dull or off-key sound for that note.

==Why would the marimba need tuning?==
In the theoretical world where it is always 72 degrees with low humidity,  a marimba would not need tuning.  But, since weather can be a factor (especially for the marching band) marimbas do not always perform the same way.  Hot and cold weather can wreak havoc on all kinds of percussion instruments, and the marimba is no exception.  On hot days, the marimba tends to be sharp and for cold days it tends to be flat.  This is the exact opposite of what happens to string instruments.  Why? The tone of a string instrument depends mainly on the tension in the string, which decreases as the string expands with heat.  The decrease in tension leads to a flat note.  Marimbas on the other hand produce sound by moving air through the resonators.  The speed at which this air is moved is the speed of sound, which varies proportionately with temperature!  So, as the temperature increases, so does the speed of sound.  From the equation given in example 2 from above, you can see that an increase in the speed of sound (c) means a longer pipe is needed to resonate the same note.  If the length of the resonator is not increased, the note will sound sharp.  Now, the heat can also cause the wooden bars to expand, but the effect of this expansion is insignificant compared to the effect of the change in the speed of sound.

==Tuning Myths==
It is a common myth among percussionists that the marimba can be tuned by simply moving the resonators up or down (while the bars remain in the same position.)  The thought behind this is that by moving the resonators down, for example, you are in effect lengthening them.  While this may sound like sound reasoning, it actually does not hold true in practice.  
Judging by how the marimba is constructed (cutting bars and resonators to specific lengths), it seems that there are really two options to consider when looking to tune a marimba: shave some wood off the underside of the bars, or change the length of the resonator.  For obvious reasons, shaving wood off the keys every time the weather changes is not a practical solution.  Therefore, the only option left is to change the length of the resonator.  
	As mentioned above, each resonator is plugged by a stopper at the bottom end.  So, by simply shoving the stopper farther up the pipe, you can shorten the resonator and sharpen the note.  Conversely, pushing the stopper down the pipe can flatten the note.  Most marimbas do not come with tunable resonators, so this process can be a little challenging.  (Broomsticks and hammers are common tools of the trade.) 


===Example: Middle C Resonator lengthened by 1 cm===

{|class='wikitable'
|
For ideal conditions, the length of the middle C (262 Hz) resonator should be 32.7 cm as shown in example 2. Therefore, the change in frequency for this resonator due to a change in length is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta Frequency = 262 Hz - \frac {c}{4\cdot (.327 + \Delta L)} &lt;/math&gt;

If the length is increased by 1 cm, the change in frequency will be:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta Frequency = \frac {343}{4\cdot (.327 + .01)} - 262 Hz = 7.5 Hz&lt;/math&gt;
|}


The acoustics behind the tuning a marimba go back to the design that each resonator is to be ¼ of the total wavelength of the desired note.  When marimbas get out of tune, this length is no longer exactly equal to ¼ the wavelength due to the lengthening or shortening of the resonator as described above.  Because the length has changed, resonance is no longer achieved, and the tone can become muffled or off-key.

==Conclusions==
Some marimba builders are now changing their designs to include tunable resonators.  Since any leak in the end-seal will cause major loss of volume and richness of the tone, this is proving to be a very difficult task.   At least now, though, armed with the acoustic background of their instruments, percussionists everywhere will now have something to do when the conductor says, “tune up!”

      <text xml:space="preserve">If this is intended to be an introductory book for people learning to play the saxophone, I'm not sure what value there is in telling  them about saxello's and tubaxes and the L.A. sax company and Jay C. Easton's homepage and such oddities.  Wouldn't it be better to, say, touch on the main types, what key they're in, point out that the fingering is similar/the same for the whole lot of them, and then redirect them to Wikipedia for such minutiae as &quot;L.A. Sax makes a straight alto&quot; and &quot;there are some sopranos that are curved&quot;?  Also there are a few statements in the current version (&quot;Altos are not that difficult to play&quot; and &quot;Alto players will usually find it easy to play the baritone&quot;) which are subjective at best.

1.Use the following WSDL file to create a SOAP request and response for getting the exchange rate between two countries.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&amp;lt;/definitions&amp;gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

2. Use the following SOAP request and response documents to create a WSDL file with the input being a city, and the output being population of that city.

==Introduction==

[http://www.rit.edu/~pac8612/webionex/website/html/ione7dim.html (Res1)] 
To obtain a pure protein sample, a protein must be isolated from all other proteins and cellular components.  This can prove to be a difficult task as a single protein often makes up only 1% of the total protein concentration of a cell.  Therefore 99% of the protein components of a sample must be removed before it can be classified as pure. A task that is equally challenging is keeping the protein in its active form.  When we purify proteins we remove them from their natural environments. As a result, it is necessary to simulate the pH, salt concentration and reducing conditions in which they are normally found.  In the process of obtaining an active and pure sample we want to minimize the number of steps taken in order to maximize the yield at the end of the separation. Finally, since proteins are made with the intention of only functioning for a short period of time, it is also critical to obtain our sample as quickly as possible.  All these components of protein separations can be successfully achieved by a group of separation methods collectively known as [http://fig.cox.miami.edu/~cmallery/255/255tech/ecbxpanel4x4.pdf chromatography.]


There are several properties of proteins that can be taken advantage of to separate proteins. Different types of chromatography take advantage of different properties. Proteins can be separated by:
* size
* shape
* hydrophobicity
* affinity to molecules
* charge


[[Image:column2.gif|thumb|right|350px|A Typical Column]]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In this chapter several different chromatographic methods will be introduced and described.  While the methods outlined below all use different characteristics of proteins to separate proteins from one another, they all utilize an insoluble stationary phase and a mobile phase that passes over it.  The mobile phase is commonly a liquid solution. It contains the protein we want to isolate. The stationary phase on the other hand is made up of a grouping of beads, usually based on a carbohydrate or acrylamide derivative, that are bound to ionically charged species, hydrophobic characters, or affinity ligands. Much of the success of chromatography is associated with the selection of an appropriate stationary phase. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In [http://fig.cox.miami.edu/~cmallery/255/255hist/ecbxp4x3_chrom.jpg column chromatography], when a protein sample is applied to the column, it equilibrates between the stationary phase and the mobile phase. Depending on the type of chromatography, proteins with certain characteristics will bind to the stationary phase while those lacking the sought characteristics will remain in the mobile phase and pass through the column. For example in ion exchange chromatography, a positively charged protein would bind to a negatively charged stationary phase, while the negatively charge protein will be eluted from the column with the mobile phase. The final step involves displacing the protein from the stationary phase, also known as elution, by introducing a particle which will compete with the protein binding site on the stationary phase. Today various commercial column are readily available, specifically [http://www.bio-rad.com/B2B/BioRad/product/br_category.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0655054085.1146799058@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=cccfaddhjklfdfkcfngcfkmdhkkdfll.0&amp;categoryPath=%2fCatalogs%2fLife+Science+Research%2fChromatography+%7c+Protein+Purification%2fChromatography+Columns&amp;divName=Life+Science+Research&amp;catLevel=4&amp;lang=English&amp;country=null&amp;loggedIn=null&amp;catOID=-31031&amp;isPA=false&amp;serviceLevel=null Bio-Rad],  [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/Area_of_Interest/Life_Science/Proteomics_and_Protein_Expr_/Protein_Analysis/Chromatography.html Sigma-Aldrich],[http://www4.amershambiosciences.com/aptrix/upp00919.nsf/Content/LabSep_Prod~SelGuides~Media GE Healthcare] and [http://www.chromtech.net.au/glass_columns.cfm Omnifit] offers a wide variety of chromatography column.

''' A .NET Perspective'''

Now we will create a simple .NET web service using C# and ASP.NET.  This web service will provide two methods for it's clients.  One will be an adding service and the other will be a subtracting service.  Both methods are marked with the [WebMethod] attribute in the following code snippet.

&lt;pre&gt;
using System;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Services;
using System.Web.Services.Protocols;

[WebService(Namespace = &quot;http://tempuri.org/&quot;)]
[WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]
public class Service : System.Web.Services.WebService
{
	#region Construction

	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// Default Construction
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	public Service () {

	}

	#endregion

	#region Operations

	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// Add a values passed in and return the sum.
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	/// &lt;param name=&quot;values&quot;&gt;All values to be added together.&lt;/param&gt;
	/// &lt;returns&gt;Sum of all values passed in.&lt;/returns&gt;
	[WebMethod]
	public double Add(double numOne, double numTwo)
	{
		return numOne + numTwo;
	}

	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// Return the difference between numOne and numTow
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	/// &lt;returns&gt;The difference between numOne and numTwo&lt;/returns&gt;
	[WebMethod]
	public double Subtract(double numOne, double numTwo)
	{
		return numOne - numTwo;
	}

	#endregion

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

When executing the web service in a debug mode using Visual Studio 2005, we will get the following screen.  Note the two methods available for this web service.

'''Exhibit 1: .Net'''

If we click on the add link, we will get the following page.  

'''Exhibit 2: .Net'''
[[Image:NET Method Page.jpg]]

On this page, we will use the add method and enter our parameters for our web service call.  For this example, we will enter 10 as the first number and 5 as the second number.  After entering numbers and pressing the invoke button, the client will receive the following XML stream containing the sum value of 15.

  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt; 
  &lt;double xmlns=&quot;http://tempuri.org/&quot;&gt;15&lt;/double&gt; 

Technologies Used
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.NET Framework 2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASP.NET 2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The example provided is very simple and does not come close to demonstrating the power of .NET Web Services.  For more information on implementing .NET Web Services, please visit http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Motor learning and control&lt;/i&gt; is the study of how our brains execute complex muscle movements. &lt;i&gt;Motor&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;muscle&lt;/i&gt; in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section will explain how we learn complex, precise movements, eventually perform a skill without even thinking about it. You'll also learn about the role of cognition (mental attention): many of these skills can only be performed when we &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; think about them. Our performance degrades when we exert conscious control.&lt;/p&gt;

===Four Steps from Sensation to Execution===

&lt;p&gt;A muscle movement takes about 200 milliseconds (one-fifth of a second) to execute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sensation&lt;/i&gt;, or neural transmission from sensory receptors in your eyes, ears, etc., to your brain, takes about 15 milliseconds.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perception&lt;/i&gt;, which retrieves long-term memories to organize, classify, and interpret your sensations, takes about 45 milliseconds. In other words, &lt;i&gt;perception&lt;/i&gt; changes &lt;i&gt;sensation&lt;/i&gt; data into perceived information or meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response selection&lt;/i&gt; takes about 75 milliseconds. You use current perception and past experiences to formulate a course or action. For example, in baseball, a batter watches the pitcher and decides whether to swing at a pitch, hit to left field or right, etc. Psychologists differentiate conscious &lt;i&gt;decisions&lt;/i&gt; from unconscious &lt;i&gt;translations&lt;/i&gt;, or relating a particular stimulus to a particular response.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response execution&lt;/i&gt; of an action plan&amp;#151;a step-by-step sequence of events that make up the planned movement&amp;#151;takes about 15 milliseconds. In these events, motor neurons carry signals from the brain or spinal cord to muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Closed-Loop Motor Control===

&lt;p&gt;We perform muscle movements with either &lt;i&gt;open-loop&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;closed-loop&lt;/i&gt; motor control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Closed-loop motor control&lt;/i&gt; uses perception to consciously, continuously adjust muscle movements. E.g., threading a needle. You look at the needle. You look at the thread. You move the thread towards the needle. You look at the needle again. You look at the thread again. You correct your movement. You do this dozens of times until the thread is through the needle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;i&gt;stimulus-response&lt;/i&gt; adjustment takes at least 200 milliseconds (one-fifth of a second). If you make ten adjustments, the task takes at least two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closed-loop motor control has two advantages. It enables precise control, and it enables execution of novel movements (activities you've never done before). E.g., threading a needle on the deck of a rolling ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closed-loop motor control has two disadvantages. It's slow, and it requires your full attention.&lt;/p&gt;

Closed-loop motor control is good for learning new skills, or for executing skills you rarely need. But you don't want to use closed-loop motor control for fast-paced, frequently used skills.&lt;/p&gt;

===Open-Loop Motor Control===

&lt;p&gt;200 milliseconds&amp;#151;a split second&amp;#151;may seem fast, but it's too slow for many motor tasks. For example, a gymnast's double-back somersault requires muscle movements lasting only tens of milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is it possible to execute a muscle movement in tens of milliseconds, when the sensation to execution cycle requires about 200 milliseconds? Simple&amp;#151;don't do the sensation, perception, and response selection stages. Just do the response execution. This final stage of muscle movements can be performed in as little as 15 milliseconds. This is called &lt;i&gt; open-loop motor control&lt;/i&gt;. Open-loop motor control is the execution of preprogrammed movements, called a &lt;i&gt;motor program&lt;/i&gt;, without perceptual feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colloquial term for this is &amp;quot;muscle memory.&amp;quot; For example, gymnasts practice hours each day for years, until they can execute complex routines seemingly effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After winning the gold medal in gymnastics at the 1984 Olympics, Mary Lou Retton said that coach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bela [Karolyi] can really teach, I've learned so much from him. Many long hours were spent in the gymnasium&amp;#133;repetition, feedback, repetition, and experimentation. Somehow, after a lot of bumps and bruises, it got easier, as if I could float.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karolyi added,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Someone should be able to sneak up and drag you out at midnight and push you out on some strange floor, and you should be able to do your entire routine sound asleep in your pajamas. Without a mistake. That's the secret. It's got to be a natural reaction.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-loop motor control has two advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;It's fast. You can execute muscle movements in tens of milliseconds.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;It requires no attention. Movements under open-loop control are &lt;i&gt;automatic&lt;/i&gt; and mentally &lt;i&gt;effortless&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-loop motor control has three disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If your motor program contains errors, you'll execute the errors. You can't stop and adjust a mistake. You may not even be aware that you made a mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Developing open-loop control of a motor skill requires long practice&amp;#151;especially for adults. Children learn some motor skills easily, that adults struggle for years to master.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Novel or new situations can't be handled. E.g., in the 2000 Olympics, officials set the gymnastic vault two inches too low. The officials didn't correct the height until 18 of the 36 women had performed. These 18 athletes performed poorly, eliminating their hopes of winning medals. The American hopeful, Elise Ray, suffered a &amp;quot;[http://truthnews.net/culture/2000_10_olympic.html devastating fall].&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Learning New Motor Skills===

&lt;p&gt;Use closed-loop motor control for learning a new motor skill. Then gradually increase your speed until you can perform the motor skill with open-loop motor control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you take tennis or golf lessons the coach will have you start with swinging the club or racquet slowly. When you've perfected your form, your coach will have you gradually increase the speed and force, while continuing to use your perfect form. After extensive practice you'll be executing perfect open-loop motor programs. You'll smash the ball hard and fast and accurately without thinking about your elbows or knees or anything other than the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

==Speech Motor Control== 

&lt;p&gt;Normal speech uses open-loop motor control:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech is &lt;i&gt;fast&lt;/i&gt;. Phonemes (speech sounds) are typically 20 to 40 milliseconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech is &lt;i&gt;complex&lt;/i&gt;, requiring coordination of hundreds of muscles to produce  sounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech is &lt;i&gt;automatic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;effortless&lt;/i&gt;. Speakers think about what they're saying, not about the muscles they're moving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluency shaping stuttering therapy uses closed-loop speech motor control. You consciously relax your breathing. Then, as you exhale, you slowly increase your vocal fold tension, until your vocal folds hum. Then you slowly move your lips, jaw, and tongue to form the sounds of each word. Stuttering is impossible when using closed-loop speech motor control. Stuttering dysfluencies are open-loop speech motor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Closed-loop speech motor control is slow. Closed-loop motor control takes about 200 milliseconds per muscle movement. Open-loop speech sounds are typically in the 20-40 millisecond range. You can see why switching to closed-loop speech motor control slows speech five to ten times, or one or two seconds per syllable.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Closed-loop speech motor control demands your full attention. You must pay attention to your breathing, vocal folds, and lips, jaw, and tongue. This isn't a problem when reading a list of words, but is impossible to use in conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Your speech loses prosody (rhythm and emotional intonation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Prosody, Parameterization Schema, and Response Selection===

&lt;p&gt;Why closed-loop speech motor control loses prosody is an interesting question. A study of television talk show guests found that 94% of what viewers remembered was prosody, or what actors call &lt;i&gt;emoting&lt;/i&gt;, or what lawyers call &lt;i&gt;affect&lt;/i&gt;.{{ref|Ford1997}} Much&amp;#151;or almost all&amp;#151;meaning is communicated by prosody. &lt;i&gt;Schemata theory&lt;/i&gt; suggests that you learn certain &lt;i&gt;invariable characteristics&lt;/i&gt; of a motor skill, and you learn certain execution rules or &lt;i&gt;parameterization schema&lt;/i&gt;. You then combine the invariable elements with the rules to produce a motor plan. E.g., you could read algebra problems in an angry voice, in a sad voice, and then with the rhythm and emotional intonation of a stand-up comedian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accents are another parameterization schema that conveys meaning. For example, a waitress from Oklahoma asked me if I wanted &lt;i&gt;ah-iss&lt;/i&gt;. When I figured out that she was asking about &lt;i&gt;ice&lt;/i&gt;, I affirmatively answered &lt;i&gt;yay-iss&lt;/i&gt;. I knew the invariable characteristics of &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; and when I'd learned the rules of an Oklahoma accent&amp;#151;e.g., break monosyllabic words into two syllables&amp;#151;I was able to say a word I'd never heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In normal speech, we produce &lt;i&gt;prosody&lt;/i&gt; through unconscious &lt;i&gt;response selection&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;parameterization schema&lt;/i&gt;. Different environmental cues cause us to select different responses. E.g., you walk into a church and immediately lower your vocal volume. But if no one else is in the church, you could yell &amp;quot;I hate to wear pants!&amp;quot; while turning somersaults down the aisle. OK, that's one of my eccentric hobbies, but most people wouldn't do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is a person who grew up in Vermont and Georgia. When she's in New England she speaks in a Yankee accent. When she's in the South she switches to a southern accent. Different environmental cues cause her to unconsciously selects different parameterization schema to produce each accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like prosody and accents, stuttering is a parameterization schema. A stutterer responds to environmental cues to unconsciously select fluent speech parameters or stuttering speech parameters, which are then combined with  invariable characteristics of words to produce fluent or stuttered speech. Thus you can treat stuttering by training stutterers to respond differently to environmental cues, or by training stutterers to use fluent speech parameterization schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, training a stutterer to not feel fear or anxiety when answering the telephone is changing the response selection to an environmental cue (a ringing telephone). In contrast, training a stutterer to speak with relaxed vocal folds changes a speech parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

===Snake Oil and Charlatans===

&lt;p&gt;Closed-loop speech motor control is the &amp;quot;wizard behind the curtain&amp;quot; of many stuttering therapy programs. Switch any stutterer to closed-loop speech motor control and he or she will be nearly fluent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can switch to closed-loop speech motor control by making any speech process conscious instead of unconscious. For example, focusing on relaxed, slow breathing will switch you into closed-loop speech motor control, with your vocal folds and articulators (lips, jaw, and tongue) following right along. Or you can focus on producing &amp;quot;gentle onset&amp;quot; with your vocal folds. This will switch your breathing and articulators to closed-loop speech motor control. Or you can focus on &amp;quot;reduced articulatory pressure&amp;quot; and your breathing and vocal folds will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always these &amp;quot;wizards&amp;quot; claim that their therapies are 100% effective if the stutterer &amp;quot;really tries,&amp;quot; that is, if he devotes his full attention to closed-loop speech motor control. If he instead pays attention to a conversation, switches into open-loop speech motor control, and then stutters, then he wasn't &amp;quot;really trying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the closed-loop speech motor control effect has caused speech-language pathologists to hypothesize various theories that stutterers have something wrong with their breathing, or with their vocal folds, or with their articulators, or even that stutterers' brains are slow in some way. That's like saying that student drivers have slower brains than Indy 500 race car drivers because student drivers are safe at 20 mph but crash when driving at 200 mph. Everyone performs slowly when attentively learning a new motor skill. For stutterers in speech therapy, the new motor skill is fluent speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some speech clinics tell stutterers that they'll always have to speak slowly. That's like training a student driver to drive 20 mph, then telling him never to go faster.&lt;/p&gt;

===Slow Speech Is Not the Goal of Stuttering Therapy===

&lt;p&gt;If you learn tennis or golf, you'll use closed-loop motor control when you're learning to swing the club or racquet. As you practice, increasing your speed and force, you'll gradually reinforce open-loop motor programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you'll use closed-loop speech motor control when working with your speech-language pathologist. She'll train you to move your respiration muscles, vocal folds, and articulators correctly to produce fluent speech. When you've mastered this at a very slow speaking rate, she'll help you to gradually increase your speaking rate, while staying fluent. The goal is fluent, automatic, effortless, normal-sounding and normal-rate speech. Slow speech is not the goal of stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severe stutterers usually don't mind learning closed-loop speech motor control. If your stuttered speech is ten to twenty times slower than normal speech, then closed-loop speech motor control, which is typically five to ten times slower than normal speech, will double your speaking rate. Some severe stutterers are even willing to use closed-loop speech motor control outside of the speech clinic. Record conversations with and without using closed-loop speech motor control. Count your syllables per second. You may find that closed-loop speech motor control feels slower but is actually faster than your stuttered speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But mild stutterers don't like closed-loop speech motor control. They can hide their stuttering by avoidance and substitution (of certain sounds, words, or speaking situations). They can sound fluent at a normal speaking rate. They don't like that closed-loop speech motor control &amp;quot;advertises to the world&amp;quot; that they have a speech disorder. If they're embarrassed to admit that they stutter, they won't want to use closed-loop speech motor control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mild stutterers should consider that closed-loop speech motor control enables them to say anything they want. E.g., a mild stutterer wants to buy a chess set. He's afraid of &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; words, so he calls a toy store and asks if they have &amp;quot;one of those games with kings and knights and castles.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puzzled clerk responds that the store has many games with kings and castles and knights. After five minutes of conversation, the clerk asks, &amp;quot;Do you mean &lt;i&gt;chess sets&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;quot; The stutterer says yes. The clerk never knows that the caller is a stutterer, but she thinks the caller is an idiot. The stutterer wasted five minutes because he wasn't willing to use ten seconds of slow speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the stutterer drives to the store and looks for a chess set, without calling first. If the store doesn't have chess sets he wastes an hour, to save ten seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, saying what you want slowly is faster than saying something else, or not speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

===Analogy to Touchtyping===

&lt;p&gt;I've never taken a typing class. I type about 45 words per minute (I'm probably the world's fastest two-fingered typist!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've twice tried to learn touchtyping. My speed dropped to less than ten words per minute. Touchtyping not only slowed me down, it required my full concentration. I couldn't think about what I was writing, only about moving my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave up touchtyping within a week. If I'd kept at it, my speed would have increased and eventually surpassed my two-fingered typing speed. I might have been typing 80 words per minute now. The mental effort would have diminished, until touchtyping was automatic and effortless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coaches say they'd rather work with a novice who has never played their sport, rather than with an experienced player who uses incorrect techniques. It's easier to learn a new motor skill correctly than it is to correct an incorrect, deeply learned motor skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is difficult to overcome because we learned to talk incorrectly. We have to learn new, fluent speech motor skills, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; we have to not use our old, dysfluent speech motor skills. We learned these dysfluent speech motor skills in childhood, when our brains were growing. Now the dysfluent speech motor skills are hardwired into our brains. Making fluent speech automatic and effortless, for a stutterer, demands more time and effort than learning a new sport or vocational skill.&lt;/p&gt;

===Using DAF to Slow Speaking Rate===
&lt;p&gt;Many speech clinics use delayed auditory feedback (DAF) devices to establish fluency using closed-loop speech motor control. With only a little training a DAF device can help a stutterer maintain perfectly paced, steady, mentally effortless, slow closed-loop speech motor control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user's speaking rate can be adjusted by turning a knob. A typical protocol is to train a stutterer to use closed-loop speech motor control with a 200-millisecond delay and one to two seconds per syllable. The stutterer practices this until he is 100% fluent. That usually takes only one or two therapy sessions. (A study found that without training a 195-millisecond delay reduced stuttering only 85%.{{ref|Stager1997}})&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the stutterer can speak 100% fluently, the speech-language pathologist then has the stutterer use one- or two-second stretched syllables without the DAF device; in increasingly stressful situations (e.g., calling the speech-language pathologist's answering machine); and with the DAF device adjusted for faster speaking rates. The stutterer must stay on-target with 100% fluency, or go back to using the DAF device at 200 milliseconds and a one- to two-second speaking rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, a 100-millisecond DAF delay is used with half-second per syllable stretched speech, a 75-millisecond delay is used with quarter-second per syllable &amp;quot;slow normal&amp;quot; speech, and a 50-millisecond delay is used with a normal speaking rate.&lt;/p&gt;

==Three Stages of Motor Learning==

&lt;p&gt;We learn new motor skills in three stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;cognitive stage&lt;/i&gt;, you observe the target motor skill. For example, your speech-language pathologist demonstrates relaxed breathing.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;associative stage&lt;/i&gt;, you learn to perform and refine the motor skill. You perform the movements under closed-loop control.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;autonomous stage&lt;/i&gt;, the motor skill becomes automatic. You perform the muscle movements without mental effort. You perform the movements under open-loop control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to the golf or tennis coach example. You watch the coach hit a few practice balls. Then the coach hands you the club or racket. The coach guides you through a swing, telling you to drop this shoulder or extend that forearm. Soon you can execute the swing perfectly, if you fully concentrate on each movement. You then practice the swing, and your game improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later a novice admires your excellent swing and asks you to explain how you do it. &amp;quot;I don't know,&amp;quot; you say, &amp;quot;I just do it without thinking about it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For another example, last summer I tried mountain bike racing. In four races I crashed four times. Then I hired a coach. In twelve hours over three weeks, he taught me how to ride down hills; make tight turns; jump my bike over logs; climb hills; plus a few tricks such as picking up a water bottle off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I quit mountain bike racing. I'd completed the associative stage and learned how to do each skill. Now I would have to practice these skills hours a day, several times a week for years to make the skills automatic in the fast, high-stress environment of racing. I.e., I could do any of the skills if I thought about it, but my body didn't automatically execute the moves without conscious mental effort. I decided that mountain bike racing isn't important enough to me to spend thousands of hours practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering therapy follows a similar course. A speech-language pathologist can show you the fluency skills&amp;#151;relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing; vocal fold relaxation (gentle onsets); and relaxed articulation muscles (lips, jaw, and tongue)&amp;#151;in a few minutes. Teaching you to execute these skills takes a few hours. You can then speak fluently in the speech clinic, when you mentally concentrate on each skill. Almost everyone successfully completes these cognitive and associative stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then have to practice these skills thousands of hours to make them automatic and effortless, in high-stress situations. Many stutterers fail at this stage. But no one intentionally fails for the reasons I quit mountain bike racing. No one rationally weighs the alternatives and says, &amp;quot;Talking isn't important to me. I'll learn sign language instead, or write notes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, stutterers fail at the autonomous stage because speech clinics don't train this well. Speech clinics call this &lt;i&gt;transfer&lt;/i&gt;. Perhaps your speech-language pathologist takes you to a shopping mall for a few hours. But the autonomous stage requires thousands of hours of conversations, including high-stress conversations. Stutterers habitually avoid such conversations. You may find that the skills you learned in the low-stress speech clinic fail in high-stress conversations. Your therapy progress begins to fail. You revert to old habits and avoidances. Your stuttering returns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A distribution is a collection of measurements of a single phenomenon. If the number of responses is small, just listing them all may be adequate description. In this case, no summarization or data reduction is needed.  However, if the number of measurements is large, a full list may fail as a communication or analysis tool.

Happily, distributions can be summarized. Some summaries are very brief and provide just a little description. For instance, the [[mean]] is a one number summary that captures just one aspect of a set of numbers. There are six aspects of a distribution that may warrant consideration when summarizing.

==Sample size== 
The number of subjects or items measured is often of fundamental interest. For instance, we might be examing a distribution of the heights of college students containing measurements on 1,234 subjects.

==Scale and precision== 
The type of data you are dealing with (continuous, catgeorical, ordinal, etc.) influences many of the choices you must make about how to describe and analyze your data. The units of measure (inches, kilos, %, mmol, drachmas per acre of corn, etc.) should be noted. For our example, the data were recorded in inches to the nearest 0.1 inch. In other words, measurements were rounded to the nearest tenth of an inch before recording.  For categorical data, the &quot;scale&quot; is just the names of the categories. If we also recorded the gender of the students, we might have three categories: &quot;Male,&quot; &quot;Female&quot; and &quot;Unknown.&quot;

==Central tendency== 
Along the scale, about where do the data lie? Theoretically, adult human height is measured on a scale that goes on to infinity. However, most of the measurements we will observe center around a value of 68 inches (5'-8&quot;).  There are a large variety of ways to describe the central tendency. For continuous data, the [[mean]] (or average) is often calculated. But the mean has limitations and other measures of central tendency are useful: median, geometric mean, mode, etc.

==Spread== 
Central tendency tell you where the data tend to be, but not all of the data will have the same value. Usually, some will be higher and some will be lower.  The college students have heights that lie between about four feet (48 inches) and about 7 feet (84 inches). The spread in the data can be summarized in many ways: range, variance, standard deviation, inter-quartile range, etc.

==Shape== 
Shape is the richest aspect of the distribution and often the most difficult to summarize. For many measurements, the bulk of the data occur at the middle and the number of observations tails off at higher and lower values. The classic [[normal distribution]] is one such distribution: it has a &quot;bell-shape.&quot;  If all the values in the range of data occur about as often as each other, then the shape is said to be &quot;uniform&quot; or &quot;rectangular.&quot;  If all the data tend to be at one end of the range, with a declining number of cases observed at the other, the distibution is said to be &quot;skewed.&quot;

There are numerical methods for describing the shape of a distibution. For instance, the degree of skew can be calculated and reported.  However, often the best way to describe the shape is to draw a picture of the data such as a histogram.

==Outliers== 
Often, a small number of observations have values substantiually above or below the bulk of the data. These outliers are sometimes disturbing or confusing, but they can be '''very, very, important.'''  The best way to summarize outliers is often just to note them individually or highlight them in the graphical description.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Guidelines for Stub Subcategories==
Going through the main {{tl|stub}} category, and starting to roll some of them off into seperate stub categories, I feel the need to start a discussion on some guidelines for using these. Right now, I can see two main issues that need to be resolved.

===Naming of Stub Subcategories===
Currently, the naming is all over the place. There are 3 conventions curretly in use:
#Category:Bookname:Stub(s)
#Category:Bookname Stub(s)
#Category:Bookname/Stub(s)
[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] suggested in IRC that the first type has the potential to clutter namespaces, and recommends the third convention:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[21 March 17:00:48] Kernigh: I usually call my templates {{Book Name/stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[21 March 17:01:02] Kernigh: In the past, I used {{Book Name:stub}}, but then I decided that was confusing with namespaces.&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[21 March 17:01:14] Kernigh: For example, {{Cookbook:stub}} would not be in the Template namespace.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It also fits in nicely with current general category convention (to use Category:Typeofmodule/Subcategory) and keeps things clean.

There's no need to rush and change old categories, but this is something I'd like to see a general consensus on before I go and clean up [[:Category:Stubs]].

===Creation of Subcategories===
There's also the question of how many stubs are necessary before a subcategory is necessary. I don't expect any strict guideline or policy to come out of this section, because it's a highly subjective and situation-specific matter: A larger, but non-complete book with only one stub/sectionstub might still warrant a category due to possible future expansion of the book. Something like the [[Cookbook]] may require classes of stubs: Recipe Stubs, Ingredient Stubs, and so on. Smaller books might need to be classified by bookshelf or general subject areas, such as smaller How-To books.

In any case, I'd like to receive some feedback on this before I begin the process of cleaning up [[:Category:Stubs]]. (It should also be noted that some of the modules in there are about to go up for a VFD as soon as I get the necessary links organised.) [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 00:21, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

:I'm hoping that we can clean up some of these stubs before they get out of control!  I guess this is a sign that Wikibooks is growing, that this sort of question even has to be raised.  Most of this IMHO is something that should be in the hands of the participants of each Wikibook, being considered as a seperate ''Wikiproject'' (as it would be traditionally defined on Wikipedia for a group of such pages).  The stub organization is something to help those authors try to coordinate their efforts and try to do general cleanup.  My writing style is that I tend to work on just one module at a time and then move on, but not everybody seems to work that way, nor is it in the nature of some of the Wikibooks either.  Some books simply seem to be just a maze of hundreds of stubs, because it is easy to add some initial details, but harder to really work out each module completely.

:Categories can have hundreds or even thousands of pages in them, so the only point of &quot;sub cats&quot; in this regard is to help break up the groupings of stubs into smaller amounts that are more easily dealt with, aka for individual Wikibooks or similar themes like Computer Programming books.  If a particular group of editors wants to create a subcat for their Wikibook but only has one stub, I say go for it.  On the other hand I think it would be more useful if there were at least 10-30 stubs before &quot;outsiders&quot; really went in and explicitly created new sub-cats.  I don't know how subjective that seems, but it is something to consider.  For sub-cats of a particular Wikibook, that should be something explicitly done by major contributors to that Wikibook.

:You might also want to consider breaking up stubs by bookshelf.  That is at least a level of organization here on Wikibooks that makes sense, and something that can be tied directly to the bookshelf page as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:59, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

::Good idea. As the stubs category has only gotten larger, and will cotinue to do so, would anyone mind if I divide the stub category into bookshelves? --[[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 02:38, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

:::I don't mind at all, that's probably a good idea, considering that every single book has the potential to include a stub category. I'm going to go through, and rename most of the stub subcategories that i've created to use the &quot;Category:Bookname/Stubs&quot; format, because that makes the most sense. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:46, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

I went through [[:Category:Stubs]], and fixed all the subcategories that I am associated with, to use the &quot;forward slash&quot; convention, as noted here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

== Stub Deletion Policy ==

I think the time has come for some serious discussion take place over the status of stubs here on Wikibooks.  The unofficial policy up until now has been to keep stubs, under the philosophy that at some point in the future somebody will come along and hate the stub so much that they will try to rework the content and turn it into a real Wikibook.  This policy seems to have been very useful on Wikipedia, but the circumstances on Wikibooks are a little bit different.

One issue here is to even determine what exactly is a stub.  One or two sentances or a short paragraph is a reasonable use of the term, as is a page full of red links with at most one or two &quot;sub pages&quot; that have been started, each of which is only a paragraph in length.  Obviously other stub definitions can be added as well.

And this is a Wikibook stub by using this definition.  Module stubs ''within'' a specific Wikibook that is otherwise under active development should be a completely seperate issue, and have its own page culling guidelines.

If stubs violate [[WB:WIN]] in terms of the likely direction of completed content, current policies cover what should happen with them and a VfD is certainly useful.  For other modules, this is where the discussion really needs to go.  Should a stub be able to languish on Wikibooks for several years (as a couple have already) or should there be a reasonable period of time (I'm talking years here, not weeks) that a Wikibook should be worked on or be deleted?

Under no condition should modules or Wikibooks stubs be deleted that have been recently created.  This is not showing good faith to whomever is trying to develop the content, and there may be a group collaboration effort going on that an administrator may not be aware of.  Any other thoughts?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:05, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

:I agree that the problem is in defining a stub; just from looking through [[:Category:Stubs]] it seems that some of these might've gone up for a speedy delete, depending on who saw the module first. (Specifically looking at the cases of [[Special:Contributions/68.73.54.217|68.73.54.217]], there's another issue at hand there, but this is a case I'm currently preparing to bring up on VfD.) Some of the stubs in the root may have been intended as being brought up as submodules of a book, but due to bad link preparation weren't linked as such, so checking the incoming links could help, and the stub could probably be moved to a subpage of the main book and recategorised as a stub under that book.

:Another problem is the misuse of the templates; I found at least five cases where {{tl|sectstub}} should have been used, but {{tl|stub}} was used instead. This makes the stubs category (along with stubs that are part of a larger book) look a lot larger than it actually should be. I also found a couple that were marked as stubs, but are actually TOCs to books, some of which had a lot of well-filled modules. So it really needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, but I think a lot of these modules might be up for deletion anyway, simply for being &quot;sub-stubs&quot;.

:: In the past, everyone always used {{tl|stub}}. It was not until my redesign of 30 November 2005 when {{tl|sectstub}} added pages to a category. Even after that, because current books use {{tl|stub}} much more often, some editors know not of {{tl|sectstub}}. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:30, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

: I'm not convined that every three-sentence stub should be discussed at VfD in order to be deleted. I think that stubs containing no useful content (like &quot;this is a part of XYZ book&quot;, &quot;second law of thermodynamics will be explained here&quot;, &quot;see also: [link] [link] [link]&quot;) should be speedy deleted. New stubs having some content should be kept but old ones (about two years old) having only table of contents with red links should be massively submitted to VfD. Stubs that should be specially targetted are those which do not explain what they should contain (like [[Energy Efficiency]]). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:31, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

== Categories on this page... ==

Why is this page put into so many categories? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:07, 10 August 2006 (UTC)
:It's a side-effect of displaying the stub templates (which place the page they're used on into a category) on the page, in the same way [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Deletion]] appears on [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]], because the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template is used on the page. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Xerol|Xerol]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Xerol|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Fluency shaping therapy programs typically begin with slow speech with stretched vowels, then work on relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing, then work on vocal fold awareness and control, and finally work on relaxed articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques are all abnormal. They all produce &quot;weird&quot;-sounding speech. The idea is to go to extremes when practicing (in the speech clinic or at home), and then in &quot;real world&quot; conversations you reduce the techniques so that you sound normal, and speak fluently.&lt;/p&gt;

==Slow Speech with Stretched Vowels==

&lt;p&gt;Slow speech enables you to learn the other fluency skills. The goal is not to use slow speech in every conversation for the rest of your life. Like a novice golfer, you learn the correct forms and muscle movements slowly at first. Then, as you master these muscle movements gradually increase your speed. See the section [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control#Slow Speech Is Not the Goal of Stuttering Therapy|Slow Speech Is Not the Goal of Stuttering Therapy]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with how &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to do slow speech with stretched vowels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I&quot; &lt;long pause&gt; &quot;am&quot; &lt;long pause&gt; &quot;an&quot; &lt;long pause&gt; &quot;American.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying &quot;I am an American&quot; normally takes about 1.5 seconds (seven syllables at about five syllables per second). By silently pausing two seconds between words, and saying each word normally, the phrase would take about eight seconds. That would not improve your fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, stretch each &lt;i&gt;vowel&lt;/i&gt; for a second or two. Also stretch voiced consonants (e.g., /m/, /n/, /r/) a little longer then normal, but not as long as vowels. Articulate voiceless consonants (e.g., /k/) lightly and quickly, just touching your lips or tongue and then moving to the next voiced sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join the syllables together, with no breaks or pauses between words. The result should sound like (where each letter is one-fifth of a second):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;IIIIIIIIIIaaaaaaammmaaaaaaannnAAAAAAAmmmeeeeeeerrriiiiiiiiiikaaaaaaannn.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure that each syllable is held equally. In other words, &quot;American&quot; should take four times longer to say than &quot;I.&quot; Don't make &quot;American&quot; the same length as &quot;I.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you hold each syllable for one second or for two seconds? Some speech clinics start with one-second stretched syllables, when other speech clinics start with two seconds per syllable. No research has investigated which is more effective. If you are 100% fluent at one second per syllable, then that is slow enough. But if you're not 100% fluent at one second per syllable, use two seconds per syllable. According to motor learning theory, you need to move slow enough that your form is perfect, but there's no reason to move slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a stopwatch to check that each syllable is the same length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a DAF device, set the delay to 200 milliseconds. Then hold each syllable until you hear yourself in the headphones. Check your stopwatch and you should see that each syllable is between one and two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

==Relaxed Breathing==

&lt;p&gt;Place one hand on your stomach. Breathe so that your hand moves out when you inhale, and in when you exhale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that you're taking many small breaths. Your inhalation and exhalation are equal in time duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is called relaxed or &lt;i&gt;diaphragmatic&lt;/i&gt; breathing. Many people breathe this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now switch to upper-chest breathing or &lt;i&gt;thoracic&lt;/i&gt; breathing. Take a big breath, using your upper chest muscles to expand your lungs. Release the air slowly, while maintaining this upper chest muscle tension to hold air in your lungs as long as possible. When you've released the air, quickly take another breath, filling your lungs as rapidly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice switching between thoracic and diaphragmatic breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoracic breathing increases our lung capacity. It enables us to maximize our physical exertion. Our &amp;quot;fight or flight&amp;quot; instinct switches us to thoracic breathing. We're then better able to run or fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some individuals &lt;i&gt;hyperventilate&lt;/i&gt; or switch to thoracic breathing when experiencing non-physical stress. Stress reduction classes help students learn to relax by consciously switching to diaphragmatic breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Breathing.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoracic vs. Diaphragmatic Breathing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also use thoracic breathing when talking. A large breath with a long, slow exhale enable us to speak many words before pausing for another breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-meaning people who know nothing about stuttering may tell you to &amp;quot;take a deep breath&amp;quot; before talking. But the opposite is better advice. Diaphragmatic breathing is the foundation of many stuttering therapy programs. Taking smaller breaths with your diaphragm can help you relax and may help you speak more fluently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it. Using relaxed breathing will relax your entire body. Most importantly, it will relax your vocal folds, and then your lips, jaw, and tongue. Your voice will deepen and sound confident - maybe even &amp;quot;sexy.&amp;quot; You'll feel relaxed and confident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice a [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Practice Word Lists|word list]] using diaphragmatic breathing. Read a magazine page aloud using diaphragmatic breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll soon discover a few problems trying to speak with diaphragmatic breathing. Each breath is small, so you're able to say only a few words on each breath. Inhalation and exhalation time lengths are equal, so you will speak in shorter phrases that are produced between longer pauses. You're less able to speak loudly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other fluency-enhancing speech motor techniques, speaking with diaphragmatic breathing is somewhat abnormal, but can also be useful. Include speaking with diaphragmatic breathing in your stuttering therapy practice exercises. Mastering this skill has helped many speak short phrases fluently during stressful situations (e.g., when a police officer pulls you over for speeding!) You may not need to say much besides, &amp;quot;Yes, officer,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;No, officer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as you master speaking with diaphragmatic breathing, you'll develop something in between thoracic and diaphragmatic breathing. This &amp;quot;in between&amp;quot; breathing will be more relaxed than thoracic breathing, yet your phrase length and vocal volume will be within the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;

==Phonation==

&lt;p&gt;Your vocal folds are flaps of muscle in your throat. Making your vocal folds vibrate produces sound. This sound then becomes your voice. Vocal fold vibration is called &lt;i&gt;phonation&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two conditions produce phonation. First, you release air from your lungs. Next, you tension or tighten your vocal folds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place your fingers on your throat. Exhale and hum. Your fingers should feel a vibration. This is your vocal folds vibrating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop humming, and feel the vibration stop. Practice switching your phonation on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now vary your phonation in two ways. Change your volume by humming louder, then quieter. Change your pitch by humming up and down a musical scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did you do that? You varied your volume of exhalation, i.e., you increased or decreased the air releasing from your lungs by tensing or relaxing your thoracic (upper chest) muscles. More exhalation enabled you to produce more volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also varied your vocal fold tension. Tense vocal folds produce a higher-pitched voice. Relaxed vocal folds produce a deeper or lower-pitched voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tense your vocal folds as hard as you can. You'll completely block your throat, not allowing any air to escape. If you take a deep breath and then block your throat, your increased lung pressure makes your chest stronger. Like inflating a tire to carry a heavier load, this is effective for lifting a heavy weight. But it's not a good way to talk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice one more aspect of phonation. Take a breath and hold it, tense your vocal folds, then release air. Switch to the other way: take a breath, release a little air, then tense your vocal folds. Note that the former produced a croak. The latter produced a nice hum. This shows that phonation requires timing two muscle movements: exhaling a little air, and then starting to tense your vocal folds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now see that three things can go wrong with phonation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Releasing too much or too little air (&lt;i&gt;inadequate breath support&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Overtensing your vocal folds. Under stress, you may try too hard to talk, tense your vocal folds too much, and block off air flow. This results in a &lt;i&gt;silent block&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mistiming exhalation and vocal fold tension. A goal of stuttering therapy is train the stutterer to consciously take a breath, release a little air, gently tense his vocal folds, and then begin to talk. This exercise is called &lt;i&gt;gentle onset&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;easy onset&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Gentle Onsets with Vowels=== 

&lt;p&gt;To hit a baseball home run, you use all of your arm muscle strength. In contrast, to putt a golf ball a few feet, your arm muscles are more relaxed than tense. Phonation is like putting a golf ball, not like hitting a home run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use &lt;i&gt;gentle onsets&lt;/i&gt; (also called &lt;i&gt;easy onsets&lt;/i&gt;), take a relaxed breath with your diaphragm. Release a little air. Make an &lt;i&gt;ah&lt;/i&gt; sound as you gradually increase your vocal fold tension. Feel your vocal folds begin to vibrate. Increase your vocal fold tension, until you reach normal speaking volume. Gradually reduce vocal fold tension, until you reach silence. Time this to take about two seconds. You should be able to do this on one breath, without reaching residual air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to see your vocal volume charted, it would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Gentleonset.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use a [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Computers and Electronics for Fluency-Shaping|computer application]] that displays your phonation contour on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice fifteen gentle onsets with the fifteen vowel sounds (say the vowel, not the word):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Front Vowels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;long &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;beet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;short &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;bit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;long &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;bait&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;short &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;bet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;short &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;at&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back Vowels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;long &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;boot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;short &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;book&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;long &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;boat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;aw&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;ah&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;cot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central Vowels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;ow&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;short &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dipthongs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;long &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;bite&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;oy&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;boy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;au&lt;/i&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;bough&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gentle Onsets with Words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Gentleonsetwords.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle Onset with Words&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now say &amp;quot;dog,&amp;quot; stretched over two seconds, with gentle onset. Begin with a quiet, gentle /d/ sound. Switch to the /aw/ vowel sound and gradually increase vocal volume. After one second, gradually reduce vocal volume. Switch to the /g/ sound, and stop vocal fold vibration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Voice and Voiceless Consonants&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;All vowels use phonation. Some consonants use phonation, i.e., are &lt;i&gt;voiced&lt;/i&gt;. Other consonants are produced without phonation, i.e., are &lt;i&gt;voiceless&lt;/i&gt;. You can whisper these consonants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place your fingers on your throat. Say &lt;i&gt;ah&lt;/i&gt; to feel your vocal folds vibrating. Say the following words and decide whether the initial consonant is voice or voiceless:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;TABLE cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;

	&lt;TR summary=&quot;Top Row&quot;&gt;
		&lt;TD&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
		&lt;TD&gt;&lt;p&gt;/h/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
		&lt;TD&gt;&lt;p&gt;hail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
		&lt;TD&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
		&lt;TD&gt;&lt;p&gt;/w/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
		&lt;TD&gt;&lt;p&gt;whale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
	&lt;/TR&gt;

	&lt;/TR&gt;
	
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first column was voiceless. The second column was voiced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice that these sounds were pairs? /h/ and /w/ have your lips, jaw, and tongue in the same positions. The difference is that your vocal folds vibrate to produce /w/, but don't vibrate to produce /h/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say a word with voiceless consonant, take a breath, let out a little air, shape the consonant with your lips, jaw, and tongue, then switch to the vowel and gently start your vocal fold vibration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice a [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Practice Word Lists|word list]]. Keep your fingers on your throat to feel your vocal folds switching on and off as you go from voiced to voiceless sounds. Stretch each word to two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because most words contain both voiced and voiceless sounds, we switch our vocal folds on and off many times each second while talking. A core behavior of stuttering is an inability to switch phonation on at the right moments. The timing can be as precise as one one-hundredth (1/100) of a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal speech is about five syllables per second, or 0.2 seconds per syllable. For this practice you're using two seconds per syllable stretched speech, or ten times slower than a normal speaking rate. Slowing down your speech helps you develop awareness and control of speech elements that are otherwise too fast to notice or control. If you play a sport, such as tennis or golf, your coach might videotape your swing and then replay it back in slow motion. This improves your awareness and control of the motor skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Continuous Phonation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering therapy sometimes teaches techniques that produce fluency, but sound abnormal. E.g., speech with diaphragmatic breathing produces fluency, but shortens phrase length and makes you pause between phrases. The immediate goal is to use these techniques to produce fluent speech, and over time reduce the degree of exaggeration, until your speech sounds normal. Another goal is have a &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; to use in stressful situations, such as speaking to a police officer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuous phonation&lt;/i&gt; is such a technique or trick. Recall that consonants come in voiced/voiceless pairs. Simple substitute a voiced consonant whenever you need to say a voiceless consonant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., &amp;quot;Patty&amp;quot; becomes &amp;quot;Baddy.&amp;quot; Say each word slowly, with your fingers on your throat to feel your phonation. You'll feel your vocal folds switch on and off for &amp;quot;Patty,&amp;quot; but stay on for &amp;quot;Baddy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you shorten the consonants and stretch your vowels (producing a slower speaking rate), listeners won't hear the difference between &amp;quot;Patty&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Baddy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gentle Onsets with Multisyllabic Words&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice using a gentle onset on each syllable. Go loud on each vowel. On the consonants, relax, go quiet, and lightly and quickly articulate the sounds.
E.g., on &amp;quot;American,&amp;quot; you start with a gentle onset on the initial &amp;#047;uh&amp;#047;. Open your mouth wide at the loudest point in the phonation contour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the &amp;#047;uh&amp;#047; sound down in volume, while at the same time closing your mouth to articulate the voiced &amp;#047;m&amp;#047;. Bring the &amp;#047;eh&amp;#047; sound up in volume. Again, open your mouth wide at the loudest point in the phonation contour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the &amp;#047;eh&amp;#047; sound down in volume, while at the same time reduce your jaw opening (but don’t close your lips) to articulate the voiced &amp;#047;r&amp;#047;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your mouth wide again for the &amp;#047;ih&amp;#047; vowel on the third syllable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you get to the only voiceless sound in &amp;quot;American.&amp;quot; Before the &amp;#047;k&amp;#047; sound, take the down the volume of the &amp;#047;ih&amp;#047; vowel. Whisper the &amp;#047;k&amp;#047;. If you block, you dropped the &amp;#047;ih&amp;#047; volume too fast. Try again with a long, slow decline in volume on the &amp;#047;ih&amp;#047;. Articulate the &amp;#047;k&amp;#047; lightly, for just a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still block on the &amp;#047;k&amp;#047;, change it to a voiced &amp;#047;g&amp;#047;. In other words, say &amp;quot;Amerigan.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use another gentle onset on the final &amp;#047;eh&amp;#047; vowel. Reduce your volume on the final voiced &amp;#047;n&amp;#047; consonant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is an abnormal-sounding &amp;quot;sing-song&amp;quot; speech pattern. Your jaw opens and closes noticeably on each syllable. While you won’t want to talk like this for the rest of your life, for practice or in stressful situations this technique helps you use gentle onsets, continuous phonation, and a slower speaking rate.&lt;/p&gt;

==Reduced Articulatory Pressure==

&lt;p&gt;The third set of speech muscles (after respiration and phonation) are your articulators: lips, jaw, and tongue. These muscles form your vocal fold humming into sounds and words. If you phonate without moving your lips, jaw, and tongue, all that comes out of your mouth is humming. The goal of this last target is to relax these muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduced articulatory pressure is also called &quot;soft targets.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lightly touch your tongue for the /t/. Lightly close your lips for the /b/. Keep your speech production muscles relaxed for all sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wrong way is to tense your lips and tongue and jaw too much, and hold this tension too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've learned to stretch and emphasize vowels. Now work on  de-emphasizing consonants. If you stretch and emphasize vowels, and de-emphasize consonants, you should be able to speak fluently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read another [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Practice Word Lists|word list]] aloud. Feel how your lips, jaw, and tongue move to change sounds. Say each word with normal articulation tension. Then say the word again with tense articulation. Then say the word again with relaxed articulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is short because most stutterers can easily do the reduced articulation target with little or no training. There's no need to include pages and pages of diagrams showing the correct positions of the lips, jaw, and tongue for each of the 40+ sounds of English. Most stutterers know the correct positions to produce sounds, we just have to do it with less force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you speak with a foreign accent, or if you have an articulation disorder (e.g., lisping), you may want to do articulation therapy along with stuttering therapy. Articulation therapy will train you to place your lips, jaw, and tongue in the correct positions.&lt;/p&gt;

== 1. Why are bats classified as mammals and not birds? ==
Here are some identifiers for mammals, birds, and bats. After examining the list, it should be rather obvious how much more like mammals bats are:

'''Mammals:''' 
*'''Fur'''
*'''Bear live young (except platypus)'''
*'''The babies nurse from their mother'''
*'''They are Warm-blooded'''
*'''Four legs often with toes and/or &quot;hands&quot; and &quot;feet&quot;'''

'''Bats:''' 
*'''They have fur or hair'''
*'''A baby bat is born alive'''
*'''The babies nurse from their mother'''
*'''They are Warm-blooded'''
*'''Bats have arms, hands and feet'''

'''Birds:''' 
*'''Birds have feathers, not fur or hair'''
*'''They are hatched from eggs'''
*'''The babies are fed from mom's mouth'''
*'''They have wings, but not hands and fingers'''

== 2. What is the main characteristic that separates bats from all other mammals? ==
Bats are the ''only'' mammal that can truly fly (others species such as the flying squirrels actually glide instead of fly).

== 3. What is the name of the order that bats belong to and what does it mean? ==
Bats are in the order Chiroptera, which literally means &quot;hand-wing&quot; in Latin. This name makes sense because a bat's wings stretch over the forearm and fingers, and attach down at the ankle bones. The name is from the Greek, Cheir=hand; Pteron=wing. They got this name when scientists noticed that they fly with a modified hand.

== 4. What are the largest and smallest bats and where do they live? ==
*'''Largest:''' The biggest flying mammals are the Flying Foxes, particularly those living in Asia and Australia. Several species have a length of 45 cm (17.7 in), a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in), and a weight of 1.6 kg (3.5 lb).  The Indian Flying Fox in particular has been known to attain a wingspan of 6 feet.  
*'''Smallest:''' The world's smallest bat is the Kitti's Hog-Nosed Bat (a.k.a. The Bumblebee Bat) of Thailand.  Weighing less than a penny and with a wingspan of less than 5 inches it is also the worlds smallest mammal.

== 5. How many different types of bats are there worldwide? ==
There are approximately 1000 species of bats in the world, and bats live on every continent except Antarctica. There are approximately 825 species of Micro-chiroptera worldwide, and about 175 species of Mega-chiroptera.

== 6. Bats are divided into two (2) suborders. What are their names? ==
*'''a. Mega-chiroptera''' 

*'''b. Micro-chiroptera'''

== 7. Which suborder of bats uses echolocation and which suborder uses eyesight to find their food? ==
*'''a. Megabats:'''  Use eyesight.  

*'''b. Microbats:'''  Use echolocation. (Bats send out sound waves using their mouth or nose.  When the sound hits an object an echo comes back.  The bat can identify an object by the sound of the echo. They can even tell the size, shape and texture of  a tiny insect from its echo.  Most bats use echolocation to navigate in the dark and find food.)

== 8. What is the diet of the Megabats? ==
The megabats are called fruit bats because many of them eat fruit, nectar, and pollen.

== 9. What is the diet of the Microbats? ==
The microbats are generally insect-eating, although they tend to have a much more varied diet than the megabats.  Besides Insects, microbats eat anything from nectar and fruit like megabats, fish, small mammals and birds, and even blood.

== 10. How many babies does a bat have each year and what are the babies called? ==
Most bats have one baby per year, though some have twins or triplets. Baby bats are called pups.

== 11. Find three Bible texts that mention bats. == 
'''Leviticus 11:19:''' The stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.

'''Deuteronomy 14:18:''' The stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.

'''Isaiah 2:20:''' In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.

=== Which text uses bats in an end-time prophecy? ===
'''Isaiah 2:20:''' In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.

== 12. Do bats hibernate or migrate for the winter? ==
In the cold climates bats either hibernate or migrate to warmer locations.  Bats living in the tropical zones stay active year round.

== 13. Name the parts of a bat. ==
Knee, tail membrane, tail, calcal, foot, wing membrane, fingers, wrist, ear, tragus, forearm, thumb.

The '''calcal''' is a bony structure connecting the leg to the tail.&lt;br&gt;
The '''tragus''' is a feature bats have in common with humans, being the fleshy part of the ear above the lobe and next to the temple.

== 14. How many insects can a bat eat in an hour? ==
600 - 1,000 insects per hour according to their body weight. A single brown bat can eat 1,200 insects per hour.

== 15. What are the two (2) main benefits bats provide for man? ==
*'''a. Eat insects.''' A single brown bat can eat 1,200 insects per hour (3,000 - 7,000 per night). Bats each such harmful insects such as cockroaches, mosquitoes, and gnats. Large colonies of bats can consume many insects that would otherwise harm farmers' crops.

*'''b. Pollinate and spread seeds.''' Bats serve as food plant pollinators.

*'''c. Provide outlet for medical research.''' Their echolocation skills have been studied to help medical professionals help the blind.  A chemical agent in the saliva of the common vampire bat, Draculin, is being tested for use in helping stroke victims.

== 16. Build or purchase a bat box, know the best place to put it and install it at a home, church, or your school. Record for 3 months what kind and how many bats have made it their home. ==
You can find online plans to build your own bat house here:
http://www.batcon.org/bhra/economyhouse.html

For best results, the roosting chamber should be at least 50 cm (20 in) wide, 70 cm (24 in) high, and about 2 cm (3/4 in) deep on the inside.  It should have an open bottom and a roof.  The inside should be roughened with horizontal saw cuts or lined with a plastic mesh so the bats will have something to grab on to.  Do not make the bat box from pressure treated wood, but do use outdoor grade plywood or cedar.  A roof will certainly help preserve the bat box, especially if covered with an asphalt shingle or with metal.

It should ideally be mounted on a building where it can more readily absorb heat, or on a pole.  Mounting a bat box in a tree will ensure that '''no''' bats move in.  The bat box should be mounted away from trees and utility wires where bat predators (hawks, owls, etc.) may roost.  The bat box should be at least 12 feet from the ground.

== 5. What is meant by delayed implantation? ==
Delayed implantation is a reproductive strategy used by close to 100 different mammals in seven different orders. In delayed implantation, the embryo does not immediately implant in the uterus, but is maintained in a state of dormancy. No development takes place as long as the embryo remains unattached to the uterine lining. As a result, the normal gestation period is extended, sometimes up to a year.

== 6. How long is the gestation period for bats? ==
The gestation period lasts from 44 days to 8 months.

== 7. What is bat guano and why was it important during the War of 1812 and the Civil War? ==
Bat guano is bat droppings (feces). Among bat colonies, thousands of pounds of guano can accumulate. During the American War of 1812 and the American Civil War, bat guano was used to make gunpowder, since the primary component of guano is saltpeter – the primary ingredient in gunpowder.

== 8. What disease can be contracted from large quantities of guano? ==
Histoplasmosis, also known as Darling's disease, is a disease caused by the fungus ''Histoplasma capsulatum''. Symptoms of this infection vary greatly, but the disease primarily affects the lungs. Occasionally, other organs are affected; this is called disseminated histoplasmosis, and it can be fatal if untreated. Histoplasmosis is common among AIDS patients because of their lowered immune system.

''H. capsulatum'' grows in soil and material contaminated with bird or bat droppings (guano). The fungus has been found in poultry house litter, caves, areas harboring bats, and in bird roosts (particularly those of starlings).

== 9. What is the life-span of a bat? ==
Most bats live longer than most mammals of their size. The longest known lifespan of a bat in the wild is 30 years for a little brown bat.

== 10. Do all bats have rabies? ==
In regions where rabies is endemic, only 0.5% of bats carry the disease. However, of the few cases of rabies reported in the United States every year not caused by dogs, most are caused by bat bites. Those that are rabid may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly, which makes it more likely that they will come into contact with humans. Although one should not have an unreasonable fear of bats, one should avoid handling them or having them in one's living space, as with any wild animal. If a bat is found in living quarters near a child, mentally handicapped person, intoxicated person, sleeping person, or pet, the person or pet should receive immediate medical attention for rabies. Bats have very small teeth and can bite a sleeping person without being felt. 

Where rabies is not endemic, as throughout most of Western Europe, small bats can be considered harmless. Larger bats can give a nasty bite. They should be treated with the respect due to any wild animal.

== 11. How good is the vision of microbats and megabats? ==
Although the eyes of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, none of them are blind. Vision is used to navigate microbats especially for long distances when beyond the range of echolocation. It has even been discovered that some species are able to detect ultraviolet light. They also have a high quality sense of smell and hearing. Bats hunt at night to avoid competition with birds, and travel large distances at most 800 km, in their search for food.

Most megabats have large eyes, allowing them to orient visually in the twilight of dusk and inside caves and forests. In contrast to the microbats, the fruit bats do not, as a rule, use echolocation (with one exception, the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus egyptiacus, which uses high-pitched clicks to navigate in caves).

== 12. What North American bat is pictured on the honor? ==
The Eastern Red Bat is depicted on the honor patch.  They are widespread across eastern North America, with additional records in Bermuda. It is also scarce but widespread throughout many of the Bahamian islands.

==Colors==
As well as having two sets of numbers, Korean also uses two sets of colors, one being the native Korean set, the other being derived from Chinese characters ''hanja'' 한자 (漢字).


===Native Korean set===

Various like dozens of Korean words represent similar colors but express the different impression of colors. The following Korean words about color are the most neutral and normal words.

Korean colors may be followed by native word, 빛 or 빛깔, or followed by 색 (色) which is derived from Chinese characters. Each word means color.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book features all kinds of short coding samples, often called ''code snippets''. It is not a reference for any specific coding language, or a command reference.

Like an ordinary cookbook, you are not looking for a recipe that can be made from a certain ingredient or using a certain utensil, but you are looking to perform a specific task.

Often, these snippets are multi-disciplinary. Especially with web programming languages, you often use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and possibly server-side languages to perform a certain task. Also, the same result can often be achieved using different languages. Each task can list solutions in several languages.

      <comment>/* Regular Expressions? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Regular Expressions? ==

There are many many proposed regular expression solutions to this problem, however the [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322 e-mail address format] is so complicated that it is difficult to do with a regular expression alone. On the other hand, the vast majority of email addresses that people actually use fall into a small subset of the standard, and thus various usable regular expressions can be found of varying degrees accuracy scattered widely across the internet. If you want to look at a cool regular expression that performs a subset of the email validation process, stare at [http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html this] for a while; there are also some quick not-quite-perfect solutions [http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html here], and a much better one [http://squiloople.com/2009/12/20/email-address-validation/ here]. There are also [https://www.emailanswers.com/services/email-list-cleaning/ email validation services] that will process your email data and provide you with a list of valid/deliverable and invalid/undeliverable emails.

== Practical solution ==
Because parsing an email address is so difficult, it makes little sense to even attempt it; particularly as it would be trivial for someone to give you a correctly formatted email address that still didn't work. This means that the best way to detect whether an email address is valid is to simply send it an email. If you can verify that the email was received, then you know for certain that the email address is valid (though it doesn't guarantee this for any length of time, as many services exist giving out temporary email addresses).

The most common way of doing this is to send someone an email containing a link to an http service with a long random string attached to it, only the email and your server contain the random key, so someone would have to read the email to find the correct link.

The purpose of the random string is to reduce the possibility that someone can make the server believe that the email address exists, while in fact it does not. For example, suppose that the link sent in the email is of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;http://myserver.com/validateemail?address=example@yourserver.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Someone could use an existing, valid email address to see the pattern, and subsequently call the server with any random email address, even without receiving the actual mail containing the link.

Some servers require authentication when opening the link. For example, the user claiming the email address must supply his user id and password when validating it. While this is useful for confidentiality of the data shown on the validation page (including the statement that the address has been validated as an existing address), it does not prevent registering non-existent addresses. Only a long random string used as described above can do that.

Note also that the string must be random only from the client perspective, not necessarily from the server perspective. For example, the server can digitally sign the url, and validate the signature. In this case, the server does not need to store the random key to be able to validate it.

This surely overlaps with the http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Source_code which is also much more extensive and has more comments attached to the code.  Without explanatory comments it surely doesn't qualify as a textbook or even an instruction manual.  Is there any point in having both?  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 12:25, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
: Good question! Well, to begin with, before I started I searched to find a similar project and didn't find anything. I haven't search Wikisource, since (quote from [[Help:How to start a book]]) &quot;Original, finished work should go to Wikisource. Wikibooks is a place to develop books&quot;, and this seems to me something that will never be finished. I have taken a quick look at [[wikisource:Source code]] and must say I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the missing links and unclear structure... -- [[User:Pbb|Peter]] 12:46, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

:: I do agree with your opinion of the structure of [[wikisource:Source code]] and also that the Wikisource guidelines are far from clear.  In fact there was request to have [[wikisource:Source code]] deleted, see [[wikisource:Proposed_deletions#September_2005]].  I suggested it should go to Wikibooks instead but the fuss seems to have died down now.  People are still sporadically contributing to the book so perhaps you might have more impact if you try to improve that book rather than write a new one.  Unfortunately there seem to be two versions: [[wikisource:Source code]] and [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Source_code]   --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:26, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

== General Overview ==

The '''''Shrieking Shack''''' is famed as the most haunted place in Britain. It is a small house, set well away from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade village]], is fenced off, and has all its windows and doors boarded up.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Prisoner of Azkaban'']] ===

The Shrieking Shack gained its reputation some ten or twenty years before our story begins, when loud howls and shrieks emanated from the building at odd times.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we learn that the Shrieking Shack is reached via a tunnel starting beneath the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]], an animate willow tree with a nasty temper. The shrieks and howls were actually produced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], who is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|Werewolf]]. When Lupin was a boy, the Shack was used to contain him during his monthly transformations, allowing him to attend Hogwarts. Once transformed while in the Shrieking Shack, he was unable to escape, and no one could enter without knowing the secret of the Whomping Willow, thus ensuring everyone's safety. Additionally, as the Shack is so remote from the Hogwarts grounds, nobody is likely to connect the sounds from the Shack with an absent Hogwarts student, thus allowing Lupin to keep his lycanthropy a secret.

These revelations are made inside the Shrieking Shack [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 18|near the end of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] follow the tunnel to rescue [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], who was dragged there by a large black dog. The dog is actually the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]] form of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who was attempting to catch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], Ron's pet rat. Scabbers is unmasked as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], another Animagus who betrayed Harry's parents to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], then framed Sirius Black for a crime he never committed. The group is joined by Lupin, who explains his, Black's and Pettigrew's relationship to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]], and about the Whomping Willow and the secret passage under it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Deathly Hallows'']] ===

The Shrieking Shack makes another appearance in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], where Voldemort makes it his headquarters for the first assault on Hogwarts. Voldemort has uncovered a window to watch the battle. He is apparently unaware of the secret passage to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]; Harry, Ron, and Hermione use it spy on him, and also witness [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape's]] death from its concealment.

== Analysis ==

The Shrieking Shack, and its secret connection to the school, are an interesting way of rendering the werewolf Lupin safe within the student body at Hogwarts. The Wizarding world must, of course, be more aware of the existence of magical transformations like lycanthropy, and similarly must have some sort of way of planning for these occurrences. It seems perhaps a bit primitive to deal with what is evidently a disease by isolation, but that does seem to be a way of minimizing the risk to others, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s willingness to go to this extent to allow Lupin to be educated at Hogwarts is an indicator of the sort of efforts he is willing to make on behalf of his charges. One could see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus Black]], for instance, faced with this same sort of situation, simply denying admission to any potential werewolf student.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The connection between the Shrieking Shack and Hogwarts, and the reputation of the Shack, very likely had nothing to do with Voldemort's selection of the building for use as a command post in the battle for Hogwarts at the conclusion of the final book. We can assume that, as Tom Riddle was long gone from Hogwarts when Lupin arrived, the Shrieking Shack holds no fears for Voldemort, and may have seemed only a conveniently-located vacant building he could use as an observation post. Additionally, he was probably unaware that the tunnel existed, as even though both Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew) and Severus Snape had used it, they would have seen little point in mentioning it to Voldemort. We note that Snape seems unsurprised to see Harry in the Shack after Voldemort has dealt him a fatal blow, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|near the end of the final book]]. Snape's earlier use of the tunnel may have been a factor in his lack of apparent surprise at Harry's sudden appearance, though Snape being very near death at that moment may have had more to do with that &amp;ndash; he may simply have not been capable of much surprise at that point.

Also of interest are the ''author's'' reasons for selecting the Shrieking Shack as Voldemort's command post. While it is not necessary that any command post be in direct line of sight from the school, as Voldemort presumably could use magical means, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]], to observe the battle progress from a distance, it should be close enough that he can dispatch messengers like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]. The author, however, knew that this would be the place where Snape died, and the place where he transferred his memories to Harry; it is safe to assume that she had planned the revelation of Snape's motivations from the start of the series, and the plot had carried things to the point where this had to be done. Thus, Voldemort's command post had to be close enough to the school for Harry to reach it, despite the intervening battle lines, yet far enough away that Voldemort did not feel that he was putting himself in danger; and it had to be somewhere that Harry, looking through Voldemort's eyes, would recognize. Finally, it had to be relatively private. This last requirement rules out almost every building in Hogsmeade, despite the likely partial abandonment of the village during the Death Eater occupation and Hogwarts attack; Hogsmeade residents and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] would still be wandering around most buildings. About the only place that meets all these requirements is the Shrieking Shack, with its protected tunnel that secretly crosses the battle lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Is this okay? ==

So, I started writing this set of documents, based on lots of code I've got lying around in various places. After some time, I got a remark that this book has got a lot in common with [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Source_code the Source Code project on Wikisource]. I checked that location, and after recovering from the shock of so many missing links and such lack of structure, I see that some of the articles there would fit the criteria for this book.

But I am confused. Isn't Wikisource for finished books? It says so on [[help:How to start a book]]. While, with the development speed of computer systems, there will always be new &quot;common tasks&quot; to be performed and new practices to perform them. And why is that book there in the Wikisource namespace?

I wouldn't mind delving into that Wikisource project to restructure it, if there is any viability in that. (Since the project is already proposed for deletion.) Is there enough overlap in the two projects? For example, I wouldn't think the various &quot;Hello World&quot; programs have a place in ''this'' project, since they don't perform any usable function apart from letting the reading study the language in question.

Any input is appreciated!

      <text xml:space="preserve">So called ''Jovian planets'' are named after Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System. They are also called the ''gas planets'' because they consist mainly of hydrogen, or the ''giant planets'' because of their size. These planets usually have complicated system of many moons and often even rings of ice and/or dust.

There are four Jovian planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

==The Solar System Jovians==

===Jupiter===
Jupiter is the innermost planet of the gas giants. It has a mass of 1.9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; kg (approx. 318x the mass of Earth) and is 142,800 kilometers (88,736 miles) across the equator. Jupiter possesses 63 known satellites, four of which - Callisto, Europa, Ganymede and Io - were observed long ago by Galileo in 1610. It is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane, ammonia, water vapor and other compounds. At great depths within Jupiter, the pressure is so high that the hydrogen atoms are broken up and the electrons are freed so that the resulting atoms consist of bare protons. This produces a state in which the hydrogen becomes metallic. 

Jupiter has a very dynamic weather system. It also has a very lean dusty ring.

Jupiter has a very powerful magnetosphere and is so enormous, that if it could be observed from the Earth would appear as large as the Moon.

===Saturn===
Saturn's mass is 5.688 x 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; kg (approx. 95x the mass of Earth) and its equatorial diameter is 119,300 kilometers (74,130 miles). Saturn is the only planet less dense than water (about 30 percent less). It has a beautiful, big and rich system of (mostly) icy rings. It has one large moon called Titan and many smaller moons.

===Uranus===
Uranus' mass is 8.686 x 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; kg (approx. 14.5x the mass of Earth ). Its equatorial diameter is 51,800 kilometers (32,190 miles). It also has a ring family, five big moons and many smaller moons. Its rotational axis lies near its orbital plane, so it appears at times as if it is rolling on its orbit.

===Neptune===
Neptune is the outermost planet of the gas giants. Its mass is 1,024 x 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; kg (approx. 17x the mass of Earth). It has an equatorial diameter of 49,500 kilometers (30,760 miles). It has one large moon, Triton (the coolest known object in our Solar system - around -235° C) as well as various smaller moons including Nereid. Neptune has four known, very dark rings.

'''Consequences of Radiotherapy to the Heart'''
:''See also:'' RT toxicity from [[Radiation Oncology/Breast/RT toxicity|Breast]]


==Pericardial Effusion==
*'''MD Anderson; 2008''' (2001-2003) PMID 18191334 -- &quot;Risk factors for pericardial effusion in inoperable esophageal cancer patients treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy.&quot; (Wei X, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Mar 1;70(3):707-14. Epub 2008 Jan 11.)
**Retrospective. 101 patients, inoperable esophageal CA, treated with concurrent chemo-RT. RT dose 45-50.4 Gy. Pericardium defined as 0.5 cm radial expansion to cardiac contour
**Outcome: crude rate 28%, median time-to-onset 5.3 months (1-17 months)
**Predictors: no clinical factors; dosimetric V30 &gt;46%, mean dose &gt;26 Gy
**Conclusion: High-dose RT to pericardium may increase risk of pericardial effusion


==Breast cancer==
*'''Oxford; 2013''' (1958-2001) PMID 23484825 -- &quot;Risk of ischemic heart disease in women after radiotherapy for breast cancer.&quot; (Darby SC, N Engl J Med. 2013 Mar 14;368(11):987-98.)
**Case-control study. Pts treated in Sweden or Denmark. 
***''Study population'' consisted of all women (ages &lt; 75) with breast cancer who received RT (both right and left); excluded pts with metastatic dz at diagnosis or prior thoracic RT. 
***''Cases'' (n=963) consisted of pts who had a major coronary event (MCE) -- MI, coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease -- that occurred after the diagnosis of breast cancer but before any recurrence or diagnosis of a 2nd malignancy.
***''Controls'' (n=1205) were selected at random from all pts in the study population; matched to country of residence, age at breast cancer diagnosis, and year of diagnosis. Had all received RT and had no recurrence of breast cancer and no 2nd cancer and no major coronary event before the index date.
***Radiation dosimetry was estimated. Reconstructed the radiation plan (using a diagram or photograph of the original RT fields and the original dose plan when available) on a CT scan of a patient with typical anatomy. Constructed DVH for the whole heart and LAD artery. Computed equivalent doses (EQD2) in 2-Gy fractions, using an alpha/beta ratio of 2 Gy. Note: 3D planning dosimetry was not available for the treated patients.
**Major coronary events: 44% at &lt; 10 yrs from ca diagnosis, 33% at 10-19 yrs, and 23% at 20 or more years. 54% of case pts died from ischemic heart disease.
**RT: 
***Lt-sided RT associated with higher rates of MCE (rate ratio = 1.32). No other association between MCE and other tumor characteristics or treatment factors, such as use of chemotherapy; trend for positive nodes (p=0.06, rate ratio 1.20). 
***Average mean heart dose: 6.6 Gy (left breast), 2.9 Gy (right breast), 4.9 Gy (overall). The rate of MCE increased by 7.4% for each increase of 1 Gy. The mean heart dose was a better predictor than the dose to the LAD. 
***For dose ranges (mean heart dose): &lt; 2 Gy, 10% increase; 2-4 Gy, 30%; 5-9 Gy, 40%; 10 or more Gy, 116%.
**Patient-related factors: positive history of ischemic heart disease (rate ratio 6.67); also: circulatory disease, diabetes, COPD, current smoker, obesity, analgesic medication use.
**The percentage increase in risk of MCE is similar for women with and without ischemic heart disease. Absolute radiation-related risks are greater in those with preexisting cardiac risk factors.
***Example: 50 yr old women with no cardiac risk factors. Mean heart dose: 3 Gy. Increase risk of death from ischemic heart disease from 1.9% to 2.4% (absolute increase of 0.5%). Increase risk of having at least one acute coronary event from 4.5% to 5.4% (increase of 0.9%).
**Conclusion: &quot;Exposure of the heart to ionizing radiation during radiotherapy for breast cancer increases the subsequent rate of ischemic heart disease. The increase is proportional to the mean dose to the heart, begins within a few years after exposure, and continues for at least 20 years. Women with preexisting cardiac risk factors have greater absolute increases in risk from radiotherapy than other women.&quot;


*'''Uppsala University; 2012''' (1970-2003) PMID 22203772 -- &quot;Distribution of coronary artery stenosis after radiation for breast cancer.&quot; (Nilsson G, J Clin Oncol. 2012 Feb 1;30(4):380-6. Epub 2011 Dec 27.)
**Retrospective cohort. Linked breast cancer and coronary angiography registries. 199 patients. Two hotspots defined as proximal RCA and mid/distal LAD
**Outcome: Odds ratio for left-sided radiation for grade 3-5 stenosis LAD 4.4 (SS), grade 4-5 stenosis 7.2 (SS)
**Conclusion: Increase in stenosis in mid/distal LAD in irradiated left-sided breast cancer; risk increases for severe stenosis
    
*'''U Penn; 2007''' (1977-1995) PMID 17634481 -- &quot;Coronary artery findings after left-sided compared with right-sided radiation treatment for early-stage breast cancer.&quot; (Correa CR, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jul 20;25(21):3031-7.)
**Retrospective. 961 patients with Stage I-II BCA, conventional tangents. Screened with stress tests and cardiac cath
**10-year risk of CAD: right and left 7% (NS)
**12-year risk of cath abnormalities: right 8% vs. left 59% (SS); 70% in LAD territory
**Conclusion: Left-sided RT as component of BCS causes increased risk of later coronary damage

**114 pts. Breast cancer. Pts imaged with technetium 99m sestamibi or tetrofosmin pre- and post-RT. 
**42% incidence of perfusion defects at 24 months.

Lancet. 1999 Oct 23;354(9188):1425-30.
***No increased risk of ischemic heart disease at 12 yrs.

==Hodgkin Disease==
*'''Zurich, 2007''' PMID 17512861 -- &quot;Radiotherapy and the heart.&quot; (Bramkamp M, Lancet. 2007 May 19;369(9574):1762.)
**Case report. 47M with CAD, s/p mantle field to 40 Gy for HD in his teens


==Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma==
*'''SEER/Colorado; 2010''' (1988-2004) PMID 19515509 -- &quot;Cardiac mortality in patients with stage I and II diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with and without radiation: a surveillance, epidemiology, and end-results analysis.&quot; (Pugh TJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Mar 1;76(3):845-9. Epub 2009 Jun 8.)
**SEER analysis. 15,454 patients, Stage I-II DLBCL, treated with anthracycline-based chemo, anti-CD20 antibody. RT given in 39%. Primary outcome cardiac-specific mortality (CSM). Median F/U 3 years
**Cardiac-specific mortality: 5-year RT+ 4.3% vs RT- 5.9%; 10-years 9.0% vs 10.8%; 15-years 13.8% vs 16.1% (HR 1.3, SS)
**Conclusion: Increased anthracycline exposure in patients treated only with chemo may result in increase in cardiac deaths


==Childhood disease==
*'''INSERM; 2010''' (1942-1986) PMID 20142603 -- &quot;Role of cancer treatment in long-term overall and cardiovascular mortality after childhood cancer.&quot; (Tukenova M, J Clin Oncol. 2010 Mar 10;28(8):1308-15. Epub 2010 Feb 8.)
**Retrospective. 4,122 5-year survivors of childhood cancer in France and UK. Chemotherapy and RT info collected; RT heart dose estimate. Average F/U 27 years
**Outcome: Overall standardized mortality ratio 8.3 compared to general population. Cardiac death SMR 5.0, if anthracycline &gt;360 mg/m2 RR 4.4 (SS), if RT dose 5-15 Gy RR 12.5, if RT dose &gt;15 Gy RR 25. Linear relationship between heart dose and risk of cardiac mortality, estimated RR 60% at 1 Gy
**Conclusion: Relationship between RT dose to heart and long-term cardiac mortality</text>

==Multifield breast technique==
The patient lies on a breast board that is inclined to ensure that the sternum is horizontal. The arm on the ipsilateral side is abducted to 90 degrees and is supported by arm supports on the breast board.

'''Tangential fields to the breast/chest wall'''&lt;br&gt;
The chest wall or breast is treated isocentrically and is covered by a pair of wedged tangential fields. The posterior beam edges are parallel to reduce divergence into the lung. The superior beam edges are also parallel to allow matching of the fields to any supraclavicular or axillay fields. The whole breast is included to ensure any residual or microscopic disease is irradicated.

''Borders''&lt;br&gt;
Superior: suprasternal notch&lt;br&gt;
Inferior: 1 - 2 cm inferior of the inframammary fold, enough to ensure full breast coverage&lt;br&gt;
Medial: anatomical midline&lt;br&gt;
Lateral: midaxillary line (may be moved posteriorly to ensure complete coverage of breast tissue)&lt;br&gt;
Anterior: about 1cm anterior of breast, to ensure coverage during normal breathing&lt;br&gt;
Posterior: to cover chest wall, with a maximum lung depth of 2cm&lt;br&gt;

''Prescriptions''&lt;br&gt;
50Gy to isocentre in 25# daily over 5 weeks, 6 or 10 MV photons&lt;br&gt;
40Gy to isocentre in 15# daily over 3 weeks, 6 or 10 MV photons&lt;br&gt;
Both prescriptions are widely used in the UK.

'''Supraclavicular field'''&lt;br&gt;
If the supraclavicular and/or axillary nodes are involved then a supraclavicular field will be used. This field is matched to the tangential fields of the breast to prevent any overdose to the junction of the fields. Shielding (from either lead or MLCs) is used to shield the shoulder joint (preventing fibrosis of the joint) and the apex of the lung.

''Borders''&lt;br&gt;
Medial: 1cm ipsilateral to anatomical midline (to avoid the oesophagus)&lt;br&gt;
Lateral: insertion of pectoralis major; lateral border of the coracoid process to cover insertion of pectoralis minor&lt;br&gt;
Inferior: to match breast tangentials&lt;br&gt;
Superior: to cover&lt;br&gt;

''Prescription''&lt;br&gt;
The dose is prescribed to the depth of the supraclavicular nodes. The prescriptions are generally the same as for the breast.

'''IM or Medial Field'''&lt;br&gt;

'''PAB'''&lt;br&gt;
If coverage of deep nodes lymph node levels is desired or dose coverage for supraclavicular field provides inadequate coverage due to axillary node seperation, then a posterior axillary boost may be prescribed to provide optimal dose distribution. &lt;br&gt;

''Borders''&lt;br&gt;
Medial: 1.5-2.0 cm of lung&lt;br&gt;
Lateral: Lateral posterior axillary fold &lt;br&gt;
Inferior: to match breast tangentials&lt;br&gt;
Superior: splits clavicle&lt;br&gt;
 
''Prescription''&lt;br&gt;
Anterior SCV field and the posterior PAB field overlap varies from patient to patient. Dose is prescribed such that the combined dose distribution is optimal and provides coverage of nodal volumes. Additional edits may be made to borders of PAB to block high dose regions due to overlap with SCV field.


==RT Prescription==
*'''North Puget, 2000''' PMID 10837972 -- &quot;The impact of dose-specification policies upon nominal radiation dose received by breast tissue in the conservation treatment of breast cancer.&quot; (Kantorowitz DA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jun 1;47(3):841-8.)
**Absorbed dose normalized as a function of different prescription methods. Idealized breast slice, RT dose 46 Gy + 20 Gy boost = 66 Gy 
**Results: for 66 Gy prescription, absorbed dose varied from 66 Gy (100% isodose line for both breast and boost) to 76.11 Gy (breast 90% isodose line and boost 80% isodose line); difference of 13%
**Recommendation: use [[Radiation_Oncology/Physics#ICRU_Reports|ICRU 50]], with Breast PTV1 = whole breast + 1-2 cm margin, specified at tangent beam intersection on the central plane, or 2/3 distance from dorsal beam edge to skin along perpendicular breast bisector. Boost PTV2 = lumpectomy cavity + 1-3 cm margin, specified at 90% with electron energy sufficient to provide 85% isodose coverage

==Target Delineation==
*[http://www.rtog.org/pdf_file2.html?pdf_document=BreastCancerAtlas.pdf RTOG Breast Cancer Atlas]


*'''RTOG; 2009''' PMID 19215827 -- &quot;Variability of target and normal structure delineation for breast cancer radiotherapy: an RTOG Multi-Institutional and Multiobserver Study.&quot; (Li XA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Mar 1;73(3):944-51.)
**Prospective. 9 breast radiation oncologists, target and organ at risk delineation, 3 representative BCA patients
**Outcome: Substantial variability, structure overlaps as low as 10%, standard deviations of up to 60%. Differences both due to target/organ boundaries, incorporation of setup uncertainty, and dosimetric limitations
**Conclusion: Differences clinically and dosimetrically significant; consensus highly desirable

*'''Netherlands Cancer Institute, The Netherlands; 2001''' PMID 11483349 -- &quot;Variability in target volume delineation on CT scans of the breast.&quot; (Hurkmans CW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Aug 1;50(5):1366-72.)
**Retrospective. 7 patient scans, 4 radiation oncologists, 3 sets of contours per patient
**Outcome: Average deviations posterior (4.2 cm), anterior (0.6 cm), cranial (2.8 cm), caudal (1.5 cm), medial (2.4 cm), lateral (0.8 cm). Intraobserver variation in volume 5.5%, interobserver variability 17.5%, overall agreement 0.43
**Conclusion: Large intra- and inter-observer variation in delineation of breast target on CT scan

**Prospective. 20 women, early BCA, candidate for APBI. 3D ultrasound at CT-sim. 3 RT oncologists contoured volumes on CT and U/S image sets. Coregistration within 2mm in 95%
**Outcome: Improved interobserver consistency in U/S over CT in 40% cases, mainly in low CT seroma clarity or heterogenous/dense breast parenchyma
**Conclusion: 3D ultrasound can be useful adjuct to CT planning

==Whole Breast RT==
===IMRT===
'''''Randomized'''''
*'''Canada''' (2003-2005) -- 2D vs. IMRT
**Randomized. 331 patients, early-stage BCA (no &gt;=4 LN+) treated with breast-only RT. Arm 1) 2D tangent + wedge vs. Arm 2) IMRT. RT dose 50/25 + optional 16 Gy electron boost.
**'''2008''' PMID 18285602 -- &quot;A Multicenter Randomized Trial of Breast Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy to Reduce Acute Radiation Dermatitis.&quot; (Pignol JP, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 19 [Epub ahead of print])
***IMRT associated with decreased moist desquamation ), in inframammary fold (26% vs 43%). The breast volume (V95) is associated with acute skin toxicity.
***Outcome: Dose distribution: IMRT better. Moist desquamation anywhere in breast: IMRT 31% vs 2D 48% (SS), 26% vs. 43% (SS), no difference in pain 23% vs. 25% (NS) or QoL
***Conclusion: Breast IMRT reduced occurrence of moist desquamation

*'''Royal Marsden''' -- 2D vs. IMRT
**Randomized. 240/306 patients. Early stage. Treated with Arm 1) IMRT vs. Arm 2) 2D using standard wedges. Dose 50/25 + boost 11.1/5.
**'''2007''' PMID 17224195 -- &quot;Randomised trial of standard 2D radiotherapy (RT) versus intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients prescribed breast radiotherapy.&quot; (Donovan E, Radiother Oncol. 2007 Mar;82(3):254-64.) Minimum F/U 5 years
***Change in breast: IMRT 40% vs. 2D 58% (SS); significantly fewer developed palpable induration. No difference in pain, hardness, or QoL
***Conclusion: Minimisation of inhomogeneity reduces late adverse effects


'''''Retrospective'''''
*'''Pittsburgh; 2009''' PMID 19624420 -- &quot;Initial outcomes analysis for large multicenter integrated cancer network implementation of intensity modulated radiation therapy for breast cancer.&quot; (Bhatnagar AK, Breast J. 2009 Sep-Oct;15(5):468-74. Epub 2009 Jul 13.)
**Retrospective. 495 patients, IMRT after BCS, large integrated cancer center network (7 community centers and 2 academic centers). Centralized IMRT planning. IMRT 50/25 + 10 Gy boost
**Outcome: Erythema Grade 1 55%, 2 28%, 3 1%; skin desquammation 20%, 4%, 1%. No difference between community and academic centers
**Conclusion: IMRT can be safely and effectively administered in a large health system

**Evaluation of radiation body exposure, given higher risk of leukemia for BCA patients receiving adjuvant anthracycline. 120 women, measurements taken during RT 
**Standard 50 Gy: abdomen 0.45 Gy (0.06-1.55 Gy). Physical wedges result in 3x more exposure compared to IMRT

*'''Fox Chase, 2006''' PMID 16462506 -- &quot;Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) decreases acute skin toxicity for women receiving radiation for breast cancer.&quot; (Freedman GM, Am J Clin Oncol. 2006 Feb;29(1):66-70.)
**Matched case control. 73 women with IMRT vs. 60 women with conventional planning. 
**Acute toxicity: no difference using CTC grading. Degree of desquamation greater for conventional patients. Large breasts worse
**Conclusion: IMRT decreases severity of acute desquamation; CTC grading not sensitive

===Active Breath Hold===
*'''William Beaumont, 2003''' PMID 12788176 -- &quot;Initial clinical experience with moderate deep-inspiration breath hold using an active breathing control device in the treatment of patients with left-sided breast cancer using external beam radiation therapy.&quot; (Remouchamps VM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Jul 1;56(3): 704-15.)
**Moderate deep-inspiration breath hold (75% of max inspiration) with active breathing control device. Goal to reduce heart dose in L BCA. 5 patients where &gt;2% of heart received &gt;30 Gy on free breath
**RT: during breath hold; durations ranging 18-26 seconds; 2-3 per beam. Step-and-shoot IMRT. 45 Gy or 50.4 Gy. Interfraction setup max 3.2mm, intrafraction max 2mm
**Outcome: V30 reduction of 3.6% and NTCP reduction of 1.5%; however increased lung V20
**Comment: not clear if this will translate into a meaningful clinical difference with modern RT techniques, and especially with more patients potentially receiving [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Partial_breast_irradiation|APBI]]

***Treatment planning. 20 patients, w/p surgery and Level I-II axillary dissection. Match line placed caudal, bisecting, and cranial to ipsilateral clavicular head. Nodal volume coverage evaluated.
***Outcome: Mean volume of Level III LN covered by 90% isodose line caudal 100% vs. bisecting 92% vs. cranial 68% (SS)
***Conclusion: Placement of match line should be caudal to clavicular head

***Retrospective.  Analyzed simulation films of pts treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (in 65 pts) and pts with clips marking the extent of axillary dissection (39 pts). 
***With the cranial field edge 2 cm below humeral head, the sentinel LN was included in the field in 95% of cases and the entire extent of axillary dissection (level I-II) was included in 43% of cases and covered 80% of the axillary dissection field in the rest of patients.  
***Conclusion: By extending the tangent field edge to 2 cm below the humeral head and 2 cm deep to the chest wall - lung interface, the RT fields will include the SLN and most of level I and II axilla.

**Retrospective. 106 data sets. Patients who underwent SLN biopsy and had surgical clips placed. 
**Outcome: SLN clips varied in vertebral level position between T2-T7 (most common T4). Within standard tangents 90% (below head of clavicle), within standard SCV field in 10% (above head of clavicle)
**Conclusion: Standard axillary fields do not encompass lymph nodes at highest risk of containing tumor, but 90% are included in standard tangents

**Retrospective. 50 consecutive patients with standard tangents. Dose distribution to axillary Level I and II evaluated
**Outcome: 95% isodose line encompassed 55% (23-87%) of anatomic Level I-II volume; it encompassed 81% (58-98%) of surgical clips
**Conclusion: Standard tangents failed to deliver a therapeutic dose to axillary Level I-II anatomic volume

Epub 2007 Dec 31.)
***Retrospective. 33 patients with advanced/metastatic BCA, PET+ in SCV LN. 52 LN identified. Locations mapped onto 4 separate planning CT done previously for SCV field (2 SCV+ and 2 SCV- by biopsy). 
***Outcome: 10% in H&amp;N Level III, 63% in H&amp;N Level IV, 21% in H&amp;N Level V (in 5 patients posterior to vertebral transverse process), 6% Axilla Level III. Close proximity to medial border in several patients
***Conclusion: Distribution of LNs identified. Increased coverage medially and posteriorly may be warranted with locally advanced disease
**'''SCV depth; 2007''' PMID 17889264 -- &quot;Treatment Optimization Using Computed Tomography-Delineated Targets Should be Used for Supraclavicular Irradiation for Breast Cancer.&quot; (Liengsawangwong R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Nov 1;69(3):711-5.)
***Retrospective. 32 patients, plan adequacy evaluated for depth of SC and Level III LNs. Plans evaluated were 6 MV @ 1.5cm, 6 MV @ 3.0 cm, 18 MV @ 3.3 cm, and mixed beam to optimize target volume to 90%
***Outcome: mean depth SC 3.2 cm (1.4-6.7 cm), mean depth LIII 3.1 cm (1.7-5.8 cm); significant variance with BMI. CT plans better than standard 3cm prescription
***Conclusion: CT-based treatment planning should be used for SC fields vs. traditional 3cm prescription depth

==PAB field==
*'''Duke''', 2000 - PMID 10837961 &amp;mdash; &quot;Variability of the depth of supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer: is a posterior axillary boost field necessary?&quot; Bentel GC et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jun 1;47(3):755-8.
**PAB field was used historically based on the assumption that the axillary LNs lie deeper than the SCLV nodes (based on pre-CT era). This study shows that the dose to the axillary LN is within 90% of the SCLV dose. Suggests that the role of the PAB field needs to be refined.

**Dosimetric comparison. Seven techniques (standard tangents; electron CW and IMN; cobalt; reverse hockey stick; 30/70 photon electron mix angled; 20/80 photon/electon mix AP, partial wide tangent fields). Dose 50/25
**Outcome: Standard tangents significantly less IMN dose than all others, then reverse hockey stick and cobalt, then all others, which were statistically similar. Partial wide tangents smallest heart V30
**Conclusion: No one technique best CW and IMN coverage, with minimal heart and lung complication probabilities. Partial wide tangents most appropriate balance

**Dosimetric comparison. Four techniques (standard tangents/SCV, wide tangents, partial wide tangents, medial electron/shallow tangents). Dose 50/25
**Conclusion: Significant anatomic variation, need to use CT planning. Partial wide tangent best choice

**Retrospective. SEER-Medicare linked database. 18,050 women, age &gt;65, Stage 0-II BCA, treated with BCS + RT, no chemo.
**Outcome: Median time surgery-&gt;RT 34 days. LR in 4%. Interval &gt;6 weeks associated with 0.96% increase in LR at 5 years (SS). On continuous modeling, HR 1.005 per day (SS). Starting &gt;6 weeks associated with LN+, comorbidity, low income, Hispanic/non-white, residence outside southern states
**Conclusion: Continuous relationship between interval to RT and local recurrence in older women

**Retrospective. 4,820 patients, postop RT. surgery to start RT grouped &lt;60 days, 61-120 days, 121-180 days, and &gt;180 days
**Outcome: Timing of RT not significant on multivariate analysis. Independent risk factors for poor outcome age, SM, and boost
**Conclusion: Timing of RT itself doesn't affect local recurrence

Epub 2008 Nov 17.)
**Retrospective. 6428 patients, T1-2 N0-1. No chemotherapy. Intervals evaluated were &lt;4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-16, 16-20, and &gt;20 weeks. 23% patients &gt;12 weeks interval. Median f/u 7.5 yrs. 
**Outcome: No significant difference in recurrence for groups treated with a surgery-to-RT interval up to 20 weeks. Increased relapse rate for interval &gt;20 weeks vs 4-8 week reference group: 10-year LR 6% vs. 10% (HR 2.0, p=0.2), DM 9% vs. 23% (HR 1.9, SS), BCSS 93% vs. 82% (HR 2.1, SS)
**Subset analysis: Similar HR for N0 subset, and patients not treated with hormone therapy. Patients treated &gt;20 weeks still better local control compared to no RT at all (HR 2.3, p=0.08)
**Conclusion: RT should start within 20 weeks of BCS; there is no impact on local control but significant benefit to distant control and breast cancer specific survival.

**SEER. DCIS or Stage I, women aged 66+. Of 7791 pts undergoing RT, 16% had delay in RT (&gt;8 weeks post surgery if no chemo or &gt;4 weeks post chemo), 3% had incomplete RT
**More likely to experience subsequent breast event if had delay in RT (OR 1.14). Those with incomplete RT had higher overall mortality (OR 1.32). Longer RT delays (&gt;12 weeks, or &gt;8 weeks with chemo) had a strongly negative impact on evens (OR 3.94 for DCIS, 2.77 for invasive).
**Conclusion: RT should be facilitated to ensure completion and timeliness.

**In pts with negative margins (&gt;2 mm) low risk of local failure if SRI &lt; or &gt; 120 days. If margins close, positive, or unknown, lower risk for early radiotherapy (6%) vs delayed (24%).

*JCRT - see discussion at [[Radiation Oncology/Breast/Breast chemotherapy#Sequencing chemotherapy and radiotherapy|Sequencing chemotherapy and radiotherapy]] (Recht, 1996) which discusses effect of margin status

==Irradiation after breast augmentation==
*M.D.Anderson 1990 - PMID 2298621 - 11 pts followed 3-16 yrs after RT
**Conclusions: 1) Better cosmetic outcome after RT for pts free of fibrotic changes in the augmented breast before RT, 2) 45 Gy to the whole breast preferred over higher doses, 3) irradiation immediately after reconstruction led to poorer cosmetic results.

==Irradiation after breast reconstruction==
*Memorial Sloan Kettering 2004 (1995-2001) - PMID 15108879 - 156 pts (81 pts irradiated, 75 controls)
**68% of RT group developed capsular contracture vs 40% controls. Cosmesis good to excellent in 80% vs 88% (N.S.). 

*Mayo (Scottsdale) 2004 - PMID 15289733 - 15 pts, TRAM flaps
**13 of 15 had cosmesis rated as good or better

*'''Fox Chase, 2004''' (1987-2002) - PMID 15234042 &amp;mdash; &quot;Low complication rates are achievable after postmastectomy breast reconstruction and radiation therapy.&quot; Anderson PR et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jul 15;59(4):1080-7.
**85 pts. Tissue expander + implant, 50 pts; TRAM, 35 pts. Reconstruction first in 70 pts (RT at a median of 7 mos post-surgery), RT first in 15 (median interval 13 mos). 

*'''MDACC, 2001''' (1988-98) - PMID 11420508 &amp;mdash; &quot;Comparison of immediate and delayed free TRAM flap breast reconstruction in patients receiving postmastectomy radiation therapy.&quot; Tran NV et al. Plast Reconstr Surg. 2001 Jul;108(1):78-82.
**32 pts with immediate TRAM followed by RT, 70 with TRAM following RT. 
**No difference in early complications between groups. More late complications (87% vs 8%) for immediate reconstruction vs delayed group. 



'''''RT following TRAM:'''''
*'''Cleveland Clinic, 2000''' (1985-99), PMID 10889371 &amp;mdash; &quot;The acute effects of postoperative radiation therapy on the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap used in immediate breast reconstruction.&quot; Hanks SH et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jul 15;47(5):1185-90. 
**25 pts.
**Conclusion: Postmastectomy radiation for TRAM flap reconstruction is well tolerated and is not associated with an increased incidence of acute side effects. Radiation technique and the use of preradiation chemotherapy do not appear to be correlated with an increased incidence of acute side effects.


==RT Utilization==

**Survey respondents and matched SEER data. For BCS, strong indications (LN+ or T3-T4) or weak indications (elderly). For mastectomy, strong indications (LN+ or T3-T4) or weak indications (T1N1, T2N1 or T3N0)
**Outcome: Strong indications for RT actually received it BCS 96% vs mastectomy 78% (SS). Weak indications for RT actually received it BCS 80% vs mastectomy 47% (SS)
**Predictors for RT: surgery type, indication strength, age, comorbidity, income, patient desire to avoid RT, level of surgeon involvement, and SEER site
**Conclusion: RT after BCS high, lower after mastectomy</text>

The second most common peripheral nerve compressive neuropathy, cubital tunnel syndrome has unique features clinically and anatomically which make it a more challenging problem to deal with.

From the standpoint of surgical intervention there are minimalists who favor in situ decompression and there are are those who might be characterized as traditionalists who favor submuscular transposition. The other options are intermediate, consisting of epicondylectomy, anterior subcutaneous transposition, usually accompanied by a fascial sling.  Then there is the hybrid operation of sort which is referred to as an intramuscular transposition in which rotated flaps of muscle fascia form the roof of the tunnel, the floor is the fleshy muscle bellies left attached, while fibrous bands that might produce kinking or compression of the nerve within the muscular bed are released. With all the transposition options it has become customary to excise the distal aspect of the medial intermuscular septum. This tissue may be left attached distally and use to augment a fascial sling for a subcutaneous transposition, or the fascial roof of a submuscular or intramuscular transposition. When the flexor pronator origin is taken down it is desirable to reconstruct in a fashion that will allow for early motion at least through a limited arc to promote gliding of the nerve in its new bed and to avert stiffness in the elbow.   
 
From the standpoint of diagnostic criteria and surgical intervention there are those who contend that unless there are electical studies to document the problem then it is not cubital tunnel syndrome and certainly not a problem to be addressed by surgical intervention to decompress the ulnar nerve.  

From the standpoint of pathophysiology there are those who consider this a nerve compression and those who emphasize the importance of local strain as a potential souce for symptoms.  In the latter case, this is considered an additional rationale for anterior transposition over any method which may leave the nerve posterior to the flexion axis of the elbow where it will remain subject to more strain.

Causation with regard to work relatedness can be controversial and especially in cases wherein electrodiagnostic studies are negative but symptoms severe. A contentious situation can arise leading to protracted work loss and litigation.  The situation is more difficult because an appropriately cautious surgeon will be reticent to embark upon surgical intervention in the absence of objective verification in the form of an abnormal electical study.  The prudent surgeon will recognize that surgery for cubital tunnel has a mixed track record for success.  In the event of an unsatisfactory outcome with surgical intervention followup electordiagnostic studies and likely and not unexpectedly may indeed show changes after a surgery where none were present before.  This  is liable to be characterized as an iatrogenic worsening of the condition.  Despite this and other hazards having to do with the medico-legal and social issues surrounding the problem, it is widely held that early surgical intervention for cubital tunnel is associated with a more favorable outcome than late surgery.  Ultimately insight in patient selection in conjunction with sound technique will allow successful navigation of these hazards.

The spectrum of clinical manifestations include patients with discreet sensory manifestations in the ulnar nerve distribution reporting diminished sensation in the small finger, ulnar half of the ring finger and the dorsal ulnar aspect of the hand.  Other patients report mainly pain or an ache along the medial forearm, and poorly localizing tingling in the hand.  Weakness can be due to pain or to the denervation of hand intrinsics and the FDP to the small finger.  Pain as a dominant feature tends to lessen with greater severity.

The differential diagnosis becomes problematic as patients may describe pain at the shoulder or base of the neck, and sensory manifestations in the forearm. Both of these features invoke consideration of a cervical radiculopathy or neurogenic thoracic outlet, however either can accompany cubital tunnel with a retroaxonal pain pattern and forearm sensory manifestations due to direct irritation of the medial brachial or antebrachial cutaneous nerves.   The latter may be especially likely wherein the pathological process is instigated by blunt trauma, or pathological subluxation of the ulnar nerve about the medial epicondyle.

In a significant minority of patients upper extremity complaints do not confine themselves to a single source.  The first task for the surgeon is to discern what combination of pathologies are responsible for the complaints, which are linked and which are discreet and which might be reasonably addressed together, and which are best treated separately.  Cubital tunnel commonly occurs in conjunction with carpal tunnel syndrome, or with tendinopathy of the common extensor origin.  While it may be prudent to address the problems individually it is tempting to combine procedures to resolve the problem in one sitting.  The latter approach requires keen insight or luck in selecting the right patient who can recover efficiently from a combined operation.  The concern is that a morass of symptoms may be attibuted to multiple compressive neuropathies and tendinopathies when in fact they are manifestations of a pain syndrome which is only aggravated by an ill conceived surgical intervention made all the worse by a multi-sight surgery.  The desire to resolve the problem in one blow may be well intentioned, and is appealing for its potential efficiency from the standpoint of cost and down time, but if the surgery fails a nightmare of protracted disability can ensue.

==Introduction==

[[File:DNA microarray.jpg|thumb|A DNA microarray as seen through a microscope.  Protein chips look identical, except each spot corresponds to one of the organism's thousands of proteins, instead of one of it's genes.  The intensity of the dot indicates the amount of protein present.]]

[[Wikipedia:en:Protein_chip|Protein chips]], also referred to as protein arrays or protein microarrays, are modeled after [[Wikipedia:en:Microarrays|DNA microarrays]].  The success of DNA microarrays in large-scale genomic experiments inspired researchers to develop similar technology to enable large-scale, high-throughput proteomic experiments.  Protein chips enable researchers to quickly and easily survey the entire proteome of a cell within an organism.  They also allow researchers to automate and parallelize protein experiments.

Protein chips were first developed in 2000 by researchers at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;MacBeath G, Schreiber S. (2000). Printing Proteins as Microarrays for High-Throughput Function Determination. Science. Sep 08; 289 (5485): 1760-1764.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today there are many companies manufacturing protein chips using many types of techniques including spotting and gel methods.  The types of protein chips available include &quot;lab on a chip&quot;, antibody arrays and antigen arrays, as well as a wide range of chips containing &quot;alternative capture agents&quot; such as proteins, substrates and nucleic acids.

Analysis of protein chips comes with many challenges including dynamic protein concentrations, the sheer number of proteins in a cell's proteome, and the understanding of the probes for each protein.  Steps include the reading of the protein levels off the chip, and then the use of computer software to analyze the massive amounts of data collected.

Applications of protein chip experiments include identifying biomarkers for diseases, investigating protein-protein interactions, and testing for the presence of antibodies in a sample.  Protein chips have applications in cancer research, medical diagnostics, homeland security and proteomics.

This chapter will demonstrate why protein chips are changing the face of proteomics, and why they will have an even larger impact in the future.

==History==
===Nucleic Acid Microarrays===
The use of [[Wikipedia:en:DNA_microarrays|microarrays]] for gene expression profiling was first published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Schena M, Shalon D, Davis RW, Brown PO. (1995). Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray. Science. Oct 20; 270 (5235): 467-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  This technology allowed scientists to analyze thousands of [[Wikipedia:en:Mrna|mRNAs]] in a single experiment to determine whether expression is different in disease states.  Unfortunately, mRNA levels within a cell are often poorly correlated with actual protein abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Gygi SP, Rochon Y, Franza B, Abersold R: Correlation between protein and mRNA abundance in yeast. Mol. Cell Biol. 19, 1720-1730 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be due to many factors including degradation rate of mRNA versus proteins and post-transcriptional controls and modifications.  Measuring the amount of protein directly would bypass any mRNA inconsistencies and give a true level of gene function, however traditional protein characterization methods were slow and cumbersome.  These combined factors were the impetus behind the creation of protein chips.

===Deficiency of Traditional Protein Characterization Methods===

[[Image: LC_MS_pic.jpg|thumb|A liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS) instrument. This technique is low throughput compared to protein chips because protein chips can test for thousands of proteins on a single chip in a single experiment.]]

Before the advent of protein chips, protein measuring and characterization was done using  two different methods: [[2D gel electrophoresis]] coupled with [[mass spectrometry]], and [[liquid chromatography]].  These methods can separate and visualize a large number of proteins per experiment, however they are time consuming when compared to protein chips.  Their process is very low-throughput because of lack of automation.  Reproducibility is also a factor because of the large amount of sample handling.  A better, more standardized, higher-throughput method needed to be invented for protein measuring and characterization.

===Protein Chip Precursors to Modern Day===

[[Image: ELISA pic.jpg|thumb|The equipment and reagents used in an Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), a precursor of protein chips.]]

Immunoassays, the precursor to protein chips available since the 1980s, exploit the interactions between [[Wikipedia:en:Antibodies|antibodies]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Antigen|antigens]] in order to detect their concentrations in biological samples.  Their creation, however, is tedious and expensive.  As a response to this, researchers at Harvard University combined the technologies of immunoassays and DNA microarrays to develop the protein chip.&lt;ref&gt;MacBeath G, Schreiber S. (2000). Printing Proteins as Microarrays for High-Throughput Function Determination. Science. Sep 08; 289 (5485): 1760-1764.&lt;/ref&gt;  In their landmark paper, published in 2000, &quot;Printing Proteins as Microarrays for High-Throughput Function Determination,&quot; Gavin MacBeath and Stuart Schreiber described how to create protein chips and demonstrated three types of applications that would benefit from this new technology.  The strengths of their approach were the use of readily available materials (i.e. glass slides, polyacrylamide gel), the relative ease of implementation (robotic microarray printers), and compatibility with standard instrumentation.

Within the past five years, many companies, including [http://www.biacore.com Biacore], [http://www.invitrogen.com Invitrogen], and [http://www.sigmaaldrich.com Sigma-Aldrich], have begun production of industrial level protein array systems that can be used for drug discovery and basic biological research.  Commercial entities have made protein chip research a streamlined and standardized process on the same level as DNA microarrays compared to its inception in 2000.

Academic research plays a huge role in the development and improvement of these technologies. The collaboration of academic research with systems such as the Affymetrix GeneChip and the Human Genome Initiative has allowed for friendly competition, resulting in the advancement of technologies. With more develops come a better understanding and encourages even more research towards these fields. 

[http://www.Affymetrix.com Affymetrix] is a company that has been manufactures microarrays, named GeneChip, since 1992. They have 13 locations across the world with headquarters located in the US (California), UK, Japan, and China.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Affymetrix.&quot; Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 5 Feb 2007, 03:19 UTC.

Animation Master’s Toon Render has a lot to offer. This topic is dedicated to providing the Animation Master Community with an in depth examination of Toon Rendering.


Of the many properties for surfaces, Toon Lines and Toon Shading control how surfaces render when Toon Render is ON in the Rendering Options window.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Toonproperties.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


To turn Toon Render ON, click Tools on the menu bar and select Options, or press Ctrl+P to bring up the Options window. Click on the Rendering tab, make sure that Advance is checked, and click on the OFF next to Toon Render to turn it to ON.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:RenderOptionsToonRenderClosed.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


If you open up the Toon Render menu, you will see three different selections: Lines Only, Override Lines, and Override Shading.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:RenderOptionsToonRenderOpen.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


===Lines Only===

If Lines Only is turned to ON, there will not be any shading for the scene that is being rendered. Lines Only cannot be used with Override Shading. If none of the models have Toon Line properties set, all of the lines in the scene will have default values.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DefaultToonLines.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


For the examination of Toon Render, frame 175 of the project Toys will be used.


&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


This is what is rendered when Lines Only is turned ON with default values for Toon Lines.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DefaultToonLinesLinesOnly.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The outlines of surfaces are now the only visible definition of the original render. Lines Only is a very simple rendering option, and has no other features inside of itself.


===Override Lines===

When Override Lines is set to ON, every surface's lines will be rendered the same. 


Note: When Lines Only is set to OFF and Override Lines is set to ON, an option called Render Lines appears in the Override Lines menu. If Render Lines is set to OFF, and then Lines Only is set to ON, the render will produce no visible lines.


There are three different settings for Override Lines: Color Method, Thickness, and Toon Line Bais.


====Color Method====

The Color Method sets what color the lines will render. There are two Color Methods: Specific and Percent Underlying. The default Color Method is Specific Color.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ColorMethods.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


When Specified Color is selected, the Color Method menu shows a color value. Specified Color for the Lines Only image is set to black, but it can be set to any color. The background color is the color of the camera’s background color, so you can make any combination of color with them.


When Percent of Underlying is selected, the Color Method menu shows a Percent value that can range from 0%-100%.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:PercentofUnderlying.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The default value is 20%. This is what is rendered for Percent of Underlying.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:PercentUnderlying20.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


This may look like the Lines Only render, but under a closer look, the lines are not the same color. This is what is rendered when the percentage is increased to 100%.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:PercentUnderlying100.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Now the lines are colored the exact color of their surface’s diffuse color. The blocks, spaceship, and crayon box have a white diffuse color, and that explains why they only have a grey outline of their edges.


====Thickness====

The Thickness sets the width of the lines. The value ranges from 0 to 20 with 2 as the default. This is what is rendered when the thickness is set to .5.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Thickness0-5.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The lines are much finer, and details that had once been covered up by large lines have come into view. This is what is rendered when the thickness is set to 10.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Thickness10.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The thick lines have covered up much of the detail in the scene. If the lines were any thicker, it would be difficult to tell what was in the scene.


====Toon Line Bias====

The Toon Line Bias sets the amount of line detail for a surface. The smaller the value of Toon Line Bias, the finer the detail that is rendered. The values range from .01 to 1000. This is what is rendered with a Toon Line Bias of 2.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ToonLineBias2.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The thickness of this render was set to .5. Far more detail is visible now with a lower value for Toon Line Bias. This is what is rendered for a Toon Line Bias of 500.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ToonLineBias500.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Only a small amount of detail is left around the outsides of the main models. This is what is rendered for a Toon Line Bias of .1.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ToonLineBias0-1.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


An incredible amount of detail is now visible; however, because there is so much detail, the scene no longer has the look of Toon about it. This would be better used for a stylized look rather than a cartoon.


===Override Shading===

Override Shading does exactly what it says it does. It sets the shading for every surface. Remember that you must have Lines Only set to OFF in order to use Override Shading.


There are four different Methods for Override Shading: Standard, Toon, Toon with Fallof, and Toon Gradient Only.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OverrideShadingCobo.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


====Standard====

The Standard method takes the original background, and simply overlays lines onto it. Here is what is rendered with Standard Method.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OverrideShadingStandard.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The Standard method does not have gradients like the other three methods, so the only thing left to do for renders using Standard is to adjust the Override Lines.


====Toon====

When you select one of the other three Methods, you get another option.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OverrideShadingGradientAppearance.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Gradients control how surfaces are shaded, but there is a lot to gradients, so those will be discussed in the next section. The Toon method, in version 12, only renders ambiance with lines, so if you want to use this method with little to know ambiance values, you will have to use lightly colored lines. Otherwise, you will have to turn on Gobal Ambiance, or set the individual Ambiance Intensity; there are faster ways to do this with other methods. This is what will render if you simply turn on the Toon method, and do not change the Specific Color Method Color.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ToonNoSpecificColorMethodColorChang.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The Spaceman is barely visible. This is what is rendered with any gradient will render with the Toon method that has a white color for the Specific Color Method.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ToonMethodWhiteSpecificColorMethod.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


====Toon with Falloff====

This Method is very similar to the Standard method, except that now you have a gradient that tells how the shading of surfaces will be rendered. Like the Standard method, Toon with Fallof method uses the diffuse color of models as well as the diffuse color of lights to create the color layer for a render.


This is what is rendered when you use the default Two-Tone (with line) gradient.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OverrideShadingToonWithFallof.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The render is much brighter now because of how the gradient is set up. There are also solid lines which indicate where the least amount of lighting is on models like the binoculars. Once again, an examination of gradients will be saved for the next section.


====Toon Gradient Only====

The Toon Gradient Only method does not use the diffuse color of lights to create the color layer of a mask. Instead, it relies on the setup of the gradient, and the diffuse color of the models.


This is what is rendered with the Toon Gradient Only method with the default Two-Tone (with line)gradient.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OverrideShadingToonGradientOnly.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


By selecting a different gradient, you can get a different shading style. This is what is rendered with changes to the line thicknesses, and gradient is now set to the Preset gradient of Two-Tone(Soft).


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OverrideShadingToonGradientOnlyTwo-.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


===Gradients===

Gradients control how shading is rendered in certin Shading Methods. Animation Master comes with five preset gradients. To select a preset gradient, right click on the gradient bar in the Method menu, and select Preset.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientPresets.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


When a different gradient is selected, a new set of key points appears on the Gradient bar.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:AllGradientPresets.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Each of the gradeints renders differently because of the properties of each key point. The construction of a Gradient is not difficult. Start by deleting all of the key points on the gradient map. To delete a key point, first click on the key point, then right click on it, and select Delete Key.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientDeleteKey.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


I suggest saving the cleared gradient so you do not have to delete every key every time. To save a Gradient, right click on the Gradient bar, and select Preset, and then select Create at the bottom. Name this gradient CLEARED. If you look at the presets, the new gradient will appear.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:CreatedGradient.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Now that the gradient is cleared, new points can be added without being changed by prexisting points. To add a point, left click anywhere on the Gradient bar. The points you add will be set to the default value which is based on the percent the key point is at and creates a grey scale gradient. To look at the properties of the key point, first left click on the key point, then right click on the key point, and select Key Settings.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientKeySettings.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


====Position====

At the top, you have the Position. This is the location of your key point on the gradient. Setting different values will move the point. The closer the percentage is to 100%, the farther right the key point is, and vice versa for percentages closer to 0%. 


====Color====

The Color has two options: This Color, and Object Color. 


=====This Color=====

If you select This Color, the Gradient will be set to that color at that point.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientThisColorRed.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The Gradient will not change color until you press OK. To see how gradients are rendered, we will make a color spectrum Gradient.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientRainBowSet.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


There are five key points on this Gradient: The first one is set to 0% and has This Color set to Red, then there is 25% with Yellow, 50% with Green, 75% with Blue, and 100% with Violet. This is what is rendered with this Rainbow Gradient.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientColorSpectrumRender.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


This Color has rendered the frame without any original surface or light color. From this render, it can be concluded that the right side of the Gradient bar controls highlights, the left side controls the darkness, and everywhere in between controls the mid tones.


This is rendered with This Color set to black at 0%, and white at 100%.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientThisColorBlackToWhite.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


This Gradient has created somewhat of a matte white render with lines. This is what is rendered with This Color set to white at 0%, and black at 100%.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientThisColorWhiteToBlack.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The highlights are now set to darkness, and the darnkess is now set to highlights. If this frame is rendered with a Gradient with This Color set to White at 50%, it would look just like a renders in Override Shadding which do not have a gradients on them at all.


=====Object Color=====

Object Color sets the brightness of the tones based on the Gradient bar. A standard render would have the Position percent and the Object Color persent set to the same value. If the Object Color percent is set higher than the Position of the Key point, the render will have darker highlights. If the Object Color Percent is set lower than the Position of the Key point, the render will appear to have less darkness.


This is what is rendered when there is a Key point at 0% with a 0% Object Color, and a Key point at 100% with 100% Object Color with Toon Gradient Only.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientObjectColorBlackToWhite.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


If one does not want any lights or darks in the render, the Cartoon preset Gradient can be used. This is what is rendered with the Cartoon Gradient.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientCartoon.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The Cartoon Gradient has one Key point set at 50% with Object Color set at 100%. If shadows are desired, the Anime Preset can be used with Toon Gradient Only. This is what the Anime preset will render.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientAnime.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


The zig-zagging effect of the shadows in this render are caused by the use of Z-Buffered Shadows.


=====Mixing This Color and Object Color=====

Gradients can be made up of both This Color and Object Color settings. This opens many more possibilities for Gradients. One mixture in particular renders quite a stylized look. Create five Key points in the Gradient bar. Set the Positions to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Set the 0% Key point to This Color to Black, set the 25% to Object Color with 25%, set the 50% to Object Color with 50%, set the 75% to Object Color with 75%, and set 100% to This Color to White.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientThisColorObjectColorMixWithLines.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


Now the mid tons have the only color in the scene, and the rest of the render is comprised of lights and darks. This is what is rendered when the Method is changed to Toon with Falloff.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:GradientThisColorObjectColorMixFalloff.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;


This opens even more possibilities for Gradients and Toon render.


===Conclusion===
Hopefully all of these examinations of Toon Render open up some more creativity for future projects with Animation:Master. Toon render is not just used to make scenes look like cartoons; Toon render is also used to set the mood of the scene and can do a very good job of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Radiation Oncology/Prostate:TOC}}

==Endorectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging==
* On axial T1 gland appears homogeneous and the zonal anatomy is not well appreciated 
* Postbiopsy hemorrhage is evident on T1-weighted images as high T1 signal intensity (important because hemorrhage may mimic tumor on T2 and greatly interferes with assessment of ECE)
* zonal anatomy is best seen on axial and coronal T2 as are the vas deferens and SV
* neurovascular bundles best seen on axials 
* penile root is better imaged on T2 coronals
* peripheral zone is hyperintense whereas tumor appears is HYPOINTENSE (other causes of low T2: hemorrhage, prostatitis, hormone treatment, and RT)
* Hemorrhage: high T1, low T2 



==Bone Metastases Detection==
*'''Brussels, 2007''' (Belgium) PMID 17664475 -- &quot;Magnetic resonance imaging of the axial skeleton for detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer: diagnostic and cost-effectiveness and comparison with current detection strategies.&quot; (Lecouvet FE, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 1;25(22):3281-7.)
**Prospective. 66 patients with high-risk PCA (newly diagnosed PCA with GS &gt;=8 and PSA &gt;=20; PSA recurrence after RP with PSADT &lt;12 months; on ADT and PSADT &lt;12 months). Evaluated by bone scan + targetedplain films (BS/TXR) vs. bone scan + targeted plain films + MRI-on request (BS/TXR/MRIor) vs. axial MRI (MRIas)
**Outcome: 62% bone mets. MRIas more sensitive than current sequence of sequential workup (bone scan, targeted XR, MRI of area at risk)

==Role of Bone Scan==
*&quot;&quot;Columbia University, 2000&quot;&quot; PMID 11121646 -- &quot;Which patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer need a radionuclide bone scan? An analysis based on 631 patients&quot; (Lee, N, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 vol. 48 (5) pp. 1443-6)
**Retrospective review of 631 consecutive patients treated at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center between 1990-1996 who had both a Gleason score and a bone scan.  Reviewed clinical factors associated with positive bone scan.
**Results: 14% with positive bone scan. Multivariate analysis: only Gleason 8-10, PSA&gt;50, and clinical T-category &gt;T2b predicted positive bone scan. All 237 patients with Gleason 2-7, PSA&lt;15 and T-category&lt;T2b had negative scans.  1% of those with Gleason 2-7, PSA&lt;=50, &lt;=T2b had positive bone scan. In those with PSA&gt;50, 49.5% had positive bone scan.</text>

      <comment>/* Miscellaneous Cleanup Tasks */ Move some stuff around</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you're seeing this page you've either come here from my [[User:Xerol|user page]] or because I put a [[User:Xerol/CleanupNotice|Cleanup Notice]] on a talk page. If it's from the latter, I probably identified a problem that can easily be fixed, but I'd prefer the cleanup be done by someone who has knowledge about the book in question so that I just don't make things worse.

Right now, if you're getting to this page from the Cleanup Notice, it's probably because I've found some [[Special:Lonelypages|orphans]] that belong in a particular book. Pages that have been categorized but not explicitly linked to in page text will appear there, which means you're probably using Categories as a table of contents, and if I've linked a '''lot''' of pages then a full TOC page or more internal links is probably required.

==Miscellaneous Cleanup Tasks==
These are problems I've found but haven't found the appropriate place to notify people about yet, or am waiting to amass a number of similar issues to solve them all in one (or few) actions.

My current major project is to get the number of [[Special:Lonelypages|orphaned pages]] down to a list of pages that are ''necessarily orphaned'' - that is, there's a reason for the page to exist, and there's a reason for no other pages to link to it. Note that I may link to some of these pages from '''this page''', which will remove them from the list on the next refresh, but it does not mean the problems have been resolved.

===Unassigned Orphans===
Pages that don't fit into any of the other 'categories' I've got listed here.
*''None for now''

===To-be-shelved===
Top-level pages that need to be indexed beyond categories. These are probably the most important to take care of, since they're not linked to from anywhere and therefore probably won't be developed. I'm collecting these here for now, once I get a couple dozen I'll put them in appropriate indices.

It seems that books can now be 'properly' categorized without actually being linked anywhere. I'll therefore divide the list into those that need categorization and those that don't.

====Categorized Books====
*[[A-level Critical Thinking]]
*[[Admission to Graduate School in the U.S.]] - Last significant activity Sep 2009
*[[Advanced Analog IC design]] - Book stub; Last significant activity Oct 2009
*[[An Imaging Guide to Mars]]
*[[An Introduction to Punjab (Pakistan)]] - Extreme stub with only two content edits; sole contributor's last edits Sep 2009
*[[Build Your Own Solar Power Generator]]

====Uncategorized Books====
*''None for now''

===Misplaced Subpages===
Maybe they were just misnamed, or an index somewhere was changed and they were forgotten. These are pages within non-orphaned books that became orphaned at some point.
*[[Algorithm Implementation/Simulation/Monty Hall problem/Usefulness]]

===Placeholder Pages===
These are pages that have been created and locked to prevent spam/vandalism or unbookified pages.
*[[Acknowledgements]]
*[[Auction]]

===Orphan Redirects===
Orphaned pages that consist of solely a redirect. In some cases there's a reason to keep the redirect around (mainly for Search use) but in cases they just clutter things up.

Some of these might be forks of existing modules here, in which case they'd probably be candidates for [[WB:DP|speedy deletion]]; in other cases they may simply need to be linked from the main module. --[[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] | [[User talk:Xerol|Talk]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just a word to say that I don't think the [[Wikitopia]] book is within Wikibooks' purview. I've opened a discussion on [[WB:VFD]] and you may want to contribute there, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:26, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

== Role of Wikibooks ==

First of all, I'm going to give you a general welcome message:

{{{1|Welcome, {{PAGENAME}}!}}}
{| style=&quot;background:white; border:1px solid #abd5f5;; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px;&quot;
 ! style=&quot;background:#d0e5f5;&quot; | [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|Getting started]] with Wikibooks
 |-
 | style=&quot;padding:5px;&quot; |
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. Find out [[WB:WIW|what this means]].
* To sign your name (on talk pages), use four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
* For help in using the wiki, see the [[Help:Editing|editing guide]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold|be bold]], and have fun!
 |}

Come introduce yourself at the [[WB:SLN|new users]] page.  If you have any questions, you can ask there or contact me personally.

----

These are all pages you should look at, and in particular look at [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] for a general view of what sorts of content is acceptable on Wikibooks.

You might also want to check out [[meta:Proposals for new projects]] for a place to suggest new project ideas like the one you seem to have proposed for [[Wikitopia]].  I know it sounds harsh, but Wikibooks is about writing content that would seem more like a book with scholarly research (aka looking things up in a book and synthesizing the material from several sources) and the development of textbooks directly intended for classroom usage.

If you were writing something about Wikitopia, which exists elsewhere, this would be a good place to write about that project.  It isn't a place to start a general participatory project with an ideological tilt to it.  From some considerable experience, both I and others have seen books that seem like yours to get an initial burst of development and then languish on Wikibooks for months or even years without any additional contributions.  Or worse yet, it becomes a BBS of a sort with participants doing things that have absolutely nothing to do with Wikibooks.

If there is an ideological tilt to Wikibooks, it is that we want to help provide an alternative to bookstores (especially college bookstores with their textbooks) where an ordinary student can obtain a high quality textbook for a realitively low cost.  Most textbook authors on that level don't really make much money anyway off of a particular book, so this is to help provide a way to simply get the material available to more people.

I want you to know that I really do value new contributors to Wikibooks, and I enjoy seeing truly innovative ways that people like to express themselves.  IMHO marking up the page for immediate deletion was completely wrong by the above user, but he does have reasons for the opinions he is trying to express here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:49, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

----

After realizing that the scope of wikibooks is much more specific than I had originally gathered, it appears that my wikibook will probably need to find a new wikihome.  I respect the mission of wikibooks and don't feel slighted in the least.  I appreciate your polite presentation and will have this wiki relocated in the next day or two when I find a more appropriate location for it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Educational Learning Object Repositories

The dramatic growth in e-learning has brought about a massive increase in the learning resources that are available on-line.  The catalogue of hardware and software packages available to the modern day educator and learner is constantly evolving as each new technology is developed.  Learning materials are written by a wide range of practitioners from professional software developers to pupils experimenting with programming, from teachers to parents.  

A wide range of these materials are available in the public domain and can be found in a variety of LORs (Learning Object repositories).  The learning object can be as small as a paragraph of text or a large as whole programme.  It can come in the form of HTML, text files, JAVA, flash or QuickTime movies etc. The LOR has come about as a direct result of the need for these resources to be easily found and reusable.

Much of the resources found in LORs have been substantially researched and reviewed, this can save the new user much valuable time in identifying good quality and effective resource.  Some offer a variety of fee based services to support the end user and give added information and instruction on the usage of the resource.

There are a number of LORs that can be directly associated with education and are supported by educational institutions.  One such site is MERLOT [http://www.merlot.org/Home.po] a free and open resource designed for faculty and students primarily studying Higher education.  The links contain online learning material, peer reviews and assignments.  Membership is free and is made up of individual members, Higher education, institutional and corporate partners dedicated to improving education.

With so many resources available the development of an LOR that looks to standardise the materials and make them available through a standardised learning environment.  Desire2Learn Learning Object Repository [http://www.desire2learn.com/products/products_learning_object_repository.asp]  has developed a package that is designed to save time and money.

D2L Standards-Based Technology
Adopting technologies that are built with open standards offers your organization accessibility, compatibility, interoperability and membership to a larger community.

The D2L LOR technology incorporates industry standards and specifications such as IMS-Content Packaging, SCORM and IEEE LOM.  The D2L metadata editor also supports other metadata application profiles such as Dublin Core, GEM, CanCore and others.
This standards-based technology enables you to quickly import and retrieve learning objects, use other authoring tools, create global partnerships and seamlessly incorporate content into your course or share learning objects with colleagues worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assessment Tools

The process of assessment in the context of learning can be defined as;
An act of judgement of a person or situation or event leading to an evaluation or rating.

To assist in the process of assessment and to allow us to make better judgements, assessment tools have and continue to be developed and refined.  Assessment can take many forms;
 
•	Case studies
•	Direct Observation
•	Examination
•	Multi-choice Test
•	Performance Projects
•	Practical Projects
•	Problem Sheets
•	Simulations
•	Essays
•	Oral Questions
•	Portfolios
•	Presentations
•	Projects
•	Short Answer Questions

 

For the purpose of this entry we can focus on the assessment tools that are more readily available on-line.

Paperless Portfolio

The paperless electronic portfolio enables learners following an NVQ qualification to receive the NVQ standards that they are working towards on a CD along with any relevant policy and procedures.  It gives the learner a resource to record all of their evidence of assessment.  The evidence is digitally transposed into the portfolio and can include digital pictures and sound recording.  The technology is able to authenticate the work to ensure that it is original and authentic.  If this technology is used widely it will provide a quick and economically friendly system.


Multiple choice Tests

An advantage of on-line multiple choice tests is that they can be graded and marked in a fraction of the time taken using a descriptive answer questionnaire.  The setting up of multiple choice tests take longer than descriptive tests but done properly the results compare favourably.  The negative aspect is that a multiple choice test does allow an amount of guessing and can result in unexpected grades. An example of an on line test can be accessed below.
Driving Theory Test[http://www.dsadrivingschool.co.uk/theorytest/theory-test.htm]


Simulation

Computer Simulations can represent real or imaginary situations; they allow users to experience things that would be difficult or impossible to do normally.  Simulation is particularly useful when carrying out a task would be too dangerous or expensive or when the desired result would take too long to produce.  A good example of where simulation can be applied is in the area of design.  Simulation allows the user to create and change designs as often as required yet allows the user to view an end product at little cost or effort compared to doing it for real.  Garden design can be accomplished through simulation with good results click the link below to try it out. 

Design a garden[http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/htbg2/virtual_garden/shockwave/garden.shtml]

These are just a few examples of the Assessment Tools that are available to on-line users.

      <comment>Foo should be Serializable</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{java:transient}} is a Java keyword which marks a member variable not to be serialized when it is persisted to streams of bytes.  When an object is transferred through the network, the object needs to be 'serialized'.  Serialization converts the object state to serial bytes. Those bytes are sent over the network and the object is recreated from those bytes.  Member variables marked by the java {{java:transient}} keyword are not transferred, they are lost intentionally.

Syntax:
 {{java:private}} {{java:transient}} &lt;member-variable&gt;;
 or 
 {{java:transient}} {{java:private}} &lt;member-variable&gt;;


For example:
{{java|code=
 public class Foo implements Serializable
 {
   private String saveMe;
   private transient String dontSaveMe;
   private transient String password;
   //...
 }
}}

Languages can change over time. The form of English that you speak is likely to be slightly different to the form of English that your parents &amp;mdash; or grandparents &amp;mdash; speak. For example, you may pronounce some words differently from them or there might be some words that you've heard of that they haven't (and vice-versa).

Many people underestimate the extent to which languages can change. To give you an idea, here is the Lord's Prayer as it might have been written in the English that was spoken about 1000 years ago (called [[w:Old English|Old English]]):

:Fæder ure þu þe eart on heofo
:Si þin nama gehalgod. 
:To becume þin rice,
:Gewurþe ðin willa,
:On eorðan swa swa on heofonum.
:Urne gedæghwamlican hlaf syle us todæg,
:And forgyf us ure gyltas,
:Swa swa we forgyfað urum gyltendum.
:And ne gelæd þu us on costnunge,
:Ac alys us of yfele.  Soþlice.

Here's the version as it might have been written about 650 years ago (called [[w:Middle English|Middle English]]):

:Oure fadir þat art in heuenes,
:Halwid be þi name.
:Þi reume or kyngdom come to be,
:Be þi wille don,
:In herþe as it is doun in heuene.
:Yeue to us today oure eche dayes bred,
:And foryeue to us oure dettis þat is oure synnys,
:As we foryeuen to oure dettouris þat is to men þat han synned in us.
:And lede us not into temptacion,
:But delyuere us from euyl.  Amen.

Finally, here's the [[w:Early Modern English|Early Modern English]] ([[w:King James Bible|King James Bible]], 1611) equivalent:

:Our Father who art in heaven, 
:Hallowed be thy name.
:Thy kingdom come,
:Thy will be done, 
:On earth as it is in heaven.
:Give us this day our daily bread,
:And forgive us our trespasses,
:As we forgive those who trespass against us.
:And lead us not into temptation, 
:But deliver us from evil. Amen.

== Language families and proto-languages ==

As languages change, the people who speak them sometimes split up into groups and travel apart from each other. Since there is usually very little contact between these groups, the languages that they speak often change in different ways to each other. This forms a ''family'' of languages that all came from a common source.

&lt;!-- More needed here --&gt;
A '''proto-language''' is the ancestor of other languages.

== Adding history to a conlang ==

&lt;!-- More needed here --&gt;
If natural languages change over time, then why not make your conlang change over time to? You could invent a whole family of languages that all came from the same source. Note that it is easier to invent a daughter language for a known, or previously invented, mother language than vice versa. This section on history will help you to do this.

== Introduction ==
&lt;p&gt;As technological advances are made in the field of proteomics, it is seen that advances are necessary in the preparation of protein samples prior to any particular procedure. A number of issues arise in this respect; including sample clean-up, fractionation, enrichment, and the also sample condition optimization. Considerations of this nature can be crucial in obtaining relevant results from an experiment; some so much so that experts feel the field of proteomics is currently being limited by the lack of significant advancement in sample preparation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This facet of proteomics is becoming particularly critical in the case of high throughput protocols where the necessary conditions of a sample in one stage may directly conflict with the efficacy of a second stage. For example, during the initial step in 2D electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, all proteins in a sample are given a net charge of zero; while the second step, gel electrophoresis, requires a negative charge on all products in the sample in order to induce movement through the gel matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies offer pre-packaged kits that will allow you to prepare samples for many different techniques.  They also offer many protein samples, and other protein technologies.  Many of these companies are also on the forefront of protein analysis technology.  Some examples are:&lt;/p&gt;

I've tested this myself; AB does 360% max. Although, perhaps you have found something new. If so, please show me a screenshot of AB doing 520% damage. If you have any other evidence of this, I would also be interested in seeing it. Thanks. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 20:24, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

PS: As for now, I'll leave the guide up as it was before, because of my personal tests on this subject (ex. fireing 500+ shots at Iron Hogs, Snails, and other creatures to test true damage % rates using both AB and DS)</text>

La Cigale, ayant chanté&lt;br /&gt;
Tout l'été,&lt;br /&gt;
Se trouva fort dépourvue&lt;br /&gt;
Quand la bise fut venue:&lt;br /&gt;
Pas un seul petit morceau&lt;br /&gt;
De mouche ou de vermisseau.&lt;br /&gt;
Elle alla crier famine&lt;br /&gt;
Chez la Fourmi sa voisine,&lt;br /&gt;
La priant de lui prêter&lt;br /&gt;
Quelque grain pour subsister&lt;br /&gt;
Jusqu’à la saison nouvelle.&lt;br /&gt;
« Je vous paierai, lui dit-elle,&lt;br /&gt;
Avant l’Août, foi d’animal,&lt;br /&gt;
Intérêt et principal. »&lt;br /&gt;
La Fourmi n’est pas prêteuse:&lt;br /&gt;
C’est là son moindre défaut.&lt;br /&gt;
« Que faisiez-vous au temps chaud ?&lt;br /&gt;
Dit-elle à cette emprunteuse.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash; Nuit et jour à tout venant&lt;br /&gt;
Je chantais, ne vous déplaise.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash; Vous chantiez ? J’en suis fort aise.&lt;br /&gt;
Eh bien ! Dansez maintenant. »

The cicada, having sung&lt;br /&gt;
All summer long,&lt;br /&gt;
Found herself sorely deprived&lt;br /&gt;
When the north wind arrived:&lt;br /&gt;
Not a single morsel&lt;br /&gt;
Of fly or tiny worm.&lt;br /&gt;
She went to plead famine&lt;br /&gt;
At the house of the Ant her neighbor,&lt;br /&gt;
Praying her to lend her&lt;br /&gt;
Some grain to survive&lt;br /&gt;
Until the new season.&lt;br /&gt;
“I will pay you,” she said to her,&lt;br /&gt;
“Before August, on my honour as an animal,&lt;br /&gt;
Interest and principal.”&lt;br /&gt;
The Ant is not a lender:&lt;br /&gt;
That is the least of her faults.&lt;br /&gt;
“What were you doing in warm weather?”&lt;br /&gt;
She said to this borrower.&lt;br /&gt;
“Night and day to all that came&lt;br /&gt;
I sang, if you please.”&lt;br /&gt;
“You sang? I am very glad.&lt;br /&gt;
Well! Dance now.”&lt;br /&gt;

Maître Corbeau, sur un arbre perché,&lt;br /&gt;
Tenait en son bec un fromage.&lt;br /&gt;
Maître Renard, par l’odeur alléché,&lt;br /&gt;
Lui tint à peu près ce langage :&lt;br /&gt;
« Hé ! bonjour, Monsieur du Corbeau.&lt;br /&gt;
Que vous êtes joli ! que vous me semblez beau !&lt;br /&gt;
Sans mentir, si votre ramage&lt;br /&gt;
Se rapporte à votre plumage,&lt;br /&gt;
Vous êtes le Phénix des hôtes de ces bois. »&lt;br /&gt;
A ces mots le Corbeau ne se sent pas de joie ;&lt;br /&gt;
Et pour montrer sa belle voix,&lt;br /&gt;
Il ouvre un large bec, laisse tomber sa proie.&lt;br /&gt;
Le Renard s’en saisit, et dit : « Mon bon Monsieur,&lt;br /&gt;
Apprenez que tout flatteur&lt;br /&gt;
Vit aux dépens de celui qui l'écoute :&lt;br /&gt;
Cette leçon vaut bien un fromage, sans doute. »&lt;br /&gt;
Le Corbeau, honteux et confus,&lt;br /&gt;
Jura, mais un peu tard, qu’on ne l’y prendrait plus.

Mr. Crow, sitting in a tree,&lt;br /&gt;
Held a piece of cheese in his beak.&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Fox, mouth watering from the scent,&lt;br /&gt;
Uttered almost precisely this to him:&lt;br /&gt;
“Hey! Good morning, Mr. Crow.&lt;br /&gt;
How lovely you are! You look so beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;
Without lying, if your songs&lt;br /&gt;
Are in keeping with your feathers,&lt;br /&gt;
You are the Phoenix of the inhabitants of these woods.”&lt;br /&gt;
With these words the Crow feels nothing but delight.&lt;br /&gt;
And to show off his beautiful voice,&lt;br /&gt;
He opens a wide beak and lets his prey fall.&lt;br /&gt;
The Fox grabs it and said: “My dear sir&lt;br /&gt;
Learn that every flatterer&lt;br /&gt;
Lives at the expense of the one who listens to him.&lt;br /&gt;
This lesson is worth a piece of cheese, no doubt.”&lt;br /&gt;
The Crow, ashamed and embarrassed,&lt;br /&gt;
Swore, but a bit late, that he would never be fooled again.&lt;br /&gt;

==The fable==

Deux mulets cheminaient, l’un d’avoine chargé, &lt;br&gt;
L’autre portant l’argent de la gabelle &lt;br&gt;
Celui-ci, glorieux d’une charge si belle, &lt;br&gt;
N’eût voulu pour beaucoup en être soulagé. &lt;br&gt;
Il marchait d’un pas relevé, &lt;br&gt;
Et faisait sonner sa sonnette : &lt;br&gt;
Quand, l’ennemi se présentant, &lt;br&gt;
Comme il en voulait à l’argent, &lt;br&gt;
Sur le mulet du fisc une troupe se jette, &lt;br&gt;
Le saisit au frein et l’arrête. &lt;br&gt;
Le mulet, en se défendant, &lt;br&gt;
Se sent percé de coups ; il gémit, il soupire. &lt;br&gt;
Est-ce donc là, dit-il, ce qu’on m’avait promis ? &lt;br&gt;
Ce mulet qui me suit du danger se retire ; &lt;br&gt;
Et moi j’y tombe et je péris ! &lt;br&gt;
— Ami, lui dit son camarade, &lt;br&gt;
Il n’est pas toujours bon d’avoir un haut emploi : &lt;br&gt;
Si tu n’avais servi qu’un meunier, comme moi, &lt;br&gt;
Tu ne serais pas si malade.

==Introduction==
When it comes to the weather, there is nothing more common on the news other than sports. People don't pay much attention to the weather until they have an issue with it or are planning something for outside. They rarely think about what goes into making that weather report or how weather works. Hopefully this book will tell you those things and maybe a little more. So next time you see a weather forecaster make a mistake, you can understand why.

__TOC__

==Definitions==
e•lec•tro•pho•re•sis (ĭ-lĕk'trō-fə-rē'sĭs) n. {{ref|AM1}}&lt;br/&gt;
1) The migration of charged colloidal particles or molecules through a solution under the influence of an applied electric field usually provided by immersed electrodes. Also called cataphoresis.&lt;br/&gt;
2) A method of separating substances, especially proteins, and analyzing molecular structure based on the rate of movement of each component in a colloidal suspension while under the influence of an electric field.  

&lt;br/&gt;
an•a•lyte (a-nə-līt) n. {{ref|MW1}}&lt;br/&gt;
A chemical substance that is the subject of chemical analysis.

[[Image:Electrophoresis_SH.png|thumb|Separation under electrophoresis]]

==Electrophoresis Theory==
Separation by electrophoresis depends on differences in the migration velocity of ions or solutes through a given medium in an electric field. The electrophoretic migration velocity of an analyte is:

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v_p = \mu_p E&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

where E is the electric field strength and &lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; is the electrophoretic mobility.

&lt;br/&gt;
The electrophoretic mobility is inversely proportional to frictional forces in the buffer, and directly proportional to the ionic charge of the analyte. The forces of friction against an analyte are dependent on the analyte's size and the viscosity (η) of the medium. Analytes with different frictional forces or different charges will separate from one another when they move through a buffer. At a given pH, the electrophoretic mobility of an analyte is:

&lt;math&gt;\mu_p = \frac{z}{6\pi \eta r}&lt;/math&gt; 
 
where r is the radius of the analyte and z is the net charge of the analyte. 

&lt;br/&gt;
Differences in the charge to size ratio of analytes causes differences in electrophoretic mobility. Small, highly charged analytes have greater mobility, whereas large, less charged analytes have lower mobility. Anionic surfactants are often used to denature proteins before electrophoresis.  This gives all proteins approximately the same charge.  Since their charges are all equal their mobility is now a function of only their masses.  Electrophoretic mobility is an indication of an analyte's migration velocity in a given medium. The net force acting on an analyte is the balance of two forces: the electrical force acting in favor of motion, and the frictional force acting against motion. These two forces remain steady during electrophoresis. Therefore, electrophoretic mobility is a constant for a given analyte under a given set of conditions.{{ref|BIO}}

==Applications of Electrophoresis==
Electrophoresis has a wide variety of applications in proteomics, forensics, molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology.

One of the most common uses of electrophoresis is to analyze differential expression of genes. Healthy and diseased cells can be identified by differences in the electrophoretic patterns of their proteins. Proteins themselves can also be characterized in this way, and some sense of their structure can be derived from the masses of fragments inside the gel. {{ref|Twyman}}

There are many different types of electrophoresis, and each can be used for something different. Two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis, for example, has the ability to discern many more proteins than most of its contemporaries. Many of these methods will be discussed in detail throughout this chapter.

==Structure of a D program==
Every program must have a starting point. In D, this is the function named ''main'' except for Windows GUI programs which uses ''WinMain''. You must have '''one''' of these functions to create a runnable application. 

Note: 
* Even though this function is the starting point for the program processing flow, it is possible to have other parts of your code execute before ''main'' is given control. These are module and class constructors, and will be discussed later.
* A collection of one or more modules that do not have a ''main'' function is known as a '''library''' and is not an executable program. Instead, the functions in libraries are used by applications as pre-written functionality.

==Simple D Programs==

Note: 
* The '''main''' function, in the D programming language, must return either '''void''' or '''int''' data type. This return value is returned to the operating system. 
* If '''void''' return type is specified, the application returns an '''int''' with the value '''0''', otherwise the program must supply a return value.
* The '''main''' function, in the D programming language, must specify either no arguments or a single argument in the form '''char[][]''', which is an array of UTF8 strings that contain the command line parameters.

In summary, the '''main''' function can take one of four formats ...
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; main() &lt;font color=green&gt;// Application defined return value,   ignores command line&lt;/font&gt;

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;int&lt;/font&gt; main(&lt;font color=blue&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[][] args)  &lt;font color=green&gt;// Application defined return value, uses command line&lt;/font&gt;

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; main() &lt;font color=green&gt;// returns 0, ignores command line&lt;/font&gt;

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; main(&lt;font color=blue&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[][] args) &lt;font color=green&gt;//returns 0, uses command line&lt;/font&gt;

===Example 1===

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;import&lt;/font&gt; std.stdio;
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; main() 
 { 
  writefln(&lt;font color=red&gt;&quot;Hello World!&quot;&lt;/font&gt;);
 }

This program merely prints &quot;Hello World!&quot; on the console, followed by a newline and then exits.  The first line imports the standard library module '''std.stdio'''.  This module defines the function '''writefln''', which is used to write to the standard output. This program does not use the command line arguments and will return zero to the operating system.

You need to compile this to convert it to an executable program. First you save the source code to a text file that has the &quot;.d&quot; extension. Assuming we called this file ''hw.d'', here is the way to compile it using the DigitalMars compiler ...
 dmd hw.d

===Example 2===

 &lt;font color=blue&gt;import&lt;/font&gt; std.stdio;
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; main(&lt;font color=blue&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[][] p_Args) 
 { 
  &lt;font color=blue&gt;foreach&lt;/font&gt;(&lt;font color=blue&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[] l_Arg; p_Args)
  {
    writefln(&lt;font color=red&gt;&quot;Argument '%s'&quot;&lt;/font&gt;, l_Arg);
  }
 }

This program prints out each of the command line parameters. The argument to ''main'' is 
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[][] p_Args
which names the argument as '''p_Args''' and declares its data type as '''char[][]''', which is a variable-length array of UTF8 strings. This is saying that ''main'' is passed a set of zero or more character strings.

The '''foreach''' statement is a way to process each of the elements in an array. In the format above, it names a temporary variable '''l_Arg''' that will receive each element in turn as the '''foreach''' moves through the array '''p_Args'''. The temporary variable is scoped to the ''foreach'' block and thus cannot be seen by code outside the ''foreach''. 

The ''writefln'' function not only writes out things to the console, it also allows you to format that output. The '''%s''' is a formating code that specifies where a subsequent argument will appear in the console output. In this case, if ''l_Arg'' contains &quot;abc&quot; then the output will be &quot;Argument 'abc'&quot;.

===Example 3===

This heavily annotated example highlights many of the enhancements over C++.

 &lt;font color=green&gt;#!/usr/bin/dmd -run&lt;/font&gt;
 &lt;font color=green&gt;/* sh style script syntax is supported! */&lt;/font&gt;
 &lt;font color=green&gt;/* Hello World in D
    To compile:
      dmd hello.d
    or to optimize:
      dmd -O -inline -release hello.d
    or to get generated documentation:
      dmd hello.d -D
   */&lt;/font&gt;
 &lt;font color=blue&gt;import&lt;/font&gt; std.stdio;  &lt;font color=green&gt;// References to  commonly used I/O routines.
 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;void&lt;/font&gt; &lt;u&gt;main&lt;/u&gt;(&lt;font color=blue&gt;char&lt;/font&gt;[][] args)   &lt;font color=green&gt;// 'void' here means return 0 by default.
 &lt;/font&gt;{
     &lt;font color=green&gt;// Write-Formatted-Line
 &lt;/font&gt;     writefln(&lt;font color=red&gt;&quot;Hello World, &quot;&lt;/font&gt;   &lt;font color=green&gt;// automatic concatenation of string literals
 &lt;/font&gt;              &lt;font color=red&gt;&quot;Reloaded&quot;&lt;/font&gt;);

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Digital Circuits Page}}

This page talks about Karnaugh maps, which are fundamental tools for analyzing and optimizing digital circuits.

==Karnaugh Maps==

A Karnaugh map (K-map for short) is a useful tool used in the simplification of combinational boolean equations and the creation of sequential logic circuits. Karnaugh maps were created by Maurice Karnaugh in 1953. The size of a Karnaugh map can be very large, however a size of four columns by four rows is easier to understand than any larger maps. 

The philosophy behind these drawings is that differences of only one bit for the logic of a boolean equation are adjacent to each other.  This is just an organizational method for a boolean logic truth table, but it can give you the ability to help simplify logical equations.  This has proven to be especially useful for digital circuit designers, as it can suggest components which can be eliminated or a way to simplify circuit designs.  This reduces both the cost and complexity of these designs, and even an automated method for developing these circuits assuming that you can come up with a logical truth table in the first place.

What is going to be demonstrated here is how to manually evaluate Karnaugh Maps.  For very complex circuit designs that involve dozens or even hundreds of variables, there is software available that automates this process.

==Structure and Creation ==

The structure of a Karnaugh map is grid shaped. The two most typical sizes used for instruction or for small projects is the three variable (a 2x4 grid or 4x2 depending on the user) and the four variable map (4x4 grid).

[[File:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.svg|right|frame|An example of a four variable Karnuagh Map]]


K-maps can only be created if a truth table is present; it works differently for sequential logic, which will be discussed later. A finished K-map can make a truth table, or a boolean equation vice versa. Once a truth table is acquired, a Karnaugh map can be created. The top left corner(or sometimes just the top and the left) of a K-map shows the variables used for that side.The picture of the K-map example shows the variables associated to that side. The top is A and B and the numbers below them is the state A and B are for that column (i.e. The column 10 is when A is true(high) and B is false(low)). From the truth table we put its output in the corresponding squares (i.e. If on the truth table when ABCD is 1011 and the output was 1, then on the four variable map, a 1 would go   in the fourth column, second row). The following example shows how to translate a truth table to a K-map and then turn the K-map into a boolean equation.

===Order of input values===

On a K-map, the order in which the input values combinations are placed is of utmost importance. By looking at the example image above, it can be noticed that it doesn't use the normal, or numeric, ordering of values (00, 01, 10, 11), but instead uses (00, 01, 11, 10). Although there are usually many orderings that can be used, not all possible orderings are usable for a K-map. A formal description for valid K-map orderings would be defined by the following rules:

# The input values combinations at two adjacent rows or columns must differ in exactly one bit.
# The map is cyclic: the first and last rows are considered to be adjacent, and the first and last columns are also adjacent.
# Each possible combination of bits must appear exactly once in the map.

For two-variable maps, fulfilling this rules is trivial: one of the variables is assigned to rows, the other one to columns, and a 2x2 map can be drawn where both possible sequences (0,1 and 1,0) are valid. It's valid even to use (0,1) for one variable and (1,0) for the other. On three or four variables, either the columns or rows (or both, for 4 variables) need to hold two variables. The sequence used in the examples above (00, 01, 11, 10) works well, and is the most used; an alternative to this could be (00, 10, 11, 01). If a K-map is ever needed for a 5 or even more inputs circuit, then longer sequences need to be made up that fulfill the rules above. For three variables (8 combinations), the (000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100) sequence is often used. This is enough for maps of up to 6 inputs, or 64 combinations; bigger circuits are very rarely mapped by hand, most often using specialized software to build the map and even to retrieve information from it; but, if the need arises, an appropriate combinations sequence can be made by [[w:Gray_code#Constructing_an_n-bit_gray_code|constructing an n-bit Gray Code]].

As could be noticed from later sections, optimization of circuits through K-maps relies completely in the above rules or properties of such maps, so using wrong combination sequences may lead to circuits that are not optimal, or even to circuits that do not produce the expected output.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction to Building with Straw Bales=

==History==

While use of grass-family plant fibers has long been a part of building methods worldwide, dating far back into prehistory, actual straw-''bale'' construction was pioneered in [[w:Nebraska|Nebraska]] in the [[w:United States|United States]], in the late 19th/early 20th century, in response the then-new availability of baling machines and the lack of significant amounts of timber or buildable [[w:sod|sod]] needed to build barns and housing in the [[w:Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sandhills]] region. Under the [[w:Homestead Act|Homestead Act]] of 1862 and the [[w:Kinkaid Act|Kinkaid Act]] of 1904, the &quot;sod-busters&quot; were required to develop and live on their new property for five years in order to maintain ownership; building housing was a legal requirement. The straw-bale house was first seen simply as a make-shift structure, to provide temporary lodging, until enough funds were available to pay for the shipping in of timbers, to build a &quot;real&quot; house. However, these homes quickly proved to be comfortable, durable, and affordable, and so became regarded as permanent housing. Over the past century they have indeed outlived many neighbouring timber-frame buildings, and a number are in continuing use today and beginning their second century.

After World War II a scattering of U.S. veterans turned to straw-bale for shelter, but modern straw-bale construction experienced a re-emergence in the late [[w:1970|1970]]s, after the [[w:1973 energy crisis|1973 energy crisis]] helped bring issues of real [[w:sustainability|sustainability]] to the forefront, with first examples built primarily in the southwestern United States.  Now, they are being built the world around, from northern Canada, Mongolia and post-Chernobyl Russia, to Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. Because it is based on an inexpensive and renewable so-called &quot;agricultural waste product,&quot; with a technique relatively simple for beginners to implement, involving few synthetic chemicals and providing effective energy-conserving insulation, it continues to grow in popularity, especially with [[w:do-it-yourself|do-it-yourself-ers]] &quot;owner-designer-builders&quot; and other proponents of sustainability.

==Current Perspective and Regulations==

(''Please help to expand this section!'')

Building with straw bales is slowly but surely gaining ever wider acceptance across America, Europe and Australasia. With some charitable groups using it in poorer countries it is also beginning to appear in South America and Eastern Europe.

Government bodies are in general less hostile than you might at first expect. In many instances government bodies actively welcome sustainable building projects and straw bale building is readily recognized as a sustainable building method. Generally there is some reluctance to accept non standard 'alternative building methods by building officials. Besides adopted straw bale building codes there are now extensive resources available based on officially executed laboratory tests, studies and reports making it much easier to win them over (see the later section entitled ''[[Straw Bale Construction/Resources/Technical Studies|Technical Studies, Reports and Tests]]'' for a compilation of links to such literature).

Since the initial research done in the United States to support the adopted straw bale buildings in several counties, tests have been executed in such places as Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, Hungary and New Zealand, resulting in the adoption of either local codes or the establishment of a frame work of best practices. 

===Australia===
Around 1996 the Standards New Zealand/Standards Australia Joint Technical Committee for Earth Building (BD-083), chaired by New Zealand architect Graeme North, decided against publishing any specific regulatory standards.

Following the conclusion of the committee, in 2001 [http://www.standards.org.au/ Standards Australia] published an ''[http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/Details.aspx?productid=568794 Earth Building Handbook]'' authored by Dr Peter Walker (University of Bath, UK) with the assistance of Stephen Dobson, David Baetge, Kevan Heathcote, Chris Howe and David Oliver.&lt;ref&gt;The handbook is available online for over AUD $100, a sample is also [http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/downloadFile.aspx?path=Previews%%205cas%%205cmisc%%205chandbook%%205cHB195.pdf available here].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Several researchers and government bodies in Canada, including the [[w:Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation|Canadian Mortgage and Housing Company]], have been testing the abilities of straw-bale construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/search/search_001.cfm?sec=en&amp;os=&amp;text=straw Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation - Documents matching 'straw']&lt;/ref&gt; They hope to develop building code to be included in the next revision of the Canadian Building Code.

Building permits can be issued for alternate building methods approved by an engineer.{{fact}}

===New Zealand===
Early European settlers used clay to make wattle and daub, sod or cob houses. Chimneys were made from tree fern trunks heavily plastered with clay. Māori began to use sod to build ''whare paruparu'' (dirt houses) ''takitaki'' (walls).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/rock-limestone-and-clay/6 Rock, limestone and clay - Clay]'', ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''. Carl Walrond, 2009-03-02.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest known standing earth building in New Zealand was built in 1842, the two storey ''Pompallier House'' in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell,_New_Zealand Russell], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Islands Bay of Islands].

Today the popularity of straw bale construction is increasing, with a growing number of specialist businesses dedicated to the area.  Straw bale constructions are required to meet the standard New Zealand building regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.slideshare.net/matt07/alternative-building-8757750 Unit Standard 13033 - Alternative Building]'', Matt Thompson. 2011-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1996 Graeme North, Chair of the Standards New Zealand/Standards Australia Joint Technical Committee for Earth Building (BD-083), rejected an approach to enlarge the committee's work to write strawbale standards for Australasia despite the wide range of building methods that utilised both earth and straw. The rejection was based on several reasons:
*Earth buildings rely on the binding properties of clay. Once this is absent, then you have another material and set of “rules”;
*Strawbale was relatively recent in New Zealand and Australia and did not have a large number of local examples or performance history to draw upon;
*There was no adequate funding available to enable them to do the work.
*Some members of the committee had no experience or interest in strawbale.

Despite this outcome, a few years later the 'New Zealand Earth Building Standards' were published in late 1998/1999.  Standards development was managed by Standards New Zealand and supported by the members of a voluntary Technical Committee.  The publications are available from [http://www.standards.co.nz/ Standards New Zealand]:
*''NZS 4297:1998 Engineering Design of Earth Buildings (Specific Design)''
*''NZS 4298:1998 Incl Amendment#1 2000 Materials &amp; Workmanship for Earth Buildings''
*''NZS 4299:1998 Incl Amendment#1 1999 Earth Buildings Not Requiring specific Designs''

In mid-2012, access to these three standards documents cost over NZD $300 to purchase,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standards.co.nz/web-shop/?action=viewProductPack&amp;mod=catalog&amp;pid=4028828607e45bd10107f8186e1c0002 NZS 4297, NZS 4298 &amp; NZS 4299 - Earth Building Set]&lt;/ref&gt; however they are usually easy to locate in a local library via services such as [http://www.worldcat.org/ WorldCat] and are not particularly long documents.  The Earth Building Association of New Zealand suggests that the final document (''NZS 4299:1998 Incl Amendment#1 1999 Earth Buildings Not Requiring specific Designs'') may be useful for earth builders seeking a way to legally avoid dealing with certain planning expenses.

Also in 1998 the Building Research Association of New Zealand published an article entitled ''Guidelines For Strawbale Building In New Zealand'' by G. North, R. Walker, B. Gilkison, N. Crocker, A. Alcorn, T. Drupsteen in its ''BUILD'' magazine.  This was apparently later republished as a 'bulletin' on straw bale building best practices&lt;ref&gt;''[http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/Details.aspx?ProductID=589139 BRANZ Bulletin #398: Strawbale Construction]'', Building Research Association of New Zealand, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;, most recently updated in December 2010&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.branz.co.nz/cms_display.php?sn=123&amp;st=1 BRANZ Bulletin #530: Strawbale Construction]'', Building Research Association of New Zealand, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of the authors of that paper, architect Graeme North, presented a paper entitled ''[http://www.ecodesign.co.nz/strawbalePF.shtml Strawbale Building Guidelines for Wet and Humid Climates (Such as New Zealand's)]'' at an international conference in 2002.

For further information on local regulations and conditions, consider visiting the ''[http://www.earthbuilding.org.nz Earth Building Association of New Zealand]''.

===Ireland===
The Building Regulations in Ireland require you to obtain a fire certificate and with strawbale construction, this is not an easy process because there are so few straw bale buildings in Ireland (with the majority being domestic houses which do not require fire certificates). Fire Officers have no reference point and as yet are reluctant to accept that this type of construction is occuring across the world and can meet the standards set out in the Building Regulations.

== Straw sources, bale dimensions and compression==
Straw-bales can be made from a range of plant fibers, not only grass-family species like wheat, rye, barley, blue-grass and rice, but also flax, hemp, etc.  (Bales of recycled materials like paper, pasteboard, waxed cardboard, crushed plastics, whole tires and used carpeting have also all been used or are currently being explored for building.)

Basic straw-bales are produced on farms and referred to as &quot;field-bales&quot;.  These come in a range of sizes, from small &quot;two-string&quot; ones 18 in (460 mm) wide, by either 14 or 16 in (350 to 400 mm) high, and 32 to 48 in (0.8 to 1.2 m) long, to three-string &quot;commercial bales&quot; 21 in wide, by 16 in high, by 3 to 4 ft long.  These sizes range from 40 to as much as 100 pounds (18 to 45 kg).

Even larger &quot;bulk&quot; bales are now becoming common, 3 by 3 ft (1 by 1 m), or 3 x 4 ft (1 m by 1.2 m) by 6 ft (2 m) long and even 4 x 4 x 8 ft (1.2 by 1.2 by 2.4 m) long, weighing up to a ton, plus rolled round bales 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) in diameter.  All of these &quot;economy-size&quot; units also offer unique potential for imaginative designers.

A newer trend is the use of high-density recompressed bales, sometimes called [[w:strawblocks|strawblocks]], offering far higher compression strength.  These bales, &quot;remade&quot; from field bales, in massive stationary presses producing up to 1 million pounds of force (4 MN), were originally developed for cargo-container transport to over-seas markets.  

But innovators soon discovered that where a wall of &quot;conventional field bales&quot; is able to support a roof load of 600 pounds per foot (900 kg/m), the high-density bales can support up to 3,000 to 4,500 pounds per foot (4,500 to 7,000 kg/m).  This makes them particularly suited to [[w:load-bearing|load-bearing]] multi-storey or &quot;living-roofed&quot; designs, and they may be faced with siding, gyp-board or paneling and have cabinetry hung directly from them with long sheet-rock screws.

They are available in a range of sizes from different companies' presses but 2' long by 2' high by 18&quot; wide might be considered &quot;typical&quot;; because they are bound with horizontally ties or straps, at 3&quot; or 4&quot; intervals vertically, they  may be recut with a chain-saw at a range of heights.  They are usually used in &quot;stacked bond&quot;, with the straws running vertically for greatest strength and tied with &quot;re-mesh&quot; on both sides before stucco application.

== Choosing your bales ==
* straw source
* twine tightness
* compression
* humidity

== Keeping your bales dry before building ==
Keeping your bales dry is extremely important. This can be a challenge, especially when building load bearing. A dry barn on site is a big advantage. Or try to negotiate to leave a trailer with bales on site for a month. 

If neither of those is an option, some hints:
* Have your bales delivered only when ready to build
* Put a double layer of pallets under your bale pile.
* Make multiple local piles of bales. Put those near the places where you will need bales. This will speed up construction, and thus limit the times bales are exposed.
* Stack the bales in pyramid shape. Cover them in tarps. The pyramid shape will help rain water drain off the pile.
* You don't expect windy rain? Then leave the bottom part of the tarp exposed. Wind will help moisture (condensation, ...) that did get to the bales dry up.

The thick walls (typically 21 to 26 inches (530 mm) when stuccoed/plastered), result in deeper window and door &quot;reveals&quot;, similar to stone and adobe buildings. Since the bales are irregular and may be shaped easily, they are readily adaptable to curved designs, and when plastered, tend toward a relaxed, imperfect texture and shape.  If flat, straight walls are desired, this can be achieved, as well, by the application of more plaster.

==UK==
Straw in steady state conditions is an unexceptional insulator in the context of insulating materials that are typically considered when designing a building envelope.

''Note: of the materials given in the table above straw is the only one that can also be used as the principle structural element. ''

''Note: U = 0.2 W/m2K is a steady state target proposed in case studies for the 2013 Part L draft, the new regulations do allow dynamic methods of analysis where natural fibre insulation materials perform significantly better.''  

However, the first point to note is that in common with all natural fibre insulation, straw performs better under dynamic conditions. So if a typical day/night cycle is considered better in-situ performance will be recorded than would be predicted from a typical U value calculation. 

The next point to consider is that straw is used in bale form and typically laid flat to maximise stability during construction. So more straw is put into the building to fascilitate the construction sequence than would be needed to provide adequate thermal performance.

Finally straw is low density and the higher density renders are thin. So thermal mass and thermal lag time are less than for a traditional masonry construction. However natural fibres interact with moisture in the air which causes a 'virtual' thermal mass effect as water vapour changes phase, this has been more thoroughly investigated in hemp-lime than straw, but is still not fully understood.

==US==

A carefully constructed straw-bale building has excellent thermal performance because of its combination of the bales' high insulative value and the thermal mass provided by the interior's thick plaster coating. (Read the section on thermal mass for more on the advantages of a high mass construction.)

: A good starting point is a discussion of what R-value is, and what it is not. It is not an absolute measure of how energy efficient your building is. It is not even a perfect way of predicting the wall’s contribution to thermal comfort. It is one piece of information about the wall that, with other information, can enable you to estimate the heat loss and heat gain through the walls. R-value is the inverse of U-factor (R = 1 / U). U-factor is a measure of thermal conductance, or how easily a material (or system) allows heat to pass through it. This is how U-factor is defined (in the U.S.): the number of British thermal units that pass through one square foot of a material (or system) per hour with a one degree Fahrenheit temperature difference between the two sides of the material. Mathematically:

&lt;math&gt;U=\left( \frac{Btu}{h \times a \times F} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

''Btu = British thermal units, a = area in square feet, F = temperature fahrenheit''

: In most other countries U-factor is defined in terms of Watts per square meter per Kelvin [W/(m2*K)]. To convert metric (SI) U-factors to inch-pound (IP) U-factors  multiply by 0.1761; to convert the other way, simply divide by 0.1761. To convert IP R-values to metric R-values, multiply by 5.6783.

: When a laboratory tests a material (or system) to determine its thermal conductance or resistance, they determine the heat flow from one side to the other on the basis of measured surface temperatures and heat energy required on the warm side of the wall to maintain a steady heat flow. This provides the U-factor, which is then converted to R-value for some purposes. (Nehemiah Stone, 2003)
(the following comments are imperial R value)  
The theoretical [[R-value]] ([[thermal resistance]]) for a 16.5 inch (420 mm) straw bale was calculated by Joseph McCabe as 52 ([[R-value|RSI]]-9.2). This is compared with a theoretical R-value for 3.5 inch (90 mm) of fibreglass (the conventional insulation material used in home construction) of 13 (RSI-2.3). This means fibreglass has an R-value of about 3.7 per inch (RSI-0.26 per centimeter) and straw bales have about 3.2 per inch (RSI-0.22 per centimeter). 

Some lab tests of straw-bale assemblies have found significantly lower R-values in practice. However, the more conservative of these results still suggests an R-value of 28 for an 18&quot; wall [http://www.cmhc.ca/publications/en/rh-pr/tech/tech02-115-e.html], which is a significant improvement over the R-14 of an energy-efficient insulated 2x6 wall[http://www.cmhc.ca/publications/en/rh-pr/tech/tech02-115-e.html]. Straw-bale experts suggest that it is possible to approach theoretical R-values by giving more attention to detailing, but this has never been documented.

:Tests have shown a range of values from R-17 (for an 18” bale wall) to R-55 (for a 23” bale). Analysis at Oak Ridge National Lab, among other places, has shown that R-values for insulation materials used in “standard” walls are generally much higher than the R-value for the wall as an assembly of disparate materials. Joe McCabe recently postulated that the same phenomenon could account for the difference between the high values from his testing of bales and the lower values obtained in the 1998 Oak Ridge test of a straw bale wall system. While it is possible that the relatively low densities where bales abut each other might contribute to greater heat loss than would be measured through an individual bale, it is unlikely that this would account for the entire difference. This difference between bales and bale walls is similar to the difference between standard insulation and what is found in stud framed walls (insulation voids, thermal bridges, uninsulated headers, and other faults).

:It is noteworthy that all tests of straw bale wall systems prior to the Oak Ridge test in 1998 had potentially significant shortcomings and should not be considered particularly reliable. The last Oak Ridge test had no identified deficiencies and is considered by most to be an accurate determination of the thermal resistance of straw bale walls. ORNL determined the R-value to be R-27.5 (or R-1.45/inch), or R-33 for three string (23”) bale wall systems. Shaving a bit off the top just for conservatism's sake, the California Energy Commision officially regards a plastered straw bale wall to have an R-value of 30.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Thermal mass==
{{main|Thermal mass}}
The interior plaster on a straw bale wall works as an excellent thermal mass on a [[diurnal]] cycle. 

Thermal mass reduces temperature swings due to daytime warming and night time cooling, by absorbing and then gradually releasing heat. This can result in a direct reduction in the need for fuel or electricity to regulate temperature, and indirectly in savings through lifestyle adjustments: occupants of a moderate environment, with only gradual temperature swings, are less likely to use artificial heating and cooling. This is most easily achieved at high desert altitudes where a clear sky contributes to both warm days (solar gain) and cool nights (nighttime cooling), but the principle still works in other climates as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Thermal mass==
(Please help expand this section, specifically adding comparative)

Straw bale like all other organic insulation materials are better able to buffer heat then inorganic insulation. Basically this improves thermal comfort within a building, exterior temperature swings are delayed and damped. Having thermal mass is the difference between the interior comfort experienced within a catherderal or in a corrugated shed, either in the summer or winter. The fact that a straw bale wall should be plastered on innner and outer surfaces greatly enhances the heat buffering effect by substantially adding to the thermal mass of the building.

The combination of insulation with sufficient thermal mass creates the high level of comfort experienced in most straw bale buildings. Adding extra thermal mass by even thicker plaster layers on inner surfaces encounters the effects of diminishing returns. Doubling the thickness over 35mm (which seams to be the optimum) increases comfort by an insignificant amount. Depending on the location overheating can take place if there is too much equator facing glass. This can be combatted by adding extra thermal mass. Shading though is far more effective but correctly dimensioning the amount of glasing is even better as it saves the heat loss through the glasing at night or overcast days.

(Passive Solar should be moved to a more appropriate section)

Passive solar refers to buildings designed to maximise the heating and cooling effects of the environment around them. They are called passive because there are none (or few) parts of the design that require energy to operate. The most common technique for passively taking advantage of the environment is maximising solar gain by exposing interior surfaces to the suns warmth and then designing the building to best contain that warmth. At the other end of the scale, where climates are hot and passive cooling is what's needed, one technique is using rising warm air to draw basement cooled air up through a building.

Any building taking advantage of passive solar gain must have well insulated interior surfaces which are exposed to sunlight and have enough mass to store daytime heat and release it at night. How suited a straw bale house is to taking advantage of solar gain depends on the mass (think of thickness) of the inside plaster coating, though some maintain that straw bale constructions are inherently unsuitable for passive solar gain [http://www.thenaturalhome.com/passivesolar.html] (although the article seems to neglect the surface plaster). It should be stressed that straw bale homes are not inherently good for passive solar gain, they need to be designed to make use of it, it doesn't just happen.  The same is true of any building material or system.

Following are the basic features that distinguish straw bale buildings designed to maximise passive (think of free and sustainable) heating and cooling:

*Limited exterior wall surface with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation high insulation].
*Equator-facing, East and West Roof overhangs correctly sized to block the summer sun (angle) and still allow the lower winter sun angle to  provide heating of interior [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_mass thermal mass].
*Passive preheating/precooling of external air by drawing through cellers, porches, glass houses and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exchanger heat exchangers].

'''Features specific to cold climates'''
*Large ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulated_glazing super insulated] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-emissivity low-e]) glass surfaces with high orientation for maximum sun exposure of the buildings interior. In strawbale buildings the inside plastered surface of the bales is a great surface for collecting sunlights heat and radiating it slowly back to the inside space. See also [[w:Solar_gain:solar gain]].
*Superinsulated doors, windows and frames. Glazing with low-emissivity glass coatings facing outwards  
*Position doors for minimum wind exposure, preferably with an enclosed porch.
*External postbox, not an in-door hole.
*Building envelope air-tightness (see below).
*For extra winter heating the focus is on renewable fuels (plant oils/ charcoal and wood) or sun heated systems ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_collector solar collectors] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump heat pumps]).

'''Features specific to hot climates'''
*Glass openings (and leisure areas) need to be protected from radiated heat from surrounding object like sun baked sand or earth, outside planting can greatly reduce radiated ground heat.
*Shading and orientation to avoid sun exposure, especially to the buildings interior.
*Position windows where they can make the most efficient use of prevailing wind for cooling and ventilation.

One common source of confusion when talking about 'passive' construction is the term 'breath' which is more accurately known as “vapor permeability”. People talk about straw bale walls breathing, but this has nothing to do with '''air''' moving through the wall, it's about '''moisture''' moving through the wall. Really it is better to refer to it as moisture permiability. In this way walls that can transport odour filled moisture to the outside contribute to a high air quality, without air moving through the wall.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Availability, types and cost==

=== Availability ===
Straw is an agricultural waste product, a by-product of grain harvesting. Many different kinds of straw are baled and can be used for construction. Straw is widely available, and is generally an abundant, renewable resource. Relatively little energy is consumed in harvesting, baling and transporting bales to a building site. In bulk, straw bales are generally sold for close to the cost of baling and transport. Farmers will sometimes sell bales for under cost in order to clear storage sheds prior to a harvest.

In most regions, straw is baled only once each year, and so must kept dry and stored for use at other times of the year. Straw production and demand is relatively constant, however high demand for bales used for erosion control following forest fires can create a temporary shortage of bales.

=== Types ===
Bales are rectangular compressed blocks of straw, bound by strings or wires. Straw bales come in all shapes and sizes. Rectangular bales are the only bales suitable for building. The round bales that are now becoming popular require re-bailing before use but this is not recommended. Three string bales (585x405x1070 mm) common in western USA have an average weight of 29 kg. The two string bales (460x350-450x960 mm) which are common in the rest of USA and most of the world are easier to handle and have a weight ranging from 15 to 19 kg.

Besides these traditionally sized bales, big jumbo bales are also becoming popular. There are basically two sizes in use. The real jumbo is 1200x760x2400 mm and the mini-jumbo is 800mm wide and available in various lengths and heights depending on the bailing machine used. The jumbo bales are appropriate for bigger industrial buildings where they show definite advantages due to their high load carrying capacity of up to 3 t/bale for the 1200mm wide variety. Only machine handling is possible due to their weight. Greater stability and the bigger size of Jumbo bales compared to the conventional bales favors rapid and easy construction.

=== Cost ===
Small bales range in price from 1.50 USD per bale to 6USD per bale.  Prices go up rapidly when you take into account transportation.  Jumbo bales, including transportation, range in cost from 15USD to 30USD per bale.  This depends upon when you purchase the bales, how far they need to be transported, and type of bale - whether it's wheat straw, flax straw, or rice straw.  Different &quot;waste&quot; products have different values for farmers and some are less usable than others for agricultural purposes.

The best way to get an idea of prices in your area is to look in the [[../../Resources/Worldwide_Contacts|Worldwide organisations and contacts]] section of this book. Of course if you find some useful information, come back and add it to this page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Resistance to pests==

Straw bales are thick and dense enough to keep out many kinds of pests. As well, the outer layer of plaster makes them unattractive or impenetrable to animals and insects. Finally, because straw contains little nutrient value to most animals and insects, it does not attract pests.

Termites like moist damp conditions.  While a wall is kept dry, there is little danger termites would have any interest.  When termites do manage to enter a wall, they tend to bypass the straw and attack any wooden studs.

In North America, termites attacked straw bale houses only very rarely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Resistance to fire==

Although loose straw is quite flammable, once packed into a bale it is too dense to allow enough air for [[combustion]]. By analogy, it is easy to light a single piece of paper on fire, but difficult and time consuming to burn an entire phone book. In construction it is critical to have, at a minimum, a parge coat of plaster on all surfaces of the wall. Parge coating the wall involves troweling on a thin coating of mortar and brushing it smooth.

Typical failure of straw-bale homes involves frame walls set against straw-bale walls without a parge coat. A spark from an electrical short or an error by a plumber ignites the hair-like fuzz on the exposed bale. The flame spreads upward and sets the wood framing on fire causing the wood framing to burn. The typical fire results in little fire damage to bales, but extensive water damage due to the fire suppression activities.

The ASTM E-119 fire resistance test for plastered straw-bale wall assemblies in 1993 passed for a 2 hour fire-wall assembly. In this test a gas flame blows on one side of the wall at approximately 2000 degree Fahrenheit (1100 degrees Celsius) while the temperature of the other side of the wall is continuously measured. The results of this test had no burn-through and a maximum temperature rise of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (33.3 degrees Celsius).

      <comment>/* UK Structural Design of Loadbearing Straw Bale Buildings */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
==Limits to structural strength==

Load-bearing straw-bale walls are typically used only in single-storey or occasionally double-storey structures. A dug foundation (basement) is uncommon.  

An [[Straw Bale Construction/All-straw vaulted building|all-straw vaulted building]] was designed and built in Joshua Tree, California, and greatly exceeded the structural requirements for this highly active seismic zone. 

Post and beam straw-bale structures have been used for buildings as large as 14,000 square feet (1,300 m&amp;sup2;) and even for a United States Post Office, in Corrales, NM [http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/NEWSLTR/v5n3/sa-10.htm].

==UK Structural Design of Loadbearing Straw Bale Buildings==

In the UK there are currently two main ways of building with straw: onsite or prefabricated. In both cases the straw is covered by an earth or lime render, note NEVER a cement render!

In the UK the recommended minimum density for a straw bale is 110kg/m^3 this is to ensure a good bond between the straw and render by improving the dimensional stability of the straw.

The below is based on the ''Natural Building Materials'' lecture series given at the University of Bath (BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials) 

===Traditional Construction===

'''Vertical Load Capacity'''

Current practise is to ignore the strength of the straw and only consider the strength of the render. Recent testing at the University of Bath has shown that the render more than any other variable affects strength and stiffness.

Consider a typical wall section for a one-storey building that uses standard two string bales laid flat (450mm) and 35mm render internally and externally. A timber base and header plate are positioned to ensure uniform load distribution.

&lt;gallery&gt;
[[File:Straw Bale Construction Section.png|thumb|Typical wall Section detail one storey building]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Assume that there is sufficient composite behaviour that the render will be restrained from buckling by the straw, the wall is plumb and the load is concentric.

Area of render = 2 × 35 × 1000 = 70×10^3 mm^2 per m run of wall 

So even a low strength mortar σc = 0.5 N/mm^2

Gives a theoretical allowable force, F = A × σc = 35kN per m run of wall

However it is unlikely that a wall will ever be built plumb so a '''practical limit of 10kN/m run is applied'''. Addional checks should be done if the wall is to be eccentrically loaded as this will result in unequal load share between the internal and external renders.

'''Lateral Load Capacity'''

Once again the strength of the straw is ignored and composite behaviour is assumed. Failure is taken to be when the render cracks and leaves the straw vulnerable.

Calculate the second moment of area, I = 2[b(t^3)/12 + bt(d^2)] (from parallel axis theorem)

Calculate the section modulus, z = I/y  (y is distance from centroid to extreme edge)

Moment resistance of the wall is given by, M = z × σb (σb of render, ignore straw)

Rearrange M = w(l^2)/8 for w to find failure load.

'''Racking Resistance'''

Straw constructions that are one or two storeys high generally do not have racking issues providing the walls are continuous and window openings are restricted to 50% of the wall area.

===Prefabricated===

The main supplier of prefabricated straw bale units in the UK is [http://www.modcell.com/ Modcell]. The panels are made near to site in a flying factory, allowing the use of local straw which minimises embodied carbon due to transportation. The frame is machine cut glulam with steel corner bracing to improve racking resistance. These can be load bearing up to three storeys or used non-structurally as cladding panels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Design and construction challenges==

Straw-bale construction is still considered experimental in many jurisdictions. Building codes may not include it, local authorities may not recognise it, and most contractors will probably not be experienced in its use. 

Straw-bale buildings must be carefully designed to eliminate the possibility of moisture entering the walls, especially from above. Successful designs often incorporate roof overhangs that are wider than normal and roof shapes and detailing that minimise the risk of water splashing against walls.

Because straw-bale walls are much thicker than normal walls, there is sometimes a compromise between the size of the building's footprint and the amount of living space.

Structurally, the Voynich Manuscript is divided into '''quires''' - each quire comprises a set of about four '''bifolios''' folded down the middle, stitched along the '''gutter'''.

Here, then, is a schematic diagram of '''Quire 1''', with clickable links to each of its 16 pages:-

''Pepes'' is cooking method of steaming the ingredients (fish, chicken, tofu, or mushroom) wrapped in banana leaves until it becomes tender, then grilling the packets. In this recipe any fresh water fish or salt water fish can be used as substitute. In restaurants serving West Java cuisine, where ''Ikan Pepes'' is always on the menu, the use of carp fish is very common.

==Ingredients==
* 1 kg whole fish (carp or snapper)  
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tomato|chopped tomato]] 
* 1 stalk [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]] 
* 1 stalk [[Cookbook:Lemongrass|lemongrass]] 
* 5 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|salam leaves]] 
* 50 g [[Cookbook:Basil|kemangi leaves]] (sweet basil) 
* salt
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 2 tbl. salad oil 
* banana leaves or aluminum foil to wrap

Spice paste, grind the following ingredients:
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] 
* 4 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
* 2 cm [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] 
* 2 cm [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] 
* 50 g [[Cookbook:Chili_Pepper|fresh chili pepper]] 
* 5 [[Cookbook:Candlenut|candlenut]] 
* 5 g [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind]] 
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 25 cc water

==Procedure==
#Scale and clean the fish. 
#Take out the intestines but not the egg. 
#Make three diagonal slashes on each side of the fish for spice paste flavor to immerse. 
#Marinade the fish with salt and tamarind for 15 minutes then wash the fish with a bowl of water to remove excess salt.
#Add cooking oil to the spice-paste, mix. 
#Coat fish with spice paste. 
#Put kemangi leaves, salam leaves and sliced lemon grass for the flavor. 
#Wrap the fish in banana leaves or aluminum foil.
#Steam with medium fire, 30 minutes. Use pressure cooker for faster cooking time and better taste. 
#Let it cool and grill the wrapped fish over charcoal fire.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* The use of Kemangi leaves is optional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Object/Edit button set==
The first button we will go over is the arrow button all the way 
at the top of the toolbar:
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:UI Overview Object Edit Arrow 1.gif|Object/Edit Select]]
&lt;br&gt;
This button puts you in Object/Edit mode.  There is also an arrow button 
below this one.  Don't confuse the two.  The top one puts you in the Object/Edit mode 
while the other one is the '''Select''' button.
&lt;p&gt;
The button immediately to the right of the Object/Edit mode arrow button is the 
'''Object/Viewpoint''' mode button:
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ABA_UI_OE_Viewpoint.gif|Object/Viewpoint]]
&lt;br&gt;
This button puts you in a mode where you can change the way the camera views
 your 3D objects.  When you are in this mode you can zoom in the view, move around 
the camera, and also rotate the camera.
&lt;p&gt;
The button below the Object/Edit button is the Object/Axis mode.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ABA_UI_OE_Object_Axis.gif|Object/Axis]]
&lt;br&gt;
''Object/Axis mode will allow you to move the XYZ arrow so an object will rotate about itself. First select the problem object in top menu under OBJECT, select its name (if you haven't named it, will likely be something like object01, object02 etc.). Now the object will be isolated. You must be in WIREFRAME view mode to see the red and blue arrows. Click the object/axis button, then immediately click the move tool below it and you will now be able to drag the blue and red arrows to the center of your object. Don't move your object when moving the red and blue arrows for your pivot point, you will see in the very center of the grid (turn on grid ) very large red and blue arrows. Your object will located on the grid where it is supposed to be in relation to other objects (in the world) so it wont be centered on master grid. OKAY, back to moving your arrows: With the MOVE TOOL selected - Move the XYZ arrow into the center of your object then choose LEFT VIEW so you can see it from the side and move the XYZ arrow center once again to the center. Use the ARCH ROTATION viewing gizmo as well to immediately rotate your view in all directions to be sure XYZ arrow is dead center of object. To get back to a dead on straight view, exit the arch gizmo and choose from the TOP MENU bar &quot;VIEW&quot; and then choose &quot;FRONT&quot;. Save often your work often. ((CAREFUL! Each time you change the VIEW to center your XYZ arrow, you must AGAIN select the object axis button and then move tool, or you might move your object if you don't pay attention.))

If you were having trouble with an object darting off screen each time you attempted to scale, this will likely solve that problem as now the pivot point (arrows) is within the object. It is desirable in most of your pieces, to have an object pivot in place - especially when building up items - as this will allow you to rotate and scale an object so it fits onto another without the object arching off into the distance. In other cases, you might wish to have the pivot/axis point in another spot on the object. If you had a foot, you might want to move to pivot closer to the ankle, so the foot would rotate around the ankle area, as in real anatomy (Im NOT talking about bone/figure mode). Or if you have a door, the pivot could be moved to the edge where hinges are normally, and the rotation would be real world physics correct. Pivot/axis points are a concern when you are turning objects around to see them and move/attach them.
&lt;p&gt;
Later in your 3D project the pivot/axis point will be important to you if you animate that object across a timeline in a movie. Again, a leg should rotate at the hip socket, hands of a clock would need to rotate from the end where they attach to the center, etc. Those old action figure GI JOE dolls with the ball joints, where you can bend the legs, arms, neck... that's a good way to think of pivot points. There are even quite a few action doll animations on Youtube where people animate the figures to look alive. Same concept in your 3D world.
&lt;p&gt;
Lastly, keep in mind that, for example, a toe might have its own axis/pivot -- but once you JOIN SOLIDS and attach the toe to the foot -- you are now dealing with the pivot/axis of the foot. The toe has been absorbed by the foot as far as pivot/axis is concerned.''
&lt;p&gt;
The button immediately to the right of the Object/Axis button is the 
'''Object/Point Edit''' mode button:
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ABA_UI_OE_Point_Edit.gif|Object/Point Edit]]
&lt;br&gt;
This button puts you in a mode that allows you to edit the properties 
of the 3D object's '''vertices''', '''faces''', and '''edges'''.
&lt;p&gt;
Below those main 4 buttons you will see three buttons with 
the letters &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;:
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ABA_UI_OE_Axis1.gif|Axis Control]]
&lt;br&gt;
These buttons restrict movement in 3D space to certain 
axis.
&lt;p&gt;
Right below those buttons are the Screen Coordinates option buttons:
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ABA_UI_OE_Coordinates.gif|Coordinates Settings]]
&lt;br&gt;
With these buttons, you change which type of coordinate system you 
want the program to go by.  Options are ''world'', ''object'' and ''screen''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Acoustics of straw bale structures =

A report carried out in Denmark (Halmhuse - Udformning og materialeegenskaber [[Straw_Bale_Construction/Resources/Technical_Studies]]) measured the sound insulation performance of a wall in an existing home. The measurements were carried out in a wall with both horizontal strawbales (where the straws were perpendicular to the plane of the wall) and on a wall with vertical strawbales (where the straws were parallel with the plane of the wall). In both instances there were approximately 40 mm of clay rendering on each side of the wall. In the first instance the sound insulation (expressed with the sound reduction R’w) was found to be R’w=52 dB and in the second instance to be R’w=46 dB. The second result is affected considerably by bed-lofts in both rooms that were carried by a wooden framework in the wall. DELTA [http://www.delta.dk/] estimates that an construction focusing on reducing the transmission due to openness in the construction (flank transmission), would be able to obtain values of 53-54 dB, regardless of the direction of the straws. For comparison it can be mentioned that the requirement of the Danish Building Regulations in 2004 for a wall that separates apartments in housing blocks is 52 dB, while the requirement for walls between non-detached houses built in accordance with the Danish Building Regulations for Small Houses is 55 dB. It should be mentioned that walls that only just satisfy these code requirements are not always perceived as satisfactory by the residents.
For most other applications the strawbale-walls will have satisfactory sound insulation performance. Within a dwelling the sound reduction is particularly satisfactory and the actual sound insulation will most likely be determined by the doors.

A less formal study was made of a recording studio in Sydney by John Glassford of [http://www.glassford.com.au/ Huff 'n' Constructions]. This has yet to be added.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a beginner's guide to understanding the game of go. Its goal is to develop, explain and demonstrate the basic and foundational concepts of go. The intended audience is beginners through to the level of intermediate amateur, and will be structured using the stages of the game as a framework. The first few sections will include all the foundational concepts of the game, with examples and context to explain why they are important. The final section is split into subsections covering the opening game, middle game, and endgame, in both theory and practice. Within each section strategy will be covered first, then tactics. Strategy concerns the big picture and focuses on larger portions of the board or even the entire board. Tactics, on the other hand, focuses on the small and intricate details specific to smaller portions of the board. 

The distinguishing factor of this guide is this intended goal and structure. It is intended to be concise and clear, providing a complete framework to initiate someone into the game. Other sources are more expansive and detailed, and are designed to either act as a form of Go library (for example [http://gobase.org GoBase]), or a complicated discussion and analysis of concepts and principles (for example [http://senseis.xmp.net Sensei's library]). There are also hard copy books in print for beginners, such as &quot;Teach yourself Go&quot; by Charles Matthews. Next section: [[Go/Basic Rules and Foundational concepts]]

Below is an example illustration used throughout this guide. It was created by the author using the tools on gobase.org.

&quot;The intended audience is beginners from levels 35kyu through levels 5kyu.&quot; This is an amazingly '''HUGE''' range of ranks... I'd suggest splitting this book into 3 books if this range is required, or changing the range from absolute beginner to 20 kyu. A late beginner level book might range from 20k to 12k and an intermediate level book might range from 12k to 5k. [[User:Malweth|Malweth]] 16:36, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

: Agreed, I think having the separate sections will help, and I think the introduction needs to avoid using the rank system anyway, as someone coming to the game may have no idea what 30k or 5k actually represent in ability. [[User:Topazg|Topazg]] 20:05, 4 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

= Other kinds of Proof =

Some Proofs do not fall into any of the categories listed above.  For example, a non constructive existence proof is a method which demonstrates the existence of a mathematical entity, without actually constructing it.

== Non Constructive Existence Proofs ==

For example, proofs exist which show the existence of nonconstructible numbers (numbers which can not be created using any combination of algebraic operations).  These proofs can clearly not be constructive.

== Proof By Exhaustion ==

Proofs which analyse and document every instance of an assertion in a case-wise analysis can be used in finite cases.  This is a cumbersome method of proof and is really only suitable when dealing with fairly small sets.  A more involved use of proof by exhaustion is the proof of the Four-Colour Theorem.  The proof has broken down the four-colour problem into subsets and a four-colour proof was applied to each of these by a computer.  This proof has not currently been verified by a human and is hence not considered fully proven.

=Basic Rules=

==Liberties==
[[Image:Go_adjacent_stones.png|thumb|The white and black squares show liberties.]]
One very important concept in the game of Go is the concept of ''liberties'', or free intersections surrounding a stone. To count how many liberties a stone has you have to simply count how many free intersections, surrounding that stone, aren't occupied by other stones. So a lone stone in the middle of the board has four liberties (intersections placed diagonally to each other aren't connected), while a lone stone on the side of the goban has only three liberties and one placed in a corner has two.

Whenever an enemy stone occupies one of these intersections, the original stone loses one liberty (since the intersection isn't free anymore). It's also true that placing a stone of the same colour on an adjacent intersection reduces the liberties of the first stone by one, but they form a ''group'', so their individual liberties aren't as valuable as before.

When two or more stones, of the same colour, are placed on adjacent intersections (remember, not diagonally) they form a ''group''. When a group is formed, its liberties are now the ''sum'' of free intersections adjacent to any single stone composing the group itself. So two adjacent stones, in the middle of the board can have at most 6 liberties (three for each stone, since the fourth liberty is occupied by the other stone in the group). We can see that grouping stones is a good way to increase liberties.

== Capturing Prisoners ==
[[Image:Go_capturing.png|thumb|Image showing the capturing of a group of stones in a game of Go]]
To capture a stone, or a group of stones, one must completely cut off all of its liberties (in other words, the stone is surrounded on all four sides). Once a stone is captured, it becomes a prisoner. This is important, because for every stone captured a point is subtracted from that player's total amount of territory. Capturing works the same way with groups of stones &amp;mdash; all captured stones are removed from the board and kept by the player who captured them. The area where the stones were removed from becomes the territory of the capturing player.

Needs to mention suicide, both legal (when taking a group) and illegal (otherwise)
A diagram would also be nice for that purpose

== Atari ==
[[Image:Atari.png|left|thumb|A stone in atari]]
A stone with only one liberty remaining is in &quot;atari.&quot; This means the stone is vulnerable to capture in a single move by the opposing player. This is somewhat comparable to &quot;check&quot; in the game of Chess, but occurs more often and is &quot;less important&quot; to the overall strategy of the game. In Chess, when the King is in check, direct action must be taken to resolve this (e.g., the king must be moved out of check, another piece must move to block the attacking piece, or the attacking piece must be captured). In Go, there is no such requirement; when a stone is placed in atari, it is not necessary to respond at all. The stone can remain in atari for many moves, or be captured by the opposing player immediately, or protected by the attacked player immediately. When a stone is placed in atari, a player may see fit to attack another area of the board or continue working to capture other territory. A player placing an opponent's stone in atari has no obligation to proclaim it, as is the rule in Checkers.

Learn to recognize capturable stones and groups: [[Go/Capturing exercise]]

== Ko rule ==
[[Image:Goko.gif|thumb|An example of a ko]]
A ''ko'' is a shape (an arrangement of stones) where one player is able to capture exactly one of his opponent's stones with one move, but after capturing the stone his opponent is able to capture (in one move) the stone that was just played again, creating an opportunity for his opponent to capture that stone in the same way again. One could capture back and forth in a ''ko'' indefinitely. This could be a problem and stop all progress in the game, so a rule was made to stop this from continuing. When one player takes a ko the other must play in another place before they can play at the ko again. This gives the first player a chance to fill in the ko and stop the fight.

To prevent the first player from settling the ko, the second player must compel the first to also play elsewhere. This is done by identifying locations where, if the second player could play two stones in a row, the result would cost the first player more than winning the ko gains. These are called ''ko threats'' and can include threatening to rescue a large dead group, kill a large living one of the opponent, or mount a costly invasion into the opponent's territory. If the first player responds, the second player is now allowed to retake the ko and it is the first player who must now find a ko threat. If the first player ignores the threat and settles the ko, the second player follows through on their threat and takes some compensation for losing the ko.

== Handicaps ==
[[Image:Go_aloituskivien_paikat.jpg|thumb|The positions for the handicap stones in the game of go.]]
To balance a game being played between players of significantly different skill, the weaker player is sometimes granted a handicap of one or more &quot;free&quot; stones. Some rule sets (Chinese, New Zealand, etc.) allow these to be placed anywhere the player desires. Other rules (Japanese, e.g.) have predefined handicap placement. Placing handicap stones is treated as black's first move, so white moves first after the handicap stones have been placed. One handicap stone is often given for every on rank difference between players. Thus if a player (white) with the rank of 7 kyu played a player (Black) with a rank of 12 kyu black would receive a handicap of 5 stones. though if the two players are only a rank or two different it is often unnecessary to use a handicap. In addition, one handicap stone is worth roughly 10 points, so if either you or your opponent does not know their rank play an even game and if one player loses by a large margin give them one stone for every ten points they lost by (as an estimate) and play another game. Repeat this until the proper handicap has been reached.

== Komi ==
In even games (games without any handicap stones), white is given a compensation for the fact that black moves first. In Japanese rules, this compensation is worth 6.5 points (the half point ensuring that no game will ever be drawn). In handicap games, white is occasionally given a half (0.5) point of compensation, simply to prevent a draw from occurring.

===Reverse Komi===
Sometimes, instead of giving white the compensation (komi), black is given that compensation instead, as a sort of handicap. This is occasionally referred to as a &quot;one-stone handicap&quot;, but is more popularly and simply called &quot;reverse komi&quot;.

=Foundational Concepts=

== Placing Stones ==
[[Image:Go_-.png|left|thumb|120px|Point on a go board.]]
Stones are placed at the points created by the intersecting lines of the grid.  A stone may be placed on any empty point, unless that point has no adjacent empty points and the placement does not cause the capture of adjacent enemy stone(s). The traditional way of placing stones on the board is by grasping the stone with the index and middle fingers, with the stone held horizontally between the index (below) and the middle (on top) fingers. This may feel awkward the first few times it is done.

== Surrounding Territory ==
Territory is surrounded when all of the points/intersections in an area are controlled by a single colour. Only an outline is needed to claim territory &amp;mdash; placing stones at every point within an area will not claim territory (and in fact reduces the actual territory claimed &amp;mdash; in Japanese rules the game is scored by counting open territory claimed, not spaces occupied by stones). An &quot;eye&quot; is one example of a group (joined stones) that claims territory. An opponent may play within territory if it is legal to do so.

== Groups ==



== Cutting ==
Cutting occurs when a stone is placed between two groups of enemy stones in order to prevent the groups from connecting.

Perhaps this should be moved more towards an intermediate level

== Initiative (Sente - Gote)==

Sente is when a player is &quot;ahead&quot; of his opponent if you will. It is when he forces the other player to respond to his moves. It is said that this player is in sente and his opponent in gote.

This section needs to be expanded.
It may also need to be moved to a more intermediate level

== Life and Death ==
A ''dead group'' is one that is unable to make more than one eye. Such a group is at risk of capture because it cannot be completely defended. A ''live group'' is one that ''is'' able to make two or more eyes. This is a very powerful group because the enemy cannot attack it successfully; any attack will result in immediate suicide or eventual capture of more territory or stones by the owner of the live group.

Groups can sometimes be neither completely dead nor completely alive.

== Eyes ==
[[Image:Go_kaksi_silm%C3%A4%C3%A4.png|thumb|White has two eyes]]
A single group of interconnected stones with one point of territory forms an ''eye''. A group with two or more eyes cannot be captured, as at both points white could not play without the stone played having no liberties (called suicide, and is not a legal move in the Japanese rule set), and is a powerful structure within the game.

=== Tsumego ===

Tsumego is Japanese for life and death problems. You are given a situation and you have to figure out how to make a group live (or how to kill a group). There are several sites that offer life and death problems, for example [http://www.goproblems.com goproblems.com].
There are also books containing these problems.

Tsumego is one part of Go/Igo/Baduk/Wei Qi, though studying tsumego alone isn't enough to progress it may help a lot in battles, as well as your calculative abilities and your ability to perceive weak groups.

=== Seki ===

A Seki situation happens when opposing groups are placed so that both depend on the same liberties to survive. Neither player can place the other into atari because this would place themselves into atari as well. Seki situations are usually left alone until the end of a Go game. The free points in them are not counted when it's time to count for scoring.

== Order of play ==
=== Exigent ===

First you should play the most urgent or necessary moves.  These are the moves that could cause you to lose considerable amount of territory or weaken your position. Ask yourself: do I have any groups that could be killed in less than three turns, and should I protect them?

=== Exploit ===
If you can find no moves of the first type, you should look for ones that take advantage of an opponent's weakness. Also find what would be your opponent's urgent moves and block those, or otherwise take advantage of them.

=== Expand ===

If there are none of the first two types of moves then find the move that would take the most territory or the biggest move.

      <comment>/* &quot;Fluency Controls and Automatic Fluency&quot; */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt; William Perkins believes that stuttering is a discoordination of phonation (vocal fold vibration) with articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue) and respiration (breathing). He believes that stuttering is a disorder of timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins' therapy develops compensatory skills that enable stutterers to talk fluently.{{ref|PetersGuitar1991}} Stutterers can't use all these fluency skills in every conversation. Using fluency skills demands attention and mental effort. He recommends that his clients use these fluency skills in difficult speaking situations. The rest of the time, they talk spontaneously. For some people the fluency skills become habitual and effortless. But for most people, only parts of the motor skills become habitual. Still, this produces improved, if not perfect speech.&lt;/p&gt;

==Establishing Fluency==

&lt;p&gt;Because Perkins believes that stuttering is a disorder of timing, his therapy emphasizes slow speech. The therapy uses delayed auditory feedback (DAF) to aid a very slow speaking rate of about two seconds per word, or 5-10 times slower than normal speech. You don't stutter when you talk this slowly. You start with reading out loud, then use slow speech in conversations in the speech clinic. You don't use this slow speech outside the speech clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After establishing extremely slow, fluent speech, you work on five &quot;breath flow&quot; motor skills. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phrasing. You limit your phrases to 3-8 syllables. This is prevents running out of air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phrase initiation. You start each phrase with an easy vocal onset. In other words, you relax your vocal folds on the first sound of the first syllable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft contact. You articulate consonants softly, keeping your lips, tongue, and jaw relaxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breathy voice. This is a soft or breathy speaking style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blending. You maintain a continuous airflow from the beginning of each phrase to the end. You blend each syllable into the next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This slow-motion speech produces a monotonous, droning speaking style. You then work on adding inflections, intonations, and emotions to make your slow speech sound normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you master these fluent speech motor skills at the extremely slow speaking rate, you then work on increasing your speaking rate, while continuing to use your fluent speech skills. The DAF delay is reduced from 250 milliseconds (ms) to 200 ms, or about one second per word. Then the delay is reduced to 150 ms, or about two words per minute. Then the DAF volume is reduced, then one earphone is removed, and finally DAF use is discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;

==Transfer==

&lt;p&gt;At this point, your speech in the speech clinic is fluent and sounds normal. You are now ready to transfer this fluent speech to conversations outside the clinic. Perkins does this in four steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate your speech. You make tape recordings of your speech, and rate your speech in terms of fluency, rate, breath flow, prosody, and self-con fidence. If you miss any of these targets, you are expected to practice the appropriate fluency shaping motor skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking hierarchies. This a rating of speaking situations from easy to dif ficult. This ranges from conversations in the speech clinic to conversations outside the speech clinic; one-to-one conversations to speaking to an audience; etc. When you can use your fluent speech in an easy situation, you move on to using it in more challenging situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social and vocational changes. You are encouraged to take responsibilities at work that require talking, and to participate in social activities that require talking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare for relapse. There are times when your fluent speech will relapse, and your stuttering will return. To prepare for this, your speech therapist has you speak without each of the fluency shaping motor skills, until you stutter. For example, your talk as fast as you can, until you stutter. Then you start again, using your fluency shaping speech motor skills to regain your fluency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==&quot;Fluency Controls and Automatic Fluency&quot;==

&lt;p&gt;Perkins found that when his clients tried to use fluency skills outside the speech clinic, the fluency skills demanded too much mental concentration and attention. They also found that their speech sounded monotonous and droning. They said, &quot;I'd rather stutter than talk like this.&quot;{{ref|Perkins1992}}

&lt;p&gt;So his clients stopped controlling their rate and went back to speaking spontaneously. They felt and spoke like normal speakers&amp;#151;at least for a few hours, usually for a few days, sometimes for a few weeks, rarely for a few months, and only once for a few years. They had no control over this spontaneously fluent speech. They could not make it happen, and they could not prevent its disappearance. They called it &quot;lucky fluency.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins at first expected that this spontaneous, fluent speech would become habitual, but it didn't. Perkins concluded that fluency shaping speech motor skills can never become automatic or permanently habitual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins then changed his therapy goals: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#133;those who were most satisfied with therapy were those who found that they could use their fluency skills to warm up each day, and also have them available for emergencies. The remainder of the time they forgot about controls and spoke naturally. This made them vulnerable to some stuttering, but by facing up to their avoidances, stuttering progressively lost its sting. These clients gained confidence in their ability to speak out freely, even though that included stuttering occasionally.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins differentiates two types of speech: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Warm up&quot; or speech exercises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spontaneous speech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;warm up&quot; speech can sound abnormal, or require mental concentration, or use a DAF device. None of these &quot;downsides&quot; matter if the &quot;warm up&quot; speech produces carryover fluency or improved spontaneous speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins believes that no adult stutterer is ever cured. He concludes that you will have to practice &quot;warm up&quot; techniques every day, to continually improve your spontaneous speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perkins believes that the key issue in fluency shaping is why fluent speech too often doesn't become habitual and automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to MySQL ==

MySQL, the most popular open source SQL database, is developed and provided by MySQL AB, a commercial company which gets its income from providing services around the MySQL database. The MySQL software delivers a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user, and robust SQL database server, intended for mission-critical, heavy-load production systems as well as for embedding into mass-deployed software. 

The official way to pronounce MySQL is &quot;My Ess Que Ell&quot; (though in practice many users pronounce it as &quot;my sequel&quot;). Michael (&quot;Monty&quot;) Widenius, the creator of MySQL, is unsure where the name originally came from, though he says that it may have come from his daughter My. Two more of Widenius's children, Max and Maria, have also lent their names to MySQL products (MaxDB and the Maria table type respectively).

== MySQL Licenses ==

The MySQL software is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is probably the best known open source license. The software is provided &quot;as is&quot; and is without any warranty.

The MySQL software has Dual Licensing, which means you can use the MySQL software free of charge under the GPL. You can also purchase commercial MySQL licenses from MySQL AB if you do not wish to be bound by the terms of the GPL.

You need to purchase commercial non-GPL MySQL licenses:

* If you distribute MySQL Software with your non open source software.
* If you want warranty from MySQL AB for the MySQL software.
* If you want to support MySQL development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A contract is an agreement that legally binds the parties to the agreement to do (or not do) what the contract stipulates.  The essential elements of a contract are the &lt;b&gt;offer, acceptance, &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt; consideration&lt;/b&gt;.  An offer is the proposal to make a contract.  The acceptance is the &quot;meeting of minds&quot;, when the &quot;offeree&quot; agrees to be bound to the offer.  Consideration is the substance of the agreement: each side must receive something, tangible or not, in order for a contract to be legally binding.


In Quebec civil law, a contract is conceived as one part of a broader legal category, the &quot;obligation&quot;.  One is obliged to honour a contract, just as one is obliged to behave according to the minimum standards of society in avoiding harm to others.  This second concept is the equivalent of the common law concept of the &quot;tort&quot;.  In the common law system, for historical reasons, the rules of contract and the rules of tort evolved separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Offer and Invitation to Treat ==
An offer is a promise which, if accepted, will bind the person who offers and the person who accepts.  All of the essential terms of a contract should be in an offer, so that the person to whom the offer is made should only have to say &quot;yes&quot;, and the contract will become enforceable.

In most contracts, the offer is made to a specific person, and that person only will be able to accept.  However, this is not always so.  A '''unilateral contract''' is a promise to the whole world: the offeror promises to do something in return to whomever does the thing requested.  An example of a '''unilateral contract''' is a reward poster:  The offeror promises to pay $25 to whomever finds his lost dog.  The offer is not made to any person in particular; it is made to whomever finds his dog. An offer is deemed accepted at the moment of performance of the contract-- as soon as someone finds and returns the dog, he is entitled to $25.  In fact, he need not have known about the reward poster to be entitled to the $25; in this way, the unilateral contract is in some ways an exception to the principle that a contract is the &quot;meeting of minds&quot;.

A tricky question about unilateral contracts often arises out of their expiry.  For example, many old paperbacks have coupons in them; &quot;send in $7.95 and we shall send you the rest of this series&quot;.  This is a unilateral contract:  whomever sends the $7.95 should receive the other books.  However, if the paperback was printed in, say 1956, one could not fill out the coupon today along with $7.95 and hope to receive the rest of the series.  Why?

There are several principles for interpreting contracts.  One is called the &quot;business efficiency&quot; principle.  Where a term in a contract is missing (for instance, the expiry date of a unilateral contract), the business efficiency principle requires judges to ask what would the parties to the contract necessarily have agreed to at the time the contract was made for this contract to make business sense.  Taking the example above, it would have made no business sense in 1956 for the offer contained in the paperback coupon to have remained valid for several decades: they knew then that the books books would eventually go out of print and the value of the currency would drop due to inflation.  However, if in 1956, they believed that this series of books would still be in print in 2004, and that inflation would remain at zero for the next fifty years, then the coupon would probably still be valid today, even if hindsight showed this offer to be foolish.

Courts have made a distinction between a unilateral contract and &quot;mere puffery&quot;.  &quot;Mere puffery&quot; is often found in advertising.  &quot;This is the best product ever!&quot; and &quot;You won't be disappointed&quot; are examples of mere puffery.  Such descriptions of the product are not considered as part of the offer, i.e., if you ''are'' disappointed, you cannot complain that the offeror did not live up to the contract.  On the other hand, if an advertiser says, &quot;if you're not satisfied, we'll give you your money back!&quot;  '''would''' be considered as part of a valid contract.  This is called a warranty, which will be discussed below.

=== Invitation for Tenders ===

== Acceptance ==
A contract is made at the moment of acceptance.  What the parties thought they agreed to after the acceptance is not relevant.  What matters is what the parties thought they agreed to at the moment it was accepted.

As a contract is a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot;, it is crucial for a contract to be formed that the offeree accepts the same thing that the offeror offered.  If the offer is &quot;I will sell you this bicycle for $50&quot; and the acceptance is &quot;I accept your offer to sell me your bicycle for $80&quot;, then there is no acceptance, because the offer and the acceptance were for different terms.  

An acceptance on different terms than the offer may be regarded as a counter-offer.  If in the above example, the first person says &quot;O.K., $80 it is,&quot;  then a contract is made.  Both parties are bound to an exchange of the bicycle for $80.

== Consideration ==
Consideration is something of value in the eyes of the law moving from the promisee that will invoke the agreement. It is usually in the for ofa benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee. In general, consideration is essential to all contracts, with the exception of contracts under seal. Moreover, the courts will often go to great length to find consideration.

===  Past Consideration ===

== Intention ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Remedies for Breach ==

If a contract is broken, the injured party might be expected to demand any of the following:

* to have what they gave returned to them (&quot;restitution&quot;)
* compensation for their loss (&quot;damages&quot;)
* forcing the other party to live up to the contract (&quot;specific performance&quot;)


In the common law tradition, damages is the usual remedy that a court awards for a broken contract.  Restitution and specific performance are only available in specific cicrumstances.

=== Damages ===


=== Specific Performance ===

=== Rescission ===
Rescission (to &quot;set aside&quot; a contract) refers to the cancellation of the contract between the parties. This is done to bring the parties as far as possible to the position they were before they entered into a contract. This an equitable remedy and is discretionary. The court may decline to rescind a contract if one party has affirmed the contract by his action (see Long v Lloyd) or a third party has acquired some rights or there has been substantial performance in implementing the contract.

Economic rights, which is the most frequent meaning when discussing &quot;copyright&quot;, are rights designed to allow the holder of the rights to benefit from the work. These rights can be bought and sold in any part, however, they necesssarily have a limited longevity. Moral rights on the other hand, are inalienable rights of the creator of a work that acknowledge the work as an extension of the artist's personality. They are rights that allow for the artist to protect their dignity and reputation.  

The purpose of copyright law was articulated in ''Apple Computer v. Mackintosh Computers'' by Reed J.
:''purpose of the Copyright Act is and always has been to grant a monopoly. No distinction is made therein as to the purpose of the work created -- for entertainment, instruction or other purposes. The legislation historically, in my view had two purposes: to encourage disclosure of works for the &quot;advancement of learning&quot;, and to protect and reward the intellectual effort of the author (for a limited period of time) in the work''

However, the scope of these rights and those of the public are put in a delicate balance that the courts must regulate.
:''The Copyright Act is usually presented as a balance between promoting the public interest in the encouragement and dissemination of works of the arts and intellectual and obtainning a just reward for the creator (or, more accurately, to prevent someone other than the creator from appropriating whatever benefits may be generated).''

Drawing the line indicating what can and cannot be property is always an ongoing debate. The ephemeral nature of expression has made it often very difficult to distinguish from an idea. Moreover, the extent to which right holders should be advantaged adds to the debate. The proliferation of new technologies has only complicated these problems as the law must continually play catch-up to the ever changing information landscape.
  
Since 2002 copyright law has experienced a significant change on an almost yearly basis. The Courts have slowly been adopting an interpretive approach similar to the US wherein interests of the artists are offset by interests of the public as demonstrated in the quote above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like most other common law countries there are no inherent rights to works, performances, or sound recording at the common law. Copyright exists solely in statute. According to section 91(23) of the Constitution Act, 1867 the federal government is granted exclusive power to enact laws related to copyright. The evolution of copyright in Canada has been guided by international treaties signed by Canada that try to unify copyright laws across the globe.

==Copyright Act==
The Copyright Act was first enacted in 1921 and was based almost entirely on the British Copyright Act of 1911. But since ratifying the Berne Convention the Act has been amended to accommodate many of the requirements of a modern copyright regime.

==International Treaties==
Section 91 of the Copyright Act states that Canada adheres to the following treaties:
:(a) the Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works concluded at Berne on September 9, 1886, as revised by the Paris Act of 1971; and
:(b) the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, done at Rome on October 26, 1961.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Subsistence of Copyright is at the core of the debate on what should be protected. Copyright is meant to protect the expression of ideas but never ideas in themselves. This becomes problematic as there is no clear way to discern the two. The case law on the subsistence of copyright focuses on the court's many attempts at demarking the difference between the two. 

===Originality===
The Act provides protection for all &quot;original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic&quot; works. Close attention has been paid to the use of the word &quot;original&quot;. It has been well established that the foremost requirement for the subsistence of copyright is that the work be original. 

The CCH Canadian case re-evaluated the meaning of &quot;original&quot; in the context of several other countries including the US and Australia. The US had adopted a &quot;creative spark&quot; doctrine requiring a minimal sign of originality to have copyright. While Australia had adopted a &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; doctrine that did not require any creativity whatsoever, rather originality is substituted by the effort made by the creator. McLachlin chose a middle ground, which in retrospect is closer to the &quot;creative spark&quot; doctrine. For a work to be original it must be the result of the exercise of &quot;skill and judgement&quot;. More specifically: skill, meaning the &quot;use of one's knowledge, developed aptitude or pracised ability in producing work&quot;, and judgement, meaning the &quot;use of one's capacity for discernment or ability to form an opinion or evaluation by comparing different possible options in producing the work&quot;. Nevertheless, originality does not require any novelty or creativity. But it does require intellectual effort beyond mere mechanical exercise. 

The determination of originality on the basis presented in CCH Canadian depends on the facts. For a large part, it depends on the degree to which the work originated from the author. Many factors are considered, in particular the medium or form used is significant. Of relevance is whether it is comprised of elements that are in the public domain or not, the ordering of data or facts, or whether the form is pedestrial or novel. Mere selection is generally not enough. As well, it is significant to consider whether there is any artistic elements to it.

The exact determination is still difficult. It has been determined that copyediting of texts is not usually sufficient. But, for example, does a quick snapshot taken by a parent of their child have sufficient judgement and skill? Generally, not.

=== Fixation ===
As stated at the beginning, the philosophy behind copyright is the protection of expression of ideas. This entails that there must be a form, or &quot;fixation&quot;, to the expression. It is fixation that distinguishes an expression from an idea. 

In Canadian Admiral Corp. v. Rediffusion, the court considered fixation: &quot;for copyright to exists in a 'work' it must be expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance.&quot; [emphasis added] In this case, the court found that there was insufficient fixation in the live broadcast of a sports event. Any sort of broadcast, telecast, or display of a spectacle on its own is not sufficient to be fixed. At the least, it must be simultaneously recorded in some fashion to be fixed.

To the possible exception of choreographed works, there is a requirement that the work be recorded in a relatively permanent form. Typing a note into a computer screen may be sufficiently permanent. Some cases have shown that unstructured speech or other spontaneous or improvised creations, such as a sports game, cannot contain copyright. 

=== Exclusion ===
Both facts and ideas are by their very nature uncopyrightable. This will often create difficulties when it becomes necessary to separate the idea from the expression as well as in the separation of fact from the arranging and use of those facts. Where the distinction between idea and expression becomes obscured the Courts often take a precautionary view that it cannot be copyrighted so as to avoid preventing others from expressing the same idea.

Minor designs that are largely ornamental or functional are excluded as well. For example, coloured blocks used as tools in a educational progam are excluded.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order for a work to be protected under the Copyright Act it must fall within an enumerated class of work. Copyright subsists in &quot;every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work.&quot; Each class is defined within the Act, however, they are in many cases open-ended.

==Literary==
The term &quot;literary&quot; has been given an extremely broad meaning in copyright law. It naturally includes written texts, but it has also been extended to include tables, source code and compiled code. Manuals, diagrams, architectural plans, forms have all been shown to be copyrightable.  

In determining whether a work is literary Courts have refused to examine whether there is any &quot;literary merit&quot;. By virtue of being written it a work can be considered literary. It need only be shown to have taken labour, skill, and judgement to arrange the work. 

The meaning of literary in its broadest form, can extend to protect characters and situations in a story. The main two criteria for determining this is the distinctiveness of the character and the notoriety of the character. (Hutton v. 20th Century Fox) Generic situations and stock characters, however, are not copyrightable (Nichols v. ??).

=== 3-D works ===

=== Computer Programs ===
Since the amendments in 1988 computer programs are deemed to be literary works. The Act defines a program as &quot;a set of instructions or statements expressed, fixed, embodied or stored in any manner, that is to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a specific result.&quot; 

In practice, this has meant that translation of code into another language can be considered infringement in the same manner that the translation of a book into another language can infringe the copyright.

==Dramatic==
A &quot;dramatic work&quot; includes:
:(a) any piece for recitation, choreographic work or mime, the scenic arrangement or acting form of which is fixed in writing or otherwise,
:(b) any cinematographic work, and
:(c) any compilation of dramatic works;

A Choreographic work includes &quot;any work of choreography, whether or not it has any story line&quot;.

A Cinematographic work includes &quot;any work expressed by any process analogous to cinematography, whether or not accompanied by a soundtrack&quot;.

As discussed in the &quot;fixation&quot; section. The communication of a dramatic event is not enough to attract copyright, nor is the presentation of musical works on television enough. The degree of premeditation is significant. A reality TV show may be largely unpredictable and improvised however, the structure of the show is well defined and likely contains copyright. 

==Artistic==
An artistic work is typically said to be a work in a visual medium as distinguished from literary, musical, or dramatic works{{ref|DRG}}. &quot;Artistic work&quot;, as defined in the Act includes &quot;paintings, drawings, maps, charts, plans, photographs, engravings, sculptures, works of artistic craftsmanship, architectural works, and compilations of artistic works&quot;
From this three basic categories of artistic works can be formulated. A work can be 1) an enumerated work (as listed in subsection 2(2) such as paintings, drawings, maps, etc.); or 2) a work of artistic craftsmanship; or 3) residual works. The first category has been relatively well defined. &quot;Architectural works&quot;, &quot;engravings&quot;, &quot;photographs&quot;, and &quot;sculptures&quot; are all defined within the Act, while the rest are defined through their dictionary definition. The second category, however, has taken a divergent turn from the rest, requiring analysis of artistic merit. The third category remains debatable that it even exists {{ref|cuisenair}}.

As with all classes of works, an artistic work must be sufficiently original and in a fixed material form. Nonetheless, the artistic merit of the work has generally not been examined {{ref|DRG}}, with the exception for works of artistic craftsmanship.   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''I do not accept that the category of artistic works in general must meet [an artistic] test. I do not accept that the word &quot;artistic&quot; in reference to &quot;artistic work&quot; is being used in the same sense as the word &quot;artistic&quot; in reference to &quot;works of artistic craftsmanship&quot;, that is, in the latter case &quot;artistic&quot;-ness requires a determination along the lines of that attempted in ''Hercher'', ''Merlet'', or ''Hay''. In my view the phrase &quot;artistic work&quot; is used merely as a generic description of the type of works which follow. It is used as a general description of works which find expression in a visual medium''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This policy decision has largely been grounded on the basis that artistic evaluation is far too difficult for the court to decide and generally leads to complications. For example, the original interpretation of &quot;architectural works&quot; required some degree of artistry beyond what the structure required for its use. This proved too cumbersome and thus they reformulated the protection to include all architectural works.
 
There still remains some debate on the need for artistic merit. In, ''Cuisenaire v. South West Imports Ltd.'' the Court found that a set of coloured rods that accompanied a math book was not sufficiently artistic as the &quot;rods are physically little more than tools or counter to be used for a particular purpose...they were never intended primarily as an article regarded as artistic or because it in itself...Indeed, even if artistic merit is not a matter of importance in copyright law, the word artistic must still be given its ordinary meaning&quot;. The end conclusion was that &quot;an artistic work...must to some degree at least, be a work that is intended to have an appeal to the aesthetic senses not just an incidental appeal...but as an important or one of the important objects for which the work is brought into being.&quot;  The requirement set by the courts means that the work be primarily designed to serve a purpose more than pure function. Nevertheless, in DRG v. Datafile the Court found copyright in a labeling system that had been created to serve a functional purpose.

== Compilations ==
A compilation of either copyrightable or non-copyrightable material may create copyright as long as it is the result of a sufficient amount of labour, skill, and judgement. 

Normal telephone books typically are said not to involve sufficient skill or judgement to have copyright. Nor are broadcast days (ordering of network TV shows).

The creation of a compilation does not alienate any of the rights that exist in the components of the works. This has resulted in many complications. Robertson v. Thompson considered the issue of a freelance writer who gave permission to a newspaper publish her article. However, she only granted the right to public her work as part of the collective work that makes up the newspaper edition, so when the newspaper put the article into an online database she sued for copyright infringement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Protection of Economic Rights ==
The owner of a copyright has exclusive rights over the certain economic benefits derived from the rights.The determination of whether any rights have been violated depends on what is the extent of those rights. This is reflected in the &quot;infringement&quot; provision of the Copyright Act which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
''27(1) It is an infringement of copyright for any person to do, without consent of the owner of the copyright, anything that by this Act only the owner of the copyright has the right to do.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The exclusive economic rights are those enumerated in section 3(1). The section gives rights to produce, reproduce, present, communicate, publish, or authorize works, depending on the type of protected work.

=== Produce or Reproduce ===
The right of reproduction is said to be the broadest of the protected rights, and in practice, it is the most often applied right. It provides &quot;the sole right to produce or reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatever...&quot; This includes both public and private reproductions. Copying within the privacy of home can still constitute infringement. 

A reproduction comes in two basic types, literal copying and non-literal copying (also referred to as a colourable imitation). As well, the copy does not need to consist of a complete reproduction, the act equally protects against taking of a &quot;substantial part&quot; of the work.

When a work is subject to literal copying in its entirety, with either minor or no changes at all, a finding of infringement is usually simple. The judge will usually find an infringement when the similarity between the works cannot be the result of coincidence. However, when the copied work has been disguised it makes determining infringement difficult. In such a case the Court will look for &quot;colourable imitation&quot; in characteristics of the work. This is often used in the &quot;Substantial similarity&quot; test which asks: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''First, there must be sufficient objective similarity between the infringing work and the copyright work, or a substantial part thereof, for the former to be properly described, not necessarily as identical with, but as a reproduction or adaptation of the latter; secondly, the copyright work must be the source from which the infringing work is derived.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In conjunction with this, it must be shown that the accused had access to the original work.  


Nevertheless, the copying of an idea from another work cannot constitute an infringement.

=== Performance in Public ===


=== Communication to Public ===


=== Authorizing ===
An individual may be liable for all types copyright infringement where it can shown that they &quot;authorized&quot; - that is, sanctioned, approved, or countenanced - someone else to infringe a copyright. This form of liability is particularly useful when the actual culprit of the infringement is unavailable or judgement proof.

In ''CCH Canadian v. Law Society of Upper Canada'', the Court outlined what is required to show authorization. A person who merely provides the means for infringing copyright cannot be held liable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fair Dealing==
Fair dealing in Canadian Copyright law provides for an exemption to copyright infringement when the use of the work is for the purpose of research or private study, criticism or a review, or for news reporting. In comparison with the US fair use clause this is a closed list and must fall into one of the three categories for the use of the works to not constitute infringement. 

With the CCH Canadian case the Court has largely reframed much of the use of the exemption as a &quot;user right&quot; to counter balance the rights of copyright holders. As such, the exception is always available even when other exceptions apply.

In considering fair dealing the Court makes the following general observation:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''It is important to clarify some general considerations about exceptions to copyright infringement. Procedurally, a defendant is required to prove that his or her dealing with a work has been fair; however, the fair dealing exception is perhaps more properly understood as an integral part of the Copyright Act than simply a defence. Any act falling within the fair dealing exception will not be an infringement of copyright. The fair dealing exception, like other exceptions in the Copyright Act, '''is a user's right'''. In order to maintain the proper balance between the rights of a copyright owner and users' interests, it must not be interpreted restrictively. ... 'User rights are not just loopholes. Both owner rights and user rights should therefore be given the fair and balanced reading that befits remedial legislation.'&quot;''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

The Court then establishes six principal criteria for evaluating fair use.
#'''The Purpose of the Dealing'''  Is it for research, private study, criticism, review or news reporting?  It expresses that &quot;these allowable purposes should not be given a restrictive interpretation or this could result in the undue restriction of users' rights.&quot; 
#'''The Character of the Dealing'''  How were the works dealt with?  Was there a single copy or were multiple copies made?  Were these copies distributed widely or to a limited group of people? Was the copy destroyed after its purpose was accomplished?  What are the normal practices of the industry?  
#'''The Amount of the Dealing''' How much of the work was used?  What was the importance of the infringed work?  Quoting trivial amounts may alone sufficiently establish fair dealing.  In some cases even quoting the entire work may be fair dealing.  
#'''Alternatives to the Dealing'''  Was a &quot;non-copyrighted equivalent of the work&quot; available to the user?  Could the work have been properly criticized without being copied?
#'''The Nature of the Work''' Copying from a work that has never been published could be more fair than from a published work &quot;in that its reproduction with acknowledgement could lead to a wider public dissemination of the work - one of the goals of copyright law. If, however, the work in question was confidential, this may tip the scales towards finding that the dealing was unfair.&quot;
#'''Effect of the Dealing on the Work''' Is it likely to affect the market of the original work?  &quot;Although the effect of the dealing on the market of the copyright owner is an important factor, it is neither the only factor nor the most important factor that a court must consider in deciding if the dealing is fair.&quot;  A statement that a dealing infringes may not be sufficient, but evidence will often be required.

&quot;These factors may be more or less relevant to assessing the fairness of a dealing depending on the factual context of the allegedly infringing dealing. In some contexts, there may be factors other than those listed here that may help a court decide whether the dealing was fair.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Patent law is a statutory regime that is designed to protect inventions. An inventor may apply to have their invention registered with a patent which provides them the right to exclude others from profitting from the invention. Much like copyright law, patent law is a purely statutory system that is in the exclusive domain of the federal government. The area of law is regulated by the Patent Act which outlines the scope of the patent regime, the rights and resonsibilities of a patent holder, the methods of applying for a patent, among other things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic requirement for something to be patentable is that it is new, useful, and inventive. The rationale behind this is that the protection of the invention should benefit all of society by encouraging those who design them to profit and continue to create more. Classic mechanical, chemical, electrical inventions follow a typically strict form of evaluation that has proven to be practicable.  However, with the expansion of the sciences, new unforeseen territory is being examined for whether the public interest in protecting inventions may be outweighed by other more detrimental factors, ethical or otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The trade-mark regime in Canada, like most common law countries, is used to protect distinctive marks and signs that are used to identify a company, product, or service. Similar to copyright law, trade-mark law is primarily statute based. The application and registration process are governed by the ''Trade-marks Act'' and the ''Trade-marks Regulations''.  However, unlike copyright, there is common law protection behind the statutory power, and it has a foundation derived from a related area of tort law known as passing off, which prevents others from appropriating the marketable image from other companies. 

&quot;In addition, there is a miscellany of statutes that, while not in the ''Trade-marks Act'', may affect the trade-mark process and registrability.  Also, on an international level, Canada is signatory to several treaties or agreements relating to trade-marks. (page 1-1 Odutola on Canadian Trade-mark Practice)&quot;  Relevant statutes are as follows: the ''Bank Act'', the ''Canada Agricultural Products Act'', the ''Meat Inspection Act'', the ''Geneva Conventions Act'', ''Canada Post Corporations Act'', ''Criminal Code'', ''Food and Drugs Act'', ''Food and Drug Regulations'' and the ''Precious Metals Marking Act''. (page 1-2 Odutola on Canadian Trade-mark Practice)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A trade-mark is a distinctive sign of some kind which is used by a business to identify itself and its products and services to consumers, and to set the business and its products or services apart from those of other businesses. Conventionally, a trade-mark comprises a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, characters, logo, a domain name, a colour applied to a surface or a combination of one or more of these elements.  There is also a range of non-conventional trade-marks which do not fall into these standard categories.

The function of a trade-mark is to serve as an exclusive identifier of the source or origin of a product or service. &quot;Because the purpose of a trade-mark is to distinguish the wares/services of a person by associating the wares/services with a single source, the trade-mark must be distinctive and remain distinctive of the single source.&quot;(p 2-1. Odutola on Canadian Trade-mark Practice)


Section 2 of the Trade-marks Act defines a &quot;trade-mark&quot; as 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''(a) a mark that is used by a person for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him from those manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by others,&lt;br&gt;
''(b) a certification mark,&lt;br&gt;
''(c) a distinguishing guise, or&lt;br&gt;
''(d) a proposed trade-mark;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 2 of the Trade-marks Act defines &quot;certification mark&quot; as &lt;br&gt;

''a mark that is used for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish wares or services that are of a defined standard with respect to''&lt;br&gt;
''(a) the character or quality of the wares or services,&lt;br&gt;
''(b) the working conditions under which the wares have been produced or the services performed,&lt;br&gt;
''(c) the class of persons by whom the wares have been produced or the services performed, or&lt;br&gt;
''(d) the area within which the wares have been produced or the services performed,&lt;br&gt;
''from wares or services that are not of that defined standard;&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Section 2 of the Trade-marks Act defines a &quot;distinguishing guise&quot; as 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) ''a shaping of wares or their containers'', or&lt;br&gt;
(b) ''a mode of wrapping or packaging wares''&lt;br&gt;

''the appearance of which is used by a person for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him from those manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by others;''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 2 of the Trade-marks Act defines a &quot;proposed trade-mark&quot; as
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''&quot;proposed trade-mark&quot; means a mark that is proposed to be used by a person for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him from those manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by others;''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


== Use ==
A trade-mark owner seeks to enforce their rights or interests in a trade-mark by preventing unauthorised trade-mark ''use''. For a trade-mark to be in &quot;use&quot; it must have public &quot;impact&quot;. As such internal company documents, such as letterhead, memos, reports, etc. are not sufficient unless they are used in outside correspondence. 

Section 4 of the Act determines when a mark has been &quot;used&quot; in relation to wares or services:
:''4. (1) A trade-mark is deemed to be used in association with wares if, at the time of the transfer of the property in or possession of the wares, in the normal course of trade, it is marked on the wares themselves or on the packages in which they are distributed or it is in any other manner so associated with the wares that notice of the association is then given to the person to whom the property or possession is transferred.
:''(2) A trade-mark is deemed to be used in association with services if it is used or displayed in the performance or advertising of those services.
:''(3) A trade-mark that is marked in Canada on wares or on the packages in which they are contained is, when the wares are exported from Canada, deemed to be used in Canada in association with those wares.
A mark for a ware is deemed &quot;in use&quot; if the product or packaging in labelled at the time of sale or if they are labelled at time they are exported out of the country. A mark for a service is deemed in use if it is displayed at the time of performance or in an advertisement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Section 35 of the Act warns that a registrable trade-mark may comprise of elements that, on their own, are not individually registrable. But nonetheless, over time these elements may gain distinctiveness to be registrable.

=== First Names and Family Names ===
Under section 12(1)(a) marks that are &quot;primarily merely&quot; the name or surname of an individual who is living or has died within the past 30 years are unregistrable unless it can be shown that the mark can be used significantly, has acquired reputation, or has secondary meaning.
 
=== &quot;Descriptiveness&quot; ===
Under section 12(1)(b) of the ''Trade-marks Act'', Trade-marks that are &quot;clearly descriptive&quot; or &quot;deceptively misdescriptive&quot; in English or French are not registrable.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''12. (1) Subject to section 13, a trade-mark is registrable if it is not
...
''(b) whether depicted, written or sounded, either clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive in the English or French language of the character or quality of the wares or services in association with which it is used or proposed to be used or of the conditions of or the persons employed in their production or of their place of origin;
...
''(2) A trade-mark that is not registrable by reason of paragraph (1)(a) or (b) is registrable if it has been so used in Canada by the applicant or his predecessor in title as to have become distinctive at the date of filing an application for its registration.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* corrupted spelling is irrelevant to the analysis

==== Clearly descriptive ====
The test to determine if a set of words in a mark are &quot;clearly descriptive&quot; depends on the immediate or first impression of the words as a whole rather than a parsed analysis of the potential meanings of the word. This requires that the words be taken in the context of similar wares or services. Simply put, words are &quot;clearly descriptive&quot; if they are &quot;related to an intrinsic quality, character or be material to the composition of the goods or products, or describe a feature, trait or characteristic, or function/result of the goods or service&quot; (9-13 of Hughes on Trade-marks) 

In the ''Drackett Co. of Canada Ltd.'' case the Court found that &quot;once-a-week&quot; slogan to be clearly descriptive of the product which was a drug that was to be taken once every week.

Descriptive of Quality

Descriptive of Character

First Impression upon ordinary user or dealer

==== Deceptively misdescriptive ====

This section is meant as a means to prevent a mark from misleading the public to believe that the product possesses qualities that it does not have. Names that suggest a product was from a certain country, made in a certain fashion, or contain a certain product, are generally discounted on this ground.

In ''Lake Ontario Cement Ltd. v. Registrar of Trade-marks'' (1976), 31 C.P.R. (2d) 103, the Court held that the word &quot;Premier&quot; for a mark for concrete was not deceptively misdescriptive. The word suggests a quality that the product could potentially possess. Moreover, purchasers of the product would unlikely have purchased the product on the basis that they believed the concrete to be the best in the industry. The word, however, was found to be clearly descriptive and thus was not registrable.

==== Languages ====
Any words in a language other than French or English that would be considered clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive cannot be excluded under section 12(1)(b). In Gula v. Manischewitz Co. (1947), 8 C.P.R. 103, a company making crackers under the mark &quot;tam tam&quot; was challenged by another cracker company with a product called &quot;tum tum&quot;. The name &quot;tam tam&quot;, which was Hebrew for &quot;taste&quot; or &quot;tasty&quot;, was allowed on the basis that it was not a recognizable word in the English or French language.

Marks made up of a combination of English and French are not usually subject to this section either. Only if the English or French component of the mark, on its own, is sufficiently descriptive then it will be subject to the section. However, merging of the two languages to produce a word or phrase incomprehensible in each language will not apply.
In Coca-Cola Co. v. Cliffstar Corp. (1993), 49 C.P.R. (3d) 358, a company tried to register the mark &quot;Le Juice&quot;, which the judge held was not identifiable in either language.

==== Character or Quality ====


==== Disclaiming ====
If part of a mark is found clearly descriptive then, by virtue of section 35, that part of the mark can be disclaimed from protection, leaving the rest of the mark protected. This, however, is not true of marks found deceptively misdescriptive.

=== Descriptive of Use ===
Under section 12(1)(c), marks, in any language, that are named in connection with the way the wares or services are intended to be used are not registerable.

=== Confusion ===
If a mark is suggestive of another mark there is a potential that the mark may be unregistrable. Marks that are &quot;confusingly similar&quot; to a registered or pending mark are unregistrable under section 12(1)(d). A similar mark depends on a number of factors including whether the mark has visual or auditory similarities, whether it suggests a similar idea, or whether they are used to market similar services or wares.

=== Prohibited Marks ===
Section 9(1) lists marks that are prohibited. Most of them are government related marks or are marks that must be protected for public policy reasons. 
These marks include:
*official government marks
*marks of the Royal Family
*badges and crests of the RCMP and Armed Forces
*emblems and names of the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and the United Nations;
* flags and symbols of other countries
* marks that are &quot;scandalous, obscene or immoral&quot;, 
* marks that &quot;falsely suggest a connection with any living individual&quot;
* portraits or signatures of individuals alive or dead within the last 30 years.

&quot;Prohibited marks have different requirements and are not obtained throught he same channels as the trade-marks discussed above.  Thus, a prohibited mark is not registered but is merely published in the ''Trade-marks Journal'' with a view to giving public notice of its adoption and use by the requesting party.  Moreover, unlike an application for a trade-mark, a request for publication of a prohibited mark is kept confidential until the date fo publication in the ''Trade-marks Journal''.&quot; (Page 2-7 Odutola on Canadian Trade-mark Practice)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once a mark has been registered, the owner or licensee of a registration can sue any other user of the mark for trade-mark infringement. The determination of infringement is found in sections 19, 20, and 22(1) of the Trade-mark Act. Unregistered marks can be actionable under the tort of passing off codified in section 7. 

Section 19 provides rights to owners of a mark against other users. The Act states:
:''19. Subject to sections 21, 32 and 67, the registration of a trade-mark in respect of any wares or services, unless shown to be invalid, gives to the owner of the trade-mark the exclusive right to the use throughout Canada of the trade-mark in respect of those wares or services.'' 
This section gives the owner the exclusive right to sue anyone who uses the identical mark for the sale of identical wares or services. Thus, three criteria must be met:
# the mark must be properly &quot;registered&quot; under section 18 of the Act.
# the mark must have been &quot;used&quot; by the infringer under section 4 of the Act.
# the mark must have been used for the sale of identical wares or services.

Section 20 expands the rights in section 19 to include confusing marks. The Act states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''20. (1) The right of the owner of a registered trade-mark to its exclusive use shall be deemed to be infringed by a person not entitled to its use under this Act who sells, distributes or advertises wares or services in association with a confusing trade-mark or trade-name, but no registration of a trade-mark prevents a person from making
:''(a) any bona fide use of his personal name as a trade-name, or
:''(b) any bona fide use, other than as a trade-mark,
::''(i) of the geographical name of his place of business, or
::''(ii) of any accurate description of the character or quality of his wares or services,&lt;br&gt;
''in such a manner as is not likely to have the effect of depreciating the value of the goodwill attaching to the trade-mark.&lt;br&gt;
''(2) No registration of a trade-mark prevents a person from making any use of any of the indications mentioned in subsection 11.18(3) in association with a wine or any of the indications mentioned in subsection 11.18(4) in association with a spirit.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 22(1) expands the rights in section 19 to include use of a mark that is not in relation to the sale of similar wares or services. The Act states:
:''22. (1) No person shall use a trade-mark registered by another person in a manner that is likely to have the effect of depreciating the value of the goodwill attaching thereto.''
This means that owners of a mark who have their goodwill indirectly harmed by another party can sue them for infringement.

The leading case on infringement is ''Clairol International Corp. v. Thomas Supply &amp; Equipment Ltd.'' (1968 Exchequer. Court). Clairol

Hi. I'm a potential author, about 2kyu, presiding over a club of about 15 players. So I'd be interested in creating some beginner material.

==GeneralGO==
I'm the one that wrote a big chunk of the current strategy section months ago (feel free to clean that up, btw), and dabbled in some other places.  I'm around a 5k AGA now.  Beginner stuff is great (I could definitely use it in my teaching), but it would also be good to have something that stronger players can learn from.

==Devildope==
I'm the first one to contribute to the Life and Death categories in this Wikibook.  I have contributed in other places as well and am a current member of Wikiproject Go. I am an amateur player around 12k KGS. I play online extensively under the alias of epiman89.  look for me in the beginner room at KGS.  ^_^ if there is anything that you would like to add to my sections on Life and Death, feel free to.  thx. --[[User:Devildope|Devildope]] 18:55, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

==topazg==
Likewise, I would be interested in authoring some material on here. I'm around 1 kyu EGF, and I will be more than happy to contribute to the beginner section and some elements of the intermediate section.

== DaoLin ==
I am interested to contribute and proofread/edit. 3d EGF

== Gabaux ==
I am not strong player mainly due to the fact I was not playing actually for a decade or so. I have resumed playing this September. I have a long-time experince to teach go (basically for beginners), and more of my pupils became later ardent and strong players. I am a regular contributor of the Hungarian gowiki.

==DonovanG==
I am by no means a strong player (14k KGS), but I will contribute all that I can to the beginner and intermediate sections. I hope this book will help spread go around :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Xcode expects to take a given set of files, as listed in your Groups &amp; Files pane and from them build a finished product or set of products such as an application, a framework, a library or a command line tool.

It's worth noting here that the items represented in this pane are of four types: files, directories, packages and groups. Files are just that, files of various types with extensions indicating the type, such as .java, .jpg, .gif, .html. Directories represent real directories somewhere in your file system and are represented with a blue folder icon. Package is a Mac OX X term for a directory of files and subdirectories that are to be recognized as a unit both by the Finder and by Xcode. They are often represented with an icon that is indistinguishable from a file icon. If Xcode isn't familiar with the kind of package represented, it displays them as blue folders. Groups are the strange items in this categorization and are pictured as yellow folders. THEY DON'T EXIST AT ALL in the file system. They are purely organizing entities for your use in Xcode. You can group files together in an Xcode Group in the Groups and Files pane that are actually distributed all over the file system of your computer. You use them in the Groups &amp; Files pane simply to group together those items of any of the four types just described that you feel are related somehow.

Getting back to Xcode's products, for a typical, simple, non-WebObjects project, the files would comprise Java or Objective C source files which would be compiled to intermediate object files and linked into a load module (for Objective C) or a .jar file (for Java) for execution. That file, created for execution is what I'm calling the product. An Xcode target is the set of files along with the instructions necessary to build such a product. It will be brought into existence by Xcode build processes.

The situation is complicated slightly in the case of WebObjects in that good practice suggests something called a &quot;split install&quot;. That is, for WebObjects projects, Xcode expects to build at least two products. One of these will be the WebObjects application which will be served by the application server. The other will be a package of static HTML pages, graphics files (.jpg and .gif files, among others) and other files that can be served directly by Apache as static resources.

The files that you add to the project must be identified as belonging to the building of one or the other of these two products. The third target, which carries the same name as your project, is something called an aggregate target. It's sole purpose is to group the other two targets into a single build operation by setting the dependencies such that the aggregate target depends on the other two. That way, by building the aggregate target, the other two targets will automatically be built together. However, you can also ask Xcode to build either of these other two targets individually.

Although you should have added the static files to your project so that they are included in the project directory, Xcode will build two packages, one for the application server and one for the web server and will either create (e.g. by compiling) or copy the appropriate files to the appropriate package. If your project were named &quot;MyProject&quot; and were built for deployment on Mac OS X, these packages would have the following structures:

For the application server:

  MyProject.woa
    MyProject - a Unix shell script to which control is initially passed and which sets up the execution environment under Unix
    MyProject.CMD - a DOS command script to which control is initially passed and which sets up the execution environment under DOS/Windows
    WOBootstrap.jar - a jar file containing a single class called JavaArchiveFilter that implements the java.io.FilenameFilter interface
    Contents - a directory containing all of the files necessary to support the execution of the WO app
         Info.plist - a property list file for the application
        MacOS/
            MyProject - a Unix shell script identical to that of the same name at the top level of the project directory
            MacOSClassPath.txt - text file containing the derived Java ClassPath for the project
        PkgInfo - a text file containing the four letter package type (APPL = application) and the application's four letter file types
        Resources/ - a directory containing the WOComponents and other resources in the Resources group of the Groups &amp; Files pane
        UNIX/ - a directory similar to the MacOS directory but used for deployment on Unix systems
        Windows/ - a directory similar to the MacOS directory but used for deployment on Windows systems
        pbdevelopment.plist - an XML file with a single element whose key is PBXProjectSourcePath and whose value is implied by the name.

For the Web Server:

  MyProject.woa

Although the packages are very different, they are identically named, have similar structures and are merged in development. They are typically ONLY separated like this for a split install. You typically put the application server package in /Library/WebObjects/Applications (or a local equivalent) and you typically put the WebServer package in /Library/WebServer/Documents/WebObjects.

You can create these packages independently in various ways. I've found it easier, recently (because of various examples of Xcode intransigence) to simply build the project as I would for development and physically separate the two for deployment. Other people have various incantations to make a split install work reliably and I'm sure they will chime in here.

&lt;p&gt;Fluency shaping stuttering therapy was developed before much was known about [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control|motor learning and control]]. Some speech clinics have not refined their therapy programs to reflect advances in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

==Improving Cognitive Stage Speech Motor Learning==

&lt;p&gt;In the first or &lt;i&gt;cognitive&lt;/i&gt; stage of [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control#Three Stages of Motor Learning| motor learning]], you observe an instructor perform a motor skill that is new to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But speech-language pathologists may be the wrong people to model fluent speech motor skills. When learning a new motor skill, novices learn best by observing another novice making mistakes, then getting it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, observing a skilled person perform the task flawlessly doesn't do you much good. For example, millions of people watch Michael Jordan play basketball. Few of those people could go out on a basketball court and repeat his moves. The exceptions are people who are already skilled and want to get even better, e.g., college basketball players can improve their game by watching the pros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stutterer watching a speech-language pathologist model gentle onsets or pull-outs or whatever is like Joe Sixpack watching Micheal Jordan. The stutterer might learn more if the speech-language pathologist modeled the &lt;i&gt;mistakes&lt;/i&gt; her other clients have made, e.g., two-second stretched words instead of two-second stretched vowels, and then showed how to correct those mistakes. Or the speech-language pathologist could prepare a video of her previous clients making mistakes, and then learning to correct their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

==Improving Associative Stage Speech Motor Learning==

&lt;p&gt;In the second or &lt;i&gt;associative&lt;/i&gt; stage of [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control#Three Stages of Motor Learning| motor learning]], you learn to perform and refine a new motor skill. But are there better fluent speech motor skills than the five (or seven) skills taught in fluency shaping stuttering therapy programs?&lt;/p&gt;

===Lower Vocal Pitch===

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a lower vocal pitch requires relaxing one's vocal folds, and reduces stuttering.{{ref|Ramig}} Unlike other fluency-enhancing techniques such as a slow speaking rate or gentle onsets, listeners like the sound of a lower vocal pitch. A lower vocal pitch communicates confidence and relaxed authority. Some listeners even say that a lower vocal pitch sounds &quot;sexy.&quot; Speaking with a lower vocal pitch makes one feel relaxed and confident. Yet this technique is not a target behavior in any fluency shaping stuttering therapy program.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to multichannel processing theory, performing two different tasks is easier if you can integrate the tasks. E.g., dancing while playing the saxophone is easier than playing tennis while playing the sax. Using fluency shaping motor skills while paying attention to a conversation should be easier if the fluency shaping motor skills relate to the conversation. E.g., if your friend asks you what you've learned in stuttering therapy, and you reply that you learned slow speech with stretched vowels and gentle onsets, you can easily perform slow speech with stretched vowels and gentle onsets while responding. If you're trying to communicate that you're relaxed and confident, then using a &quot;slow normal&quot; speaking rate with a lower vocal pitch should be easier than using gentle onsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique can be trained by using relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing while feeling (with your fingers or your throat) and/or listening to your vocal fold vibrations. Begin by humming or saying &quot;ahhhh.&quot; Bring the pitch up, then down, then up again, then down further. Repeat until your feel and hear yourself humming at a very low pitch. Now speak slowly, stretching vowels, while keeping your vocal pitch low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that your vocal volume drops as you lower your vocal pitch. Don't try to speak loudly with a low vocal pitch, you may damage your vocal folds. A lower vocal volume is usually acceptable unless you're speaking in a noisy environment or to a person with hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Anti-Stuttering Devices#Frequency-shifted Auditory Feedback|Frequency-shifted auditory feedback]] (FAF) induces a lower vocal pitch in non-stutterers.{{ref|Elman1981}} Only one study tested whether FAF changes stutterers' vocal pitch, with negative results.{{ref|Natke2001}} However, anecdotal evidence suggests that a lower FAF setting than was used in the study induces a lower vocal pitch in stutterers. If you have an FAF device, set it for one-half or one octave down, and use the best-quality headphones you have. Then say &quot;ahhhh&quot; or speak slowly with stretched vowels, trying to slow your vocal fold vibrations to match the frequency you hear in the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower vocal pitch may be difficult for women speech-language pathologists to model, or for children or women stutterers to use ([[w:Lauren Bacall#The Breakthrough|Lauren Bacall]] might contradict that statement!). Adult men are more capable of lowering their vocal pitch. Listen to an audio book read by a male actor and then listen to another audio book read by a female actor: you'll likely hear that the male actor can perform a wider variety and range of character voices.&lt;/p&gt;

==Improving Autonomous Stage Speech Motor Learning==
&lt;p&gt;The third or &lt;i&gt;autonomous&lt;/i&gt; stage of [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control#Three Stages of Motor Learning| motor learning]] moves you from closed-loop motor control to open-loop motor control. In stuttering therapy, the autonomous stage makes fluent speech automatic and effortless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous stage motor learning results from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Practicing target muscle movements &lt;i&gt;faster&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;harder&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;While making &lt;i&gt;no errors,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In &lt;i&gt;stressful&lt;/i&gt; situations,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;With an ideal &lt;i&gt;practice schedule&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For about three million &lt;i&gt;repetitions&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you take tennis lessons. Your coach shows you how to grip the racket properly, and swing at the ball. At first you execute this movement slowly, with little force. As your skill improves, you swing faster, and hit the ball harder. Whenever you make a mistake, your coach stops you and makes you begin again, slowly. At first your coach hits you easy balls. Then he hits harder balls to you, making the game stressful. Then you play tennis regularly. Over several years your game improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where Stuttering Therapy Fails&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Most stuttering therapy programs do little to train autonomous motor learning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your speech-language pathologist tells you to make a conscious effort to speak fluently. You're told that if your fluency fails, it's your fault for not concentrating on your speech.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All practice is done with relaxed speech-production muscles. You never increase muscle tension.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All practice is done at slow speaking rates.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All practice is done in the speech clinic, or at home alone. You don't do practice in high-stress situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Increasing Force and Speed&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering therapy programs fail to train the autonomous stage of speech motor learning because of a counterintuitive aspect of stuttering. Stuttering is characterized by excessive speech-production muscle activity. The obvious but wrong treatment for stuttering is to reduce speech-production muscle activity, i.e., to speak with relaxed breathing, vocal folds, and articulation muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Open- and Closed-Loop Speech Motor Control#Snake Oil and Charlatans|As noted earlier]], speech-language pathologists see that slowing down and switching to closed-loop speech motor control eliminates stuttering. They reach the obvious but wrong conclusion that stutterers must slow their speaking rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluency shaping therapy begins by training slow, relaxed, fluent speech motor skills. Similarly, golf and tennis instruction begins with slow, relaxed, correct movements. Golf and tennis instructors then have you increase your force and speed. In contrast, speech-language pathologists tell you not to increase your force and speed. It may seem counterintuitive, but after you master slow, relaxed fluent speech, you must increase both the speed and force of your speech, without making errors, to train automatic, effortless fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Increasing Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force of your speech is indicated by volume. Work on getting loud. But don't shout or yell. Instead, &lt;i&gt;project&lt;/i&gt; your voice. Vocal volume is a factor of both exhalation volume and vocal fold tension. Increase your exhalation volume while keeping your vocal folds relatively relaxed. This result is high volume with the intonations of normal conversational speech. Stage actors do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increase your onset speed while maintaining long syllable duration. Pretend that your forearm is a sports car's accelerator. When your fist is up, your vocal volume is quiet. As you push your fist down, your volume increases. When your fist is all the way down, you're at maximum volume. Listeners one hundred feet away can hear you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly lower your fist to produce a gentle onset. Then slam your fist down fast to go from silence to maximum volume. Then hold that volume while stretching the vowel. Pull your fist up fast to end the word with speed. This is slow speech with maximum effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to damage your vocal folds. Stop if you feel hoarse or start to lose your voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Increasing Speed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorten syllable duration from two seconds, to one second, to one-half second, to one-quarter second. Practice this both with relaxed, quiet speech, and with loud, forceful speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the practice [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Practice Word Lists|word lists]] say each word four times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slow and relaxed (quietly).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slow and projecting your voice (loudly).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Relaxed (quietly) with a quick onset.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Loudly projecting the word with a hard onset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where to Practice Force and Speed&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;It's hard to practice loud speech in a small room. The ideal place to practice is an empty auditorium. Have your speech-language pathologist sit in the back row. Stand on stage and project your voice to her. She yells, &amp;quot;Can't hear you!&amp;quot; until you reach ideal volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another place to practice is near a building that produces an echo. A third place to practice is on a freeway overpass. [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Famous People Who Stutter/In the Ancient World#Demosthenes, Orator|Demosthenes]], the stutterer who became the greatest orator of ancient Greece, projected his voice over breaking waves at the seashore. Work on projecting your voice over the cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reinforcing On-Target Speech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing speed and force &lt;i&gt;myelinates&lt;/i&gt; or reinforces neural pathways in your brain. A mistake reinforces the wrong neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to talk fluently requires talking fluently 100% of the time. That sounds like circular advice, and it is. Reinforcing motor skills is a &amp;quot;virtuous cycle.&amp;quot; Using target skills reinforces the skills, making the skills easier to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, stuttering reinforces undesirable speech motor skills ([[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/What Is Stuttering?#Core Behaviors|core behaviors]]) and bad communication habits ([[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/What Is Stuttering?#Secondary Behaviors|secondary behaviors]]). Stuttering sets up a &amp;quot;vicious cycle&amp;quot; instead of a &amp;quot;virtuous cycle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Swimming Analogy&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to improve my swimming. At first I could swim only one length of the pool. But I got in that pool three times a week. I found that a flotation device helped me swim five or ten laps. After two months something &amp;quot;clicked&amp;quot; in my brain and I swam half a mile. It was easy, almost effortless. I didn't need the flotation device any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I moved to a building without a swimming pool, stopped swimming, and now I swim as poorly as I did before that summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, stutterers go to speech therapy three times a week for months. Then suddenly one day they find themselves talking fluently, without effort. If they discontinue speech therapy, this &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; fluency disappears and they go back to stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stutterers' brains have [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress/Stuttering Reduces Stress|two sets of speech motor programs]]. Sometimes our brains pick the fluent speech motor programs. At other times our brains pick the stuttering speech motor programs. Speech therapy reinforces the fluent speech motor programs. Eventually this fluent speech becomes habitual. But during &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; fluency this habit is precariously balanced. One stressful day, in which you allow yourself to stutter, can reinforce the stuttering motor programs, and your &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; fluency is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Speech Buddies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children learn grammar by listening to other people talking, then speaking, then having their parents correct their grammar. You may not remember this, but after a family vacation to the seashore you told your mother's friend, &amp;quot;We went nearly to the beach every day,&amp;quot; and your mother corrected you, &amp;quot;No, dear, we went to the beach nearly every day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mom was your speech buddy. You need another speech buddy now, to correct your speech when you're dysfluent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask your speech-language pathologist to let you organize a practice group with her other clients. Meet once a week to practice fluent speech. Exchange telephone numbers and arrange to call a speech buddy every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an idea that'll get you talking fluently. If you have a spare bedroom in your house, call a local university and offer to let a speech-language pathology student live rent-free, in return for reminding you to use fluency shaping skills. If you don't have a university with a communication sciences department, call your school district and see if they have a speech-language pathologist who'd go for free rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train your spouse, housemates, and the people you work with to remind you to use fluency skills. If you're a parent with a child in speech therapy, ask your child's speech-language pathologist to train you to correct your child at home (see [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Stuttering Therapy Long-Term (In)Effectiveness#SLPs vs. Parents vs. Computers|SLPs vs. Parents vs. Computers]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your spouse can come with you to speech therapy, or you can tell her what you're learning. You can tell your housemates or co-workers. But there's a problem. Suppose you wear a sign offering to pay $1 whenever a listener hears you stutter. Listeners are too polite to do that. They'd feel like they were getting paid to kick a paraplegic in his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can't wear a sign around your neck offering to pay $1 whenever anyone catches you doing a hard onset, or using thoracic breathing. No one but a speech-language pathologist knows what those behaviors are. Non-stutterers have no idea what they do to speak fluently. They don't know how to correct you or tell you what you did wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My Romantic Disaster of 1996&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In eighth grade I had a teacher with a forceful personality and a large ego. He decided to cure my stuttering. Whenever I stuttered he stopped me, then told me to say it without stuttering. I hadn't had speech therapy and had no idea what to do. His method was as effective as teaching me Chinese by stopping me from speaking English and telling me to speak in Chinese. Twenty years later I'd completed several speech therapy programs. I dated a young woman who disliked my stuttering. Whenever I started to block, she'd give me a certain look. I'd stop, relax my breathing and vocal folds, and speak fluently. Within a few days with her I was talking fluently all the time. The relationship crashed and burned shortly after that.&lt;/i&gt;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 05:13, 28 March 2006 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an individual who hasn't completed a speech therapy program, a person pointing out their stuttering is the worst thing. Such an individual doesn't have any control over his speech. Telling him to talk fluently increases his stress and his stuttering. (See the section [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood Stuttering/Pre-School Stuttering#Modeling|Modeling]].)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for an individual who has mastered fluent speech skills, pointing out his disfluencies and reminding him to use fluent speech skills will help him. When you're at that stage, find someone to do this for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or pay listeners $1 whenever you stutter. I tried this and never stuttered. I'm not sure if that was a success or a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Start a Virtuous Cycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do whatever you need to get into the virtuous cycle. You may have to do things that are difficult or embarrassing&amp;#151;e.g., telling your co-workers that you stutter (hint: they've probably already figured that out!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you're in the virtuous cycle, fluent speech will become easier and easier with less and less effort. The difficult things will become easier, and the embarrassing things won't be embarrassing (or necessary). Done right, you'll only have to do these things for a few days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting into the virtuous cycle may require:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Using closed-loop speech motor control (very slow speech).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Using an electronic anti-stuttering device.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Taking a dopamine-antagonist medication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Talking in uncomfortable situations, e.g., to strangers or to telemarketers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a high-testosterone kickstart, see [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress/Speech-Related Fears and Anxieties#The Predator Approach|The Predator Approach]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Practicing Under Stress&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous motor learning requires practicing a new motor skill in stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design a hierarchy of stressful situations. The first might be leaving a message on your speech-language pathologist's answering machine. When you can do that comfortably and fluently, you might talk to telemarketers using closed-loop speech motor control (slow, fluent speech). Then you could join Toastmasters and make a series of speeches to your club. More about this in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress/Speech-Related Fears and Anxieties#Make a Stress Hierarchy|Speech-Related Fears and Anxieties]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Practice Scheduling&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The United States Postal Service studied workers learning to type on mail-sorting machines (similar to typewriters). All subjects received 60 hours of training. The scheduling varied between four groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One group had two two-hour sessions per day, for 15 days. A second group had one two-hour session per day, for 30 days. A third group had two one-hour sessions per day, for 30 days. The fourth group had one one-hour session per day, for 60 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first group (two two-hour sessions per day) learned fastest, but in the long run had the worst performance. The fourth group (one one-hour session per day) took the longest to get &amp;quot;up to speed,&amp;quot; but eventually had the best performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the postal workers preferred the two-hour/two-session schedule, even though they had the worst performance. People are impatient. They don't want to spend 60 days learning something, if they think there's a 15-day shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Extinguishing Maladaptive Motor Skills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could simplistically conclude that you should practice stuttering therapy no more than one hour per day. But there's an essential difference between speech therapy and mail sorting. The postal workers were learning a new motor skill. Stutterers have to learn a new motor skill and &lt;i&gt;extinguish&lt;/i&gt; an old motor skill. As noted earlier, coaches often prefer to work with individuals who have never played a sport and haven't learned bad habits, rather than work with experienced athletes and have to break their bad habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extinguish an old motor skill you must stop doing it. Perhaps the ideal stuttering therapy is done one hour per day, and then you take a vow of silence the rest of the day. But that's unrealistic. To burn new fluent neural pathways, and extinguish old stuttering neural pathways, you must use fluent speech every time you talk. You must never stutter. Each disfluency weakens your new fluent neural pathways and strengthens your old stuttering neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extinguishing a maladaptive motor skill isn't the same as &quot;breaking&quot; a bad habit. Maladaptive motor skills enable you to perform a desirable behavior, but not as a well as another motor skill. E.g., touchtyping is better than two-fingered typing, but two-fingered typing also gets the job done. In contrast, picking my nose is an undesirable behavior. I wish that a teacher had taught me to touchtype when I was a child. I don't wish that a teacher had taught me a better way to pick my nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because maladaptive motor skills enable you to perform a desirable behavior, it's hard to unlearn them and replace them with optimal motor skills. Stuttering isn't like picking your nose. Your mother could slap your hand and stop you whenever you pick your nose. If she stopped you every time you stuttered, you wouldn't be able to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extinguishing a maladaptive motor skill may involve &quot;one step forward, one step back&quot; temporarily. To speak fluently, you may have to speak much slower, or not respond immediately while you focus on your speech motor skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Intensive Residential Speech Therapy Programs&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Some stutterers go to intensive residential speech therapy programs. These programs typically last three weeks. You're surrounded by speech-language pathologists and other stutterers, and isolated from the real world. For the first two weeks, you use two-second stretch all the time. In the third week, you move to one-second stretch, then half-second, and finally quarter-second slow normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intensive residential speech therapy programs are like the postal workers who did the &amp;quot;short cut&amp;quot; training. In three weeks of intensive therapy you learned to talk fluently. But many stutterers find that long-term results are disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Your Ideal Practice Schedule&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Work with your speech-language pathologist to develop a practice schedule. A severe stutterer may have to spend many hours a day doing &amp;quot;homework.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't practice sitting alone in a room reading endless word lists. This isn't going to produce carryover fluency to stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A one-hour daily practice could have the following three elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;After breakfast, twenty minutes of high intensity (using projection and hard onsets) practice, using [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Practice Word Lists|practice word lists]].&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;During the day, a stressful twenty-minute session while using a biofeedback device to keep your vocal folds relaxed. This could be calling strangers for your job.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;After supper, twenty minutes of very slow closed-loop speech motor control conversation. You could call another stutterer in your support group. Or you could talk to telemarketers or call infomercial toll-free numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How Long Does Autonomous Learning Take?&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Gymnasts practice daily for about eight years to become proficient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motor learning researchers studied the manual (hand) skills of cigar-makers. Beginner cigar-makers worked three times slower than experienced cigar-makers. Becoming fully skilled required making three million cigars.{{ref|Kottke1978}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three million repetitions were also needed for Japanese pearl handlers to become proficient. The Suzuki method of teaching violin to children requires the production of about 2.5 million notes. Basketball, football, and baseball throws require about a million practice throws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that making fluent speech automatic and effortless requires saying about three million syllables. At five syllables per second, talking four hours a day (just your time talking, not combined talking and listening), you could produce three million syllables in six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got a job answering telephone calls, and you did your stuttering therapy skills on every call, and you connected a biofeedback device into your telephone to alert you when you missed a therapy target, and you spent your free time at Toastmasters clubs making speeches or volunteering at a hospital's information desk, fluent speech might become automatic for you in six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most stutterers practice between ten minutes and one hour per day. If they were silent the rest of the day, they'd say three million syllables somewhere between six months and three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one has studied whether using undesirable motor skills cancels out on-target practice. I.e., does a half-hour of on-target practice get cancelled out by not using fluency skills the rest of the day? Such a practice schedule might take years to produce automatic fluent speech&amp;#151;or might never work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;The [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control#Three Stages of Motor Learning|associative stage]] of motor learning requires feedback. In sports this is called &lt;i&gt;knowledge of results&lt;/i&gt;. E.g., in golf or tennis you see where the ball goes after you hit it. Playing golf or tennis on a dark, foggy night would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback quality is affected by &lt;i&gt;speed&lt;/i&gt;. If you hit ten golf balls on a dark, foggy night, then the next day find one of the balls 150 yards away, you'll have no memory of what you did right to hit it so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback quality is also affected by &lt;i&gt;accuracy&lt;/i&gt;. If you and your buddy each hit a golf ball, and one ball goes 150 yards but you don't know whose ball it was, you have inaccurate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the observer gets bored. If you hit golf balls for hours, and have a person telling you how far the balls go, sooner or later the person will stop paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

===Which Fluency Skills Need Feedback?===

&lt;p&gt;When you're learning fluent speech motor skills, you need knowledge of results. Some skills are easy to observe. E.g., resting your hand on your stomach tells you whether you're using diaphragmatic (relaxed) breathing or thoracic (speech) breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your articulators (lips, jaw, and tongue) are a little harder to be aware of, as you can't see them. But you have good proprioceptive awareness of these muscles, so developing awareness and control isn't hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your vocal folds are another story. These muscles are deep in your throat. You can't touch them or see them. Most people don't even know they have vocal folds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult feedback is with the timing of all this. E.g., your speech-language pathologist tells you to exhale a little air and then increase your vocal fold tension. You do this slowly and correctly. Then she tells you to increase the speed. You must execute these movements within hundredths of a second. You can't tell whether you're doing it right, and most speech-language pathologists can't either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fluency specialist who's helped hundreds of stutterers has better-trained ear and visual skills and gives better quality of feedback than a speech-language pathologist who's never treated a stutterer.&lt;/p&gt;

==Biofeedback Devices==

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biofeedback&lt;/i&gt; is the measurement and display (to the user) of a physiological activity, to enable the user to improve awareness and control of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biofeedback machines provide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster, more precise, and more reliable feedback than a human observer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machines can provide feedback in real-time, beeping the instant you make a mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machines can accurately measure things humans can't see or hear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And machines never get bored, even after hours of practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the computer training the physical speech motor skills, the speech pathologist can spend more time on the psychological aspects of stuttering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you learn visually rather than aurally, you may learn faster with the computer displays than by listening to your speech on a tape recorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some devices are designed for home practice use as well as clinical use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But biofeedback devices aren't a &amp;quot;miracle cure&amp;quot; for stuttering. Stuttering therapy works on many motor skills, so you might need several devices. And you still need a speech-language pathologist to train you to do the target motor skills (cognitive stage). The machines can only help you to refine your skills (associative stage).&lt;/p&gt;

===CAFET and Dr. Fluency===

&lt;p&gt;The Computer-Aided Fluency Establishment and Trainer (CAFET) and Dr. Fluency are computer-based stuttering biofeedback systems. Both use a microphone to monitor vocal volume, as a surrogate for vocal fold activity, and a chest strap to monitor breathing. Dr. Fluency uses two chest straps, to differentiate diaphragmatic (relaxed) breathing from thoracic (upper chest) breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see your breathing and vocal volume displayed on the computer screen, along with instructions or error messages. The two computer systems train similar speech motor skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Continuous breathing. The computer alerts you if you hold your breath more than 1/3 of a second.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gradual exhalation, as opposed to the rapid, uncontrolled exhalation associated with stuttering.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pre-voice exhalation, or letting a little air out before you begin tensing your vocal folds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gentle onset, or gradually increase vocal volume. The computer alerts you if your vocal volume changes too rapidly. The computer also alerts you if your voice is too quiet for your air flow (which sounds breathy).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Continuous phonation. Breaks in vocal volume are shown on the computer monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adequate breath support. The computer alerts you if you continue to talk after the point at which you should take another breath.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Phrasing. Each of the above seven speech targets is taught first with vowels, then progressing to monosyllabic words, then to marked-length phrases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unpublished study of the CAFET program with 197 adults and teenagers reported that 82% met fluency criteria six months after completing the program; 89% were fluent after twelve months; and 92% were fluent two years post-therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

===Electromyography (EMG)===

&lt;p&gt;EMG measures muscle activity via electrodes taped to your skin. Several studies found EMG to be effective for treating stuttering.{{ref|Craig1982}} These include the large [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/School-Age Stuttering#SLPs vs. Parents vs. Computers|study]] that found computers to be more effective than speech-language pathologists.{{ref|Craig1996}} {{ref|Hancock1998}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMG surface electrodes tape to your skin. They are excellent for monitoring your masseter (jaw muscle) or orbicular oris (lips); pretty good for monitoring your tongue or respiration muscles; and useless for monitoring your vocal folds. Your vocal folds are deep in your neck, surrounded by other muscles. A single channel EMG is usually set up with one electrode on the jaw and the other electrode at the base of the throat, which monitors all muscle activity from thoracic respiration to articulation. This set-up monitors all speech-production muscles (including vocal fold activity) at once. When the red light goes on (indicating high muscle activity) it may not be apparent which muscle is tense. Also smiling and swallowing are indicated as high muscle activity. These problems could be avoided by using a multichannel EMG, but those are costly and time-consuming to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

===Vocal Frequency Biofeedback===

&lt;p&gt;The CAFET and Dr. Fluency monitor vocal fold activity indirectly via vocal volume, which assumes that a quiet voice means relaxed vocal folds, and loud voice means tense vocal folds. Another method is to monitor the frequencies of the stutterer's voice. Relaxed vocal folds generally produce a deep-pitched voice; tense vocal folds generally produce a high-pitched voice. Vocal volume and vocal frequency biofeedback use a microphone; no electrodes are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kay Elemetrics' Visi-Pitch device monitors both vocal volume and vocal frequency, seperately. 
Casa Futura Technologies has devices that monitor a combination of vocal volume and frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most important therapeutic things we do as physicians is to affect the patients attitude about their problem. For example, if the patient presents with a painful complaint and we provide a diagnosis and more importantly a prognosis, the patient experiences a significant change in their experience of the pain without the physician actually doing a thing. In particular what is removed is the unchecked anxiety that accompanies the experience of pain especially pain of unknown source. Even pain of known source however can produce anxiety enough, specifically anxiety about how bad and how long. With the worst of the anxiety removed there is an opportunity to engage the patient in the process of improving their condition.

There is something of the original shamanistic symbolic exchanges which seems to happen with every day patient encounters in the office practice. Shamans and traditional healers seem to employ a strategy of symbolic exchange whereby a totem of object, an herb , an mark on the body, is delivered to the patient and the problem, the disease is removed. This basic exchange paradigm seems to be at work in our offices, whereby a successful encounter is judged by whether or not such an exchange has taken place, regardless really as to the efficacy of what was presented to the patient in exchange for their problem. The use of antibiotics for viral illnesses is just one example.

The therapeutic effect of laying on of hands can constitute a symbolic therapeutic exchange. It is conceivable that many techniques osteopathic and chiropractic techniques may work in this way even if they do not impart a physical change to the patient by virtue of the method, just the laying on on hands in a ritualistic process can succeed as a therapeutic exchange. This is not to say that what is offered to the patient is entirely arbitrary. The object of exchange must have certain attributes, but actual efficacy is not necessarily required. What is equally important is that the patient believes the item of exchange will allow the patient to leave behind the problem they came in with. The placebo effect then looms large in any patient encounter and extends well beyond what we provide in pill form.

It is not surprising then that you can talk to a patient on a rational level, offering in essence information, certainly from the point of view useful information, even powerful information to the patient, and yet, from the patient's point of view, the encounter with you the physician is unsatisfactory. Is this a failure to communicate or is the problem that the patient did not really come so much for information as for some other purpose, some sort of healing magic. We tend to assume that something is wrong in the manner of delivery, perhaps overestimating the patients ability to absorb all that is said, perhaps insufficient metaphorical power, talking too fast, failing ot verify the understanding or simply limitations upon what a patient can recall 5 minutes after the encounter.

Communication is a process.  When we consider this process we tend to emphasize the role of the provider of information rather than the role played by the target in the process.  Without the participation of the target there is no communication but only utterances. Much of what we think of as communication in our offices consists of utterances on our part.  An example would be the notion of informed consent.  When studied it is evident that in the case of a complex medical decision the patient actually understands what he is consenting to only 17% of the time.  Improving upon this while maintaining some efficiency in the process will be aided by simplifying our information making it understandable in terms which reflect the life experiences of the patient rather than jargon filled information requiring a life experience includes a working knowledge of physiology and anatomy which is likely lacking in our patients.  

An understanding of the information needs of our patients and the hierarchy of those needs based on their circumstance is helpful in delivering the information when it is relevant to the immediate needs of the patient at any particular time in the process.  As an example, a patient in acute pain with a fracture dislocation of the wrist has need of coping information which relates to what is immediately to be done to relieve the pain and correct the severe deformity.  Leave discussions as to the length of recovery the nuances of anatomy and such for later.

It may make more sense to keep the information as simple as possible rather that showboating the depth and sophistication of our understanding as to the complex interplay of anatomy and physiology and disease. If we spend the whole encounter this way the patient is liable to feel dissatisfied. We would be better off to ensure first that a human to human connection has been made, and then set about the process of providing a conceptual framework just sufficient to allow the patient to segregate themselves from their problem. This is the power of a diagnosis, no matter how nebulous, no matter how accurate in many cases. The encounter then moves on to seek to validate what has been said verbally and to enable the patient to potentially leave their problem behind, at least in part. It takes more than just voluminous information dump.

How can a diagnostic process such as a physical exam alone be therapeutic? The answer perhaps is that the process, narrows the scope of the problem for the patient. Conceptually a mysterious entity that the patient arrives with becomes, a spur or a bursa or whatever else the exam allows for the physician to apply as a specific name for the problem. The problem is then objectified, segregated and seems all together closer to being eliminated simply by this process.


This concept presumes an attitude toward disease which most of us in western culture hold to which is that when we have an affilction we have some &quot;thing&quot;. We objectify the problem, compartimentalize it and separate it from us, as something separate from &quot;us&quot;. This follows from the fact that since Descartes we have a body, rather than we are a body, tends to be how we think of things. We tend to approach our health problems in this dualistic way. The enlightenment philosophy which leads to the science which leads to the technology tends to fall short when the problem is an undesirable emotional state, wherein it becomes difficult to separate the problem from the self. Obviously if you cannot separate the problem from the self it is difficult to leave the problem behind.

There is logic then in the notion of conceptualizing problems of this sort, behavioral, psychiatric, as the patient being possessed by an intrusive entity, a malefactor to be extricated. The symbolic exchange of the therapeutic encounter is one strategy to accomplish this extrication. Even the somatic problems which lend themselves to the heuristic approach which objectifies the problem then extricates it fail in accomplishing the same success in resolving that aspect of the problem which cannot be readily extricated, and that remains a part of the self, be it, the emotional imprint of the traumatic experience, or the seemless interaction of intent and function with which we customarily interface with our bodies, consider here the loss of physical capacity of a parkinsons patient struggling to consciously do what for all of their life has flowed effortlessly. Consider too the impact of body image which a post surgical patient or traumatically deformed patient must reestablish to once again feel fully integrated. Until this reintegration is accomplished our results fall short of establishing wellness even if they have successfully healed the problem, and the patient is no longer really sick.

The encounter between a healer and a patient then is characterized here as an interaction which alters the relationship between a patient and the disease process they are dealing with. The healer is a helpful ally, but the primary conflict is between patient and disease. What we call a change in attitude on the part of the patient may appear to have psychological benefit, might be characterized as a placebo effect, but one day we may understand the net effect to be more substantive than that as the manner in which changes in central nervous system function influences metabolic immunologic hemodynamic or other processes within the body in a way which can favor resolution of the problem.

Communication is most likely to occur when utterances (information) are delivered when a patient is about to encounter a transition point in the process of their care and when that information is of immediate practical use in negotiating that transition. All clinicians develop efficient litanies of information that dispel immediate confusion and then adumbrate the future course of treatment to begin the process of dispelling the penumbra in which the patient and family find themselves as they work through the system, and the injury or disease process.

While beginning an incision following a bier block the patient states that he can feel you working.  You ask for the local and inject to achieve a digital block and soon can proceed with appropriate patient comfort.  The procedure complete the splint applied the tourniquet comes down, and low and behold the finger stays white.

This is not the right time to check the bottle, but alas as our assiduous adherence to the trust now one habits of residency slide we ask to see the bottle and note the red label marcaine with epinephrine. The nurse stares blankly as you ask her to fill out an incident report.  Another nurse checks the card which indeed calls for plain marcaine.

The finger still pale sorry looking, accusatory, the adjacent fingers mocking in their robust post tourniquet rubror and pulchritudinous splendor. The mind ponders the best approach applying a dab of nitropaste, injecting a bit of papaverine and submerging the finger in warm water as the patient snores away sedated fortunately oblivious to the precarious state of his finger. Finally pink the pulp regains turgor and a bullet dodged.

We return alas to old habits and ask next time to be shown the bottle prior to injecting.

      <comment>/* SQL Code */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

MySQL is a relational database. In a relational database, data is stored as a collection of fields called a row. Like fields, rows are in turn collectively stored as a table. Tables are stored collectively in a database. One MySQL server can store multiple databases, and have users who have various rights to each database.

Nowadays, MySQL is the one of the most popular relational database among others as it is simple, free (open source), easy to maintain, and cost effective.

In order to store data into MySQL, we will need to prepare a space in MySQL for a database.

== SQL Code ==

The code for creating such a database in SQL (Structured Query Language) is a simple query :
&lt;br&gt;
 mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE `database_name`;

(Without the ' ' single quotes around the database name)

== Using the Database ==

After a database has been created, you have to tell MySQL that to make it the active database before you can start running further queries on it. You do this as follows :

 mysql&gt; USE `database_name`;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before creating a table, please read the previous section on [[../Creating a Database/]].

A Table resides inside a database. Tables contain rows, which are made up of a collection of common fields or columns. Here is a sample output for a SELECT * query :

 mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM `books`;
 +------------+--------------+------------------------------+------+
 | ISBN       | Author       | Title                        | Year |
 +------------+--------------+------------------------------+------+
 | 1234567890 | Poisson, R.W | Programming PHP and MySQL    | 2006 |
 | 5946253158 | Wilson, M    | Java Secrets                 | 2005 |
 | 8529637410 | Moritz, R    | C from Beginners to Advanced | 2001 |
 +------------+--------------+------------------------------+------+

As you can see, We have rows (horizontal collection of fields), as well as columns (the vertical attributes and values).

== Creating a Table ==

The SQL code for creating a table is as follows :

 mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE `table_name` (
        `field1` type NOT NULL|NULL default 'default_value',
        `field2` type NOT NULL|NULL default 'default_value',
        ...
        );

== Example ==

Here is an example of creating a table called `books` :

 mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE `books` (
        `ISBN` varchar(35) NOT NULL default '',
        `Author` varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
        `Title` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
        `Year` int(11) NOT NULL default '2000'
        );

== Getting Information about Tables ==

To get a list of tables :

 mysql&gt; SHOW TABLES;

Which produces the following output :

 +-------------------+
 | Tables_in_library |
 +-------------------+
 | books             |
 +-------------------+
 1 row in set (0.19 sec)

To show the CREATE query used to create the table :

 mysql&gt; SHOW CREATE TABLE `books`;

Which produces the following output : 

 +-------+--------------------------------------------+ 
 | Table | Create Table 
 +-------+--------------------------------------------+
 | books | CREATE TABLE `books` (
   `ISBN` varchar(35) NOT NULL default '',
   `Author` varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
   `Title` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
   `Year` int(11) NOT NULL default '2000'
 ) TYPE=MyISAM |
 +-------+--------------------------------------------+
 1 row in set (0.05 sec)

And then to show the same information, in a tabulated format :

 mysql&gt; DESCRIBE `books`;

Which produces the following output : 

 +--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
 | Field  | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
 +--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
 | ISBN   | varchar(35)  |      |     |         |       |
 | Author | varchar(50)  |      |     |         |       |
 | Title  | varchar(255) |      |     |         |       |
 | Year   | int(11)      |      |     | 2000    |       |
 +--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
 4 rows in set (0.18 sec)

      <comment>/* DELETE */  Corrected ISBN</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Here are a few basic queries to get you going. For more detailed information, have a look at the online documentation on the MySQL website http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/index.html .

== SELECT ==

The SELECT query is the standard means by which to retrieve information from the database. The syntax for the SELECT query is as follows:

 mysql&gt; SELECT field1, field2, ... 
        FROM table_name
        [WHERE condition1
             AND condition2
             ...
        [ORDER BY field1, field2, etc...]
        [LIMIT number]];

Example : 

 mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM books;
 
 mysql&gt; SELECT Title, Author
        FROM books
        WHERE Year &gt; 2001
        AND Year &lt; 2006
        ORDER BY Author ASC
        LIMIT 100;

== INSERT ==

The INSERT statement is used to insert data into a particular table of a database. The Syntax is as follows :

 mysql&gt; INSERT INTO table_name
        (field1, field2, etc...)
        VALUES ('val1', 'val2', etc...);

Example :

 mysql&gt; INSERT INTO books
        (ISBN, Title, Author, Year)
        VALUES ('1234567890', 'Programming PHP and MySQL', 'Poisson, R.W', 2006);

== DELETE ==

The DELETE statement is used to remove row(s) from a table. The syntax is as follows :

 mysql&gt; DELETE FROM table_name
        [WHERE condition1, condition2 etc...];

Example :

 mysql&gt; DELETE FROM books
        WHERE ISBN = '1234567890';

== ALTER ==

ALTER is used to modify the structure of a table. Here is the syntax for ALTER :

 ALTER [IGNORE] TABLE tbl_name
     alter_specification [, alter_specification] ...   
 
 alter_specification:
     ADD [COLUMN] column_definition [FIRST | AFTER col_name ]
   | ADD [COLUMN] (column_definition,...)
   | ADD INDEX [index_name] [index_type] (index_col_name,...)
   | ADD [CONSTRAINT [symbol]]
         PRIMARY KEY [index_type] (index_col_name,...)
   | ADD [CONSTRAINT [symbol]]
         UNIQUE [INDEX] [index_name] [index_type] (index_col_name,...)
   | ADD FULLTEXT [INDEX] [index_name] (index_col_name,...)
       [WITH PARSER parser_name]
   | ADD SPATIAL [INDEX] [index_name] (index_col_name,...)
   | ADD [CONSTRAINT [symbol]]
         FOREIGN KEY [index_name] (index_col_name,...)
         [reference_definition]
   | ALTER [COLUMN] col_name {SET DEFAULT literal | DROP DEFAULT}
   | CHANGE [COLUMN] old_col_name column_definition
         [FIRST|AFTER col_name]
   | MODIFY [COLUMN] column_definition [FIRST | AFTER col_name]
   | DROP [COLUMN] col_name
   | DROP PRIMARY KEY
   | DROP INDEX index_name
   | DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_symbol
   | DISABLE KEYS
   | ENABLE KEYS
   | RENAME [TO] new_tbl_name
   | ORDER BY col_name
   | CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET charset_name [COLLATE collation_name]
   | [DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET charset_name [COLLATE collation_name]
   | DISCARD TABLESPACE
   | IMPORT TABLESPACE
   | table_options
   | partition_options
   | ADD PARTITION (partition_definition)
   | DROP PARTITION partition_names
   | COALESCE PARTITION number
   | REORGANIZE PARTITION partition_names INTO (partition_definitions)
   | ANALYZE PARTITION partition_names
   | CHECK PARTITION partition_names
   | OPTIMIZE PARTITION partition_names
   | REBUILD PARTITION partition_names
   | REPAIR PARTITION partition_names
   | REMOVE PARTITIONING

== DROP ==

DROP is used to completely remove a table or database. The syntax is as follows :

 mysql&gt; DROP table_name;

== TRUNCATE ==

TRUNCATE is used when you want to remove the data, but not the structure of a table. The syntax is as follows :

 mysql&gt; TRUNCATE table_name;

'''Image Copyright Problem: [[:Image:D2l.jpg]]'''
&lt;!-- If the top of this page says &quot;Editing Template:Image copyright&quot;, then you are modifying the master copy of this template, and not your user talk page. To edit your talk page, just:
1. Click the back button in your web browser.
2. Click the &quot;edit this page&quot; tab at the top. --&gt;

Thanks for uploading [[:Image:D2l.jpg]]. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in [[Wikibooks]] because of [[w:copyright law|copyright law]]. We need you to specify two things on the [[:Image:D2l.jpg|image description page]]:
* The copyright holder, and
* The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder.  If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikibooks, we've sorted them using [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags|image copyright tags]]. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TAGHERE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  

There are 2 basic ways to licence an image on Wikibooks:
#An [[w:open content|open content]] licence
#[[w:public domain|Public Domain]]

*The copyright holder gets the best protection of his work by licencing their work under an [[w:open content|open content]] license like the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike] licence.  If you have the '''express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence''', use the image copyright tag: {{tl|cc-by-sa-2.5}}.  The [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] is another choice for licencing one's work.  Again, if you have the '''express permission''' of the copyright holder, use the tag: {{tl|GFDL}}.

*The copyright holder can also release his work into the [[w:public domain|public domain]], see [[Wikibooks:Image_copyright_tags#Public_domain_dedications|here]] for images released into the public domain.
**Images from certain sources are automatically release into the [[w:public domain|Public Domain]].  This is true for most governments like the federal United States government. However not all governments release their work into the public domain, such as the UK government .  Non-free licence governments are listed [[w:Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags#Non-free_UK_Government_licenses|here]]. 

For any other sources of for more information see [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]].  Please remember that if you don't tag your images, they will be deleted.

::''P.S.  If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them.  Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.''

If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:23, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody''''' is a former [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]]. His profession has apparently been rather hard on him, as he has a wooden leg, a magical artificial eye, and a large chunk taken out of his nose. He has developed a deep distrust of nearly everyone and everything. His nickname is derived from his magical eye, which is forever swiveling, totally independently of his real eye.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Alastor Moody is introduced when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]] contacts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]]. It seems that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|muggles]] witnessed Mad-Eye's garbage cans attacking an intruder at his house; Arthur was summoned to deal with the fall-out.

Moody becomes the new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher during Harry's fourth year, replacing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]]. Students notice that rather than drinking from the pitcher of pumpkin juice during the Welcoming Feast, he instead drinks only from his hip flask.

When Moody sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] throw a curse at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], he reprimands him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguring]] him into a ferret and bouncing him off the floor; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] warns Moody, quite strongly, that Transfiguration is never used as punishment. Moody then takes Malfoy to see his House Head, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]].

In his first Defence Against the Dark Arts class, Moody demonstrates the three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curses]]: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|the Imperius curse]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|the Cruciatus curse]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|the killing curse]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], whose parents were tortured into insanity with the Cruciatus curse, is understandably upset at the demonstration; Moody takes him up to his office and calms him down, giving him a book on Mediterranean aquatic magical plants.

Moody's teaching methods are unconventional but effective. He puts every member of the class under the Imperius curse, to show them what the effects are, and is quite pleased to find that Harry is able to resist. Over the next few classes, he puts Harry repeatedly under the Imperius curse to teach him how to resist it. We assume he is also attempting to teach the same ability to the rest of the class, as Ron is described as suffering the after effects of dealing with that curse at one point.

In the confusion surrounding Harry unexpectedly becoming a Triwizard champion, Moody intimidates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] into accepting four champions instead of three. Moody takes a liking to Harry and helps guide him through the Tournament.  

After Harry emerges from the third Task with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]]'s body, Moody takes him to his office. There he starts sounding more like a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]] than an Auror. Realizing the danger, Harry distracts him long enough for Professor Dumbledore, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], and Professor Snape to break in and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stun]] him. When a dose of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice potion]] wears off, Moody is revealed to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]]. Professor Snape administers [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]] and Crouch confesses he is working under [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] orders. Crouch says he intended to kill Harry to gain his Master's favor. Moody's trunk is opened, and the real Alastor Moody is discovered within, weak but still alive. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] is summoned, who arrives with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]]. The Dementor administers the &quot;Kiss&quot; (sucking out Crouch's soul) before Crouch can confess to Fudge.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Alastor Moody is a member of the Order, and effectively the leader of the Advance Guard who escort Harry from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursley's house]] to Headquarters. Moody cannot recognize Harry, having been unconscious for Harry's entire previous school year, but calls upon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], another member of the Advance Guard, to identify him. Moody then [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disillusionment|Disillusions]] Harry to conceal him, and after waiting for a signal, they take off, Wizards and Witches of the Order acting to shield Harry from any evil wizards who might be prepared to attack. Many other members of the Advance Guard seem to feel that Moody's caution is a bit over-blown; he says they should circle around to lose any pursuit, but is overruled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], who says that they are all freezing up there.

On landing, Moody uses Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deluminator|Deluminator]] to put out all the streetlights at Grimmauld Place, then shows Harry a piece of paper. The paper, being written by Dumbledore, who is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Secret-Keeper]] for the Order, allows Harry to see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]], and enter it. Once all the wizards have entered Headquarters, Moody uses the Deluminator to restore the streetlights.

At the party for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] following their appointment as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]], Moody remarks that Dumbledore must have thought Ron was good at dealing with jinxes; authority figures are often the targets of unprovoked attacks. Moody's magical eye finds that the unknown thing inside a writing desk in the parlour was only a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]]. Harry points out to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], who is working on a shady deal with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]], that Moody could be observing them with his magical eye; Mundungus immediately stops haggling with the twins and gives them the goods they are dickering for at the twins' offer price, half of what he was originally asking. And finally, Moody shows Harry an old picture of the Order; Harry feels rather upset at having this sudden reminder of his parents, and how they had died, thrust upon him.

Moody and Tonks escort Harry and the Weasleys to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's]], for the Weasley children's first visit after their father is injured. Afterwards, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Moody, and Tonks confer as to how exactly Harry was able to perceive the attack on Arthur; Moody suggests that Voldemort might have been possessing him. This suggestion, which the Weasleys and Harry overheard by means of the twins' [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Extendable Ear|Extendable Ears]], echoes Harry's private thoughts, but until now it had been too frightening a thought for him to entertain. Now that all of the Weasleys have heard it, he has to deal with it.

Moody meets Harry at the train station after the end of school, along with Tonks, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]. The four of them, plus Ron and Hermione, confront Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]], telling them that they will want to be reassured that Harry is having a good summer, or else they will come and visit to find out why not. Mad-Eye, with his magical eye, intimidates Vernon to the point that he nearly falls over a luggage cart.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Alastor Moody does not play a significant part in this book. We can safely assume that he is working with the Order, but he does not seem to visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] or the school while Harry is there.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody leads the Order of the Phoenix's operation of transporting Harry Potter from Privet Drive to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]]. The Order has decided to disguise [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], Ron, Fred, George, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fleur Delacour|Fleur Delacour]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] as Harry Potter by using Polyjuice Potion. Moody dies during the flight, as the Death Eaters and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] had been tipped off as to the date, though not the details, of Harry's escape. Confronted with multiple possible Harry Potters, Voldemort selects the Harry who was sharing a broom with the most powerful [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Auror]], attacking Moody and Mundungus. Mundungus [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparates]] to avoid a curse, which caught Moody instead.

We later find that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] has mounted Moody's magical eye on her office door as a sort of trophy. Harry removes it, and later gives it decent burial under a tree. Nothing else of Moody is recovered.

== Strengths ==

Mad-Eye's greatest asset is his &quot;Mad&quot; eye, the magical artificial eye he uses after losing his real eye in battles against Death Eaters. This electric-blue eye gives him 360 degree vision – he can see through the back of his own head – as well as being able to look through invisibility cloaks and closed doors.

Another strength is his formidable character. He has great strength of will, and apparently has need of it to persevere in the face of criticism about his apparent paranoia.

It is also likely that he is a very powerful wizard, as more than a small amount of skill is required to become an Auror. It is for this reason, we are told, that Voldemort chose to attack Moody's broom before any of the other departing Potters.

== Weaknesses ==

A lifetime of fighting Dark magic has left him with an extreme paranoia that causes him to distrust everyone and everything. He is accused at one point of having destroyed a gift sent to him because he thought the ticking indicated a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Cockatrice|Cockatrice]] egg; in fact, it had been a carriage clock.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==
Moody has a good friendship with Ron's father, Arthur Weasley, and was also close to Albus Dumbledore. It is also shown in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' that Tonks is very close to Moody, as shown by her reaction when he is killed.

== Analysis ==

Not an intimately friendly person, Moody deeply distrusts most people or things since his &quot;Auror&quot; days, in which he lost an eye, part of his nose, and a leg. We are led to believe that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Evan Rosier|Evan Rosier]] blasted some of his nose off.

He rarely believes anyone and always suspects that a spell could have been cast with malafide intentions by the &quot;Dark Side.&quot; This also explains his apparent motto, &quot;Constant Vigilance&quot;.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
#Why is Moody so paranoid?
#How does Moody interact with other people?
#Is Moody's eye unique, or are there any other similarly magical eyes?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Many actions and details described under the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; section were not actually done by the real Alastor Moody, but rather [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]], who kidnapped Moody and used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] (which he keeps in his hip flask) to impersonate him. Because these events are not revealed until the book's conclusion when Crouch is under the influence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Veritaserum|Veritaserum]], they appear under the listing for that character. However, he managed to deceive even Albus Dumbledore with his impersonation, so it must have been very close to the true Alastor Moody.

It should be noted that Moody's death was required by the plot. As noted in the article on Albus Dumbledore, Harry could not have been the hero if he had another hero at his back. It is a staple of heroic fiction that the hero's teacher, older and apparently stronger than the hero, must fall to allow the hero to take his place and defeat the villain. At the end of the previous book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Dumbledore dies. We have not seen as much of Moody, and Harry does not have any particular feeling for him, he quite clearly isn't the father figure Dumbledore was for Harry. However, he remains an older and supposedly stronger wizard than Harry, and so seems poised to fill Dumbledore's place in the hierarchy of heroes. In order to prevent that happening, Moody must be quickly incapacitated, preferably before the readers have started to care about him too much. It is unsure why the author does not allow the characters to find Moody's body; Umbridge having his magical eye on her door does imply quite strongly that Moody is dead, but denies us any real closure. It is possible, though unlikely, that the author wanted to leave the faint possibility that Moody could return to assist later in the story, if the plot developed to need that.

[[Easy Ido/Lesson six|Lesson six]] | [[Easy Ido/Lesson eight|Lesson eight]]

==Verb + Infinitive==

The English sentence 'I need to go home' is in the form Verb ('I need') + Infinitive ('to go').  Ido uses the same construction.  Here are some verbs which can be found in sentences like this:

* '''povar''' - to be able (to do something)
* '''mustar''' - to have to (by necessity)
* '''bezonar''' - to need (to)
* '''volar''' - to want (to)
* '''devar''' - to have a duty (to), 'should'

==Times==

One can talk about time using words such as the following:

* '''hiere''' - yesterday
* '''hodie''' - today 
* '''morge''' - tomorrow 
* '''horo''' - hour 
* '''kloko''' - o'clock
* '''dio''' - day
* '''semano''' - week
* '''monato''' - month
* '''yaro''' - year

==Short words==

Like in many languages, the hardest to learn can be the short words.  To make matters worse, some words in Ido are very similar while their translations in English are quite different.  The converse can also be true.  Here are a few sets of words which need special attention.

===That===

* '''ta''' - used when 'that' is an adjective, e.g. it precedes a noun. '''Ta libro esas granda''', 'That book is big'.
* '''to''' - used when 'that' is a pronoun, e.g. it precedes a verb. '''To esas libro''', 'That is a book'.
* '''ke''' - used when 'that' is a conjunction, e.g. it joins two clauses.  '''Me pensas ke hundi esas animali''', 'I think that dogs are animals'.

===N words===

* '''nek''' - neither and nor.  '''Me manjas nek frukti nek legumi''', 'I eat neither fruits nor vegetables'.
* '''nur''' - only.  '''Me havas nur un frato''', 'I have only one sibling'.
* '''nun''' - now.  '''Me mustas irar nun''', 'I must go now'.
* '''nam''' - for, since.  '''Me skribis la vorto, nam me ne savis olu''', 'I wrote the word, for I did not know it'.

===Ul words===

* '''ulo''' - something. '''Forsan ulo plu bona venos.''', 'Perhaps something better will come.'
* '''ulu''' - anyone, someone. '''Kad ulu savas ube ol esas?''', 'Does anyone know where it is?'
* '''ula''' - any, some. '''Kad vu havas ula libri pri cienco?''', 'Do you have any books about science?'

===Tr words===

* '''tra''' - through. '''Me marchis tra la parko.''', 'I walked through the park.'
* '''tro''' - too. '''Mea libro esas tro olda.''', 'My book is too old.' 
* '''tre''' - very. '''Ta libro esas tre interesanta.''', 'This book is very interesting.'

===Others===

Once you have mastered the words above, try learning these last few.  Also, try using them in sentences.

* '''dum''' - during
* '''yen''' - here is/are, there is/are (as in 'There is the train!')
* '''do''' - so, consequently
* '''ma''' - but
* '''ja''' - already
* '''se''' - if
* '''ya''' - indeed, truly
* '''tante''' - so (as in 'so big', 'so quickly')

I'm not exactly sure what sort of guidance you are seeking here, but I would like to strongly recommend that you look at  [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers]].  Keep in mind that very short pages like the one you made at [[Quik Mart]] are likely to be deleted simply because there is no content there, and no real possibility of become a new module.

==Introduction==

Acoustic filters, or mufflers, are used in a number of applications requiring the suppression or attenuation of sound.  Although the idea might not be familiar to many people, acoustic mufflers make everyday life much more pleasant.  Many common appliances, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, use acoustic mufflers to produce a minimal working noise.  The application of acoustic mufflers is mostly directed to machine components or areas where there is a large amount of radiated sound such as high pressure exhaust pipes, gas turbines, and rotary pumps.

Although there are a number of applications for acoustic mufflers, there are really only two main types which are used.  These are absorptive and reactive mufflers.  Absorptive mufflers incorporate sound absorbing materials to attenuate the radiated energy in gas flow.  Reactive mufflers use a series of complex passages to maximize sound attenuation while meeting set specifications, such as pressure drop, volume flow, etc.  Many of the more complex mufflers today incorporate both methods to optimize sound attenuation and provide realistic specifications. 

In order to fully understand how acoustic filters attenuate radiated sound, it is first necessary to briefly cover some basic background topics.  For more information on wave theory and other material necessary to study acoustic filters please refer to the references below.

== Basic Wave Theory ==

Although not fundamentally difficult to understand, there are a number of alternate techniques used to analyze wave motion which could seem overwhelming to a novice at first.  Therefore, only 1-D wave motion will be analyzed to keep most of the mathematics as simple as possible.  This analysis is valid, with not much error, for the majority of pipes and enclosures encountered in practice.

=== Plane-Wave Pressure Distribution in Pipes ===

The most important equation used is the wave equation in 1-D form (See [1],[2], [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WaveEquation1-Dimensional.html 1-D Wave Equation]], [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Transverse_vibrations_of_strings#Characterization_of_the_mechanical_system Vibrations of Strings]] for information).

Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest, if plane waves are propagating, that the pressure distribution in a pipe is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=\mathbf{Pi}e^{j[\omega t-kx]}+\mathbf{Pr}e^{j[\omega t+kx]}&lt;/math&gt;

where Pi and Pr are incident and reflected wave amplitudes respectively.  Also note that bold notation is used to indicate the possiblily of complex terms.  The first term represents a wave travelling in the +x direction and the second term, -x direction.

Since acoustic filters or mufflers typically attenuate the radiated sound power as much as possible, it is logical to assume that if we can find a way to maximize the ratio between reflected and incident wave amplitude then we will effectively attenuated the radiated noise at certain frequencies.  This ratio is called the reflection coefficient and is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\left( \frac{\mathbf{Pr}}{\mathbf{Pi}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to point out that wave reflection only occurs when the impedance of a pipe changes.  It is possible to match the end impedance of a pipe with the characteristic impedance of a pipe to get no wave reflection.  For more information see [1] or [2].

Although the reflection coefficient isn't very useful in its current form since we want a relation describing sound power, a more useful form can be derived by recognizing that the power intensity coefficient is simply the magnitude of reflection coefficient square [1]:

&lt;math&gt;R_{\pi}=\left|\mathbf{R}\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;

As one would expect, the power reflection coefficient must be less than or equal to one.  Therefore, it is useful to define the transmission coefficient as:as it is said&lt;math&gt;{{NAMESPACE}}♀√&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{\pi}=\left(1-R_{\pi}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is the amount of power transmitted.  This relation comes directly from conservation of energy.  When talking about the performance of mufflers, typically the power transmission coefficient is specified.

== Basic Filter Design ==

For simple filters, a long wavelength approximation can be made to make the analysis of the system easier.  When this assumption is valid (e.g. low frequencies) the components of the system behave as lumped acoustical elements.  Equations relating the various properties are easily derived under these circumstances, see [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Acoustics_of_pipes%2C_enclosures%2C_and_cavities_at_low_frequency Lumped Elements]] for further information.

The following derivations assume long wavelength.  Practical applications for most conditions are given later.

=== Low-Pass Filter ===
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_lpass.jpg|thumb|Tpi for Low-Pass Filter]]
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_lpass1.jpg|thumb]]

These are devices that attenuate the radiated sound power at higher frequencies.  This means the power transmission coefficient is approximently 1 across the band pass at low frequencies(see figure to right).

This is equivalent to an expansion in a pipe, with the volume of gas located in the expansion having an acoustic compliance (see figure to right).  Continuity of acoustic impedance (see Java Applet at: [[http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Ultrasonics/Physics/acousticimpedance.htm Acoustic Impedance Visualization]]) at the junction, see [1], gives a power transmission coefficient of:


&lt;math&gt;T_{\pi}=\left(\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{S_{1}-S}{2S}\right)kL}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


where k is the wavenumber (see [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Engineering_Acoustics/Boundary_Conditions_and_Forced_Vibrations#Wave_Properties Wave Properties]]), L &amp; &lt;math&gt;S_{1}&lt;/math&gt; are length and area of expansion respectively, and S is the area of the pipe.

The cut-off frequency is given by:


&lt;math&gt;f_{c}=\left(\frac{Sc}{\pi L(S_{1}-S)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


=== High-Pass Filter ===
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_hpass.jpg|thumb|Tpi for High-Pass Filter]]
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_hpass1.jpg|thumb]]

These are devices that attenuate the radiated sound power at lower frequencies.  Like before, this means the power transmission coefficient is approximately 1 across the band pass at high frequencies (see figure to right).

This is equivalent to a short side branch (see figure to right) with a radius and length much smaller than the wavelength (lumped element assumption).  This side branch acts like an acoustic mass and applies a different acoustic impedance to the system than the low-pass filter.  Again using continuity of acoustic impedance at the junction yields a power transmission coefficient of the form [1]:


&lt;math&gt;T_{\pi}=\left(\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{\pi a^2}{2SLk}\right)^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


where a and L are the radius and effective length of the small tube, respectively, and S is the area of the pipe.

The cut-off frequency is given by:


&lt;math&gt;f_{c}=\left(\frac{ca^2}{2SL}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Band-Stop Filter ===
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_bstop.jpg|thumb|Tpi for Band-Stop Filter]]
[[Image:acoustics_filter_imp_bstop1.jpg|thumb]]

These are devices that attenuate the radiated sound power over a certain frequency range (see figure to right).  Like before, the power transmission coefficient is approximently 1 in the band pass region.

Since the band-stop filter is essentially a cross between a low and high pass filter, one might expect to create one by using a combination of both techniques.  This is true in that the combination of a lumped acoustic mass and compliance gives a band-stop filter.  This can be realized as a helmholtz resonator (see [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Acoustics_of_pipes%2C_enclosures%2C_and_cavities_at_low_frequency#Examples_of_Electro-Acoustical_Analogies Helmholtz Resonator]] or figure to right).  Again, since the impedance of the helmholtz resonator can be easily determined, continuity of acoustic impedance at the junction can give the power transmission coefficient as [1]:


&lt;math&gt;T_{\pi}=\left(\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{c/2S}{\omega L/S_{b}-c^2/\omega V}\right)^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;S_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the neck, L is the effective length of the neck, V is the volume of the helmholtz resonator, and S is the area of the pipe.  It is interesting to note that the power transmission coefficient is zero when the frequency is that of the resonance frequency of the helmholtz.  This can be explained by the fact that at resonance the volume velocity in the neck is large with a phase such that all the incident wave is reflected back to the source [1].

The zero power transmission coefficient location is given by:


&lt;math&gt;f_{c}=\left(\frac{c}{2\pi}\right)\sqrt{\left(\frac{S_{b}}{LV}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;


This frequency value has powerful implications.  If a system has the majority of noise at one frequency component, the system can be &quot;tuned&quot; using the above equation, with a helmholtz resonator, to perfectly attenuate any transmitted power (see examples below).

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Design ===

If the long wavelength assumption is valid, typically a combination of methods described above are used to design a filter.  A specific design procedure is outlined for a helmholtz resonator, and other basic filters follow a similar procedure (see [[http://www.silex.com/pdfs/Exhaust%20Silencers.pdf 1]]).

Two main metrics need to be identified when designing a helmholtz resonator [3]:

(1) - Resonance frequency desired: &lt;math&gt;f_{c}=\frac{c}{2\pi}\frac{\sqrt{C_{o}}}{V}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;C_{o}=\frac{S}{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

(2) - Transmission loss: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{C_{o}V}}{2S}=const&lt;/math&gt; based on TL level.  This constant is found from a TL graph (see [[http://mecheng.osu.edu/~selamet/docs/2003_JASA_113(4)_1975-1985_helmholtz_ext_neck.pdf HR]] pp. 6).

This will result in two equations with two unknowns which can be solved for the unknown dimensions of the helmholtz resonator.  It is important to note that flow velocities degrade the amount of transmission loss at resonance and tend to move the resonance location upwards [3].

In many situations, the long wavelength approximation is not valid and alternative methods must be examined.  These are much more mathematically rigorous and require a complete understanding acoustics involved.  Although the mathematics involved are not shown, common filters used are given in the section that follows.

== Actual Filter Design ==

As explained previously, there are two main types of filters used in practice: absorptive and reactive.  The benefits and drawback of each will be briefly expained, along with their relative applications (see [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:specific_application-automobile_muffler#Absorptive_muffler Absorptive Mufflers]].

=== Absorptive ===

These are mufflers which incorporate sound absorbing materials to transform acoustic energy into heat.  Unlike reactive mufflers which use destructive interference to minimize radiated sound power, absorptive mufflers are typically straight through pipes lined with multiple layers of absorptive materials to reduce radiated sound power.  The most important property of absorptive mufflers is the attenuation constant.  Higher attenuation constants lead to more energy dissipation and lower radiated sound power.


{| width:75%; height:200px border=&quot;1&quot;
|- 
| Advantages of Absorptive Mufflers [3]:
|- 
| (1) - High amount of absorption at higher frequencies.
(2) - Good for applications involving broadband (constant across the spectrum) and narrowband (see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband 1]]) noise.

(3) - Reduced amount of back pressure compared to reactive mufflers.
|-
| Disadvantages of Absorptive Mufflers [3]:
|-
| (1) - Poor performance at low frequencies.
(2) - Material can degrade under certain circumstances (high heat, etc.).
|}

==== Examples ====
[[Image:Cherrybomb_muffler.jpg|thumb|Absorptive Muffler]]

There are a number of applications for absorptive mufflers.  The most well known application is in racecars, where engine performance is desired.  Absorptive mufflers don't create a large amount of back pressure (as in reactive mufflers) to attenuate the sound, which leads to higher muffler performance.  It should be noted however, that the radiate sound is much higher.  Other applications include plenum chambers (large chambers lined with absorptive materials, see picture below), lined ducts, and ventilation systems.

=== Reactive ===

Reactive mufflers use a number of complex passages (or lumped elements) to reduce the amount of acoustic energy transmitted.  This is accomplished by a change in impedance at the intersections, which gives rise to reflected waves (and effectively reduces the amount of transmitted acoustic energy).  Since the amount of energy transmitted is minimized, the reflected energy back to the source is quite high.  This can actually degrade the performance of engines and other sources.  Opposite to absorptive mufflers, which dissipate the acoustic energy, reactive mufflers keep the energy contained within the system.  See [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Acoustic:Car_Mufflers#The_reflector_muffler Reactive Mufflers]] for more information.


{| width:75%; height:200px border=&quot;1&quot;
|- 
| Advantages of Reactive Mufflers [3]:
|- 
| (1) - High performance at low frequencies.
(2) - Typically give high insertion loss, IL, for stationary tones.

(3) - Useful in harsh conditions.
|-
| Disadvantages of Reactive Mufflers [3]:
|-
| (1) - Poor performance at high frequencies.
(2) - Not desirable characteristics for broadband noise.

==== Examples ====
[[Image:EXHAUSTCUT-OUTsm.jpg|thumb|Reflective Muffler]]

Reactive mufflers are the most widely used mufflers in combustion engines[[http://www.eiwilliams.com/steel/index.php?p=EngineSilencers#All 1]].  Reactive mufflers are very efficient in low frequency applications (especially since simple lumped element analysis can be applied).  Other application areas include: harsh environments (high temperature/velocity engines, turbines, etc.), specific frequency attenuation (using a helmholtz like device, a specific frequency can be toned to give total attenuation of radiated sound power), and a need for low radiated sound power (car mufflers, air conditioners, etc.).

=== Performance ===

There are 3 main metrics used to describe the performance of mufflers; Noise Reduction, Insertion Loss, and Transmission Loss.  Typically when designing a muffler, 1 or 2 of these metrics is given as a desired value.


==== Noise Reduction (NR) ====

Defined as the difference between sound pressure levels on the source and receiver side.  It is essentially the amount of sound power reduced between the location of the source and termination of the muffler system (it doesn't have to be the termination, but it is the most common location) [3].


&lt;math&gt;NR = \left(L_{p1}-L_{p2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;L_{p1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{p2}&lt;/math&gt; is sound pressure levels at source and receiver respectively.  Although NR is easy to measure, pressure typically varies at source side due to standing waves [3].


==== Insertion Loss (IL) ====

Defined as difference of sound pressure level at the receiver with and without sound attenuating barriers.  This can be realized, in a car muffler, as the difference in radiated sound power with just a straight pipe to that with an expansion chamber located in the pipe.  Since the expansion chamber will attenuate some of the radiate sound power, the pressure at the receiver with sound attenuating barriers will be less.  Therefore, a higher insertion loss is desired [3].


&lt;math&gt;IL = \left(L_{p,without}-L_{p,with}\right)&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;L_{p,without}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{p,with}&lt;/math&gt; are pressure levels at receiver without and with a muffler system respectively.  Main problem with measuring IL is that the barrier or sound attenuating system needs to be removed without changing the source [3].


==== Transmission Loss (TL) ====

Defined as the difference between the sound power level of the incident wave to the muffler system and the transmitted sound power.  For further information see [[http://freespace.virgin.net/mark.davidson3/TL/TL.html Transmission Loss]] [3].


&lt;math&gt;TL = 10log\left(\frac{1}{\tau}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\tau =\left(\frac{I_{t}}{I_{i}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;I_{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are the transmitted and incident wave power respectively.  From this expression, it is obvious the problem with measure TL is decomposing the sound field into incident and transmitted waves which can be difficult to do for complex systems (analytically).

==== Examples ====

(1) - For a plenum chamber (see figure below):

&lt;math&gt;TL = -10log\left(S\left(\frac{cos\theta}{2\pi d^2}+\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha S_{w}}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt; in dB

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is average absorption coefficient.

| [[image:acoustics_filter_implem_plenum.jpg|none|thumb|Transmission Loss vs. Theta]] 
|}

(2) - For an expansion (see figure below):

&lt;math&gt;NR = 10log\left[ \frac{1}{2}\left| e^{-ikx_{s}}+\left( \frac{1-S}{1+S} \right)e^{ikx_{s}} \right|^2\left( 1+S \right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;IL = 10log\left[ \frac{\left( 1+S \right)^2}{4} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;TL = 10log\left[ \frac{\left( 1+S \right)^2}{4S} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S=\left( \frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

(3) - For a helmholtz resonator (see figure below):

&lt;math&gt;TL = 10log\left[ 1+\left( \frac{\left( \frac{c}{2S_{b}} \right)}{\omega LS - \left( \frac{c^2}{\omega V} \right)} \right)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt; in dB

To add a more personal note, keep in mind that Wikibooks is not Wikipedia.  Yeah, I understand that it takes time to develop a stub of a book, there are enough areas to work on with Wikibooks that starting a book with a single sentance and a bunch of red links will never be realisticly developed into Wikibooks in the near term either.

For some details, look at [[Help:How to start a book]], which goes into details that you should consider before starting a whole new Wikibook.  And keep in mind that Wikibooks is not about articles but rather whole books.  If you want to get an encyclopedia-type of article started, please go to [[w:|Wikipedia]] instead, where they specialize in that sort of information.  

Still, thanks for trying to contribute to Wikibooks, and I hope that you can help us out here in the future on some of the major projects and books.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:29, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Election of 1800 ==

John Adams' Presidency was plagued by several problems. Adams and Congress enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts, which restricted the First Amendment free speech rights of the opposing Republicans.  In response, Anti-Federalists in Virginia and Kentucky passed the Virginia and Kentucky Resolves, which were written by Jefferson and Madison and tried to invalidate the Alien and Sedition Acts. Adams could not even control members of his own party, whom he alienated by disregarding his cabinet's advice. By 1800, Adams was clearly vulnerable.

Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr ran against Adams and his running mate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. The original intention was for Jefferson to become President and Burr to become Vice President. However, the Electoral College vote was eventually tied between the two candidates. This occurred because the constitution originally called for the individual with the most votes to become the President and the candidate with the second most votes to become the Vice President. George Washington, who approved of this system thought that there should be no party politics but just efforts for the overall good of the country. This had previously (in the election of 1796) led to Thomas Jefferson becoming the Vice President under John Adams, rather than Thomas Pinckney, the candidate for VP who was favored by Adams. 

Despite the original intention of the two candidates, the House of Representatives were to choose one or the other as President since neither candidate achieved a majority in the Electoral College. The House was controlled by Federalists, and it had to vote thirty-six times until Jefferson finally became President. (Aaron Burr, who became Vice President, resented Alexander Hamilton, who finally agreed to vote for Jefferson as President; Burr eventually killed Hamilton in a duel in 1804 when the two were running for Governor of New York.) Subsequently, a constitutional amendment was approved which led to separate balloting for President and Vice President in the Electoral College.

===Revolution of 1800===
Jefferson's first term was called the Revolution of 1800, because of the many changes to America.  The peaceful transition of power effectively capped the demise of the Federalists, but not before the Federalists had established a strong, working central government structured and principled as described in the Constitution, instituted a sound financial system, and began diversifying the economy. An indirect legacy of the Federalists, via the Judiciary Act of 1801 and the ensuing ''Marbury v. Madison'', was the doctrine of judicial review, or the power of the federal judiciary to invalidate federal laws on constitutional grounds. 

Jefferson differed from the Federalists in that he saw government as a threat to individual freedom; the only protection against that threat was democracy and strong protections of personal liberties. He did not, however, reject wholesale the accomplishments of the Federalist administrations that preceded him, and his combination of them with his own beliefs came to be known as &quot;Jeffersonian democracy.&quot;

==Important Supreme Court cases==
In 1803, the U.S. Supreme Court established some principles that would have a profound effect in the life of America. The first was the issue of judicial review and the second was the controversial trial of Aaron Burr. The first trial ''Marbury v. Madison'' dealt with the court packing  policies of the previous president John Adams. This trial introduced the concept of judicial review to the political scene.

== Louisiana Purchase ==

[[Image:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|350px|thumb|The Purchase was one of several territorial additions to the U.S.]]
The French province of Louisiana included present-day North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri as well as most of Kansas, the western part of Minnesota, the eastern parts of Montana, Colorado, and Wyoming, and, of course, Louisiana. 

After the French and Indian War, France ceded all of Louisiana east of the Mississippi to Britain, except for the city of New Orleans. France gave New Orleans and the western part of Louisiana to Spain. By the Treaty of Paris, the United States received the British part of Louisiana. 

Napoleon Bonaparte obtained the return of Louisiana from Spain in 1800, under the Treaty of San Ildefonso (Louisiana had been a Spanish colony since 1762.) However, the treaty was kept secret, and Louisiana remained under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France. The transfer finally took place on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the cession of the colony to the United States.

The port of New Orleans was crucial to trade on the Mississippi. Jefferson, knowing this, sent James Monroe to Paris in 1802, seeking to negotiate a treaty with France that would allow the United States to benefit from New Orleans. Jefferson put forth four options: the purchase of only New Orleans, the purchase of New Orleans and Florida, the purchase of some Louisianan land allowing the US to build a port there, or the purchase of navigation rights on the Mississippi.

The French, however, rejected all four options. For them, it was all of Louisiana or nothing. Napoleon was preparing to launch an invasion of Britain and the faction in France who favored raising funds for the coming war were ascendant over those, such as de Talleyrand, who hoped for a French empire in North America. It is also possible that the French understood that Jefferson was prepared to go to war rather than tolerate a strong French presence in the region and this would have disturbed Napoleon's imminent launch of a global war.  The US agreed to purchase Louisiana for $15 million. The Senate ratified the treaty in 1803, thus increasing the size of the United States dramatically.

Although Jefferson did buy the Louisiana Purchase, he had to stretch the Republican view of literal constitutionality. The president did not have the right to buy land in the constitution, but Jefferson rationalized that the land would greatly benefit Americans.  The Federalists were particularly opposed to the purchase and reasoned that the conflicting interests of those settling the new States with the interests of the established States would threaten the Union.

=== The Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition ===
Shortly after purchasing the Louisiana Territory, Jefferson sent two men, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, to survey the new land. In 1804, the two men (and forty or so others) set out from St. Louis and traveled northwest over the next two years. By December 1805, the party had reached the mouth of the Columbia River (which spilled into the Pacific Ocean) with the help of Sacajawea, a Shoshone Indian who served as their interpreter, and her husband Toussaint Charbonneau (a Canadian fur trapper). In 1806, the party split into two groups - one led by Lewis, the other by Clark - eventually reconvening in Fort Mandan (located in present-day North Dakota).


With journals in hand, Lewis, Clark, and the other members of the Expedition returned to St. Louis by September 1806 to report their findings to Jefferson. Along the way, they continued to trade what few goods they still had with the Indians and set up diplomatic relations with the Indians. Additionally, they recorded their contact with Indians and described (and at times drew) the shape of the landscape and the creatures of this western world, new to the white man. In doing so, they fulfilled many of Jefferson's wishes for the Expedition. Along the way, William Clark drew a series of maps that were remarkably detailed, noting and naming rivers and creeks, significant points in the landscape, the shape of river shore, and spots where the Corps spent each night or camped or portaged for longer periods of time.

=== The Pike Expedition ===
In 1805, Captain Zebulon Pike, a soldier, set out to explore the new territory as well. He started in St. Louis as well, but unlike Lewis and Clark, traveled directly west into the Rocky Mountains. He reached Santa Fe, where he was captured briefly by Spanish soldiers in the area. Pike returned to Washington in 1807 to report the number of Spanish forces in the region. More important, however, was his description of the area - he nicknamed the territory &quot;The Great American Desert&quot; due to its relative lack of vegetaion. Coincidentally, it was this nickname that would prevent settlers from &quot;moving west&quot; for the next thirty to forty years, but eventually the westward expansionist movement took full bloom.

== Embargo and Non-Intercourse Acts ==

In 1807, Britain and France, frustrated with America's refusal to help either of them in the Napoleonic Wars, were constantly seizing American merchant ships and taking their cargo and sailors. 

===The ''Chesapeake''-''Leopard'' Affair===
Britain disregarded American neutrality - among other things, it seized American ships and forced their sailors to join the Royal Navy, often without regard for the sailors' nationality.  This was a practice known as impressment.  In June of 1807, the British ship ''Leopard'' attacked the American ''Chesapeake'' in American waters because the commander of the latter ship had refused to let the British search the ship for British deserters.  The Americans lost and four &quot;deserters&quot; were taken from the ''Chesapeake''.  Jefferson demanded an apology from the British and an end to impressment.  While the British did apologize, they did not stop searching American ships or end the practice of impressment.  The British claim that these impressed sailors were &quot;deserters&quot; was not subject to review, and these sailors were often not really deserters from the Royal Navy.Many Americans begin to get distraught by the British impressment of sailors. This became one of the deal breaker to beginning the War of 1812.

===The Embargo Act and its aftermath===
On June 22, 1807 Jefferson called an emergency Cabinet meeting to discuss sea trade with western countries.  Americans urged Jefferson to go to war with France. In response to continued disregard to US neutrality, on December 22, Congress passed the &lt;b&gt;Embargo Act&lt;/b&gt;. This law ordered that merchants could not trade internationally (at all, not just to France and Britain), in hope that it would protect the merchant ships and weaken the French and British economies.  The embargo stopped nearly all trade between the US and Europe.  The lack of trade severely damaged the United State's economy, and merchants, who were generally members of the Federalist Party, howled in complaint.  Smuggling also continued.  

The next year, 1808, the Democratic-Republican candidate James Madison, who was also a Virginian and had been Jefferson's Secretary of State, was elected President.  However, the Democrat-Republicans suffered some reverses in the House of Representatives, a clear signal that the Embargo Act was unpopular and politically damaging.  Congress modified the embargo with the &lt;b&gt;Non-Intercourse Act&lt;/b&gt; in 1809, which made an addendum to the previous act: merchants were allowed to trade with any nation besides Britain and France. Although trade improved, British and French ships begin seizing American ships again.  Overall, the Embargo Act was a failure because it did not bring either Great Britain or France to respect US neutrality and damaged the political fortunes of the Democratic-Republicans.

In 1810, a change to the Embargo and Non-Intercourse Acts was passed.  It was called '''Macon's Bill No. 2'''.  It said that if either Britain or France dropped trade restrictions against the U.S. and stopped seizing American ships, the United States would trade with them and not with the other.  Napoleon, then ruler of France, agreed, meaning that the U.S. was allowed to trade with France and not with Britain.

== War of 1812 ==

The War of 1812 was fought between the United States of America, on one side, and on the other side the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its colonies, especially Upper Canada (Ontario), Lower Canada (Quebec), Nova Scotia, and Bermuda. When the war had finished, 1,600 British and 2,260 American troops had died. The war was fought from 1812 to 1815 and involved both land and naval engagements. Britain was at war with France and to impede American trade with France imposed a series of restrictions that the U.S. contested as illegal under international law. The Americans declared war on Britain on June 18, 1812 for a combination of reasons: outrage at the impressment (seizure) of thousands of American sailors into the British navy, frustration at British restraints on neutral trade, and anger at British military support for Native Americans defending their tribal lands from encroaching American settlers.

Washington, Adams, and Jefferson had attempted to keep the United States neutral in the conflict between Napoleonic France and her allies and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Russia and their allies.  France had been an ally of the United States during the revolutionary war, but the United Kingdom was extremely powerful. 

Some historians, such as Robin Reilly, have argued that the declaration of war on Great Britain by the United States was a victory for French diplomacy, forcing Britain to divert its attention and some resources from continental matters. From a British perspective, there was certainly no reason to commence a war with the United States. Britain had been engaged in a desperate war with France since 1793 and depended on American supplies to maintain Wellington's army in Spain. Britain depended on the supplies such as beef and oak to feed troops and to build ships.  Any combat in North America would merely be a distraction from the main effort to contain and defeat the French in Europe.

In 1812, Congress declared war against the increasingly aggressive United Kingdom. The United States' attempt to invade Canada by land was a miserable failure, but the US did win great victories at sea. In addition to the regular Navy, the US commissioned privateers to destroy British commercial ships. The British also used privateers. Privateers were private vessels entitled to attack and destroy enemy ships, and to take any goods they found on those ships.  This was essentially legalized piracy.  

Early in the war, the British could not spare many ships because of the threat posed by Napoleon in Europe. Once Napoleon was defeated in 1814, the British could concentrate their ships on the United States and the War of 1812.  As the power of the British navy stationed near North America increased, British troops marched on Washington with the navy ready to lend support. The British burnt the White House, the Capitol, and the ships in DC. Due to letter Dolly Madison had received hours before the British arrival at the White House, she was able to protect the life-size painting of George Washington painted by Gilbert Stuart. Dolly Madison, President James Madison's wife, was responsible for the decor of the White House which was fairly new. The whole capitol city could have been burned down if it wasn't for rain that evening. As a result the entire library of congress was lost this led to the purchase of the Jefferson Library which consisted for 6,700 volumes of federal government for the amount of $23,950 in May of 1815.

=== Treaty of Ghent and the Battle of New Orleans ===

Neither side made significant progress. British victories on land were offset by American victories at sea and by American privateers, who threatened to cripple the British economy. However, by 1814 the blockade of American ports had tightened to the extent that the United States ships found it increasingly difficult to sail without meeting forces of superior strength. In August 1814, American and British negotiators met in Ghent, Belgium to discuss peace. The Treaty of Ghent ceased the war, but made no substantial changes to policies prior to the War. 

Due to difficulty in communication, news of the Treaty did not reach the US for several weeks. This led to some famously pointless bloodshed. British generals attacked the American port of New Orleans, but suffered tremendous casualties due to the efforts of Major General Andrew Jackson. The British then secured Mobile bay and were victorious in the Battle of Fort Bowyer but had to simply march away afterwards.

Again due to difficulty in communication, New England did not receive news of the Battle of New Orleans, which was an American success. Pessimists feared the dissolution or conquest of the US. But when news of the Treaty of Ghent reached America in early 1815, most fears seemed allayed. Neither side could justifiably claim absolute victory in the War, but the Americans were encouraged that they did not falter against the mighty British. 

American diplomacy was triumphant, as it had been in the Revolution and the Louisiana Purchase, stopping the war before the British could mobilise a hundred thousand veterans and the full power of the Royal Navy after the global conflict of the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815. It can be noted that the United Kingdom and America have not engaged in armed conflict since the war.

==Education==
Jefferson was very passionate about education that he pushed an amendment into congress that would legalize federal support for public education on December 2, 1806. Congress did not pass it, so Jefferson gave it to his home state of Virginia so that it could be used in their constitution. Jefferson made an understandable plan for education which included the elementary, high school, college levels. 

Jefferson thought that elementary education was the most important form of education of them all. He had six goals for education that he hoped would make all people “productive and informed voters.” His goals are: to allow people to deal with their own business, give a person the ability to express their own opinions and ideas in writing, to better their thoughts and faculties through reading, to comprehend his duties and the duties of his neighbors, to know his rights and how to use them, and to use what they know in their social lives.

== Operating systems ==

Here are some links to Windows and Linux pages which might be useful when you have to choose an operating system. Be careful and do your research to make sure you get the OS that's right for you. To download the CD images (*.iso) for making installment CDs, you will want to have a DSL connection or faster, since files are often around 700 MB (the size of one CD). Some distros are larger than one CD.

=== Downloading tips ===

# Download each ISO file seperately. If you do them all at the same time, it will eat bandwidth and take lots of time to download.
# Do not use dialup! It takes 3 hours to download a 12 MB Internet Explorer install package on dialup. Dialup is also shared bandwidth, so if you download, everything for most other people goes extremely slow.
# Don't download anything you think is unsafe. I recommend downloading items with proper names and the names of companies. Don't download something like &quot;WW32@Bugbear.3.E&quot; or &quot;timestamp maker&quot;. Download stuff like &quot;Adobe Acrobat 7.0.7&quot; or &quot;Macromedia Flash Professional&quot;.
# Virus check, and validate with the file's MD5 checksum before using. This ensures the download is not rigged or damaged.

=== Linux ===
; [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ Fedore Core] : Based on Redhat, this is the newest Redhat supported distro available. Has most of the features that Redhat once including a new &quot;bleeding edge&quot; interface. This has become about the second most powerful Linux distros on the web.{{fact}}

; [http://www.mandriva.com/ The Mandriva Distribution] : A common one with multiple uses.

; [http://www.opensuse.org/ The SUSE Distribution]: Comes in all shapes and sizes. The OSS or the &quot;Open Source Editon&quot; is a set of four downloadable isos with many open-source programs that are useful if you want a low cost office. The Novell Editon is the paid for edition including stuff like StarOffice, Mesa, commercial/proprietary software. So if you have a business, where you want quality and good tools for your money then buy that.

; The [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] distros : A very popular distribution, Ubuntu is an attempt at &quot;user friendly&quot; Linux. Canonical Ltd. started Ubuntu with a 10 million dollar grant, and in less than a year has become a major player in the Linux field. All these distros can be configured as servers as well as running on their own.
:*[http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] The standard Ubuntu edition comes packaged with the [[Using GNOME|GNOME]] desktop environment and lots of other open source software.

; [http://www.slackware.com/ Slackware] : Good Distro, though not up to date with good graphical interfaces. If you want something newer, get a distro above. Cons: Requires a geek to install apps in Slackware.

=== Microsoft Windows ===

[http://www.microsoft.com/ Microsoft Windows] is an operating system started in the late 80s after Apple Computer created the Macintosh. This is the OS running on the majority of PCs. Unlike open source systems like Linux, Windows is proprietary, and so must be purchased with a license.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Comparative Pie Charts==
[[File:CompPieGraph.png|thumb|350px|right|A pie chart showing preference of colors by two groups.]]

The comparative pie charts are very difficult to read and compare if the ratio of the pie chart is not given.

Examine our example of color preference for two different groups.  How much work does it take to see that the Blue preference for both groups is the same?  First, we have to find blue on each pie, and then remember how many degrees it has.  If we did not include the share for blue in the label, then we would probably be approximating the comparison.  So, if we use multiple pie charts, we have to expect that comparisions between charts would only be approximate.  

What is the most popular color in the left graph?  Red.  But note, that you have to look at all of the colors and read the label to see which it might be.  Also, this author was kind when creating these two graphs because I used the same color for the same object.  Imagine the confusion if one had made the most important color get Red in the right-hand chart?  

If two shares of data should not be compared via the comparative pie chart, what kind of graph would be preferred?  The stacked bar chart is probably the most appropriate for sharing of the total comparisons.  Again, exact comparisons cannot be done with graphs and therefore  a table may supplement the graph with detailed information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Registers==
Registers can move two types of digital information: parallel and serial. Registers also have two basic ways of moving it: FIFO and LIFO. The simplest register is a FIFO, which is only one level deep and one bit wide. It is basically a single D Type Flip/Flop.

===FIFO===
A FIFO (First In First Out) is a digital device that moves data in the same way a queue would. The first chunk of information in is moved over as more is loaded in behind it. This continues until it is pushed out the end. Like a grocery line.

===LIFO===
A LIFO (Last In First Out) is a like a FIFO only the data comes out in the reverse order it came in. Data is processed like a stack data structure. Imagine putting items onto a stack, the first item taken off would be at the top of the stack. Thus, the last item in (item at the top of the stack), would be the first item out

===Parallel===
Parallel Registers take in mulitple bits at a time.

===Shift Registers===
Shift Registers are the simplest serial interfaces. They take serial data in one bit at a time and convert it to parallel form or the other way around. The first way is Serial In Parallel Out and the latter is Parallel In Serial Out. Shift Registers are used to make larger state machines like counters and UARTs.

====Serial In Parallel Out====

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once upon a time, I was working with a colleague who needed to do some quick data analysis to get a handle on the scope of a problem. He was considering importing the data into a database or writing a program to parse and summarize that data. Either of these options would have taken hours at least, and possibly days. I wrote this on his whiteboard:

:Your friends: cat, find, grep, wc, cut, sort, uniq

These simple commands can be combined to quickly answer the kinds of questions for which most people would turn to a database, if only the data were already in a database. You can quickly (often in seconds) form and test hypotheses about virtually any record oriented data source.

==Intended audience==

You've logged into a Unix box of some flavor and run some basic commands like &lt;tt&gt;ls&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;cd&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt;. If you don't know what the &lt;tt&gt;ls&lt;/tt&gt; command does, you need a more basic introduction to Unix than I'm going to give here.

== Foreword ==

DarkBASIC Programming is the first ever Wikibook on DarkBASIC!

You'll go from Hello World, to computing a text adventure, to making a simple first-person shooter (when the book is eventually finished).

Don't worry it's easy! The style is easy for beginners to DarkBASIC &amp; programming.

Before I start, I'd like to thank The Game Creator's forum users for compliments, rants &amp; comments on this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Formatting==

These typesetting conventions will be used when presenting example interactions at the command line:

 $ '''command argument1 argument2 argument3''' 
 output line 1 
 output line 2 
 output line 3 
 [...]

The &quot;&lt;tt&gt;$ &lt;/tt&gt;&quot; is the shell prompt. What you type is shown in boldface; command output is in regular type.

==Example data==

I will use the following sample files in the examples.

===The Unix password file===

The password file can be found in /etc/passwd. Every user on the system has one line (record) in the file. Each record has six fields separated by colon (':') characters. The fields are username, encrypted password, userid, default group, home directory and default shell. We can look at the first few lines with the head command, which prints just the first few lines of a file. Correspondingly, the tail command prints just the last few lines.

 $ '''head -5 /etc/passwd''' 
 root:x:0:0:root:/:/bin/bash 
 bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin 
 daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin 
 adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin 
 lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin

===Census data===

The US Census releases Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) on [http://www.census.gov/ its website]. We will use the 1% sample of Washington state's data, the file pums_53.dat, which can be downloaded [http://www2.census.gov/census_2000/datasets/PUMS/OnePercent/Washington/ here]

 $ '''head -2 pums_53.dat''' 
 H000011715349 53010 99979997 70 15872 639800 120020103814700280300000300409

==Developer efficiency vs. computer efficiency==  	 
			
The techniques discussed here are usually extremely efficient in terms of developer time, but generally less efficient in terms of compute resources (CPU, I/O, memory). This kind of brute force and ignorance may be inelegant, but when you don't yet understand the scope of your problem, it is usually best to spend 30 seconds writing a program that will run for 3 hours than vice versa. 

==The online manual==

The &quot;man&quot; command displays information about a given command (colloquially referred to as the command's &quot;man page&quot;).  The online man pages are an extremely valuable resource; if you do any serious work with the commands presented here, you'll eventually read all their man pages top to bottom.  In Unix literature the man page for a command (or function, or file) is typically referred to as command(n).  The number &quot;n&quot; specifies a section of the manual to disambiguate entries which exist in multiple sections.  So, passwd(1) is the man page for the passwd command, and passwd(5) is the man page for the passwd file.  On a Linux system you ask for a certain section of the manual by giving the section number as the first argument as in &quot;man 5 passwd&quot;. Here's what the man command has to say about itself:

 $ '''man man''' 
 man(1)                                                        man(1) 
 NAME
        man - format and display the on-line manual pages 
        manpath - determine user's search path for man pages 
 
 SYNOPSIS 
        man [-acdfFhkKtwW] [--path] [-m system] [-p string] [-C 
        config_file] [-M pathlist] [-P pager] [-S section_list] 
        [section] name ... 
 
 DESCRIPTION 
        man formats and displays the on-line manual pages. If you 
        specify section, man only looks in that section of the 
        manual. name is normally the name of the manual page, 
        which is typically the name of a command, function, or 
        file. [...]

      <comment>/* Using output with headers */ Fix order of commands so header is removed, not a grep result.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">''&quot;This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.&quot;'' -- Doug McIlroy, the inventor of Unix pipes

The commands I'm going to talk about here are called filters. Data passes through them and they modify it a bit on the way. These commands read data from their &quot;standard input&quot; and write data to their &quot;standard output.&quot; By default, standard input is your keyboard and standard output is your screen. For example, the &lt;tt&gt;tr&lt;/tt&gt; command is a filter that translates one set of characters to another. This invocation of &lt;tt&gt;tr&lt;/tt&gt; turns all lower case characters to upper case characters:

 $ '''tr &quot;[:lower:]&quot; &quot;[:upper:]&quot;'''
 '''hello'''
 HELLO
 '''i feel like shouting'''
 I FEEL LIKE SHOUTING 
 '''[ctrl-d]'''

Ctrl-d is how you tell the command from the keyboard that you're done entering input.

You can tell your shell to connect standard output to a file instead of your screen using the &quot;&gt;&quot; operator. The term for this is &quot;redirection&quot;. One would talk about &quot;redirecting&quot; &lt;tt&gt;tr&lt;/tt&gt;'s output to a file. Later you can use the &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; command to write the file to your screen.

 $ '''tr a-z A-Z &gt; tr_output'''
 '''this is a test'''
 '''[ctrl-d]'''
 $ '''cat tr_output'''
 THIS IS A TEST

Many Unix commands that take a file as an argument will read from standard input if not given a file. For example, the &lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;/tt&gt; command searches a file for a string and prints the lines that match. If I wanted to find my entry in the password file I might say:

 $ '''grep jrauser /etc/passwd'''
 jrauser:x:7777:100:John Rauser:/home/jrauser:/bin/bash

But I could also redirect a file to &lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;/tt&gt;'s standard input using &quot;&lt;&quot; operator. You can see that the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; operators are like little arrows that indicate the flow of data.

 $ '''grep jrauser &lt; /etc/passwd'''
 jrauser:x:7777:100:John Rauser:/home/jrauser:/bin/bash

You can use the pipe &quot;|&quot; operator to connect the standard output of one command to the standard input of the next. The &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; command reads a file and writes it to its standard output, so yet another way to find my entry in the password file is:

 $ '''cat /etc/passwd | grep jrauser'''
 jrauser:x:7777:100:John Rauser:/home/jrauser:/bin/bash

For a slightly more interesting example, the &lt;tt&gt;mail&lt;/tt&gt; command will send a message it reads from standard input. Let's send my entry in the password file to me in an email.

 $ '''cat /etc/passwd | grep jrauser | mail -s &quot;passwd entry&quot; jrauser@example.com'''

= Using output with headers =

In many situations, you end up with output that has a first line that is a header describing the data, and subsequent lines that are the data.  An example is ps:

 $ ps | head -5
   PID TTY           TIME CMD
 22313 ttys000    0:00.86 -bash
 31537 ttys001    0:00.06 -bash
 22341 ttys002    0:00.28 -bash
 70093 ttys002    0:00.00 head -5

If you wish to manipulate the data but not the header use tail with -n switch to start at line 2. For example:

 $ ps | tail -n +2 | grep bash | head -5
 22313 ttys000    0:00.86 -bash
 31537 ttys001    0:00.06 -bash
 22341 ttys002    0:00.28 -bash
 70120 ttys002    0:00.00 -bash

This output shows only &quot;bash&quot; processes (because of '''grep''')

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''&quot;90% of data analysis is counting&quot;'' - John Rauser

...well, at least once you've figured out the right question to ask, which is, perhaps, the other 90%.

==Example - Counting the size of a population==

The simplest command for counting things is &lt;tt&gt;wc&lt;/tt&gt;, which stands for word count. By default, &lt;tt&gt;wc&lt;/tt&gt; prints the number of lines, words, and characters in a file.

 $ '''wc pums_53.dat'''
 85025 1219861 25659175 pums_53.dat

Nearly always we just want to count the number of lines (records), which can be done by giving the &lt;tt&gt;-l&lt;/tt&gt; option to &lt;tt&gt;wc&lt;/tt&gt;.

 $ '''wc -l pums_53.dat'''
 85025 pums_53.dat

==Example - Using grep to select a subset==

So, recalling that this is a 1% sample, there were 8.5 million people in Washington as of the 2000 census? Nope, the census data has two kinds of records, one for households and one for persons. The first character of a record, an H or P, indicates which kind of record it is. We can grep for and count just person records like this:

 $ '''grep -c &quot;^P&quot; pums_53.dat'''
 59150

The caret '^' means that the 'P' must occur at the beginning of the line. So there were about 5.9 million people in Washington State in 2000. Also interesting, the average household had 59,150/(85,025-59,150) = 2.3 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fixed width data==

How many households had just 1 person? Referring to the file layout, we see that the 106th and 107th characters of a household record indicate the number of people in the household. We can use the &lt;tt&gt;cut&lt;/tt&gt; command to pull out just that bit of data from each record. The argument &lt;tt&gt;-c106-107&lt;/tt&gt; instructs cut to print the 106th through 107th characters of each line. The head command prints just the first few lines of a file (or its standard input).

 $ census_data&gt;'''grep &quot;^H&quot; pums_53.dat  | cut -c106-107 | head -5'''
 03 
 02 
 03 
 02 
 02

You can give &lt;tt&gt;cut&lt;/tt&gt; a comma separated list to pull out multiple ranges. To see the household id along with the number of occupants of the household:

 $ census_data&gt;'''grep &quot;^H&quot; pums_53.dat  | cut -c2-8,106-107 | head -5'''
 000011703 
 000024602 
 000231203 
 000242102 
 000250202

The &lt;tt&gt;-c&lt;/tt&gt; argument is used for working with so called &quot;fixed-width&quot; data. Data where the columns of a record are found at certain offset in bytes from the beginning of a record. Fixed width data abounds on a Unix system. ls -l writes its output in a fixed width format:

 $ '''ls -l /etc | head -5'''
 total 6548 
 -rw-r--r--    1 root     root          46 Dec  4 12:23 adjtime 
 drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root        4096 Oct  8  2003 alchemist 
 -rw-r--r--    1 root     root        1048 Aug 31  2001 aliases 
 -rw-r--r--    1 root     root       12288 Oct  8  2003 aliases.db

As does ps:

 $ ''ps -u'''
 USER       PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND 
 jrauser  26870  0.0  0.1  2576 1388 pts/0    S    09:45   0:00 /bin/bash 
 jrauser   8943  0.0  0.0  2820  880 pts/0    R    12:58   0:00 ps -u

Returning to the question of how many 1 person households are there in Washington:

 $ '''grep &quot;^H&quot; pums_53.dat  | cut -c106-107 | grep -c 01'''
 7192

7,192, or about 28% of households have only one occupant.

==Delimited data==

In delimited data, elements of a record are separated by a special 'delimiter' character. In the password file, fields are delimited by colons:

 $ '''head -5 /etc/passwd'''
 root:x:0:0:root:/:/bin/bash 
 bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin 
 daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin 
 adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin 
 lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin

The 7th column of the password file is the user's login shell. How many people use bash as their shell?

 $ '''cut -d: -f7 /etc/passwd | grep -c /bin/bash '''
 170

You can give either &lt;tt&gt;-c&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-f&lt;/tt&gt; a comma separated list, so to see a few users that use tcsh as their shell:

 $ '''cut -d: -f1,7 /etc/passwd | grep /bin/tcsh | head -5'''
 iglass:/bin/tcsh
 svowell:/bin/tcsh
 dsedaris:/bin/tcsh
 skine:/bin/tcsh
 jhitt:/bin/tcsh

===Tricky delimiters===

The space character is a common delimiter. Unfortunately, your shell probably discards all extra whitespace on the command line. You can sneak a space character past your shell by wrapping it in quotes, like: &lt;tt&gt;cut -d&quot; &quot; -f 5&lt;/tt&gt;

The tab character is another common delimiter. It can be hard to spot, because on the screen it just looks like any other white space. The &lt;tt&gt;od&lt;/tt&gt; (octal dump) command can give you insight into the precise formatting of a file. For instance I have a file which maps first names to genders (with 95% probability). When casually inspected, it looks like fixed width data:

 $ '''head -5 gender.txt'''
 AARON           M 
 ABBEY           F 
 ABBIE           F 
 ABBY            F 
 ABDUL           M

But on closer inspection there are tab characters delimiting the columns:

 $ '''od -bc gender.txt | head'''
 0000000 101 101 122 117 116 040 040 040 040 040 040 011 115 012 101 102 
           A   A   R   O   N                          \t   M   \n  A   B 
 0000020 102 105 131 040 040 040 040 040 040 011 106 012 101 102 102 111 
           B   E   Y                          \t   F  \n   A   B   B   I 
 0000040 105 040 040 040 040 040 040 011 106 012 101 102 102 131 040 040 
           E                          \t   F  \n   A   B   B   Y 
 0000060 040 040 040 040 040 011 106 012 101 102 104 125 114 040 040 040 
                              \t   F  \n   A   B   D   U   L 
 0000100 040 040 040 011 115 012 101 102 105 040 040 040 040 040 040 040 
                      \t   M  \n   A   B   E

The first thing to do is read your system's manpage on &quot;cut&quot;: it may already delimit by tab by default.  If not, it requires a bit of trickery to get a tab character past your shell to the cut command. First, many shells have a feature called tab completion; when you hit tab they don't actually insert a tab, instead they attempt to figure out which file, directory or command you want and type that instead. In many shells you can overcome this special functionality by typing a control-v first. Whatever character you type after the control-v is literally inserted. Like a space character, you need to protect the tab character with quotes or the shell will discard it like any other white space separating pieces of the command line.

So to get the ratio of male first names to female first names I might run the following commands. Between the double quotes I typed control-v and then hit tab.

 $ '''wc -l gender.txt'''
 5017 gender.txt 
 $ '''cut -d&quot; &quot; -f2 gender.txt | grep M | wc -l''' 
 1051 
 $ '''cut -d&quot; &quot; -f2 gender.txt | grep F | wc -l''' 
 3966

Apparently there's much more variation in female names than male names.

If your system's cut command delimits on tab, the above command becomes simply 
'''cut -f2 gender.txt'''.

Cellular apoptosis is programmed cell death. The concept has been studied for a century but the idea of programmed cell death was first identified in 1964, and the greek term apoptosis referring to the falling of leaves in autumn coined to describe the process in 1972.  In the average human 50 to 70 billion cells undergo aptoptosis, which makes room for cell renewal.  Physiologic growth and development as well as tissue homeostatis rely on this ability. Injury results in a period of rapid cell proliferation which can extend over weeks yet at the end of several weeks, there may be the number of cells as there were a few weeks into the process, due to concommitant apoptosis.  Orchestrated cell death and proliferation is going on similtaneously.

Under certain conditions a given cell needs to shut down for good,   Blunt trauma to cartilage of sufficient severity is associated by apoptosis of 35% of the cells.   In vivo models of osteonecrosis of the femoral head due to glucocorticoids is associated with cellular apoptosis of the osteocyte with resultant loss of their mechanosensing function and with that loss of structural integrity resulting in joint collapse. The apoptosis caused by glucocorticoids in some cell lines in prevented by inhibiting protein synthesis, a point which emphasizes the active nature of the process.  Many oncologic treatments work by inducing apoptosis in the neoplastic cell.    

If there is a catastrophic failure, say a car crash for instance, if the engine is still going, the concern is for fire or explosion, in other words, wide spread damage due to the continued functioning of the aparatus.  It may be that programmed cell death is useful overall in a similar way.  If there is sufficient damage to a cell its continued function may it be detrimental to the organism as a whole making programmed cell death the best option.  

If you have a breakdown say on a boat far away from land, it may be necessary to pirate the parts from something non essential in order to get the sail or the engine to work.  In some cartilage injuries, especially if the full thickness of the cartilage is not violated, there is no migration of pluripotential cells to the sight of injury.  The cells that undergo apoptosis, do they provide a local reservoir for recycling of parts, allowing for an in situ healing process?

If a virus infects a cell it takes over the reproductive aparatus for its own purpose.  In such a case would not a mechanism for programmed cell death be desirable. Extrinsic triggering of apoptosis in an infected cell or a cell that had undergone malignant transformation is an essential defense mechanism. Not surprisingly then, the search word apoptosis in HighWire Press generates over one hundred thousand references.  

Apoptosis is different than necrosis.  It is an active process and highly regulated, an orchestrated suicide rather than an accidental demise of the cell. The process requires specific effectors, studies implicate an intrinsic mechanism involving translocation of the cytochome c aparatus from the mitochondria initiated by a cascade of proteases called caspases.  When the effectors are lost apoptosis may fail to occur and the cell continues to proliferate, evading the apoptosis inducing defense mechanism.  We can't get to the shut down switch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
Think of the difference between a textbook and a self-help book. A textbook is &lt;i&gt;descriptive&lt;/i&gt;. Generally established facts and theories are presented from an unbiased, neutral point of view. Facts are referenced to published sources, preferably from peer-reviewed journals. Textbooks are written in the third person. This Wikibook is based on a large foundation of descriptive material.

In contrast, self-help books are &lt;i&gt;prescriptive&lt;/i&gt;. Such books tell you what to do. They also critique established theories, and present new ideas or untested hypotheses. All this can be done in this Wikibook, but please follow some guidelines so that readers don't confuse descriptive and prescriptive material.

==Discussion Pages==

Every page of this Wikibook has an associated discussion page. Just click on the link &quot;Discuss this page.&quot;

Discussion pages are for asking questions, critiquing ideas or material, contributing personal experiences, or contributing new ideas or untested hypotheses. Please sign your contributions to the discussion pages.

You can see whether there's anything on a discussion page by the color of the link. if the link &quot;Discuss this page&quot; is red, then the discussion page is blank. But if the link is blue or purple, there's a material on the discussion page.

==Signing Your Contribution==
&lt;p&gt;Almost anything you add to this Wikibook should either have a footnote reference to a published source, or you should sign your name as the contributor. To sign your name, first log in. Then at the end of your contributed material type two dashes and four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

==Prescriptive Material, or &quot;Tell Me What To Do!&quot;==

Try to make your contributions descriptive, not prescriptive. Describe how a certain therapy is practiced, and how effective it is. Don't tell readers what therapy they should do. Tell readers about a good job interview you had, not what they should do in job interviews.

Many people find it easier to write in the second person, as if they were talking to a friend or client. If this gets your thoughts on paper, then do it. But then come back later and try to change into the third person. Or if you see material someone else wrote in the second person, you can try to change it into the third person.

One chapter is purely prescriptive, and it's not where you'd expect prescriptive material. The section &quot;Scientific Research&quot; ends with the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Research I'd Like to See|Research I'd Like to See]], in which you can tell researchers what research they should do. 

==Personal Experiences==

Self-help books include personal experiences, and are often written in the first person. This wikibook has many areas for you to contribute personal experiences, including [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/How We Treat Stuttering|How We Treat Stuttering]], [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/What Worked for Me|What Worked for Me]], and [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/My Life in Stuttering|My Life in Stuttering]].

To contribute a personal experience, either put it on a discussion page or add a section &quot;Personal Experiences with&amp;#133;&quot; at the end of any chapter.

==Critiques==

&lt;p&gt;Constructive criticism is a part of any growing field of knowledge. This wikibook includes areas for criticism, e.g., [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Stuttering Modification#Critiques of Stuttering Modification Therapy|Critiques of Stuttering Modification Therapy]].&lt;/p&gt;

To contribute a critique, either put it on a discussion page or add a section &quot;Critiques of&amp;#133;&quot; at the end of any chapter.

&lt;p&gt;Don't write libelous or disparaging remarks. You may write factual statements (&quot;Dr. Balderdash is 58 years old&quot;), or your personal opinions and experiences (&quot;Therapy with Dr. Balderdash was the worst experience of my life&quot;), or ask questions (&quot;Does Dr. Balderdash have rocks in her head?&quot;). You may &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; write disparaging statements that appear to be factual (&quot;Dr. Balderdash is the worst speech-language pathologist in the world.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

*Wikipedia article about [[w:Slander and libel|libel and slander]]

==Temporary Comments==

&lt;i&gt;In a few places I injected a personal experience, critique, or untested hypothesis into descriptive material. I set off such paragraphs in italics by starting the paragraph with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and ending the paragraph with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I also signed such paragraphs. Such paragraphs should be short&amp;#151;no more than one paragraph&amp;#151;and temporary. If you write such a paragraph, try to come back later and replace it with documented description, or move the paragraph to a discussion page. Do the same with such paragraphs you find written by other people, especially if the date is more than a few months old.&lt;/i&gt;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 21:08, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

==Linking to Other Chapters or External Websites==

&lt;p&gt;In general, links in text should be to other Wikimedia, e.g., another chapter of this Wikibook, or to an article on Wikipedia. Links to any other websites should be in a separate section at the bottom of a chapter, entitled &quot;External Links.&quot; However, this rule doesn't have to be followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikimedia links also start and end with double brackets, e.g.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/How to Participate in this Wikibook]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;links to this chapter. The location of a chapter is always in large, bold type at the top of the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to external websites starts and end with single brackets, e.g.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://www.stutteringhelp.org Stuttering Foundation of America] (http://www.stutteringhelp.org)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put the website's URL in parantheses after the link so that readers who print out this book to read will get the links.&lt;/p&gt;

==Referencing Published Material==

&lt;p&gt;Adding footnote references is done in two parts. Next to the text, add 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ref|Author1995}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at the end of chapter add&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# {{note|Author1995}}Author, Arthur. &quot;The Art of Footnotes,&quot; Journal of References, July 1995, page 47.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other  Text Formating Codes==

*[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|Instructions for writing and editing wikipages]]

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the HTML computer language to format text.&lt;/p&gt;

==Stutterer or PWS?==

Some people prefer to say &quot;person who stutters&quot; (PWS) instead of &quot;stutterer.&quot; Either way is acceptable.

The term &quot;consumer&quot; can mean an adult stutterer, usually receiving speech therapy services, or a child who stutters, or the parent of a child who stutters.

Please use the term &quot;speech-language pathologist&quot; or SLP, or &quot;speech and language therapist&quot; not &quot;speech pathologist,&quot; &quot;speech therapist,&quot; or  &quot;[[w:Pathologist|pathologist]].&quot;

{{ TODO|todonote = a) create a table for data types b) explain them.}}
==D Data Types==

If you look directly at the content of a computer's memory, you see only a lot of bytes. These are often shown as numbers but in fact they don't have a meaning on its own, not even the meaning of a number.

Types are used in computer languages like D to give one byte or a sequence of bytes a meaning. Types define if these bytes are a number, a text, a date or whatever.


===Basic Types===
====Void Type====
*void 
====Boolean Type====
*bool
====Integer Types==== 
Provided types are:

*byte 
*ubyte 
*short 
*ushort 
*int 
*uint 
*long 
*ulong 
*cent (reserved for future use)
*ucent (reserved for future use)


Each type has a size in bits which defines how many different values(=states) it can hold.

An 8 bit type, for instance, can store 256 different states, while a 16 bit type can store 65536.


The sizes of the types are:

{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| '''Name'''
| '''Size in Bits'''
| '''Size in Octets'''
| '''Min'''
| '''Max'''
| '''Comment'''
|-
|byte
|8
|1
| -128
| +127
|-
|short
|16
|2
| -32768
| +32767
|-
|int
|32
|4
| -2147483648
| +2147483647
|-
|long
|64
|8
| -9223372036854775808
| +9223372036854775807
|-
|cent
|128
|16
| -170141183460469231731687303715884105728
| +170141183460469231731687303715884105727
|-
|}


Each type exists as signed and unsigned variant. The unsigned ones have an &quot;u&quot; prefix (like ''uint'', ''ubyte'').

Unsigned means that the range of possible states is interpreted as nonnegative values starting at 0 and going up to the maximum number of possible states for this type minus 1 because the 0 is also a state which must be stored.

For the ''ubyte'' type (8 bit = 256 states) this means it can store values from 0 up to and including 255.

Signed types interpret one half of their states as positive, the other half as negative values, so the signed ''byte'' type has a range of values from -128 to +127.

====Floating-Point Types==== 
*float 
*double 
*real 
*ifloat 
*idouble 
*ireal 
*cfloat 
*cdouble 
*creal

====Character Types====
A ''character'' is a unit of [[information]] that roughly corresponds to a grapheme-like unit, or symbol, such as in an [[alphabet]] in the [[written language|written]] form of a [[natural language]].
The concept also includes [[control character]]s, such as [[carriage return]].

Characters are typically combined into [[string (computer science)|string]]s.

D language allows to directly handle Unicode strings.

*char (to handle UTF8 code units)
*wchar (to handle UTF16 code units) 
*dchar (to handle UTF32 code units)

===Derived Types===
*pointer 
*array 
*associative array 
*function 
*delegate

===User Defined Types===
*alias 
*typedef 
*enum 
*struct 
*union 
*class

      <text xml:space="preserve">The trimean is a resistant measure of central tendency.

Instead of focusing on the median, the trimean is calculated by adding twice the sum of the median to the sum of the 25th percentile and 75th percentile and then divide the sum by four.

(25%ile + 2* 50%ile + 75%ile) / 4 = Trimean

John Tukey came up with this in a 1982 publication.  This is part of the family of L-Estimates which are statistics based on linear combination of the order statistics.  

Because it depends on order statistics it is a robust measure, but by including the 25%ile and 75%ile this lowers the breakdown value of the measure.

Hello there AK7,

I've just read you post on the C++ Talk, there is already some info on specific IDEs and more would be great but that is not the main point or the primary objective of the book, but we do intend on having more info on them...

Please see if you can move your post to the right discussion area, as it is signed I did not do so myself... sorry and txs
(you probably didn't see the info present on the page on that subject. If you think you can make it more evident to editors please, see what can be done about it, once again txs)

For your first language you should pick a easy one, see about Python it can be learned in 12 hours and you can do anything with it, from small scripts to ful games (I think there is a book here on Python but if you can't find any info try [[User:Panic2k4|my user page]] and check my del.icio.us url database on Python. If you intend on learning C++ or if you liked Python the best IDE at the moment if you are using windows is MS Visual Studio 2005 (you can get it free at MS site, the Express Edition) if you are on another OS you can check out Code::Blocks or Eclipse if you have a quick machine (the latest is Java based), in any case stay away from any .NET derived languages, you can for instance use Iron Python in .NET after if you feel like it...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:34, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">So far we've seen how to use cut, grep and wc to select and count records with certain qualities. But each set of records we'd like to count requires a separate command, as with counting the numbers of male and female names in the most recent example. Combining the uniq and sort commands allows us to count many groups at once.

==uniq and sort==

The &lt;tt&gt;uniq&lt;/tt&gt; command squashes out contiguous duplicate lines. That is, it copies from its standard input to its standard output, but if a line is identical to the immediately preceding line, the duplicate line is not written. For example:

 $ '''cat foo'''
 a 
 a
 a
 b
 b
 a
 a
 a
 c
 $ '''uniq foo'''
 a
 b
 a
 c

Note that 'a' is written twice because &lt;tt&gt;uniq&lt;/tt&gt; compares only to the immediately preceding line. If the data is sorted first, we get each distinct record just once:

 $ '''sort foo | uniq'''
 a
 b
 c

Finally, giving the &lt;tt&gt;-c&lt;/tt&gt; option causes &lt;tt&gt;uniq&lt;/tt&gt; to write counts associated with each distinct entry:

 $ '''sort foo | uniq -c'''
 6 a
 2 b
 1 c

Sorting a CSV file by an arbitrary column is easy as well:
 $ '''cat file.csv'''
 a, 10, 0.5
 b, 20, 0.1
 c, 14, 0.01
 d, 55, 0.23
 e, 94, 0.78
 f, 1,  0.34
 g, 75, 1.0
 h, 3,  2.0
 i, 12, 1.5
 $ '''sort -n -t&quot;,&quot; -k 2 file.csv'''
 f, 1,  0.34
 h, 3,  2.0
 a, 10, 0.5
 i, 12, 1.5
 c, 14, 0.01
 b, 20, 0.1
 d, 55, 0.23
 g, 75, 1.0
 e, 94, 0.78
 $ '''sort -n -t&quot;,&quot; -k 3 file.csv'''
 c, 14, 0.01
 b, 20, 0.1
 d, 55, 0.23
 f, 1,  0.34
 a, 10, 0.5
 e, 94, 0.78
 g, 75, 1.0
 i, 12, 1.5
 h, 3,  2.0

==Example - Creating a histogram==

The combination of &lt;tt&gt;sort&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;uniq -c&lt;/tt&gt; is extremely powerful. It allows one to create histograms from virtually any record oriented text data. Returning to the name to gender mapping of the previous chapter, we could have gotten the count of male and female names in one command like this:

 $ '''cut -d&quot; &quot; -f2 gender.txt | sort | uniq -c'''
 3966 F
 1051 M

==Example - Creating another histogram==

And returning to the census data, we can now easily compute the complete distribution of occupants per household:

 $ '''grep &quot;^H&quot; pums_53.dat  | cut -c106-107 | sort | uniq -c'''
 1796 00
 7192 01
 7890 02
 3551 03
 3195 04
 1391 05
  518 06
  190 07
   79 08
   39 09
   14 10
   14 11
    3 12
    3 13

==Example - Verifying a primary key==

This is a good opportunity to point out a big benefit of being able to play with data in this fashion. It allows you to quickly spot potential problems in a dataset. In the above example, why are there 1,796 households with 0 occupants? As another example of quickly verifying the integrity of data, let's make sure that household id is truly a unique identifier:

 $ grep &quot;^H&quot; pums_53.dat | cut -c2-8 | sort | uniq -c | grep -v &quot;^ *1 &quot; | wc -l
 0

This &lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;/tt&gt; invocation will print only lines that do not (because of the &lt;tt&gt;-v&lt;/tt&gt; flag) begin with a series of spaces followed by a 1 (the count from &lt;tt&gt;uniq -c&lt;/tt&gt;) followed by a tab (entered using the control-v trick). Since the number of lines written is zero, we know that each household id occurs once and only once in the file.

The technique of grepping uniq's output for lines with a certain count is generally useful. One other common application is finding the set of overlapping (duplicated) keys in a pair of files by grepping the output of uniq -c for lines that begin with a 2.

==Example - A histogram sorted by most common category==

Throwing an extra sort on the end of the pipeline will sort the histogram so that the most common class is at the top (or bottom). This is useful when data is categorical and does not have a natural order. You'll want to give sort the &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt; option so that it sorts the counts numerically instead of lexically, and I like to give the &lt;tt&gt;-r&lt;/tt&gt; option to reverse the sort so that the output is sorted in descending order, but this just a stylistic issue. For example, here is the distribution of household heating fuel from most common to least common:

 $ '''grep &quot;^H&quot; pums_53.dat | cut -c132 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn'''
 12074 3
  7007 1
  3161 
  1372 6 
  1281 4 
   757 2
   170 8
    43 9

Type 3, electricity, is most common, followed by type 1, gas. Type 7 is solar power.

==Converting the histogram to proper CSV==

The output of uniq -c is not in proper CSV form.  This makes is necessary to convert the output if further operations on the output are wanted.
Here we use a bit of inline perl to rewrite the lines and reverse the order of the fields.

 $ '''cut -d&quot; &quot; -f2 gender.txt | sort | uniq -c | perl -pe 's/^\s*([0-9]+) (\S+).*/$2, $1/' '''
 F, 3966
 M, 1051

==Command Line perl==

A tutorial on perl is beyond the scope of this document; if you don't know perl, you should learn at least a little bit. If you invoke perl like &lt;tt&gt;perl -n -e '#a perl statement'&lt;/tt&gt; the &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt; option causes &lt;tt&gt;perl&lt;/tt&gt; to wrap your &lt;tt&gt;-e&lt;/tt&gt; argument in a implicit while loop like this:

 while (&lt;&gt;) {
    # a perl statement
 }

This loop reads standard input a line at a time into the variable $_, and then executes the statement(s) give by the -e argument. Given &lt;tt&gt;-p&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;perl&lt;/tt&gt; to adds a print statement to the loop as well:

 while (&lt;&gt;) {
    # a perl statement
    print $_;
 }

==Example - Using perl to create an indicator variable==

Education level is recorded in columns 53-54 as ordered set of categories, where 11 and above indicates a college degree. Let's condense this to a single indicator variable for completed college or not. The raw data:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c53-54 | head -5'''
 12
 11
 06
 03
 08

And once passed through the perl script:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c53-54 |''' 
 '''perl -ne 'print $_&gt;=11?1:0,&quot;\n&quot;' | head -5'''
 1
 1
 0
 0
 0

And the final result:

 ~/census_data&gt;'''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c53-54 |'''
 '''perl -ne 'print $_&gt;=11?1:0,&quot;\n&quot;' | sort | uniq -c'''
 37507 0
 21643 1

About 36% of Washingtonians have a college degree.

==Example - computing conditional probability of membership in two sets==

Let's look at the relationship between education level and whether or not people ride their bikes to work. People's mode of transportation to work is encoded as a series of categories in columns 191-192, where category 9 indicates a bicycle. We'll use an inline perl script to rewrite both education level and mode of transportation:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c53-54,191-192 | '''
 '''perl -ne 'print substr($_,0,2)&gt;=11?1:0,substr($_,2,2)==9?1:0,&quot;\n&quot;;' | '''
 '''sort | uniq -c''' 
 37452 00
    55 01
 21532 10
   111 11

55/(55+36447) = 0.15% of non college educated people ride their bike to work.  111/(111+20219) = 0.56% of college educated people ride their bike to work.

Sociological interpretation is left as an exercise for the reader.

==Example - A histogram with custom bucket size==

Suppose we wanted to take a look at distribution of personal incomes. The normal trick of sort and uniq would work, but the personal income in the census data has resolution down to the $10 level, so the output would be very long and it would be hard to quickly see the pattern. We can use perl to round the income data down to the nearest $10,000 on the fly. Before the inline perl script:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c297-303 | head -4'''
 0018000
 0004100
 0004300
 0005300

And after:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c297-303 | '''
 '''perl -pe '$_=10000*int($_/10000).&quot;\n&quot;' | head -4'''
 10000
 0
 0
 0

And finally, the distribution (up to $100,000). The extra grep [0-9] ensures that blank records are not considered in the distribution.

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c297-303 | grep [0-9] |'''
 '''perl -pe '$_=10000*int($_/10000).&quot;\n&quot;' | sort -n | uniq -c | head -12'''
    20 -10000
 15193      0
  8038  10000
  6776  20000
  5436  30000
  3685  40000
  2370  50000
  1536  60000
   899  70000
   521  80000
   326  90000
   283 100000

==Example - Finding the median (or any percentile) of a distribution==

If we sort all the incomes in order and had a way to pluck out the middle number, we could easily get the median. I'll give two ways to do this. The first uses cat -n. If given the -n option, cat prepends line numbers to each line. We see that there are 46,359 non blank records, so the 23179th one in sorted order is the median.

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c297-303 | grep [0-9] | wc -l'''
 46359 
 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c297-303 | grep [0-9] | sort | '''
 '''cat -n | grep &quot;^ *23179&quot;'''
 23179 0019900

An even simpler method, using head and tail:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c297-303 | grep [0-9] | sort |'''
 '''head -23179| tail -1'''
 0019900

The median income in Washington state in 2000 was $19,900.

==Example - Finding the average of a distribution==

What about the average? One way to compute the average is to accumulate a running sum with perl, and do the division by hand at the end:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c297-303 | grep [0-9] | '''
 '''perl -ne 'print  $sum+=$_,&quot;\n&quot;;' | cat -n | tail -1'''
 46359 1314603988

$1314603988/ 46359 = $28357.0393666818

You could also get &lt;tt&gt;perl&lt;/tt&gt; to do this division with an END block which perl will execute only after it has exhausted standard input:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c297-303 | grep [0-9] | '''
 '''perl -ne '$sum += $_; $count++; END {print $sum/$count,&quot;\n&quot;;}' '''
 28357.0393666818

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Example - creating a scatter plot==

Does the early bird get the worm? Let's look at the relationship between the time a person leaves for work and their income. Income is recorded in columns 297-303, and the time a person leaves for work is recorded in columns 196-198, encoded in ten minute intervals. This pipeline extracts, cleans and formats the data:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c196-198,297-303 | grep -v &quot;^000&quot; | '''
 '''grep -v &quot; $&quot; | perl -pe 'substr($_,3,0)=&quot; &quot;;' &gt; time_vs_income'''

The greps knock out records for which either field is null, and the perl script inserts a space between the two columns so gnuplot can parse the columns apart. Plotting in gnuplot is simple:

 $ '''gnuplot'''
 
         G N U P L O T
         Linux version 3.7 patchlevel 1
         last modified Fri Oct 22 18:00:00 BST 1999
 
 Terminal type set to 'x11'
 gnuplot&gt; '''plot 'time_vs_income' with points'''

And the resulting plot:

[[Image:Time_vs_income.gif]]

Recall that 0 on the x-axis is midnight, and 20 is 200 minutes after midnight or about 3:20am. Increased density in the beginning of the traditional 1st and 2nd shift periods is apparent. Folks who work regular business hours clearly have higher incomes. It would be interesting to compute the average income in each time bucket, but that makes a pretty hairy command line perl script. Here is it in all its gruesome glory:

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c196-198,297-303 | grep -v &quot;^000&quot; | '''
 '''grep -v &quot; $&quot; | perl -ne '/(\d{3})(\d{7})/; $sum{$1}+=$2; $count{$1}++; END { foreach $k'''
 '''(keys(%count)) {print $k,&quot; &quot;,$sum{$k}/$count{$k},&quot;\n&quot;}}' | sort -n &gt; time_vs_avgincome'''

You can plot the result for yourself if you're curious.

==Example - Creating a bar chart with gnuplot==

Let's look at historic immigration rates among Washingtonians. Year of immigration is recorded in columns 78-81, and 0000 means the person is a native born citizen. We can apply the usual tricks with cut, grep, sort, and uniq, but it's a bit hard to see the patterns when scrolling back and forth in text output, it would nicer if we could see a plot.

 $ cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c78-81 | grep -v 0000 | sort | uniq -c | head -10
  2 1910
  7 1914
 12 1919
  7 1920
  6 1921
  5 1922
  7 1923
  5 1924
  8 1925

Gnuplot is a fine graphing tool for this purpose, but it wants the category label to come first, and the count to come second, so we need to write a perl script to reverse uniq's output and stick the result in a file. See perlrun(1) for details on the -a and -F options to perl.

 $ '''cat pums_53.dat | grep &quot;^P&quot; | cut -c78-81 | grep -v 0000 | sort | uniq -c |'''
 '''perl -lape 'chomp $F[-1]; $_ = join &quot; &quot;, reverse @F' &gt; year_of_immigration'''

Now we can make a bar chart from the contents of the file with gnuplot.

 gnuplot&gt; '''plot 'year_of_immigration' with impulses'''

Here's the graph gnuplot creates:

[[Image:Year_of_immigration.gif]]

Be a bit careful interpreting this plot, only people who are still alive can be counted, so it naturally goes up and to the right (people who immigrated more recently have a better chance of still being alive). That said, there seems to have been an increase in immigration after the end of World War II, and also a spike after the end if the Vietnam war. I remain at a loss to explain the spike around 1980, consult your local historian.

      <comment>/* Model */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The one-way ANOVA F-test is used to identify if there are differences between subject effects. For instance, to investigate the effect of a certain new drug on the number of white blood cells, in an experiment the drug is given to three different groups, one of healthy people, one with people with a light form of the considered disease and one with a severe form of the disease. Generally the '''an'''alysis '''o'''f '''va'''riance identifies whether there is a significant difference in effect of the drug on the number of white blood cells between the groups. Significant refers to the fact that there will always be difference between the groups and also within the groups, but the purpose is to investigate whether the difference between the groups are large compared to the differences within the groups. To set up such an experiment three assumptions must be validated before calculating an F statistic: independent samples, homogeneity of variance, and normality. The first assumption suggests that there is no relation between the measurements for different subjects. Homogeneity of variance refers to equal variances among the different groups in the experiment (e.g., drug vs. placebo). Furthermore, the assumption of normality suggests that the distribution of each of these groups should be approximately normally distributed.

==Model==
The situation is modelled in the following way. The measurement of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th test person in group &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is indicated by:khalil kakayi

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ij}=\mu+\alpha_i+U_{ij}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

This reads: the outcome of the measurement for &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in group &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is due to a general effect indicated by &lt;math&gt;\mu\,&lt;/math&gt;, an effect due to the group, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i\,&lt;/math&gt; and an individual contribution &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The individual, or random, contributions &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}\,&lt;/math&gt;, often referred to as ''disturbances'', are considered to be independently, normally distributed, all with expected value 0 and standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

To make the model unambiguous the group effects are restrained by the condition:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i\alpha_i=0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Now. a notational note: it is common practice to indicate averages over one or more indices by writing a dot in the place of the index or indices.  So for instance
:&lt;math&gt;X_{i.} = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{j=1} X_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

The analysis of variance now divides the total &quot;variance&quot; in the form of the total &quot;sum of squares&quot; in two parts, one due to the variation within the groups and one due to the variation between the groups:

:&lt;math&gt;SST=\sum_{ij}(X_{ij}-X{..})^2=\sum_{ij}(X_{ij}-X_{i.}+X_{i.}-X{..})^2=
\sum_{ij}(X_{ij}-X_{i.})^2+\sum_{ij}(X_{i.}-X{..})^2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

We see the term sum of squares of error:

:&lt;math&gt;SSE=\sum_{ij}(X_{ij}-X_{i.})^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

of the total squared differences of the individual measurements from their group averages, as an indication of the variation within the groups, and the term sum of square of the factor

:&lt;math&gt;SSA=\sum_{ij}(X_{i.}-X{..})^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

of the total squared differences of the group means from the overall mean, as an indication of the variation between the groups.

Under the null hypothesis of no effect:

:&lt;math&gt;H_0: \forall_i\ \alpha_i=0&lt;/math&gt;

we find:

:&lt;math&gt;SSE/\sigma^2\,&lt;/math&gt; is chi-square distributed with a(m-1) degrees of freedom, and
:&lt;math&gt;SSA/\sigma^2\,&lt;/math&gt; is chi-square distributed with a-1 degrees of freedom, 

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the number of groups and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of persons in each group.

Hence the quotient of the so-called mean sum of squares:

:&lt;math&gt;MSA=\frac{SSA}{a-1}&lt;/math&gt; 
and
:&lt;math&gt;MSE=\frac{SSE}{a(m-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

may be used as a test statistic

:&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{MSA}{MSE}&lt;/math&gt;

which under the null hypothesis is F-distributed with &lt;math&gt;a-1&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom in the nominator and &lt;math&gt;a(m-1)&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator, because the unknown parameter &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; does not play a role since it is cancelled out in the quotient.

In each case the content of the pages beginning Bartending/Cocktails has already been merged into another article linked from [[Bartending/Cocktails]], which is why I believe the old links to be unnecessary. However, I will discuss this with the main authors of the book.

Incidentally, when linking to Wikibooks, I strongly recommend always linking to the book's title. Other pages in any book are subject to significant change (such as the merging of articles here followed by deletion of the old location spaces). On Wikibooks, whilst we tend to have redirects for book titles and bookshelves, we don't for pages and chapters of books (if we did we'd have more redirects than articles!).

== Cocktails ==

Just to note that if you are transwiki'ing a cocktail, first you transwiki it to [[Transwiki:Name given in Wikipedia]], and then move that page to [[Bartending/Cocktails/Name of cocktail]] before linking it in, as appropriate to the right subpage of [[Bartending/Cocktails]], [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:52, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

:That's right. The Bartending book needs a bit of TLC at the moment - but I'm hoping that come June (or later) it will be a book of the month. This means some consolidation. As noted before, when linking to wikibooks, it's best to link through to the book title (ie to [[Bartending]]) rather than any of its subpages. That's because book structures change, sometimes dramatically, whereas book titles tend to be static, and then have redirects remain when they are moved. I'm happy clearing out anything in the Transwiki: pseudo-namespace if you want. Alternatively, feel free to add them direct to [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary]] and add the contributors to [[Bartending/Contributors]]. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:21, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">At the moment the equations explaining how the equation for the resulting force is derived is a little unclear. that is each of the seperate lines interfere with each other making it hard to make out what is in each line. i think that a bit of space should be left inbetween each line to rectify this problem.[[User:194.205.255.98|194.205.255.98]] 08:42, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

Are we not using integral calculus here?  If we can use integral calculus, we should, instead of (for example) assuming constant force in the definition for impulse;  it really is  &quot;the integral over time of force * dt&quot; with the correct notation, which i don't know how to do in latex.  --[[User:Bmk|Bmk]] 03:50, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

'''Rendang''' is made from beef or water buffalo meat slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices. Thick coconut milk used in cooking produces delicious spicy condiments which is more delicious than the meat itself.

==Ingredients==
* 1 kg beef cut into big cubes to make 20 pieces
* 4 [[Cookbook:Kaffir Lime Leaf|lime leaves]] 
* 1 stalk [[Cookbook:Lemongrass|lemongrass]] 
* 2 liter ready-to-use [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut milk]] or coconut milk from 1 big fresh coconut

Spice paste, using food processor grind the following ingredients:
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] 
* 4 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
* 25 g [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] 
* 15 g [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] 
* 75 g young [[Cookbook:Galangal|galangal]] 
* 1 tbl. [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|ground fresh red chili pepper]] 
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
* 1/2 dried [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Candlenut|candlenut]] 
* 1/2 tbl. salt
* 1 tbs. [[Cookbook:Gula Jawa|Gula Jawa]] (Indonesian Palm Sugar)

==Procedure==
#Marinate meat with the spice paste for at least 1 hour
#In a pan, stir occasionally while cooking coconut milk over slow fire until some oil surfaces from the coconut milk (at least for 20 minutes)
#Put 300 cc of coconut milk to cover the marinated meat and all the spices (including lime leaves and lemon grass) in a big wok (the bigger the better) and cook over slow to medium fire while occasionally stir the ingredients until half of the coconut milk is evaporated
#Pour 100 cc of coconut milk and stir until almost all of the coconut milk is evaporated
#Keep on stirring and pouring the rest of the coconut milk, 100 cc at a time
#Cook for until the meat is tender (at least one and a half hour) and almost all the liquid from the coconut milk is evaporated and turned into spicy condiments

==Notes, tips and variations==
*When cooled, the coconut oil in the rendang may solidify. Reheat in a pan before serving. A reheated rendang often has better flavor
*Fresh coconut milk produces a better gravy
*Chicken or mutton can be used in place of beef
*Beef liver may be used but produces a darker gravy

      <text xml:space="preserve">The midrange is defined as the average of the high and the low observations in a dataset.  Because it is a linear combination of order statistics, it falls in the class of L-estimates.  

Although it uses order statistics in its calculation, the statistic can be influenced by a single bad observation on the high or low side.

      <text xml:space="preserve"># Go is played on a 19x19 square grid of points, by two players called Black and White. 
# Each point on the grid may be colored black, white or empty. 
# A point P, not colored C, is said to reach C, if there is a path of (vertically or horizontally) adjacent points of P's color from P to a point of color C. 
# Clearing a color is the process of emptying all points of that color that don't reach empty. 
# Starting with an empty grid, the players alternate turns, starting with Black. 
# A turn is either a pass; or a move that doesn't repeat an earlier grid coloring. 
# A move consists of coloring an empty point one's own color; then clearing the opponent color, and then clearing one's own color. 
# The game ends after two consecutive passes. 
# A player's score is the number of points of her color, plus the number of empty points that reach only her color. 
# The player with the higher score at the end of the game is the winner. Equal scores result in a tie.
Source: [[#Footnotes|John's Go Page]]

==Discussion==

The most common criticism of Tromp-Taylor rules is that they do not describe a method for removing &quot;dead stones&quot; from the board. If both players are required to play until all stones on the board are alive&lt;sup&gt;[[#Footnotes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;,
* games can be very tedious to play or to watch
* it becomes a waste of time to continue once both players know the eventual outcome of the game
* computer programs that are designed with [[Computer Go/Japanese rules|Japanese rules]] in mind may not even be able to play to that point without a significant redesign

===Removing dead stones===

After two consecutive passes, stones which both players agree could eventually be captured are removed from the board. But what if there are stones on the board that one player believes could eventually be captured, but the other player disagrees?

''Note: in practice, disagreements between humans are extremely rare. Novice players frequently make mistakes in determining which stones could eventually be captured, but they do not typically disagree. It is a considerably more significant problem in Computer Go, where novice programs are less skilled than any human. Programs which pass and then do not agree on which stones are alive make Computer Go look ridiculous to most human players.''

===Third-party mediation===

The simplest solution is to use a third-party in cases of disagreement. This third-party could be a human judge, or a computer program that is capable of automatically determining which stones could eventually be captured.

'''Potential problems:'''
* The third-party may be incorrect or biased, especially if the third-party is a computer program
* It may be too time-consuming or take too many resources to have a third-party judge (for example in large tournaments, or on automated servers where hundreds of games end every minute)
* There may not even be a third-party available

===Chinese rules===

After two consecutive passes, if there is a disagreement, the disagreement must be settled by further actual play. In a programmatic environment, this may look something like this:
* Both players provide a list of all the stones they believe could eventually be captured.
* If the lists differ, play continues, starting with the player who first passed.
* If both players immediately pass again (thus making four consecutive passes), the game is over and all stones on the board are considered alive.
* If later in the game both players again pass, the process is repeated.

Note that this can never result in an infinite loop, because each time through this process another stone must be added to the board or the game ends.

'''Potential Problems:'''
* In timed games, one player may run out of time and lose while trying to capture stones that are obviously dead. In some circumstances, &quot;clean-up&quot; moves can involve life-and-death problems that take considerable time, especially for computer programs, to play through properly.

===Japanese rules===

After two consecutive passes, disagreements must be settled by further play, much like Chinese rules. However, since this may alter the score of the game under territory scoring, the board position that existed at the end of the two passes must be copied to a second board, and the disputed position resolved on that board. The resultant state of any disputed group(s)&amp;mdash;alive or dead&amp;mdash;is then applied to the group on the original board, and the second board discarded.

'''Potential Problems:'''
* In addition to the problems with the Chinese rules solution, it is inconvenient to duplicate the board position in order to play out disputed positions. Most computer programs are not designed to do this sort of dispute resolution, and most protocols are not designed to support it.

===KGS Computer Go Tournament rules===

The KGS Computer Go Tournament rules are in essence identical to the Chinese rules, except that, after the first disagreement, the players are advised to manually capture all stones they believe are dead. After the next two consecutive passes, rather than repeating the process, the game is immediately considered over and all stones on the board are counted alive and scored as such. See: http://www.weddslist.com/kgs/rules.html#gep

''Note: this protocol has been proposed but is not currently in use for KGS Computer Go Tournaments; currently disputes are resolved by third-party mediation.''

===Considerations===

When attempting to develop a sensible method of resolving the issue of dead stone disagreement, it may be helpful to keep a few points in mind:
* Some Go engines are very simplistic and do not or cannot produce an accurate list of dead stones. Any solution should not penalize such programs; it should elegantly fall back on the default Tromp-Taylor method of counting all stones on the board as alive.
* In the case where the two players are never able to agree on which stones could eventually be captured, the method should not allow an infinite loop, nor should it prevent a player from capturing stones that can indeed be captured.
* A solution should be able to resolve situations where all groups on the board are unsettled (for example, if there are only two or three stones on the board)
* A solution should take into account when:
** a player has one of their opponent's groups marked as dead when their opponent doesn't
** a player has one of their own groups marked as dead when their opponent doesn't
** any combination of the above

===Abusive Behavior===

It is feasible that a computer program (or a player) might:
* purposefully not provide an accurate list of dead stones, thus forcing their opponent to continue the game, hoping the opponent makes a mistake or loses on time
* place stones with no chance of survival inside of an opponent's large eye, hoping that the game will end with some of these ought-to-be-dead stones still on the board

These sorts of abusive behaviors &quot;make sense&quot; under many rulesets, but they are very annoying to humans in general. Tactics like these should be considered rude, but they should primarily be opposed socially, not programmatically. However, it is worthwhile to make sure that a proposed solution doesn't overly reward such behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Formalization sometimes seems an unneeded burden when learning something new, yet it is the main tool to pass scientific knowledge to others. An informal introduction into CA was already presented, now is time for a detailed formalization that will allow us to dig further into the theory of CA.

= Overview =

This book tries to mix rigorous mathematical formulae with self explanatory graphical representations of the same equations.

The formalization chapter is composed of the following sections:
# The '''[[Cellular_Automata/Mathematical_Model|mathematical model]]''' focuses on a general definition of one-dimensional cellular automata. At the end, it generalizes the theory to more than one dimension and functions that look more than one step into history.
# A '''[[Cellular_Automata/Neighborhood|neighborhood]]''' can be defined with general equations or can be described with a less general graphical definition. This chapter focuses on the last approach to describe the most common CA.
# A '''[[Cellular_Automata/Rule|rule]]''' is a common way to define transition functions, some common ways to define a rule are described here.
# A '''[[Cellular_Automata/Pattern|pattern]]''' is used to describe a part of the content of a cellular automaton. Since some CA have been studied in detail, some patterns have been observed frequently as well. This section describes common methods for describing patterns.

==Introduction==
{{main|w:La Marseillaise}}

==How To Read The Anthem==

You will not get much out of the anthem if you skim through it or only know the meanings of half the words. There are two ways you can read it. The first is to read the French text and English translation below. The second way will lead to a greater understanding of the anthem, but is more time consuming. Read a line, [http://translate.google.com/translate_t look up] words you don't know, then continue on to the next line. When you finish reading a verse, you should reread both in French and English to make sure you understand both the overall picture and each line. It may be necessary to repeat this several times. After reading the entire anthem once, quickly read it a second time. You should be able to reread it in no time at all. If you find yourself having trouble rereading the anthem, read it a third time until you are comfortable reading it.

'''(1)''' The sentence (in French) is inverted, the non-literal translation is : &quot;The bloody banner of tyranny is raised against/before us&quot; but it may be also &quot;Protect us against tyranny, The bloody banner is raised&quot;&lt;br&gt;
'''(2)''' Here and in the next line, this is often sung as ''&quot;nos&quot;'' (&quot;our&quot;) rather than ''&quot;vos&quot;'' (&quot;your&quot;); ''&quot;vos&quot;'' remains official.&lt;br&gt;
'''(3)''' ''&quot;la carrière&quot;'' (&quot;the career&quot;), that is, of being in the army.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Icon Guidelines=
This WikiProject maintains a complete collection of Apple icons for use as decoration and illustration. To keep this collection organized, its important to follow these procedures.

To add an Apple icon:
# Find the application in your applications folder
# Right-click it and choose &quot;Show Package Contents&quot;
# In the window that appears, go to Contents &gt; Resources
# Find and open the application's ICNS file
# In the drawer, select the 128x128 version
# Go to File &gt; Save As and save the file as a PNG on your desktop. Make sure the &quot;Alpha&quot; checkbox is checked.
# Upload the PNG to WikiBooks (remember to tag as a Fair Use logo!)
# Add the icon to the Icon Directory below

Make sure you upload the PNG with the correct title. For applications that came with Tiger, call the icon &quot;Tiger &lt;application&gt; Icon&quot;, even if the application is not just in Tiger. When a new version of the Mac OS arrives, all icons will be renamed Leopard, except those that changed between the releases, for which a Tiger and a Leopard version will be kept. Make sure you fix all links to the icon!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
A multiplexer is a device that brings the concept of a rotary switch in analog electronics to the digital side. It is a device which, based on some input, will change the connection of its other inputs to its outputs. Conceptually a digital multiplexers functionality is the same as an analog one, only it handles everything digitally. Because of the mathematical concept of combinatorix they can be used to replace chain logic circuits. However, this is not done frequently because multiplexer based logic has a comparably high propagation delay.

==Configuration==
:[[File:Decoder_Example.svg]]


The circuit above has 2 Control Lines A1Ao which can be used as 2 Selectors . Depend on the value of the Selectors only one of the Output Lines can be high . The circuit above has the capability to select the output line 

The operation of the circuit above can be summarized in the Truth Table below

:{|  width=50%
!  A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; !! D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 
|-
| 00 || 0001  
|- 
| 01 || 0010  
|- 
| 10 || 0100 
|- 
| 11 || 1000 
|- 
|}


In general
: 2 Selectors can select 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4 output lines
: 3 Selectors can select 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 output lines
: n Selectors can select 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; output lines

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
A counter is a device that generates some patterned binary value depending on a clock or some other pulsed input. There are three simple types of counters ripple and synchronous.[[

==Types of Counters==
===Ring Counters===
If the output of a shift register is fed back to the input. a ring counter results. The data pattern contained within the shift register will recirculate as long as clock pulses are applied. For example, the data pattern will repeat every four clock pulses in the figure below. However, we must load a data pattern. All 0's or all 1's doesn't count. Is a continuous logic level from such a condition useful?


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04375.png]


We make provisions for loading data into the parallel-in/ serial-out shift register configured as a ring counter below. Any random pattern may be loaded. The most generally useful pattern is a single 1.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04429.png]


Loading binary 1000 into the ring counter, above, prior to shifting yields a viewable pattern. The data pattern for a single stage repeats every four clock pulses in our 4-stage example. The waveforms for all four stages look the same, except for the one clock time delay from one stage to the next. See figure below.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04430.png]


The circuit above is a divide by 4 counter. Comparing the clock input to any one of the outputs, shows a frequency ratio of 4:1. How may stages would we need for a divide by 10 ring counter? Ten stages would recirculate the 1 every 10 clock pulses.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04431.png]


An alternate method of initializing the ring counter to 1000 is shown above. The shift waveforms are identical to those above, repeating every fourth clock pulse. The requirement for initialization is a disadvantage of the ring counter over a conventional counter. At a minimum, it must be initialized at power-up since there is no way to predict what state flip-flops will power up in. In theory, initialization should never be required again. In actual practice, the flip-flops could eventually be corrupted by noise, destroying the data pattern. A &quot;self correcting&quot; counter, like a conventional synchronous binary counter would be more reliable.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04432.png]


The above binary synchronous counter needs only two stages, but requires decoder gates. The ring counter had more stages, but was self decoding, saving the decode gates above. Another disadvantage of the ring counter is that it is not &quot;self starting&quot;. If we need the decoded outputs, the ring counter looks attractive, in particular, if most of the logic is in a single shift register package. If not, the conventional binary counter is less complex without the decoder.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04433.png]


The waveforms decoded from the synchronous binary counter are identical to the previous ring counter waveforms. The counter sequence is (QA QB) = (00 01 10 11).

===Ripple Counters===
Ripple counters are the simplest type of counters. They are nothing more than toggle flip flops connected in a chain to divide each others output frequency by two. The result is a binary count. They are called ripple counters because the new count ripples through them. The major disadvantage of ripple counters is that because of new count &quot;rippling&quot; through the flip flops all the bits of the count arrive at different times.

===Synchronous Counters===
Synchronous counters are simple state machines made out of flip flops and logic gates. They have two parts, a register made out of flip flops and a decoder made out of logic gates. A register is a simple group of flip flops that are all clocked at the same time. In this way they can hold the counters output value until the next clock cycle. The decoder, decodes the current count and generates the correct value for the next count to the flop flops. For example in a simple up counter the decoder would always output the current count plus one. The major advantage of Synchronous Counters is that all the bits of their output change at the same time.

[[w:Unit test|Unit testing]] is a great way to catch errors early in the development process, if you dedicate time to writing appropriate and useful tests.  As in other languages, Ruby provides a framework in its standard library for setting up, organizing, and running tests called Test::Unit.

There are other very popular testing frameworks, rspec and cucumber come to mind.

Specifically, Test::Unit provides three basic functionalities:

# A way to define basic pass/fail tests.
# A way to gather like tests together and run them as a group.
# Tools for running single tests or whole groups of tests.

== A Simple Introduction ==

First create a new class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# File:  simple_number.rb

class SimpleNumber

  def initialize(num)
    raise unless num.is_a?(Numeric)
    @x = num
  end

  def add(y)
    @x + y
  end

  def multiply(y)
    @x * y
  end

end
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's start with an example to test the SimpleNumber class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# File:  tc_simple_number.rb

require_relative &quot;simple_number&quot;
require &quot;test/unit&quot;
 
class TestSimpleNumber &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
 
  def test_simple
    assert_equal(4, SimpleNumber.new(2).add(2) )
    assert_equal(6, SimpleNumber.new(2).multiply(3) )
  end
 
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Which produces
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; ruby tc_simple_number.rb
 Loaded suite tc_simple_number
 Started
 .
 Finished in 0.002695 seconds.
 
 1 tests, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
&lt;/source&gt;

So what happened here?  We defined a class ''TestSimpleNumber'' which inherited from ''Test::Unit::TestCase''.  In ''TestSimpleNumber'' we defined a member function called ''test_simple''.  That member function contains a number of simple ''assertions'' which exercise my class.  When we run that class (note I haven't put any sort of wrapper code around it -- it's just a class definition), the tests are automatically run, and we're informed that we've run 1 test and 2 assertions.

Let's try a more complicated example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# File:  tc_simple_number2.rb

require_relative &quot;simple_number&quot;
require &quot;test/unit&quot;

class TestSimpleNumber &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase

  def test_simple
    assert_equal(4, SimpleNumber.new(2).add(2) )
    assert_equal(4, SimpleNumber.new(2).multiply(2) )
  end

  def test_typecheck
    assert_raise( RuntimeError ) { SimpleNumber.new('a') }
  end

  def test_failure
    assert_equal(3, SimpleNumber.new(2).add(2), &quot;Adding doesn't work&quot; )
  end

end
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ruby tc_simple_number2.rb
Loaded suite tc_simple_number2
Started
F..
Finished in 0.038617 seconds.

  1) Failure:
test_failure(TestSimpleNumber) [tc_simple_number2.rb:16]:
Adding doesn't work.
&lt;3&gt; expected but was
&lt;4&gt;.

3 tests, 4 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors
&lt;/source&gt;

Now there are three tests (three member functions) in the class. The function ''test_typecheck'' uses ''assert_raise'' to check for an exception. The function ''test_failure'' is set up to fail, which the Ruby output happily points out, not only telling us which test failed, but how it failed (expected &lt;3&gt; but was &lt;4&gt;).  On this assertion, we've also added an final parameters which is a custom error message.  It's strictly optional but can be helpful for debugging.  All of the assertions include their own error messages which are usually sufficient for simple debugging.

== Available Assertions ==

Test::Unit provides a rich set of assertions, which are documented thoroughly at [http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html Ruby-Doc].  Here's a brief synopsis (assertions and their negative are grouped together.  The text description is usually for the first one listed -- the names should make some logical sense):

{| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
| assert( boolean, [message] ) 
| True if ''boolean''
|- 
| assert_equal( expected, actual, [message] )&lt;br&gt;assert_not_equal( expected, actual, [message] )
| True if ''expected == actual''
|-
|  assert_match( pattern, string, [message] )&lt;br&gt;assert_no_match( pattern, string, [message] )
| True if ''string =~ pattern''
|-
| assert_nil( object, [message] )&lt;br&gt;assert_not_nil( object, [message] )
| True if ''object == nil''
|-
| assert_in_delta( expected_float, actual_float, delta, [message] ) 
| True if ''(actual_float - expected_float).abs &lt;= delta''
|-
|assert_instance_of( class, object, [message] )
| True if ''object.class == class''
|-
|assert_kind_of( class, object, [message] )
| True if ''object.kind_of?(class)''
|-
| assert_same( expected, actual, [message])&lt;br&gt;assert_not_same( expected, actual, [message] ) 
| True if ''actual.equal?( expected )''.
|-
| assert_raise( Exception,... ) {block}&lt;br&gt;assert_nothing_raised( Exception,...) {block} 
| True if the block raises (or doesn't) one of the listed exceptions.
|- 
| assert_throws( expected_symbol, [message] ) {block}&lt;br&gt;assert_nothing_thrown( [message] ) {block} 
| True if the block throws (or doesn't) the expected_symbol.
|-
| assert_respond_to( object, method, [message] ) 
| True if the object can respond to the given method.
|-
| assert_send( send_array, [message] )
| True if the method sent to the object with the given arguments return true.
|-
| assert_operator( object1, operator, object2, [message] )
| Compares the two objects with the given operator, passes if ''true''
|-
|}

== Structuring and Organizing Tests ==

Tests for a particular unit of code are grouped together into a ''test case'', which is a subclass of Test::Unit::TestCase.  Assertions are gathered in ''tests'', member functions for the test case whose names start with &lt;tt&gt;test_&lt;/tt&gt;.  When the test case is executed or required, Test::Unit will iterate through all of the tests (finding all of the member functions which start with ''test_'' using reflection) in the test case, and provide the appropriate feedback.

Test case classes can be gathered together into ''test suites'' which are Ruby files which require other test cases:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# File: ts_allTheTests.rb
require 'test/unit'
require 'testOne'
require 'testTwo'
require 'testThree'
&lt;/source&gt;

In this way, related test cases can be naturally grouped.  Further, test suites can contain other test suites, allowing the construction of a hierarchy of tests.

This structure provides relatively fine-grained control over testing.  Individual tests can be run from a test case (see below), a full test case can be run stand-alone, a test suite containing multiple cases can be run, or a suite of suites can run, spanning many test cases.

=== Naming Conventions ===

The author of Test::Unit, Nathaniel Talbott, suggests starting the names of test cases with &lt;tt&gt;tc_&lt;/tt&gt; and the names of test suites with &lt;tt&gt;ts_&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Running Specific Tests ===

It's possible to run just one (or more) tests out of a full test case:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ruby -w tc_simpleNumber2.rb --name test_typecheck 
Loaded suite tc_simpleNumber2
Started
.
Finished in 0.003401 seconds.

1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to run all tests whose names match a given pattern:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ruby -w tc_simpleNumber2.rb --name /test_type.*/ 
Loaded suite tc_simpleNumber2
Started
.
Finished in 0.003401 seconds.

1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Setup and Teardown ===

There are many cases where a small bit of code needs to be run before and/or after each test.  Test::Unit provides the &lt;tt&gt;setup&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;teardown&lt;/tt&gt; member functions, which are run before and after every test (member function).

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# File:  tc_simple_number3.rb

require &quot;./simple_number&quot;
require &quot;test/unit&quot;

class TestSimpleNumber &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase

  def setup
    @num = SimpleNumber.new(2)
  end

  def teardown
    ## Nothing really
  end

  def test_simple
    assert_equal(4, @num.add(2) )
  end

  def test_simple2
    assert_equal(4, @num.multiply(2) )
  end

end
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ruby tc_simple_number3.rb
Loaded suite tc_simple_number3
Started
..
Finished in 0.00517 seconds.

2 tests, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==

===Radius of a bike tire===
Implement a class with a public method that can solve the following problem: A user has a rubber bicycle tire of an arbitrary circumference. When one side is cut, and the bike tire is stretched into a line, it is measured at an arbitrary length. From this length, determine the radius of the bike tire originally.

After this, write a test case to test the class. It should include at least 2 methods to test.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Read everything you can find about stuttering. Decide which therapy interests you. Even if a book costs over $40 don't be penny-wise and pound-foolish&amp;#151;the most expensive book is cheaper than the cheapest therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for a board-certified Fluency Specialist at [http://www.stutteringspecialists.org/specialists_list.html http://www.stutteringspecialists.org/specialists_list.html]. There are about 100,000 speech-language pathologists in the United States, of which less than 500 are Fluency Specialists. Speech-language pathologists are trained in a wide variety of disorders. Most speech-language pathologists had one class, or maybe half of a class, in fluency disorders. Many speech-language pathologists have no training or experience with stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The [http://www.stutteringhelp.org Stuttering Foundation of America]  ((http://www.stutteringhelp.org) or 800/992-9392) also has a list of recommended speech pathologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or attend your local [http://www.nsastutter.org/ National Stuttering Association] (http://www.nsastutter.org/ or 800/364-1677) support group, and ask people to recommend a speech pathologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a serious complaint against a speech pathologist, call the American Speech-Language Hearing Association at (301) 897-5700.&lt;/p&gt;

==Paying for Stuttering Therapy==

&lt;p&gt;Speech pathologists usually charge between $60 and $120 per hour. You may go two hours a week, for a few months, then one hour a week for a few more months, depending on your severity and progress. Your speech clinic may also have group therapy sessions, for about $25 for two hours. You usually do the group therapy for maintenance, after a few months of individual therapy. The total bill may be $2500 to $5000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few health insurance carriers pay for stuttering therapy. They may say that stuttering is a pre-existing condition, or that stuttering is not a medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal law requires that public schools provide speech therapy for children as young as three. In some states, this may continue up to 21, if you're in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unemployed, you may get stuttering therapy paid by your state's vocational rehabilitation. If you are employed, ask your employer to pay part of your therapy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

==Most Speech-Language Pathologists Don't Like Stuttering==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the sad things about stuttering, that sad disorder of the human race, is that its victims far too often find themselves in the hands of a naïve rather than incompetent therapist.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#151;Charles Van Riper
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) asked speech-language pathologists to rank 20 speech disorders in order of preference. Childhood stuttering was ranked in the middle. Adult stuttering was at the bottom. Speech pathologists dislike adult stuttering because they know little about it. Their lack of training makes them uncomfortable in treating stuttering. You may be the first stutterer your speech pathologist has ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A speech pathology professor wrote on the Internet: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my students came to me and asked if I was serious about wanting them to go out and stutter [for a day]. She didn't want to do that. Another said she was sweating it out too&amp;#133;I had difficulty getting students to fake stuttering to get the feeling people who stutter have every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I've been adding stuff for kicks, The book seems unacceptably bare. Don't like it, chuck it, but I think its some quality stuff. [[User:Sameerkale|Sameerkale]] 00:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

I think it is a good idea to break down this page into several other pages, because each chord type really should get special attention. And also, if this page is expanded much more, it'll get huge. I have broken down this page's content across several other pages, and made reference to new pages that should be created. Ideally, I will begin write-ups for the other pages shortly. --[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 23:17, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

: Sounds good, we can coordinate which pages to write, actually. My experience with formatting is limited, and everytime I have tried to rearrange the sections I screwed it up.  Hopefully this will become a good book in time. I don't have a digital camera handy, but I possibly could upload photos of the proper fingerings this weekend, depending on my AP Calculus/Physics homework situation.  [[User:Sameerkale|Sameerkale]] 23:07, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

==What's the goal of this page?==
Currently this page is a description of different chord types, but it seems to be more &quot;music theory&quot; than &quot;guitar theory&quot;. I think the [[Music]] wikibook does a pretty good job of getting the basics of music theory covered, and I don't think it would be necessary to duplicate all that content here. In contrast, the [[de:Gitarre:_Inhalts%C3%BCbersicht|German guitar wikibook]] begins their Rhythm Guitar section with &quot;Chord Types&quot;, which is a detailed explanation of the theory behind the different types of barre chords and how they're related on the neck. However, they also have another page, [[de:Gitarre:_Barr%C3%A9griffe|Barrechords]], which has roughly the same purpose of our [[Guitar/Barre Chords]] page.

So I am wondering exactly what the purpose of this page should be, or even if it should exist in it's current form. Perhaps it would be better renamed to something like &quot;Chord Theory&quot;, and it be given a slightly different purpose. Certainly it would be more effective to teach people about the different chord types by demonstrating how they can be played on the guitar, not just providing the theory behind the chord.

I also worry about duplication, because like in the German wikibook, a lot of the content in the Barre Chord section is covered in the Chord Types section, although for a slightly different purpose. Perhaps there could be some way to merge the content of the two pages into a single comprehensive page. Thoughts? --[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 03:05, 21 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Anatomy of a darcs repository ==

Understanding how to use the darcs commands can be a lot easier if you have a rough idea how things work.  We're not asking you to learn about patch commutation algebra (yet), but one thing you should at least be comfortable with is the anatomy of a darcs repository.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-anatomy.png|center|Anatomy of a darcs repository]]

The idea of the diagram is as follows: the stuff on the left in yellow is you.  That's what darcs calls the '''working directory'''.  The stuff in grey, on the other hand, is part of that mysterious &lt;code&gt;_darcs&lt;/code&gt; directory if you've played around with darcs before.  This can be broken down some more.  The '''pristine tree''' (middle) is exactly like your working directory, except only representing the last saved state.  It's not essential to darcs's operations, but it makes things run more efficiently, and is perhaps useful for understanding how things work.  Finally, the right-most portion is the set of '''patches'''.  Patches are what makes darcs... well... darcs.  Darcs thinks in patches.  Almost every darcs operation somehow involves (darcs) juggling some patches around behind the scenes.  Enthusiastic darcs users find that this makes life easier in a number of ways.  For example, accepting patches to your code becomes an extremely natural thing to do - you just let darcs apply them and in they go.  But before we get to that, let's tackle a small set of essential commands.

== Essential commands ==

=== init===

Say you have a directory with some files in it.  When you run &lt;code&gt;darcs init&lt;/code&gt; to initialise the repository, you get an empty new darcs repository.  Your working directory might contain files, but darcs does not know about them yet.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-init.png|center|After a darcs init - an empty repository]]

=== add ===

&lt;code&gt;darcs add&lt;/code&gt; tells darcs to keep track of a file or directory that was only in your working directory.  It creates or adds to a special temporary patch which we call the '''pending patch''' (will be represented in blue).  Note that it does ''not'' affect your pristine tree whatsover! The idea is that we haven't saved your work (which is what the pristine tree is for).  We've only told darcs that we might conceivably want to save it later on.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-add-before.png|center|during darcs add]]

Note that the pending patch is different from all the other patches.  It is really a representation of (some) things you have not yet converted into a real darcs patch.

=== whatsnew ===

The &lt;code&gt;darcs whatsnew&lt;/code&gt; compares the working directory against the pristine tree (theoretically, against the set of patches) and displays what has changed between them.  If there is anything in the pending patch, it also displays the contents of that.

[[Image:Darcs-repo-whatsnew.png|center|Darcs whatsnew]]

=== record ===

The &lt;code&gt;darcs record&lt;/code&gt; command is how you save your work.  It copies your chosen changes from the working directory to the pristine tree, and more importantly, creates a new patch representing those changes.  Changes can also come from the pending patch, and these changes will also be propagated into the pristine tree.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 90% of adult stutterers never seek treatment for their stuttering (see the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Incidence and Prevalence|Incidence and Prevalence of Stuttering]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some stutterers don't know that stuttering treatments are available. Or a stutterer doesn't realize that more than one treatment is available: he tried one therapy, wasn't successful, and doesn't think of trying another therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stutterers are more likely to seek speech therapy at life changes&amp;#151;when starting college, when graduating from college, looking for a job, etc. When life is unchanging, stutterers see no reason to change their speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting stutterers to practice 20 minutes a day is difficult. Getting stutterers to use therapy techniques in conversations can be impossible. There are several reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuttering is a developmental disorder. You've stuttered as long as you can remember. People who start stuttering later in life (from a stroke or head injury) almost always seek treatment. To these people, the ability to talk is a major loss. But if you've never talked fluently, you don't know what you're missing. Stutterers may not consider that their stuttering is a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denial&amp;#151;stutterers are embarrassed about stuttering, and so don't want to think about it. Failure at stuttering therapy can support denial&amp;#151;a stutterer goes to a therapy program, the therapy &quot;doesn't work,&quot; and now he has an excuse to never try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some cultures assume that stuttering is &quot;God's will&quot; or punishment for misdeeds in an earlier incarnation. Other people assume that suffering is the human condition, and they live with difficulties rather than try to solve their problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Aristotle thought that slaves were the ordination of Nature&amp;#151;the devil of it was, the slaves thought so too.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sally Ballard wrote about her fear of speech therapy for the British Stammering Association newsletter. After describing several bad experiences with speech pathologists as a child (due more to her temper than the speech pathologists), Ms. Ballard describes taking her children to a speech clinic: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am terrified of [my children] stammering&amp;#133;Even though it did not look as if they would stammer, I took them to a speech therapist. I was petrified of her&amp;#133;She told me that my children were fine, and asked me if I would like help for myself. I said thanks but no thanks, and almost ran out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later, I realized that I could not carry on as I was [having her husband make telephone calls, walking because she couldn't tell the bus driver where to stop]&amp;#133;Even though I was scared of speech therapists, I decided I had to get over my fear&amp;#133;I worked out that it was two main things: the fear of being unable to gain respect [fear that speech pathologists would treat her like a child or a mentally-retarded person], and the fear of being a failure [and continuing to stutter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to my local health clinic and asked (eventually) to see a speech therapist&amp;#133;I went into a flat panic. I could not decide what to do. What if they could not help me? What if I would always stammer or, worse still, what if she helped me overcome my speech problem? I would not have an excuse any more and, if I failed in life, I could no longer put it down to the fact that I stammered. I would have to accept the blame myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the fateful day of my appointment arrived, I was a nervous wreck. I wouldn't let my husband come with me in case I chickened out and didn't go at all, but in the end I went. My palms were sweating by the time I arrived&amp;#133;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speech pathologist taught Ms. Ballard to &quot;stammer more fluently.&quot; The speech pathologist then asked how stuttering affected Ms. Ballard's life. She said that stuttering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had stopped me from doing the one career that I wanted. Teaching. With terrific support from my husband, children, friends, and my speech therapist, I applied to the local college&amp;#133;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite rejections from several universities because of her stuttering, Ms. Ballard eventually was accepted. She concluded,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never give up. If things don't go the way you wanted them to, don't look on the down side of life. Try to look at all the things you have achieved in life. Everyone will be surprised at how much that really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who do not have access to speech therapy or wish to work on their own, read &lt;i&gt; Self-Therapy for the Stutterer&lt;/i&gt; by Malcolm Fraser available from the Stuttering Foundation of America (www.stutteringhelp.org or 800-992-9392).&lt;p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Before the Game =
[[Image:Blank_Go_board.png|thumb|An empty Go board]]
Before the game, it is customary to formally greet one's opponent. This can be done while standing or sitting, but some players might be offended if you sit down before greeting them. In Japanese the standard greeting is &quot;Onegai shimasu,&quot; and since Japanese terms are the most common among go players in the USA, it is likely that you may hear it there occasionally. The next important thing to do is make sure that the goban is in the correct position. Both players should be sitting opposite each other, with the shorter sides of the goban facing the two players. Now you must decide if either player needs a handicap (handicaps will be discussed in the next lesson); if so, then that player will play as black with the appropriate handicap. If neither player needs a handicap, then you must decide what color you will be playing. There are a variety of ways to do this. One common way, called &quot;Nigiri&quot; (Japanese for &quot;squeeze&quot;), is for one player to grab a handful of stones.  The other player then guesses if there is an even or odd number of stones, indicating the guess by placing on the goban one stone for &quot;odd&quot; or two stones for &quot;even.&quot; The stones should be dropped onto the goban and counted, two at a time. If the guessing player guessed right, he will play as black.

= Opening Game (Joban)=
After you have greeted each other and done all other preparations, you can start the game.  In an even game, black will always make the first move, then white, then black, etc.  If black is weaker and begins with handicap stones on the board, then white makes the first move.  The opening mostly takes place within the outer five rows of the board. The beginning game is the part of the game where the general outlines of territory(the moyo) will start to show themselves. The opening lasts roughly 30 to 60 moves.

==Strategy for The Opening Game ==
Orthodox strategy involves early play in the corners of the board, as fewer moves are required to surround territory.  Standard plays in the corner include the (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5) points.  Plays on the non-symmetric (not (3,3) or (4,4)) often elicit a prompt response, as one additional play in this vicinity is usually sufficient to form secure corner territory.

= Middle Game =
After most of the possible territory on the sides has been claimed (these can just be outlines of territory) the game will move into the center of the board. This part of the game is called the middle game.  It takes place in the middle of the board, and chronologically it is the middle of the game. The first middle territory move should be to the center of the board.


==Strategy for The Middle Game ==
The middle game is where most of the fighting occurs.  The goals of this phase are to solidify the areas that you have laid claim to, and reduce the area that your opponent has laid claim to.  There are many ways of doing this, but one of the most effective is to use moves that your opponent must respond to as a way to strengthen and enlarge your own territory.  If there is a weak group that your opponent is unwilling to sacrifice, this tactic works especially well.  If you don't know what a weak group or a move that your opponent must respond to is, look for places that are relatively open, and try to claim them.  If you are near a side, try to hug it.  It is easier to make eyes along the side than in  the middle.  If you are not near a side, connect your stones to the open middle or a stronger group.

= End Game (Yose) =
The end game, being the last part of the game, is the point in the game where territory is  solidified, destroyed, and made. The end game is an important part of the game; doing badly in the end game can cause a loss.  The game will end when either both players pass or one player resigns (gives up). If one player resigns the other wins.  If both players pass, then points are counted to see who has the higher score.

== Strategy for The End Game ==
The purpose of this phase is to solidly define the borders for counting.  The proper way to play this phase is to count how many points each move will swing, and play the largest one.  The most important thing is to make sure you aren't accidentally killing your own groups.  Some groups that are alive run into a &quot;shortage of liberties&quot; that suddenly allow them to be killed.

= Counting Points =
[[Image:gomarkedstones.png|thumb|circles mark neutral territory, squares mark dead stones and x mark territory]]

[[Image:Gocounted.png|thumb|The board after the territory has been counted]]

After a game is finished, territory must be counted to determine the winner of the game. Each player will take turns filling in &quot;neutral&quot; territory, territory which does not belong the either player. Next, dead stones, stones inside territory owned by the opponent, are removed and placed with the captured stones. Once all dead stones are removed, captured and dead stones are placed in the territory belonging to their color. Now count the remaining points of territory. Stones may be rearranged for easier counting as long as the borders of the territory are not disturbed.

*The perfect tenses are also called the compound or composed tenses. 
*The perfect tenses are all composed of a conjugated auxiliary verb and a fixed past participle.

==Auxillary Verb Formation==
*The auxiliary verb is always either avoir or être.
*The tense of the verb depends upon the tense that avoir or être is conjugated in.
**When the auxiliary verb is conjugated in the passé composé, for example, the auxiliary verb is conjugated in the present indicative.
***J'ai fini. - I have finished.

==Past Participle Formation==
*-er verbs - replace -er with é
*-ir verbs - replace -ir with i
*-re verbs - replace -re with u
*irregular verbs - must be memorized

==Past Participle Agreement==
Audio: [[media:French-vacances16.ogg|French native speaker]]&lt;br/&gt;
*The past pasticiple must agree with the direct object of a clause in gender and plurality if the direct object goes before the verb.
**the direct object is ''masculine singular'' - no change
***J'ai fini le jeu. - I have finished the game.
***Je l'ai fini. - I have finished it.
**the direct object is ''feminine singular'' - add an '''e''' to the past participle
***J'ai fini la tâche. - I have finished the task.
***Je l'ai finie. - I have finished it.
**the direct object is ''masculine plural'' - add an '''s''' to the past participle.
***J'ai fini les jeux. - I have finished the games.
***Je les ai finis. - I have finished them.
**the direct object is ''feminine plural'' - add an '''es''' to the past participle.
***J'ai fini les tâches. - I have finished the tasks.
***Je les ai finies. - I have finished them.

==Avoir ou Être?==
*In most circumstances, the auxiliary verb is avoir.
*However, under certain situations, the auxiliary verb is être.
*This occurs when:
**The verb is one of 16 special verbs that take être.
***Arrivé, Allé, Venu, Devenu, Revenu, Entré, Rentré, Descendu, Retourné, Resté, Monté, Parti, Sorti, Tombé, Né, Mort.
***Note that when a direct object is used with these verbs, the auxiliary verb becomes avoir.
**The verb is reflexive.
***That is, the subject of the verb is also its object.

==List of Tenses==
There are seven perfect tenses in French. These are:
#[[French/Grammar/Tenses/Present perfect|Le passé composé]] (The Present Perfect)
#[[French/Grammar/Tenses/Pluperfect of the indicative|Le plus-que-parfait de l'indicatif]] (The Pluperfect of the Indicative)
#[[French/Grammar/Tenses/Pluperfect subjunctive|Le plus-que-parfait du subjonctif ]] (The Pluperfect Subjunctive)
#[[French/Grammar/Tenses/Past anterior|Le passé antérieur]] (The Past Anterior)
#[[French/Grammar/Tenses/Future anterior|Le futur antérieur]] (The Future Anterior)
#[[French/Grammar/Tenses/Past conditional|Le conditionnel passé]] (The Past Conditional)
#[[French/Grammar/Tenses/Past subjunctive|Le passé du subjonctif]] (The Past Subjunctive)

Seems to me the counting diagrams are all wrong. All white stones at the bottom side have no more than one eye thus are dead. SO, after counting all of them are counted as prisoners (assuming Japanese rules) and the territory is counted as black. Rami 08:41, 21 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Stuttering modification therapy is primarily associated with Charles Van Riper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering. Instead, the goals are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify your moments of stuttering, so that your stuttering is less severe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce your fear of stuttering, and eliminate avoidance behaviors associated with this fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

==Four Phases of Stuttering Modification Therapy==

&lt;p&gt;The therapy has four phases: identification, desensitization, modification, and stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;

===Identification===

&lt;p&gt;You begin by identifying the core behaviors, secondary behaviors, and feelings and attitudes that characterize your stuttering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your speech-language pathologist points out your &quot;easy or effortless stuttering.&quot; You learn to identify when you do these behaviors. The goal is to improve your awareness of what you do when you stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, your speech pathologist trains you to identify and become aware of your avoidance behaviors, postponement behaviors, starting behaviors, word and sound fears, situation fears, core stuttering behaviors, and escape behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you identify feelings of frustration, shame, and hostility associated with your speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, identifying these behaviors is done in the speech clinic. Later, your speech pathologist takes you out of the clinic, to identify what you do in everyday conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

===Desensitization===

&lt;p&gt;Van Riper called this &quot;toughening the stutterer to his stuttering.&quot; You do this in three stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confrontation, or accepting that you stutter. You're expected to tell people that you stutter, and talk about what you are doing in therapy to change your stuttering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freeze your core behaviors&amp;#151;repetitions, prolongations, and blocks. When you stutter, your speech pathologist raises a finger. You hold what you are doing, until she drops her finger. For example, if you were repeating a syllable, you have to continue to repeat that syllable. Your speech pathologist will make you freeze these core behaviors for longer and longer periods. The goal is for you to become less emotional or more tolerant of these behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Voluntary stuttering, or stuttering on purpose. This helps you remain calm when you stutter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Modification===

&lt;p&gt;This is where you learn &quot;easy stuttering&quot; or &quot;fluent stuttering,&quot; in 3 stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancellations. When you stutter, you stop, pause for a few moments, and say the word again. You say the word slowly, with reduced articulatory pressure, and blending the sounds together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull-outs. After you master freezing and cancellations, you use your &quot;easy stuttering&quot; while you are in a stutter, to pull yourself out of the stutter and say the word fluently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparatory sets. After mastering pull-outs, you look ahead for words you're going to stutter on, and you use &quot;easy stuttering&quot; on those words. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Stabilization===

&lt;p&gt;The last stage of stuttering modification therapy seeks to stabilize or solidify your speech gains. This is accomplished through sub-goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is for you to become your own speech therapist. You take responsibility for making your own assignments and prescribed therapy activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sub-goal is &quot;the automatization of preparatory sets and pull-outs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last subgoal is for you to change your self-concept from being a person who stutters to being a person who speaks fluently most of the time but who occasionally stutters mildly. &lt;/p&gt;

==Efficacy Studies==

&lt;p&gt;A study indicated that naïve or nonprofessional listeners responded less well to stuttering combined with stuttering modification techniques than they did to stuttering (only).{{ref|Manning1999}} In other words, listeners may prefer to listen to untreated stuttering than to listen to a stutterer using stuttering modification therapy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nineteen adult stutterers participated in the 3.5-week [http://www.ssmpmanual.com/ Successful Stuttering Management Program] (SSMP, developed by Dorvan Breitenfeldt) program. Immediately post-treatment their speech had improved 10%. Six months later this modest gain had all but disappeared. Several measures of anxiety found a 10-15% psychological improvement. The researchers cautioned that six months isn't a long follow-up, and that this psychological improvement might not last, given the absence of improved speech. The researchers concluded, &amp;quot;&amp;#133;the SSMP appears to be ineffective in producing durable improvements in stuttering behaviors.&amp;quot;{{ref|Blomgren2005}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Stuttering Modification Programs==

===Approach-Avoidance Therapy (Joseph Sheehan)===

&lt;p&gt;In the 1940s, behavioral psychologist Neal Miller tied strings to rats, and sent them scampering down a runway towards food. He measured how hard the rats pulled on the strings to get to the food. He called this force the &quot;gradient of force.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then put an electric shock at the end of the runway, instead of food. The rats scampered away from the electric shock, and Miller called this the &quot;gradient of avoidance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He put the food and the electric shock together at the end of the runway. The rats wanted to scamper to the food, but away from the electric shock. They ended up running back and forth in a narrow space somewhere in the middle of the runway. This was called the &quot;approach-avoidance conflict.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminded psychologist Joseph Sheehan of stutterers' repetitions and prolongations. In 1953, Sheehan developed the theory that stutterers want to say a word, but also want to avoid the word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would stutterers wish to avoid saying words? Sheehan suggested that stutterers dislike the listener, or fear certain words, or fear certain situations, or feel guilt or anxiety about the emotional content of our message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheehan believed that &quot;stuttering is not a speech disorder, but a conflict revolving around self and role, an identity problem.&quot; He based this view on the fact that most stutterers have difficulty saying their names, and that many stutterers are fluent when acting (Sheehan, 1970).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheehan developed a stuttering modification therapy program based the reduction of avoidance.first, in the &quot;self-acceptance&quot; phase, you are trained to accept yourself as a stutterer. You are encouraged to maintain eye contact with listeners, and discuss your stuttering with friends and acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;monitoring&quot; phase, you improve your awareness of what you do when you stutter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;initiation&quot; phase, you seek out feared situations, and feared words, and stutter openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;modification&quot; phase, you stutter openly and easily. You let the listener know that you are having trouble with a word. You do a prolongation on thefirst sound of the word. You do a &quot;smooth release&quot; onto the next sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in the &quot;safety margin&quot; phase, you develop a tolerance for disfluency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheehan did not believe that stutterers could or should speak fluently. In his therapy, &quot;No practicing of special techniques for achieving fluency are involved&amp;#151;only openness and honesty and a changing role of self-acceptance as a stutterer will lead to overcoming the tyranny of stuttering.&quot;{{ref|CulattaGoldberg1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheehan's stuttering therapy is practiced at the University of California&amp;#151;Los Angeles (UCLA).&lt;/p&gt;

===Successful Stuttering Management Program (Breitenfeldt and Lorenz)===

&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Successful Stuttering Management Program&quot; (SSMP) is practiced by Dorvan Breitenfeldt and Dolores Rustad Lorenz at Eastern Washington University in Spokane, Washington. It's a three-week, intensive, residential group therapy program. The program is mainly stuttering modification therapy, emphasizing avoidance reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program begins with &quot;confrontation of stuttering.&quot; The aim is to develop awareness of your stuttering, reduce use of avoidance techniques, and eliminate word and situation fears. The techniques are voluntary stuttering and stuttering surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &quot;stuttering survey,&quot; you go to a shopping mall, stop strangers, and ask them questions about their reactions to your stuttering. You stutter on purpose. You do 200-300 stuttering surveys in the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second phase, you learn the stuttering modification techniques: preparatory sets, cancellations, and pull-outs. This differs from other stuttering modification therapies, in which preparatory sets are learned after cancellations and pull-outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second phase also includes changing your self-concept and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also substitute continuents for plosives. You substitute /w/ for /b/, /s/ for /t/, and /z/ for /d/. For example, you say &quot;wank&quot; instead of &quot;bank,&quot; and &quot;zollar&quot; instead of &quot;dollar.&quot; You also add sounds with prolongations. For example, &quot;water&quot; becomes &quot;oowater.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other speech pathologists are skeptical of this technique:{{ref|DeNil1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This type of substitution behavior seems to go against the original philosophy of nonavoidance&amp;#133;the idea of teaching stutterers to substitute&amp;#133;strikes us as [an avoidance &quot;trick&quot;]&amp;#133;it may even strengthen clients' tendencies to scan ahead in anticipation of sounds that are feared and should be avoided.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third phase, you transfer your new skills to face-to-face and telephone conversations. You are also encouraged to do voluntary stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

===&quot;Self-Therapy for the Stutterer&quot; (Malcolm Fraser)===

&lt;p&gt;The book &quot;Self-Therapy For The Stutterer,&quot; by Malcolm Fraser, shows how to do stuttering modification can be done as self-therapy, as opposed to going to a speech clinic. The book is published by the Stuttering Foundation of America.&lt;/p&gt;

==Critiques of Stuttering Modification Therapy==

===Assumptions===

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering modification therapy assumes that stutterers will never be able to talk fluently, and so the best a stutterer can hope for is to be a better communicator while still stuttering. The effectiveness of other, more recently developed stuttering therapies for producing fluent speech makes this assumption questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

===Identification Critiques===

&lt;p&gt;Improving self-awareness of stuttering behaviors, as well as psychological effects, is an excellent foundation for any speech therapy. The problem with this stage of stuttering modification therapy is that it was developed before the invention of video camcorders and [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Computers and Electronics for Fluency-Shaping|biofeedback devices]]. Current technology can help you do this stage better and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

===Desensitization Critiques===

&lt;p&gt;Telling people that you stutter is good. But freezing core behaviors and voluntary stuttering could strengthen the neural pathways for these behaviors, making these undesirable motor programs even harder to change.&lt;/p&gt;

===Modification Critiques===

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cancellations&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;pull-outs&amp;quot; don't work if you have poor awareness of your stuttering. By the time you realize that you are stuttering your speech may be out of control. If stutterers' [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Neurology of Stuttering#Auditory Processing Underactivity|auditory processing underactivity]] results in poor awareness of one's speech, then stutterers who have a this neurological abnormality strongly can't be expected to modify their speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Preparatory sets&amp;quot; teach stutterers to &amp;quot;scan ahead&amp;quot; for feared words, i.e., teach you another secondary behavior. In fact, the entire &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot; stage is arguably teaching you more secondary behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If modified stuttering sounds worse to listeners than untreated stuttering, increased listener discomfort may cause stress in the stutterer using stuttering modification techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

===Stabilization Critiques===

&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;becoming your own speech pathologist&amp;quot; doesn't mean reading books about stuttering, taking a class, going to conventions, or learning about new research and therapies. &amp;quot;Becoming your own speech pathologist&amp;quot; means motivating yourself to do therapy activities indefinitely. You wouldn't do these therapy activities on your own, because you don't perceive resulting benefits. You need a speech pathologist to get you to do the activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another goal is &amp;quot;the automatization of preparatory sets and pull-outs.&amp;quot; But you're just told you to practice, and not taught techniques or practice schedules to maximize [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control#Three Stages of Motor Learning|autonomous motor learning]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last goal is for you to change your self-concept from being a person who stutters to being a person who speaks fluently most of the time but who occasionally stutters mildly. This would be a good goal if stuttering modification therapy trained you to be a person who stutters mildly. But if stuttering modification therapy &quot;&amp;#133;appears to be ineffective in producing durable improvements in stuttering behaviors.&amp;quot; then this self-concept may be difficult to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">After the release of SNES there was great interest in reverse engineering the system to allow for homebrew and backup play.  Nintendo fitted the machine with various security measures such as the lock-out chip to prevent unauthorized code running on the machine.  

Eventually the homebrew community figured out how games ran on the SNES hardware and were able to bypass the security mechanisms.  Companies such as BUNG releases hardware plugins such as Game Doctor SF series. These allows users to not only copy games but also run homebrew developed games to be run on the SNES hardware.  Homebrew ROMS could be converted into the Game Doctor SF format and put onto a 3 1/2&quot; floppy.  Games as large as 12Mbits could be put fit on floppy disks formatted to 1.6Mbytes.  

An alternative device was the Super Flash, by Tototek, allowed for multiple games to be burned into a flash memory chip of cartridge (allowing up to 48Mbits). This chip is the mask rom for the Super Flash development cartridge.  The device is easy to use and has a nice user interface on the computer end.  Simply plug in the Super Flash cartridge and upload the '''games''' you want.  This was nice if you wanted to make a SNES game and play it in an actual cartridge rather than a floppy disk.

The legality of homebew SNES game releases has not been tested in court, and it is debatable whether or not bypassing their security measures would fall foul of modern reverse engineering laws. However essentially homebrew games themselves can be produced legally for the SNES as long as no copyright material is included.

Previously in the 1990s, Nintendo sued Color Dreams for producing NES games without an official license. The outcome was an undisclosed settlement, but Color Dreams continued to produce unlicensed games. The strength of Color Dreams position lies with that they worked around the 10NES lockout chip code rather the illegally duplicating it.

&lt;p&gt;Self-awareness of stuttering behaviors is the foundation of stuttering therapy. Have a friend or your speech-language pathologist videotape you speaking. Watch the video. For some stutterers, watching that video will be the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Some stutterers are unaware of their stuttering, or the severity of their stuttering. You can't couldn't change behaviors that you are unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;

==Transcribe Your Speech==
&lt;p&gt;If your ego can handle more difficult homework, have someone videotape you in a stressful speaking situation. The tape should have you talking for at least three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now play the tape back, and transcribe what you said. Count the syllables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the tape again, counting your dysfluencies. Calculate your stuttering rate. 2% or fewer dysfluent syllables is normal speech. 3-5% dysfluent syllables is mild stuttering. 6-10% is moderate stuttering. More than 10% dysfluent syllables is severe stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the tape again, measuring your speaking time. Calculate your speaking rate in syllables per second. Non-stutterers can speak about five syllables per second, or three hundred syllables per minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the tape again. Mark each dysfluent syllable in your written transcript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the tape again. Note each &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; of dysfluency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For repetitions, write down every repetition, e.g., &amp;quot;b-b-baseball.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For prolongations, underline the prolonged sound.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For silent blocks, write &amp;quot;&amp;#060;block&amp;#62;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the tape again. Pick out your three longest dysfluencies and time each. Write the times on your transcript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the tape again. Note your secondary symptoms. Write down every head jerk, facial grimace, eye blink, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're finished, read aloud your transcription. Perform your stuttering exactly as did on the tape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give your script to your speech-language pathologist. Ask her to perform your script, [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood Stuttering/Pre-School Stuttering#Modeling |modeling]] you.&lt;/p&gt;

==Your Stuttering Autobiography==

&lt;p&gt; Write your stuttering autobiography. Add it to the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/My Life in Stuttering|My Life in Stuttering]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describe how stuttering affected your childhood, teenage years, and adult life. Describe your inner, emotional experience of stuttering. Describe each therapy program you've done, and the results.&lt;/p&gt;

==Over- or Underaware of Stuttering?==

&lt;p&gt;Mild stutterers typically think their speech is worse than it is. A mild stutterer has one little block on &lt;i&gt;baseball&lt;/i&gt; and panics. He thinks, &amp;quot;Did the listener notice? I should have been paying attention and seen that a &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; was coming up. Next time I'll say 'the great American pastime' instead. Or better yet, I'll keep his mouth shut for the rest of the day&amp;#133;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severe stutterers typically think that their speech is better than it is. Listeners impassively pretend not notice. During severe blocks, time stops for the stutterer. If you'd asked me how long a dysfluency had been, I would've said a second or two&amp;#151;even when it was actually five minutes or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, severe stutterers can be mentally healthier than mild stutterers. They can't hide severe stuttering. Severe stutterers can be willing to work hard at speech therapy. Fluent speech motor exercises, even at two-second stretch, get words out faster than severe stuttering. When severe stutterers learn to talk fluently, they often (not always) easily develop normal professional and personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, mild stutterers, who can hide stuttering, often have more severe psychological disabilities. They're hesitant to do speech therapy. Using therapy skills (e.g., slow speech, or voluntary stuttering) alerts listeners that the individual stutters. Even if they successfully complete a speech therapy program and can talk fluently, they think their new fluent speech sounds &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; and prefer their old speech (even after they hear themselves on tape and admit that their new speech sounds normal). Fluency shaping speech therapy can be a breeze for mild stutterers, because their brains don't need much rewiring. But their psychological disabilities can keep them from talking for years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
==Dopamine Antagonist Medications== 

&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrist would like to use dopamine antagonists to reduce stuttering. However, these medications have side effects. Also, the long-term effects of the following medications are unknown. In some patients, even placebo can temporarily reduce stuttering. Rather than taking medication indefinitely, it may be better for a severe stutterer to take a medication at the start of a stuttering therapy program, and then reduce his dosage as his fluency improves, until he no longer needs the medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suspect that your child’s medication contributes to his or her stuttering&amp;#151;especially if your child is on several medications&amp;#151;I suggest that you consult a doctor. No drug has been more effective than placebo in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
===Haldol===

&lt;p&gt;Haloperidol (Haldol) is an old dopamine antagonist. It was the first medication to reduce stuttering in two clinical trials. 

&lt;p&gt;The side effects can be severe.&lt;/p&gt;

===Risperdal===

&lt;p&gt;Newer medications more narrowly target certain dopamine receptors. The dopamine D2-receptor antagonist risperidone (Risperdal) reduces stuttering about 50%.{{ref|Maguire1997}} Like other stuttering therapies, the drug is most effective in low-stress situations, and least effective in high-stress situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drug is FDA-approved only for short-term (6-8 week) treatment of schizophrenia. Side effects include insomnia, agitation, anxiety, somnolence, extrapyramidal nervous system disorders, headaches, dizziness, constipation, rhinitis (a breathing disorder), rashes, tachycardia (a heart disorder), and breast growth in men and women (due to increased levels of the hormone prolactin), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (potentially fatal). &lt;/p&gt;

===Zyprexa===

&lt;p&gt;Olanzapine (Zyprexa) reduces stuttering on average 33%.{{ref|Riley2002}} Side effects may include permanent damage to the frontal lobe, weight gain, and drowsiness.{{ref|Gottlieb2002}}&lt;/p&gt;

===Other Dopamine Antagonists=== 

&lt;p&gt;Pimozide{{ref|Stager1997}} and Tiapride{{ref|Rothenberger1994}} are other dopamine antagonists that have been reported to help stutterers. [http://www.indevus.com/product/pagaclone.asp?page=pagaclone Pagoclone] is currently being tested on stutterers.&lt;/p&gt;

==Antidepressants Increase Stuttering==

&lt;p&gt;Some antidepressant medications boost dopamine. These medications include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class, which includes Prozac and Zoloft. These medications have increased stuttering in stutterers. In a few cases, these drugs caused non-stutterers to stutter.&lt;/p&gt; However, there is no real evidence of this.

&lt;p&gt;Another stutterer wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried 3 antidepressants: Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft. All increased my stuttering noticeably. The antidepressants that I have tried make me more able to get out of bed in the morning and restore my &amp;quot;get up and go&amp;quot;; however, they have caused me to go from being a person with a barely noticeable stutter to a more pronounced stutter. I had more occasions to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into my psychiatrist yesterday and explained that the current antidepressant is making my stutter significantly worse. However, in the 10 minutes we talked I was practically perfectly fluent. He then concludes that obviously &amp;quot;it's not that unmanageable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He prescribed 10mg Propanolol to take before I have to be in a difficult speaking presentation. It is supposed to &amp;quot;reduce performance anxiety.&amp;quot; I don't feel like I have a tremendous amount of performance anxiety; stuttering just isn't very fun. I think he doesn't believe me about the severity of the stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anti-Depressants and Stutter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I have tried one tri-cyclic anti-depressant called Trazodone, 150mg/day. After about a month of taking the pills I experienced mild to serious stuttering.  I never remembered stuttering before or never had anyone comment on my stutter. The stutter brought on even worse anxiety while still on the pills.  I then found myself having worse performance anxiety as well.

A month after stopping the regular taking of the pills my stutter was almost completely absent.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other Medications and Drugs==

===Ritalin===
&lt;p&gt;A speech pathologist asked on the Internet: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm treating an 8-year-old diagnosed ADHD and who suddenly began stuttering (advanced core and secondary behaviors) without any prior history of dysfluency, as a side effect of the medication Ritalin. He's had a whole neuro work-up which revealed nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another speech pathologist responded that many of the children he treated for stuttering were on Ritalin for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmacist Richard Harkness advises against Ritalin for children who stutter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritalin increases dopaminergic neurotransmission and is contraindicated for use in those with Tourette's disorder. Ritalin has also, in rare cases, brought on symptoms of Tourette's disorder. Tourette's disorder has been likened to stuttering in that it involves a flaw in dopaminergic neurotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Botulinum Toxin===

&lt;p&gt;Botox, the toxin in botulism, has been injected into stutterers' vocal folds. The toxin partially paralyzes your vocal folds so you can't get into hard blocks. You also can't talk loudly or forcefully. The toxin reduces stuttering somewhat. It wears off in a few months, and you get a second shot. The second shot reduces stuttering less than the first. By the third shot, the toxin usually has no effect on stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

===Tranquilizers===

&lt;p&gt;Some doctors prescribe tranquilizers to stutterers on the erroneous belief that nervousness causes stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A psychiatrist had some pills he thought might help. Einer was to take one per day during the week remaining before the great day, and one extra big super pill on the morning of the wedding. The pills made him feel somewhat relaxed but had no noticeable effect on his speech. The wedding arrived, Einer took his super pill, and went off to London on the train to meet his relatives who had come for the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hour before the wedding Einer had still not returned. I kept the smiling calm that I had learned to assume in the face of all our difficulties and began dressing. Half an hour later I stood in white satin complete with veil and bouquet, looking out of the bedroom window towards the railway station, wondering what could have happened and preparing myself mentally for a last minute cancellation of the wedding. Had he thrown himself under a train, unable to continue life as a stutterer? Had he run back to Canada as a supreme act of avoidance? The minutes ticked by. Finally another train pulled in, and up the hill walked Einer, a lazy smile on his face, apparently unaware of the panic that he had caused. He had forgotten to take pencil and paper and so was unable to ask for guidance and had become hopelessly lost. However, the super pill had kept him smiling. I am glad to say that thanks to the kindly vicar in reading along with Einer, the wedding vows were the first and only fluent words my family heard Einer speak that summer.{{ref|BobergJ}}&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, tranquilizers have &amp;quot;more effect on the complexity or severity of the [stuttered] blocks than on their frequency.&amp;quot;{{ref|Bloodstein1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

===Alcohol=== 

&lt;p&gt;No researchers have studied the effects of alcohol on stuttering. Anecdotally, alcohol reduces stutterers' fears and anxieties (e.g., about talking to persons of the opposite sex) and so reduces stuttering. But alcohol reduces one's ability to use therapy techniques, so increases stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Changing how stutterers hear their voices improves fluency. This can be done in many ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Speaking in chorus with another person.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing your voice distorted.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing your vocal fold vibration (phonation) without hearing the articulation of your lips, jaw, and tongue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing a synthesized sound mimicking your phonation (masking auditory feedback, or MAF).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing your voice delayed a fraction of a second (delayed auditory feedback, or DAF).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing your voice shifted higher or lower in pitch (frequency-shifted auditory feedback, or FAF).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together these phenomena are called &lt;i&gt;altered auditory feedback&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No brain scans have looked at stutterers' [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Neurology of Stuttering#Auditory Processing Underactivity|auditory processing]] while speaking with altered auditory feedback.{{ref|Watkins2005}} However, one hypothesis is that introducing errors targeted at the area that integrates auditory and somatic processing increases blood ﬂow to that area. In other words, hearing what you're saying out of sync with what you feel your muscles doing raises a red flag. The red flag is raised in the area that's abnormally underactive in stutterers. Increased blood flows to this area. The activity level increases to normal, and stuttering diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The errors must &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; raise red flags in other brain areas, such as language processing. E.g., when you walk up to Fred and say, &amp;quot;Hi, Fred,&amp;quot; a device that whispered in your ear, &amp;quot;Hi, Steve&amp;quot; likely wouldn't improve fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-stutterers have difficulty speaking with altered auditory feedback. Most can't count to ten. They repeat or skip numbers, or giggle uncontrollably, then rip the headphones off. If altered auditory feedback increases blood flow to the auditory/somatic integration area, then in non-stutterers the devices raise activity to an abnormally high level. Too much activity is as bad as not enough activity. Interestingly, the effects of too much activity in this area are somewhat like stuttering&amp;#151;repeating words, or not being able to get words out.&lt;/p&gt;

===Planum Temporale Abnormality and DAF===

&lt;p&gt;DAF effectiveness is has been associated with [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Neurology of Stuttering#Auditory Processing Underactivity|planum temporale (PT) abnormality]].{{ref|Foundas2001}} {{ref|Foundas2004}}&lt;/p&gt;DMAF device uses vocal tone to improve fuency. The device is called StutterFree™ This effect is unlike DAF as it is not a temperary effect device but has proven perminate in some cases. Mostly works for children.

==Immediate Effects of Anti-Stuttering Devices==

&lt;p&gt;The most effective types of altered auditory feedback are delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and frequency-shifted auditory feedback (FAF). Each reduce stuttering about 70%, immediately, without training, speech therapy, mental effort, or abnormal-sounding speech. Combined DAF/FAF reduces stuttering about 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70-80% is the average improvement found in dozens of studies, with hundreds of stutterers.{{ref|Kalinowski1993}} Rarely does DAF and/or FAF improve anyone's speech more than 90%, or less than 50%. If auditory processing underactivity were the only cause of stuttering, then DAF/FAF devices would make all stutterers 100% fluent. The 70-80% effectiveness shows that auditory processing underactivity is a factor in stuttering, but not the only factor. To get closer to 100% fluency an anti-stuttering device has to be combined with speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

==Should Adults Use Anti-Stuttering Devices?==

&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, the only treatment for stutterers' auditory processing abnormality is an altered auditory feedback device. No speech therapy is known to correct this abnormality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people overcome stuttering by treating the other factors. But using an anti-stuttering device in conjunction with other therapies may make the other therapies easier, faster, and more effective. If so, you'll then need your anti-stuttering device less and less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have success with speech therapy and can talk fluently in most situations, there will be a few situations in which you stutter. E.g., you may want an anti-stuttering device for public speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an anti-stuttering device plugged into your telephone can be an easy way to do speech therapy. If the device produces carryover fluency, after a few calls your speech may be improved for the rest of the day. Many [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/State Special Telephone Equipment Programs|states]] provide telephone-compatible anti-stuttering devices free.&lt;/p&gt;

==Should Children Use Anti-Stuttering Devices?==

&lt;p&gt;For children under six, stuttering therapy is usually 100% effective, so anti-stuttering devices are unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With seven- to thirteen-year-olds, DAF devices are usually used in school with a speech-language pathologist. Because such therapy is usually effective{{ref|Ryan1995}} {{ref|Radford2005}} there's no need for a child to use an anti-stuttering device outside of therapy. However, if a child sees his speech-language pathologist for only ten or twenty minutes once or twice a week, the speech-language pathologist could train the parents to supervise their child practicing with a DAF device at home every day, to increase therapy time. A typical protocol for home therapy is ten minutes reading aloud, a ten-minute conversation with a family member, and a ten-minute telephone call (perhaps to a grandparent). Or the parent and child could play [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood Stuttering/Pre-School Stuttering#Direct Therapy with Preschoolers|Say the Magic Word]] while driving to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't know whether children who stutter have the same neurological abnormalities as adult stutterers. Altering a child's brain activity might cause his brain to develop in a different way. Extensive use of an anti-stuttering device might cause the child's brain to develop normal auditory processing and the child would outgrow stuttering. But maybe extensive use of an anti-stuttering device would cause the child's brain to develop in another, unknown abnormal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some anti-stuttering devices impair the user's hearing by occluding (blocking) the ear that the device is in. And some devices pick up, distort, and amplify [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Sound Quality, Background Noise#Background Noise|background noise]]. If a child can't hear his teacher, he'll fall behind in school. He might get hit by a bus that he didn't hear coming. Users of some anti-stuttering devices have reported symptoms of permanent hearing damage, such as ringing in the ears or pain from loud noises.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) can be used two, very different ways. The delay can be set between 50 and 70 milliseconds to reduce stuttering about 70% at a normal speaking rate, without  training, mental effort, or abnormal-sounding speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAF can also be used to support the fluency shaping target of [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Fluency-Shaping Techniques#Slow Speech with Stretched Vowels|slow speech with stretched vowels]]. For this purpose the delay is usually set at 200 milliseconds and then reduced to shorter delays (as short as 75 milliseconds) over the course of the therapy program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this latter purpose, a speech-language pathologist must train the stutterer. When the stutterer can complete a simple speaking task, such as counting to ten, using the slow speech target correctly, then he can use a DAF device. DAF therapy then has two goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To increase the length and complexity of the utterance, and increase the stress of the speaking situation, while using the DAF device to support on-target fluent speech.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To reduce the need for the DAF device, until the stutterer no longer needs the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first goal, after the stutterer can count to ten using the slow-speech target correctly (e.g., all syllables stretched equally, all syllables stretched to one or two seconds, no pauses between words, and no dysfluencies) without the DAF device, then use the device to have a conversation at the same slow speaking rate. When the stutterer can achieve the slow speech target with 100% fluency using the DAF device for utterances with the length and complexity of normal conversations, then the stutterer should take the device out of the speech clinic and use it in increasingly stressful conversations. The first goal is speech that is 100% fluent and on-target (i.e., slow) in any conversation. For a severe stutterer, this may mean using one- or two-seconds per syllables speech with the device set at 200 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the stutterer achieves the first goal, then he gradually reduces his dependence on the device. He decreases the delay and increases his speaking rate. But if he has any dysfluencies he should go back to the longer delay and slower speaking rate. He can also decrease the volume, and use the device in one ear instead of both ears. He can use the device at the beginning of conversations, and then turn it off when he feels capable of speaking on target with the support of the device. He can discontinue using the device in low-stress conversations. Then he can discontinue using the device in medium-stress conversations, reserving the device only for stressful conversations such as public speaking. Eventually he should need the device only occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

==Mistakes in DAF Use==

&lt;p&gt;The common mistake with DAF is using a normal speaking rate with a long (slow) delay. If you want to talk at a normal speaking rate, set the DAF delay between 50 and 75 milliseconds.  Don't use a delay longer than 75 milliseconds unless you're using [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control#Closed-Loop Motor Control|closed-loop slow speech]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical mistake is for a stutterer to experience a 50% fluency improvement at 50 milliseconds and then a 75% improvement at 75 milliseconds.{{ref|Sark1996}} He sees that the dial goes up to 200 milliseconds. He thinks, &amp;quot;I'll crank up this baby! I'll redline it! I'll turn it up all the way to 200 milliseconds and I'll be 200% ﬂuent!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAF doesn't work like that. 200 milliseconds is for speech ﬁve to ten times slower than normal. Non-stutterers can't talk normally with a 200-millisecond delay (with rare exceptions due to a linguistic abnormality) but most stutterers are capable of forcing themselves to &amp;quot;tune out&amp;quot; the delay. This appears to be due to stutterers' auditory processing underactivity. In other words, if you use DAF incorrectly you may be able to make your auditory processing underactivity worse. This may explain why some stutterers have reported that a DAF device lost effectiveness or &amp;quot;wore off&amp;quot; over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mistake is to use a DAF device in low-stress situations (such as reading aloud) and expect carryover to high-stress situations. Carryover works the other way. For example, a child could use a DAF device only when called on to speak in class. Or an adult could a DAF device when speaking on the radio at work, but not for conversations with his wife at home. As a rule, use an anti-stuttering device in situations in which you stutter, and don't use it in situations where you speak fluently.&lt;/p&gt;

==Long-Term Effects of DAF== 

&lt;p&gt;Nine adult stutterers used DAF devices thirty minutes per day, for three months. The thirty minutes consisted of ten minutes reading aloud, a ten-minute conversation with a family member, and a ten-minute telephone call. The subjects received no speech therapy.{{ref|Borsel2003}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devices were used with binaural (two ears) headsets. The subjects were allowed to set the delay where they wanted. Most selected delays around 100 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SchoolDAF-small.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-Term Effects of DAF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before three months of DAF use, the subjects stuttered on 37% of words, on average. When they put on the DAF device their stuttering dropped to 10%. I.e., the device improved their speech about 70%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months later the subjects stuttered on 17% of words, when not using the DAF device. When wearing the DAF device they stuttered on 13% of words.

&lt;p&gt;This shows that, when not wearing the devices, the subjects' stuttering diminished from 37% of words to 17% of words, or a 55% improvement. This is &amp;quot;carryover fluency.&amp;quot; Put another way, the devices trained the users to need the devices less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase (from 10% to 13%) in stuttering when wearing the devices wasn't statistically significant. Examining this more closely, stuttering when wearing the device increased only for &amp;quot;automatic speech,&amp;quot; such as reciting days of the week, and for repeating words and sentences after the examiner. No change in effectiveness was found in conversations or in a &amp;quot;picture description&amp;quot; task. This suggests that any &amp;quot;wearing off&amp;quot; effects occurred in less-important speaking situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;carryover fluency&amp;quot; effect was the same across all speaking tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another study, an eleven-year-old boy received fourteen hours of structured therapy with mediated learning and a School DAF. His stuttering diminished from 9% dysfluencies to 4.8% dysfluencies (when speaking without the device, a 47% improvement). One year later he still had 4.8% dysfluencies. Another fourteen hours of treatment reduced his stuttering to 4.1% dysfluencies.{{ref|Radford2005}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two other studies combined speech therapy with a DAF device. One study was of adults,{{ref|Ryan1974}} the other of children.{{ref|Ryan1995}} Both studies found that combining DAF and stuttering therapy trained the subjects to speak fluently (less than 2% stuttering) and no longer need the devices.&lt;/p&gt;

== Overview ==

'''''Petunia Dursley''''', née Evans, is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s aunt (she is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother's]] sister). She and her husband [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Vernon Dursley]] reluctantly took Harry in as a baby, while they had their own son, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]. Petunia dislikes Harry's magical abilities and wishes to &quot;stamp it out of him,&quot; and partly as a result of this, relations between her and Harry have never been good.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Vernon Dursley]] kisses his wife, Petunia, goodbye as he leaves for work. Several unnerving things happen during the day, but while he is tempted to call Petunia, he does not, instead waiting until he is back home before asking casually about her sister's family, the Potters, and what they had named their son. Petunia says the son was named Harry, a nasty, lower-class sort of name.

Discussing the Dursley family, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]] questions [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s decision to place [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|the infant Harry]] with the Dursleys, saying that they are &quot;the worst kind of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]].&quot; She reports that she had seen [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|their child]] hitting Petunia, demanding candy. Dumbledore says he is aware that Harry would have a home in any Wizarding household, but that he has his reasons for putting Harry there.

We are told that it is Petunia Dursley who finds the infant Harry on the Dursley doorstep. Apparently, it is also Petunia who handles most of the &quot;odd things&quot; happening around Harry: when his hair will not remain cut the way she wants it, she cuts it short, only to have it grow back overnight; she is trying to force a hideous sweater over Harry's head when it mysteriously shrinks to the point that it will not even fit over his hand; and she receives the school reports about odd things happening there, such as Harry climbing on the roof.

In the events surrounding Dudley's eleventh birthday and the subsequent appearance of Harry's first Hogwarts letter, Vernon is the center of the action, while Petunia largely backs Vernon up. While Petunia does receive the phone call from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Mrs. Figg]] saying that she won't be able to look after Harry, and then comforts Dudley in his dismay at having to have Harry along, she thereafter remains largely in the background as Vernon drives them to the zoo, buys treats for Dudley, retrieves Dudley from the snake enclosure, and punishes Harry for this odd event by locking him back in his cupboard under the stairs. And when Harry's Hogwarts letter arrives, it is Vernon who takes it from him and opens it. While Vernon and Petunia do discuss what to do about this letter, it is Vernon who decides that they will simply not answer it. When more letters arrive, Vernon intercepts and destroys them. It is Vernon who, in the end, decides that they must leave the house to escape the letters. Dudley asks Petunia at this point if &quot;Daddy has gone mad&quot;; Petunia does not seem to be able to answer.

When the family finally settles in the hut on the island, Petunia still has not had much role in things. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] arrives, he tells Harry that his mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily]], Petunia's sister, was an extremely good witch. Petunia, apparently pushed beyond her endurance, bursts out that Lily was a freak, coming home with pockets full of frog spawn, and that she was doted on by her parents. Only Petunia saw what she really was. Petunia's malevolence is only stopped when she mentions that Harry's parents had gotten themselves blown up. Harry interjects that Petunia had told him that his parents had been killed in a car crash, which prompts Hagrid to respond angrily that no car crash could have done anything to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and Lily Potter. The conversation then is carried by Vernon and Hagrid until Vernon insults Dumbledore. Enraged, Hagrid gives Dudley a pig's tail, and the Dursleys retreat in confusion, leaving Harry and Hagrid the front room.

When Vernon takes Harry to Kings Cross Station to board the train a month later, Dudley and Petunia are in the car; Vernon has only consented to take Harry to London because they need to go to a specialist to get Dudley's tail removed before school starts. During the trip, she says nothing; but we see her laughing at Harry as the car drives away, leaving Harry to hunt for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]].

Petunia is at King's Cross Station when Harry returns from school, but says nothing, simply watching as Vernon verbally collects Harry and directs him towards the exit.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Harry is not surprised when nobody in the house remembers that it is his birthday. Vernon has important visitors arriving that night, and Petunia and Dudley are called upon to rehearse their lines. Harry is hard-put to avoid laughing at the excesses that they are planning, but Petunia is overcome instead by what she sees as Dudley's brilliance.

Later, when Harry is in the garden, Dudley taunts him about having received no mail from his &quot;weird friends at that school&quot;. Harry, angered, says he was thinking about how to set the hedge on fire, and starts mumbling nonsense words. Panicking, Dudley calls for his mother; Petunia swings at Harry's head with a soapy frying pan, but misses. As punishment for daring to use magic, Petunia gives Harry a long sequence of tasks to help her cleaning up the house for Vernon's visitors, then sends him up to his room after a very sketchy dinner.

When Harry is locked into his room, Petunia does periodically bring him meals which she pushes through a cat-flap in his door. Neither Harry nor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] finds cold vegetable soup particularly appealing, but that being all they have, they make do.

Petunia again is present when Harry returns from school, but says nothing, leaving the conversation to Vernon.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Petunia and Vernon are listening to the new kitchen TV when the newscaster talks about a murderer who has escaped from prison, one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Apparently at the mention of a reward for information, Petunia looks out the kitchen window, as if expecting an escaped convict to be hiding in their back yard.

For the rest of Harry's time there, however, she is quite overshadowed by Vernon's sister, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marge Dursley|Marge]], who visits for a week starting on Harry's birthday.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Dudley's school nurse has seen what Petunia, so quick to see a fingerprint on her walls or what the neighbours are doing, could not see: that Dudley is not just fat, but massively obese. Petunia has, under prompting, put him on a diet, and so he would not feel alone, has put the rest of the family on a diet as well.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] has managed to get tickets to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] and agrees to pick Harry up and take him to The Burrow. While they are waiting for the Weasley family to arrive, Petunia is compulsively straightening cushions in the sitting room. Mr. Weasley arrives through the boarded up fireplace, rather explosively, with Ron, Fred and George, and Petunia tries to hide behind Vernon. When Dudley eats one of the Twins' accidentally-on-purpose dropped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ton-Tongue Toffee|Ton-Tongue Toffees]], it makes his tongue become several feet long; we see Petunia struggling with it, trying to get it out of his mouth. During the ensuing mayhem, Harry departs at Mr. Weasley's orders; it seems that Petunia is largely having hysterics at this point.

Petunia is not present at Kings' Cross Station when Harry returns from school.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Petunia opens the door to a clearly ill Dudley (he vomits all over the mat) being supported by Harry. Once inside, Dudley accuses Harry of using magic on him. Harry replies that while he had his wand out and had threatened Dudley with it, he had not used it against Dudley. After much arguing back and forth, complete with arrivals of owls threatening Harry with imprisonment and expulsion from Hogwarts, Uncle Vernon demands to know what these [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] are that Harry was supposedly protecting Dudley from. Petunia tells him that they are the guards from the Wizard prison, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]]. Suddenly realizing what she has said, she claps her hand over her mouth, then explains that she had heard &quot;that awful boy&quot; talking about them with her sister, Lily. This proves too much for Vernon, who now orders Harry out of the house. Another owl arrives, this one with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Howler|Howler]] addressed to Petunia. Harry, knowing what Howlers will do if left alone, recommends that she open it; she does, and an awful voice says, &quot;Remember my last, Petunia!&quot; before the letter dissolves into flames.

Still in shock, Petunia now says that Harry will have to stay with them. Over Vernon's protests, and with her voice strengthening as her self-assurance returns, she says that throwing Harry out will look very bad to the neighbours. Vernon, giving in, sends Harry to his room.

Harry remains in his room until Vernon receives notification that he may be the winner of the Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition. The Dursleys go off to the competition venue, and Harry departs Privet Drive for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place]] with the Advance Guard.

In Harry's conversation with Dumbledore after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|the battle at the Ministry]], we learn that the Howler which had changed Petunia's mind so that she overruled Vernon about throwing Harry out was, in fact, sent by Dumbledore. We also learn the reason Harry has been forced to stay with the Dursleys: Lily dying to save Harry from Voldemort had created a powerful protective charm, but it could only be maintained while Harry had a place that he could call home that was shielded by Lily's blood &amp;ndash; in this case, Petunia, Lily's sister.

When Harry returns to London on the Hogwarts Express, the Dursleys are there waiting for him. A group of wizards, led by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]], confronts them, saying that they expect to hear regularly from Harry, and that they expect Harry to be treated well. While most of the conversation is directed at Vernon, Harry does notice that Petunia seems most distressed, not by the appearance of this flock of wizards, but rather by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks']] hair, which is its usual shocking pink color.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Dumbledore tells Harry that he will be arriving to take Harry to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] only a fortnight after school ends. Harry only half believes him, and has not told the Dursleys, so Dumbledore's arrival at 11PM comes as a shock to them. At his arrival, Petunia comes out of the kitchen where she has been giving all the surfaces their nightly wipedown, wearing a house-dress and rubber gloves. Dumbledore propels a couch into the three Dursleys, forcing them to sit down, then suggesting drinks, summons several glasses of mead, which he sends across the room to the Dursleys. Vernon, Petunia, and Dudley ignore the glasses of mead, which become more insistent as the conversation goes on. Harry notes that one of the glasses is bouncing repeatedly off Vernon's head, spilling its contents in its insistence to be noticed; another must be acting similarly with Petunia. Dumbledore tells Vernon and Petunia that he had expected that they would treat Harry as one of their own children, and was very disappointed that they had not; however, he was pleased that Harry had not been as badly treated as the child sitting between them. Both Petunia and Vernon look around, appearing to think that Dumbledore was referring to someone other than Dudley. Dumbledore also says that, while Harry will be visiting again briefly, he will not stay long over the next summer break, as the charm that protects him will end when he reaches his majority, at seventeen.

When Dumbledore summons [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] in an attempt to determine whether the house at Grimmauld Place has passed to Harry, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] had intended, Harry sees Petunia's look of revulsion, and thinks that nothing as dirty as Kreacher had likely ever been in her house.

Petunia says very little during this visit of Dumbledore's, and Harry does not return to Privet Drive in this book.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

We see Petunia only briefly at the beginning of this book; as she and Vernon are preparing to leave for a place of safety, Dudley says that he does not believe that Harry is a waste of space. Petunia seems aware that this is effusive compliments from Dudley, but her only response is a nod of the head to Harry as she leaves the house.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]'s memories, we see the young Petunia and her sister Lily, before Lily goes to Hogwarts. We see Petunia's fear when Lily demonstrates that she can make a flower open and close, and we see Petunia's distrust of the young Snape. We also see that Petunia eavesdrops on Lily and Severus talking about the Wizarding world, particularly about the Dementors and Azkaban Prison. On the platform where Lily is about to board the Hogwarts Express, we also learn that Petunia had sent a letter to Hogwarts asking to be accepted into the school, and had received a refusal.

== Strengths ==

It's shown that Petunia is a very neat person and likes everything else neat and tidy, also.

Although she is not fully aware of it, Petunia projects Lily's protection of Harry due to their blood relation.

== Weaknesses ==

Petunia's desire that things be neat and clean borders on obsession. It appears that before she goes to bed at night she has to scrub down the kitchen completely; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']] we see her with her nightdress and housecoat, wearing rubber gloves and clearly in the middle of her bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], we learn also that she expects to take all day cleaning up the house for the Masons, dinner guests and potential clients of Vernon Dursley.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

She is Lily Potter's older sister, and thinks that her sister is a &quot;freak&quot;.  She has  the same opinion of her nephew, Harry Potter.  She married Vernon Dursley, and had a son, Dudley Dursley. 

We are told that she spends large parts of each day snooping on the neighbours, and of course we see that she models her behaviour based on what the neighbours would think. Any relationships with other characters, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|&quot;batty old Mrs. Figg&quot;]], are going to be coloured by a need to keep up appearances. Relationships with Wizards, such as Albus Dumbledore, will be primarily tinged with fear; she fears and distrusts the magic that, by her lights, took her sister away from her.

Petunia's relationships with her family are somewhat varied, though apparently uniformly shallow. Toward Harry, we see that Petunia makes no accommodation to Harry's needs, rather seeing him as unpaid domestic help; in the first three books, we see her setting him tasks like making breakfast, weeding the gardens, scrubbing pans, and similar work. We have seen that Vernon often restricts Harry to his room for days at a time; Petunia assists in this by preparing food, barely enough to sustain Harry's life, and pushing it through a cat-flap installed in Harry's bedroom door, at intervals. Petunia never shows Harry the slightest bit of affection. As Harry matures and becomes more powerful as a wizard, Petunia's feelings towards him shift, becoming less aloof and more fearful.

Petunia acts completely differently towards her son, Dudley, showering him with gifts and making nearly infinite allowances for his desires. It is hard to know how much of this is from affection, and how much is from fear; it seems Dudley is quite capable of hitting Petunia and does so when provoked.

It is hard to determine Petunia's actual feelings, if any, towards her husband, Vernon. It does seem that she discourages intimacy. One gets the feeling almost that Petunia has gotten married because that is what people do, rather than out of any particular affection for the man she is married to.

== Analysis ==

Petunia seems to be inordinately interested in what other people are doing, and thus, is extremely concerned with what other people think of her. Having accepted Harry into her house, reluctantly, we see that her rationale for keeping him there as he grows is that people would wonder what had gone wrong were he suddenly to disappear. Nearly everything that Petunia does is done to look good in the eyes of the neighbours, with the possible exceptions of her private treatment of Harry and her treatment of Dudley. We see this in particular at the start of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', where Harry is almost thrown out of the house before Petunia rationalizes the instructions she has received in terms of what the neighbours would think, and again at the end of that same book where she seems dismayed in particular by the unconventionality of Tonks' hair colour.

Petunia's stated reason for the Dursleys' treatment of Harry is to &quot;stamp that (magic) stuff out of him&quot;, to make him normal so that he can take his place in &quot;normal&quot; society. However, her parsimonious treatment of Harry, giving him Dudley's cast-off and horribly oversized clothes, and her attempts to cut his hair, rather undercut his chances at ever being accepted into normal society. Petunia obviously feels that providing a roof for Harry should be enough, and that he should be grateful for that, and for any scraps the family deigns to send his way.

One thing which should be mentioned is the Howler delivered to Petunia at the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. While we do eventually learn that this came from Dumbledore, we never hear any more about the circumstances. The fact that Dumbledore says &quot;Remember my last [letter], Petunia,&quot; has been seen as proof that there has been ongoing correspondence between them, as if there had only been the one letter that had been left with Harry, the Howler would instead have said something like &quot;Remember my letter&quot;. It is confirmed that Dumbledore had written to Petunia earlier — we find out in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that Dumbledore had rejected her application to attend Hogwarts — but we are uncertain whether that and the letter left with Harry are the only two times Dumbledore has written to her, or whether there has been a trickle of correspondence over the years. Given the shock with which the Dursleys received Harry's first Hogwarts letter, one must suspect that there was little, if any, correspondence over the years, so the &quot;last&quot; to which Dumbledore referred in the Howler was most likely the letter that he had left with the infant Harry some fourteen years earlier. It is a safe assumption that Dumbledore had, in that letter, informed Petunia of the threat facing Harry should Voldemort return, and why Petunia was Harry's best hope of survival. Presumably, Petunia did not inform Vernon of the full details; if he knew them, Petunia would likely have mentioned them rather than talking about what the neighbours would think.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#How much does Petunia actually know about the wizarding world?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One of the things that most clearly defines Petunia, as we see in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], is her fear and distrust of things magical, which has been a large part of the reason Harry has been kept ignorant of his ancestry. While she is joined in this distrust by her husband Vernon, one must wonder, having completed the series, how much of this on Petunia's part is jealousy. Yes, Lily's magical ability had frightened her, and she had serious doubts about young Severus, who was evidently of a lower social class. Yet she had, as it turns out, written to Dumbledore pleading for admission to Hogwarts and been refused. It is likely that a large part of her jealousy was sour grapes: &quot;the magical world has refused me, so I will refuse it.&quot; Harry, as part of the magical world, was similarly refused any part of Petunia's concern; it was likely only by telling herself that she could stamp the magic out of Harry, that she could countenance having him in her house at all.

The purpose of this page is to provide a quick comparison of the stages that are used for various malignancies.  It is not meant to go into detail of what constitutes each stage.  For that information, see the article on each specific malignancy.

This page uses the lastest AJCC 6th edition from 2002.

''Note: should move this information into table form''

Notes: M-stage not listed unless it is different than the commonly used M0 or M1.
&lt;br&gt;For simplicity, N(1-3) means N-stage can be N0 or N1-3. However, N(0-1) means N-stage is N0 or N1. These schemes are different but easier to remember.
&lt;br&gt;All sites also contain T0 (no tumor) but this isn't listed below. Many sites contain Tis and Stage 0 but these aren't listed below.

The headings below are per the AJCC Cancer Staging Handbook and do not necessarily follow the Table of Contents organization of this wikibook.

In all, T-stage parallels the FIGO stage, except there is no T4b (Stage IVB is M1), and in cases where the FIGO stage includes node-positive disease as a distinct stage (e.g. uterine corpus Stage IIIC). Except for vulvar, N+ makes the overall stage the highest Stage III stage. There is no T4 (and thus no IVA) for ovary and fallopian tube.
&lt;br&gt;N-stage changes the FIGO stage in most, but only in vulvar cancer is there N1 vs N2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Many states, including Texas, California, Massachusetts, Georgia, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Arizona have special telephone equipment distribution programs that provide telephone-compatible anti-stuttering devices free to qualified residents. (See below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're unemployed and stutter, your state's vocational rehabilitation program will help get you a job, including paying for speech therapy and/or an anti-stuttering device. See the section [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/How to Handle Job Interviews#Vocational Rehabilitation|Vocational Rehabilitation]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're employed, ask your employer to help pay for an anti-stuttering device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your employer were to say no, you could say that the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/How to Handle Job Interviews#The Americans With Disabilities Act|Americans with Disabilities Act]] requires employers to pay for &amp;quot;reasonable accommodations&amp;quot; requested by employees with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some speech clinics will handle your insurance billing for anti-stuttering devices. The CPT/HCPCS procedure code for electronic anti-stuttering devices is E1399-NU. The diagnosis code for stuttering is 307.0.&lt;/p&gt;

==Special Telephone Equipment Distribution Programs==

&lt;p&gt;Most states have programs to help individuals with disabilities use telephones. States that &lt;i&gt;DO NOT&lt;/i&gt; provide anti-stuttering telephone devices include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alabama (no program)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Colorado (hearing impaired only)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Idaho (hearing impaired only)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;New Hampshire (independent living only)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;New York (no program)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ohio (no program)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other states may provide anti-stuttering devices on a case-by-case basis. Find other state programs on the [http://www.tedpa.org/statprog/map.htm TEDPA] website. In general, if a program's mandate includes speech-impaired individuals then the program might help stutterers. If a program's mandate is only for hearing-impaired individuals then the program doesn't help stutterers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following information may be inaccurate or out of date. Please check with your state's program.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes linear cord like, sometimes broad and sheet like, tendons in the body vary in structure, macroscopically, at the microscopic level and at the level of the intracellular aparatus depending upon the particular setting in which they act.  Tendons impart the force of contraction of a muscle to bone either to stabilize its position in space against an external force or to accelerate the bone through space.  From the standpoint of the joint in the first case the motion of the joint is prevented by the neutralization of an external force the length of the muscle tendon unit remains relatively fixed or in the second case the motion of the joint is produced by shortening of the muscle tendon unit with relaxation and relative lengthening of the antagonist muscles. 

While the classic conception of a concentric contraction affecting flexion or extension of a joint provides a basic statement of the manner in which a muscle tendon unit functions, in the body the function is often  more complex.  It is the role of the muscle tendon unit to dampen impact forces to the skeleton and to modulate the motion by the allowance for eccentric contraction leading to smooth decelerations and the imparting of forces through a transfer of potential energy in the form of spring like elastic forces contained by the stretched muscle tendon units.  The muscle contraction serves to maintain tension in the muscle tendon unit so that the transfer of kinetic and potential envergy can occur.  This biomechanically more complex arrangement  is especially evident in the highly coordinated activities of running and throwing.  Aging results in a less elastic structure within tendon leading to deteriorating performance in these activities after age 40. Tendinosis within the supraspinatus tendon is present in somewhat less than 1/3 or individuals under the age of forty with increasing frequency with age but still absent in 10% of 80 year olds thus the changes conflate with aging but may not be justifiably characterized as due to aging. Tendinosis is noted in a higher percentage of torn tendon samples than in in tact tendons suggesting that this process does contribute to a vulnerability to injury. Inflammatiom as defined by the presence of neutrophils  occurs at the sight of tendon rupture however they may be there in response to necrotic tenocytes and disrupted collagen. While submaximal strains may result in collagen disruption which stimulates an inflammatory response, the  cytokine activity stimulated by the inflammatory response may further weaken the tendon leading to failure upon repeated strains prior to structurally competent remodeling.   

Gait analysis reveals the perfect, or in the pathologic state the imperfect, balancing of floor reaction force vectors, as derived from force plate data, in relation to joint axis and just sufficient  opposing torque, as derived from dynamic EMG data,  imparted by the contracting muscle tendon unit such that the center of gravity can be advanced in an energy efficient manner. Feedback via stretch receptors (golgi organs) at the terminal ends of sensory neurons terminating mostly on the surface of tendons and especially at the musculotendinous junction provide the feedback to mediate these reflex contractions.    
In the case of the elaborate programmed and learned activites such as these the proprioceptive function of the tendons  provide for anticipatory reflexive contractions to occur whereby the joints are spared exessive forces. In this way the coordinated function of the muscle tendon unit protect the skeleton and the cartilage from damage. Joint architecture in conjunction with periarticular ligamentous structures are likewise evolved to enable motion while avoiding deleterious shear forces upon the cartilage which is durable in compression but prone to stuctural damage when exposed to shear. Joints act in series to permit a greater arc of overall motion while maintaining joint contact forces perpendicular to the opposing joint surfaces, thus allowing for the range of motion while remaining a mechanically sound environment compatable with  the working material parameters of cartilage.  The segmental structure of the spine and the serial stucture of the wrist and ankle are examples.

Human movement evolves in patterns by which combinations of posture and gesture communicate intent and social relation augmenting or undermining verbal communication.  The effect crosses cultural and even species barriers. [http://www.limsonline.org/ Movement]
   
Histology of tendons reveal columns of tenocytes elongated with oval nuclei in aligned with the linear pattern of collagen the concentric production of collagen extruded from the tenocyte and arrayed in the extracellular matrix resulting in the fascicle pattern observed. There are associated blood vessels and nerves a peritenon and epitenon with a slight fluid layer between in larger tendons.  Bursae are frequently associated as in the shoulder and about the achillus tendon and hamstring insertion at the knee.

The smallest functional unit that we acknowledge is a fascicle consisting of collagen aligned end to end  a quarter staggered array. Fibril diameters vary from 10 to 500 nm depending upon species and age. Fibrils are bundled to form fascicles which are surrounded by loose connective tissue endotenon through which course blood vessels lymphatics and nerves.

Tendon structure has variation in the size of fascicles and variations in the degree of crimp of the collagen within the matrix, a feature that serves ot dampen sudden strains and responsible for the toe region of the stress strain curve.The crimping straightens after which the stress strain curve becomes linear from about 2% strain to 4% strain after which bond slippage and finally failure begins to occur with gross failure at 8% strain on average. High strain rates and obliquity of strain increase the likelihood of failure.  Tendons which typically handle higher sudden loading generally exhibit greater crimp angles.  Some tendons notably the rotator cuff may be subject to compressive and shear forces which the structure must contend with.  These tendons have more complex ultrastucture with some transverse and spiral patterned collagen fiber orientation. Muscle tendon units that cross more than one joint may be uniquely vulnerable by virtue of more complex patterns of mechanical stesses, the achilles tendon the hamstrings  and the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon are noteworthy in this regard.   

While the majority of forces are in line tension the structures of muscle tendon units vary with resultant differences in excursion which appear to match the role the muscle tendon unit plays with multipennate and unipennate pattern which favor a priority upon power or excursion. Tendons transmit  tension forces through a matrix composed predominantly of type I collagen (95%, very small amounts of elastin which is capable of 200% strain to failure as opposed to collagen in with a 8% strain typically results in failure. Type III collagen is seen in healed tendons, its presence in normal tendon represents a minor contibution under normal conditions. Proteoglycan is present and is felt to play a larger role in compressive forces where present.  The subtleties of the composition vary through the body in a manner commensurate with the varying function of tendons.  Lower extremity tendons involved in running and shoulder tendons involved in throwing have compositions with more elastin.  Tendons involved in grasp and fine motor function are stiffer with more extensive cross linking of type I collagen. Distinctions in ultastructure are also noted with smaller fascicles in flexor tendons and larger fascicles in weight bearing tendons  

The potential strength of a muscle contraction is proportional to the cross sectional area of the muscle. This strength of contraction can be made to vary with training and disuse and the atrophy or the hypertrophy of the muscle may be readily observed over a matter of days or weeks.  The tendon too will respond to physiologic stress and lack of use thus as a living structure it thrives on regular mechanical strains to order itself.  Adaptive change and functional reserve are facilitated by gradual transitions whereas sudden changes especially unanticipated high strain rate loading or sudden changes in the frequency of loading, like a new weekend project taken on by a white collar worker, can lead to injury.  Indeed daily injury and mechanical stesses trigger adaptive remodeling  by  tendon modulating rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis in keeping with changing mechanical demands resulting in periodic renewal of tendon cellular structure and material composition. The mechanism and degree of adaptive changes occurring in tendons in response to conditioning remain ill defined.  Likewise the presumed mechanism of chronic tendinosis leading to attritional failure as a consequence of a remodeling process out of step with demand remains a matter of speculation.  

Tendon can withstand up to 1000 Kilograms per square centimeter, and at times appears to be subject of forces as within the achilles tendon during running which at 12 times body weight exceed the ultimate tensile strength of the tendon. The muscle tendon unit is protected by reflex relaxation of the muscle at higher strains. 

Tendon displays viscoelastic properties consistent with the organic polymeric structure of its constituent type I collagen. Viscoelasticity is defined by such behaviors as increasing strain with sustained stress (creep) and  decreasing stress at constant strain (stress relaxation), properties which one can appreciate in the process of conducting a stretching regimen. Another viscoelastic property is an increase in apparent stiffness at higher strain rates, which will also tend to mean a lower ultimate tensile strength and failure at a lower % strain at higher strain rate. These material properties also play a role under cyclic loading whereby phase lag (hysteresis) will contribute to the dissipation of mechanical energy. Atomic force microscopy of collagen structure suggests that its inherent mechanical strength is partly explained by the cross linking and hydrogen bonding between the triple helical strands of collagen which function as sacrificial bonds which break thus absorbing load and then rapidly reform. 

It is hypothesized that repeated submaximal strains can result in an altered balance of proliferation and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Nuclear fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis is observed in tendinosis of the rotator cuff.  Tendon remodeling which pushes the limit of its capacity to keep up results in a tendon stucture that may be weaker and thus more readily prone to failure at a lower percent strain or at a lower strain rate than would otherwise be required. Lipoid and mucinous degeneration are both noted in tendon.
While many systemic factors come in to play one common thread may be a common influence upon the local blood flow to portions of certain tendons. Hypoxia with overuse may result in anoxic injury, reperfusion injury due to reactive oxygen species is suggested by the finding of enyzmes in tenocytes that function to neutralize the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species.  Watershed areas are implicated in the suprapinatus and achilles tendons. It is in keeping with the pruning effect of smoking on small blood vessels that the lack of colleral supply in these watershed areas may come into play.
It is debated whether the findings of fibroangioblastic change associated with tendinosis is in keeping with this hypothesis or not. The seemingly contradictory proliferation of blood vessels may reflect an attempt to overcome a previous phase of dysvascularity. It is also unknown whether apoptosis represents a primary pathologic process such as occurs in some forms of musculodystrophy or alzheimers or whether this process is secondary to some other pathology representing a normal remodeling process in response to that injury.    

Ultimately it is the resident cell poplulation of tenocytes that maintain the functional integrity of the matrix which provides the mechanical properties of the tendon although in cases of tendon laceration, both an intrinsic and extrinsic repair potential comes into play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The short answer is &quot;Nobody knows&quot; - but it's interesting to try to make some guesses based on what we '''do''' know!

Scientists who have tried to make good guesses use an equation called 'The Drake Equation' which was named after Doctor Frank Drake who first tried to work this out about forty years ago.   The idea is that if you know how likely it was for life to form on Earth - and if you know how many planets there are that are more or less like the Earth - then you can make a good estimate of how much life there is out there.

We can try to do that ourselves.

=== How many stars are there in the Universe? ===

When you look up at the sky on a really dark night - far from the lights of cities and roads, you can see about five thousand stars and four or five planets.  But nearly all of the stars and planets out there are far, far away and much too dim to see.

We know that there are eight planets orbiting the Sun and that our sun is a lot like the other stars out there in our galaxy.  Our galaxy (which we call &quot;The Milky Way&quot; because it looks like a splash of milk across the night sky) has about three hundred '''billion''' stars in it.  But the Milky Way is a rather small galaxy and there are many, many other galaxies.

With our very best telescopes we can see about a hundred billion galaxies.  With a hundred billion galaxies - each one with hundreds or even thousands of billions of stars - astronomers calculate that there are about fifty thousand, billion, billion stars in the part of the universe that we can see!  That's a big number.  Written out in numbers it's  50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars!

=== Do all of those stars have planets? ===
Well, it's rather hard to tell for sure - but astronomers have looked carefully at some of the stars in our neighborhood and whilst planets that are orbiting other stars are too small to see - even with our very best telescopes, we can sometimes see a slight wobble in the light coming from a star that is caused by the gravity of one or more planets that are orbiting it.

Knowing that, we have found that many nearby stars have at least a few planets that are big enough to wobble the lights from the star enough so we know they are there. There are probably other planets too small to produce a big enough wobble for us to measure - so we don't know exactly how many planets to expect. But it seems that there are probably more planets than stars in the universe, so there could easily be 50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets for life to try to get started on.  That's a lot of places and we haven't counted moons, asteroids, comets and dust clouds!

=== How often does life actually get started on one of these planets? ===

This something we can really only guess at.  We know that life formed once on one planet because we are that life and we live on that planet - but how do we know whether the Earth is just an amazingly special place or whether there are Earth-like planets orbiting most of the stars in the sky?   Unfortunately, we don't know.

* Many planets must be too hot - like Venus and Mercury in our own solar system.  Life can't survive there because the chemicals that life needs don't work properly when things are that hot.
* Other planets might be too cold - so there would not be enough sunlight for plants and animals to use as energy.  The outer planets of our Solar system - Pluto and Neptune - must be far too cold for life to exist there.
* It's possible that planets might not have the right mixture of life-giving chemicals.  There is no life on our Moon because it has no atmosphere - in daytime it's too hot and at night too cold.
* Other planets may form and then be destroyed before life has had time to form - and on others, life might have formed a long time ago and then died out for some reason,

But there are plenty of planets to choose from.  Next time you are on a beach or at a playground with a sand lot, take a handful of sand.  There are an awful lot of tiny sand grains in a fistful of sand - but there are more stars and planets than there are grains of sand on all the beaches of all the world!  Surely they can't all be too hot, too cold, too dry or too poisonous?

But we humans haven't yet looked closely enough in enough places where life might be to really know for sure what life needs.  We've found bacteria living in boiling hot water near underwater volcanoes.  There are tiny worms who live in the ice near to the South Pole.  Bacteria have been found living inside rocks in the deepest mine shafts.  There is hardly anywhere on earth where live can't survive somehow.   Astronauts from Apollo 12 who visited the moon in 1969 visited the Surveyor III lander that had been sitting on the moon for more than two years.  They found that bacteria that had hitched a ride on Surveyor when it was launched and were still alive after two years of living on the moon!

It seems then that life can survive and even prosper in some fairly hostile places - this shows that a planet may not have to be a comfortable place for humans in order to develop life.  However, there doesn't seem to be any native life on the Moon beyond what humans have put there by accident and our robotic missions haven't found life on Mars or Venus or any of the comets we've looked at closely.

With at fifty thousand billion billion planets in the universe, even if each planet only had a one in a trillion chance of having life, there could still be billions of planets teeming with life out there in the universe. But if the chances are that bad then we might be alone in our galaxy with the nearest other creatures living hundreds of millions of light years away.   Even if the odds for life are only a million to one for each planet, we humans and our robots might have to travel for thousands of years and search millions of planets and moons before we'd find them.

=== So how many aliens are there? ===

That is where the drake equation comes into play:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; × f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; × n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; × f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; × f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; × f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; × L = The number of alien civilisations that we can talk to in our galaxy&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This equation might look complicated, but it's actually quite simple when you understand it. 

R&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is how many stars appear a year. So, for example, if there was 10 stars being made every year, then you could scrible out R* and put at '10' there instead.

f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the chances that a star has planets. If, on average, there was a 1 in 2 chance that each new star had a planet, then the number that replaced f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; would be 0.5 (1÷2).

n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of planets in each solar system that can have life. In our solar system, n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; would be 1, because we only have one planet that we know has life on it, Earth.

f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; is the chances that these planets have life. If all planets that could have life have life, then 1 would go in the place of f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;

f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the chances that the life on these planets is clever. A 1 in a hundred chance of life would give us 0.01, 1÷100.

f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the chance that they will be able to talk to us. This number might be 1 (100%), because if they are clever they will eventually find out how to talk to other planets.

Finally, L is how long each alien civilisation will live (or want to talk to us), in years. Though nobody knows the real value of this, Frank Drake guessed 10,000 years.

Now, we can multiply them all together. 10×0.5×1×1×0.01×1×10000 = 500 alien civilisations in our galaxy. The values here are just guesses, though, and other guesses have ranged from only one civilisation in our galaxy to thousands.

=== Little Green Aliens ===
If so many planets in the universe does this mean that we should expect little green aliens to be popping out of their flying saucers soon? Well, perhaps not.  For beings living in another galaxy outside of the Milky Way, if they noticed that we are here and set out to visit us - traveling at the speed of light, they still wouldn't get here for another 300 million years!  They couldn't have set out millions of years ago to visit us because humans haven't been on around for nearly that long.

If we're going to be visited by aliens, they'd have to live on a nearby star and know how to fly very fast to get here.  That means that if we are to meet alien cultures they must come from within the very few stars that are within a reasonable travel time.  Life would have to be very common indeed for there to be intelligent beings close enough to meet us face-to-face.

=== SETI - The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence ===
One group of scientists are searching for other intelligent life in our galaxy by listening to the radio.  With large radio telescopes they sweep the stars looking for radio signals with interesting patterns in them that would not come from natural radio sources.  So far, they haven't found anything - but that may mean that they have to keep on looking - or it might be that the aliens are not transmitting anything in our direction with enough power for SETI's sensitive radio telescopes to pick up.

=== Panspermia - Life from Space? ===
One other possibility is that life didn't just appear on Earth at all.   If life were really common throughout the universe, it's possible that life arrived on Earth after it developed somewhere else.   We know that meteorites found on Earth have come here from the Moon and from Mars - and probably from other planets too.  We also know that debris in the form of little bits of rock and ice rain down on the Earth from space all the time.  If life existed in that debris when the Earth was young, there is a good chance that we Earthlings originally came from some other planet entirely.  It could be that all life on Earth originated on Mars and we are the alien invaders!

=== So what '''IS''' the answer? ===
We still don't know for sure that there is life anywhere beyond the earth, and even if life were common in the universe, we don't know whether we'd ever be able to find it if there was.

The search for life beyond Earth is a very new thing.  Humans have only been searching for about 40 years - and we've only been looking in the most likely places for 10 years.  If we humans are going to find signs of life outside the Earth, it will probably happen in your lifetime.  You may one day be amongst the first humans to encounter alien life or to hear a message from another world through SETI!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lighting is the most important aspect of a good render. Without it, there is only darkness. This topic will be dedicated to examining all of the properties one can find when using Lights.

To create a light, right click on the Objects folder in the Project Workspace, select New, and click on Light.


[[File:NewLight.jpg|center]]


A new Light will appear in the Objects folder.


Lights have many properties that tell Animation:Master how to render, as well as properties that tell where to put the light, and what direction to aim it in.


[[File:LightProperties.jpg|center]]

==Bone Position==

The Bone Position sets the coordinates of Bone for the Light.


[[File:BonePosition.jpg|center]]

===Start===
Changing the Start values will set the starting position of the Bone in relation to the origin. Adjusting this value will change the values in the Rotate menu and will change the Length.

===End===
Changing the End values will set the ending position of the Bone in relation to the origin. Adjusting this value will change the values in the Rotate menu and will change the Length.

===Rotate===
The Rotate menu sets how a Light is oriented in relation to the center of the light. Adjusting the Rotate values will change the values in the End menu.

===Length===
The Length values sets how long the Bone is. Adjusting this value will change the values in the End menu.

For the most part, I suggest not changing the Bone Start and End position values. When a Light is put into a Choreogrophy or an Action, the position of the Light will be controlled by the Transform Values. The only time the Bone Position should be changed is when a Light is added into a Model, and a Light is needed in a specific location on the model at all times. It is a good idea to adjust the Length of a Light if you are using a Klieg or a Sun Light so that you can grab the end of the Bone without having to zoom in or out.

==Transform==
'''Note:''' The Transform values will not change the position of the light when changed in the Objects folder. They really have no purpose in the Objects folder and should have Visibility set to False.


[[File:Animation Master Transform.jpg|center]]


In a Choreography or an Action, the Transform values act very similarly to Bone Position values. Neither The Bone's Start and End, nor the Length can be changed with Transform values. 

===Translate===
The Translate values set the position of the Light in relation to the Bone Start and End values. Meaing, if the Bone Start and End values are set to the default values (0,0,0), then the Translate values would move in relation to the origin.

If you select a light in a choreography, left-click on the center of the light and drag it around the screen. This will translate the light to the position underneath the mouse. 


[[File:TransformLight.jpg|center]]

===Scale===

Scale sets the size of the Light in the three different dimensions. This value affects only two values: how rays are emitted from the light, and the shape of volumetrics. I will discuss those later in this topic. I suggest leaving the scale as it is.

===Rotate===
The Rotate menu sets how the objects will be oriented in relation to the center of the light. Changing the Rotate values will not affect Bulb lights unless volumetrics are used in conjunction with a customized scale. Klieg and Sun Lights use Rotate the most often. You can either enter these values manually, or you can use the manipulator on lights to rotate them to point in a direction.


[[Image:LightRotate.jpg|center]]


The control box at the end of the Bone sets the rotation of the light. You can view the light from any direction to make sure that it is properly rotated in the direction desired.

==Roll Method==
The Roll Method refers to how the Bone is rotated in an Action or Choreography as it is animated. The Roll Handel is the Control Box that is directly above the center of the Light which is connected by a handle. There are three different Roll Methods: Z-Singularity, Y-Poles-Singularity, and Roll History.

===Z-Singularity===
Z-Singularity is primarily used for Model Bones. When the Y rotation of the Bone approaches 180 degrees, the role handle will start to rotate around the original Axis of the Bone. If the light rotations have not been set in the Options folder, the Roll Handel will rotate around the negative Z-axis.


[[File:RollMethodZ-Singularity.jpg|center]]


The ring placed around the Z-axis shows how the Roll Handel will rotate. Notice that the light is pointing in the negative Z-Axis.

===Y-Poles-Singularity===
Y-Poles Singularity is the default Roll Method for objects like Lights, and Cameras. This Roll Method tries to keep the positioned in somewhat of an upright position. The Animation:Master Help file gives the example of a basketball court camera positioned in above the center of the court. The camera will roll so that the players are viewed in an upright position as the camera moves from one end of the court to the other.


[[File:RollMethodY-Poles-Singularity.jpg|center]]


The ring placed around the Y-axis shows how the Roll Handel will rotate. This rotation happens around both the positive and negative Y-axis.

===Roll-History===
The Roll-History Roll Method determines how a Bone will roll based on the history of the Roll Handel. When this method is used, there will be no axis at which the bone will rotate around. This can create smoother animation, but the exact rotation of the bone cannot always be predicted. Nonetheless, the rotations can always be corrected.

==Euler Order==
Euler Order refers to the freedom of rotation on the X and the Y plane. There are three types of Euler Order types: YXZ, XYZ, and Automatic.

===YXZ===
This Euler Order gives less of a priority over rotations made on the Y-axis. This means that when a Bone is rotated on the Y-axis, it only has 180 degrees of freedom. Outside of the 180 degrees of freedom, the other two axises control the rest of the motion.

===XYZ===
This Euler Order gives less of a priority over rotations made on the X-axis. This means that when a Bone is rotated on the X-axis, it only has 180 degrees of freedom. Outside of the 180 degrees of freedom, the other two axises control the rest of the motion.

===Automatic===
In most situations, this is the best Euler Order method because the differences between the other two types are small in differences. The reason why it is better is because Animation:Master determines which Euler Order is best for the Bone in a specific rotation.

==Ignore Fog==
Currently, the use of the feature with a Light is unknown. Normally when it is used on a model, that model will show up even if it is immersed in fog.

==Animate Mode==
Animate Mode determines whether or not the Light will animate over a scene. By default, the Animate Mode is set to ON, but if Animate Mode is set to OFF, the light will not move. This is good for keeping a static light in the scene. If Animate Mode is set to ON, then the light will animate normally.

==Type==
There are three different types of lights in Animation:Master: Bulb, Klieg, and Sun.


[[Image:LightTypes.jpg|center]]

===Bulb===
A Bulb Light emits light in all directions.


[[File:TypeBulb.jpg|center]]


The Bulb Light is positioned just in front of and above the Box. Notice that the light fades with distance and that light is being emitted onto every visible surface.

===Klieg===
A Klieg Light emits light in the direction enclosed within the Cone Angle of the Light.


[[File:TypeKlieg.jpg|center]]


This Light is positioned exactly where the Bulb Light was positioned. The Klieg is pointing towards the bottom corner of the box, and the Cone Angle is wide enough to show the top corner of the box.

===Sun===
A Sun Light emits light in one direction only. Because the source of the Light is considered to be extremely far away, there would be no light come from any other angle than the direction of the Light.


[[File:TypeSun.jpg|center]]


Sun Lights are good for outdoor scenes scenes because they emit shadows starting from the farthest outward geometry on the Sun Light's Axis.

==Width==
The Width sets the diameter of the light source.


[[File:LightWidths.jpg|center]]


The only values that have changed for these two lights is the Width. Notice that the falloff distance radius is pushed outwards because of the increase in Width when the actual falloff distance was not changed. This also affects how shadows are rendered if there is only 1 Ray Cast set in the Shadows menu.


[[File:LightWidths1RayShadows.jpg|center]]


This is a Top view of a Box that is positioned just below and to the left of the light source. Notice that the shadow on the 60 cm Width Light appears to have a gradient on it unlike the nearly solid black shadow of the 10 cm Width Light. To get rid of the gradients, turn up the ray casts, and turn on multipass.


[[File:LightWidths3RayCastsMultiPass.jpg|center]]


The shadows are now faded around the edges because more rays could pass by the geometry at different areas. I will go more into Ray Casts later on in this topic.

==Width of Softness==
The Width of Softness only appears in Klieg lights. What the Width of Softness does is sets how soft the outer rim of the Klieg Light is. Small percentages will result in harsher edges, which percentages closer to 100% will be very soft.


[[File:WidthOfSoftness.jpg|center]]

==Fall-Off==
The Fall-Off value is the distance at which the brightness of the Light is equal to the intensity of the light. This means if the Fall-Off distance was set to 500 cm, models positioned 500 cm away from the light source would be the diffuse color their surface properties are set to. Any surfaces closer to the light source would be brighter, and surfaces farther away would be darker.


[[File:LightFalloff.jpg|center]]


The closest box is much brighter than the second closest box, but because the brightest color on a monitor is white, the effects cannot be seen. The second box is actually set at the Fall-Off distance and all other boxes are set farther away then that.

==Cone Angle==
The Cone Angle is a value that is applicable only to a Kleig Light. This value sets the angle at which light is emitted from the Light.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of methods for removing tarnish from sterling silver. The benefits and drawbacks of each will be discussed below.

Before you take any action, take to heart the advice given to doctors: First, Do No Harm.

It is within your power to reduce a valuable antique to a worthless piece of slag.  Countless people over the centuries have destroyed works of art by rough polishing.  Please don't join their number.  In fact, the word ''polishing'' should be equated with ''sandpapering'' in your mind... as something to be avoided.  Tarnish is not a foreign substance above the surface of the silver.  Rather, tarnish is sulphur which has become chemically bonded into the surface of the silver.  Scouring away the silver on the surface in order to remove the tarnish is extreme overkill.  The only way to remove the sulphur without removing the silver surface is to ('''gently''') reverse the chemistry.

Keep in mind that there are two qualities you are trying to revive: 1) the original mirror surface formed by the silversmith during the final stages of production, and 2) the microscopic scratches which have naturally accumulated over that mirror surface in the course of lovingly using the piece.  Abrasion during cleaning will obliterate one or both of these qualities, and thereby most of the value of the piece.

== Hand Polishing ==
This is the method of care adhered to by serious collectors, as it brings out the beautiful luster of the sterling without destroying its patina. There are a variety of products available for hand polishing, from pastes to creams. It is generally best to stay with well-known silver-care product manufacturers, as some inferior products may cause scratching. (When in doubt, test the product in an inconspicuous area or on a less valuable piece.) Some examples are Twinkle Silver Cream (very gentle), Wright's Silver Cream (slightly more abrasive), and creams and pastes by the Hagerty company. These are readily available through supermarkets, jewelry stores and silver dealers, as well as on the Internet.

The author of this paragraph infinitely favors Hagerty's foam.  Not the pink spray made by the same company, but rather the foam.  Forget supermarkets.  Look for it in department stores which have a wedding gift department.  You'll find it in white plastic jars about the size of a baseball.  Despite being called foam, it actually looks like chocolate pudding... and smells absolutely nothing like chocolate pudding.  Use it as you used to use fingerpaint in kindergarten: with your bare fingertips, rub the foam over the surface of the silver.  Keep running your fingertips back and forth until, usually after just a few seconds, you begin to see the spots of tarnish fade.  In cases of more stubborn tarnish, you may need to rinse with tap water and again fingerpaint with the foam a second or third time.  Don't be impatient and reach for something scratchier to hurry up the process: that's the slippery slope towards destroying a piece.

Some pieces should not be immersed in water. Items containing mirrors, wooden parts, fabric, glue, etc. should be fingerpainted with as little foam as possible, then wiped with a barely damp sponge or cloth.  For particularly small areas of silver near parts that must not become wet, a Q-Tip dabbed into the foam will usually do quite well.

Not all yellowness on a piece of silver comes from tarnish.  Gold wash or ''vermeil'' was often applied to the interior of cups and goblets and on the service end of utensils to protect against corrosive beverages and foods. This wash is usually thin, and can be easily removed with too-abrasive or too-vigorous cleaning.  Hagerty's foam will not injure gold wash, but aggressive scrubbing with a cloth can injure it.

Keep in mind that it's not necessary or even desirable to remove every bit of tarnish from a piece of silver.  Especially when the piece has fluted or embossed surfaces, it's expected that the deep grooves will acquire a darker hue than the raised areas.  The resulting contrast is something to be left intact.  Should a particularly stubborn spot of tarnish refuse to fade after, say, half a dozen foam fingerpaintings, it's time to leave well enough alone.  

Crucially, avoid injuring any identifying mark which may be present on the piece.  American pieces will, if 92.5% silver, have the word STERLING stamped on them, usually on the underside.  Older American pieces, at 90% silver (called coin silver), may have nothing more than the maker's mark stamped on them.  European pieces, of various percentages silver, will typically have anywhere from one to half a dozen cryptic symbols (lions, anchors, crowns, moons, faces in profile, single or double letters, etc.) hammered into them.  It is imperative that these symbols not be worn away: they are the hallmarks by which a piece's age, origin place and maker are indicated.  Lose the hallmarks and what had been a verifiable 1754 French handworked masterpiece is now an unidentified could-have-been-mass-produced-last-week piece of junk.

If you are going to use the piece soon after applying the foam, finishing up the wash with gentle dishwashing liquid and lots of cool water is perfectly reasonable.  It is also perfectly reasonable to eat from the piece immediately after rinsing just with water.  If, however, you are going to put the piece away, let the foam be the last thing you rinse from the piece.  A trace of the foam will remain even after you've run enough fresh water over it not to be able to see any more foam.  This trace amount of foam will slow down the piece's chemical desire to become tarnished again.  Don't put a piece away wet.  Gently towel it dry (blotting rather than rubbing) and let it air for perhaps an hour before storing it away.

The remainder of this page is informative but very risky.  Remember: you can play one of two roles with this piece... you can either be its protector, or its destroyer.  Silver has value, but the scrap value of the metal is often negligible compared to the condition value.  If you feel that the radical steps described below must be taken, let it not be you who takes these steps.  Instead, sell the piece as-is and get your money out of it before (with all good intentions) you destroy 90% of its value.

For example, a deceptively easy but damaging way to shine your silver is to use tooth powder. Just dust your fingers with a bit of tooth powder and rub over the area you want to shine. You can finish by wiping the piece with a tissue or a piece of cotton - moist or dry. Now go back and look at the surface you've just worked on. It'll have hundreds of visible scratches that were not there before, and its previously warm glow will have turned dull. If you keep doing this, you'll gradually turn the piece's original mirror finish into something resembling aluminum. This is due to the presence of grit in the mixture. Why is this so damaging? Well, for one thing, silver metal is a lot softer than tooth enamel. Tooth powder containing abrasives is the right tool for scouring foreign matter off of the hard surface of teeth, but tarnish is more akin to tobacco stains. The only way to remove a stain with abrasives is to remove surface material, resulting in a damaged surface. On the other hand, gently applied chemistry removes stains while leaving the surface intact.

== Wheel Polishing == 
In cases of extreme tarnish and/or corrosion, it may be necessary to take the item to a jeweler or silver repair company.  There the tarnish can be removed with jeweler's rouge. This is sometimes referred to as putting an item &quot;on the wheel&quot;. While this method does remove tarnish, it also removes the ''patina'', or microscopic wear marks which give antique silver its beautiful glow, leaving in its place the shiny look of an item fresh off the factory line. Thus, this method is avoided by serious silver collectors in favor of hand polishing.  

See and avoid.  In almost every case I've encountered, people who own polishing wheels are obsessed with overusing them... even so called professionals.  Jewelers are often called upon to remove a previous owner's initials from, say, a set of silver spoons.  I have seen the results of overly enthusiastic jewelers who removed the initials by buffing away a thumb-sized crater, thereby rendering the piece even less valuable than it had been with someone else's initials still attractively inscribed.

== Silver Dips == 
The term ''dip'' calls to mind television infomercials promising instant polishing of your cherished silverware. These commercially sold silver dips are an abomination. A few work by eating away the tarnished surface of the metal, somewhat akin to the idea of removing a tattoo with battery acid. Most dips, however, work by turning the tarnish from its natural dark color to a cloudy white haze, somewhat akin to the idea of trying to hide a tattoo with skin-colored magic marker ink. Either type of commercially sold dip results in a permanently damaged piece. See and avoid.

In the broader sense of the word ''dip,'' however, it is possible to try cleaning a piece of silver by immersing it in some sort of liquid as opposed to fingerpainting it with foam. There are several mild chemical combinations which will gently attract some sulphur away from a piece of silver. One of the simplest involves dissolving baking soda in warm water in a glass bowl, then inserting both the silver item and a piece of aluminum foil. You'll know it's beginning to have some effect when you catch a whiff of eggs rising from the water. Frankly, though, I've tried this and several other passive approaches to tarnish removal, and I'm not particularly impressed with the results. Fingerpainting with foam does a far better job of restoring silver, for the same reason that shampooing your hair cleans it better than merely soaking your head in soapy water.

Serious sterling collectors avoid silver dips. One reason is that silver dip tends to brighten areas of the design that should remain dark in order to give a relief effect. This is especially important in pieces that have Repoussé and chasing. Another reason is the difficulty in removing the end product of the conversion, which usually requires an abrasive cleanser... and abrading the surface is one of the most effective ways of destroying a piece's value.

== Caveats == 
A few cautions should be noted. Sterling silver is a very soft metal that is easily damaged. Be careful not to dent the piece by knocking it against a sink or other hard surface. Be very gentle with sterling hinges, such as those on teapots and boxes, as these can be easily bent by mishandling. Do not use a toothbrush or other bristled brush on sterling, as this will permanently scratch the surface.

A more effective baking soda method: Put several layers of aluminium foil (glossy side up) in a non metallic container, add some baking soda on the foil, place your silver object on top, add more baking soda on top of the silver piece and finally cover all of the silver piece with BOILING water. Wait five minutes.

== Frequency of Polishing / Storage ==
Sterling that is continuously on display, such as a tea service or candelabra, will need more frequent polishing than pieces that can be wrapped and stored. Much of this depends on the amount of sulphur in the environment (city dwellers living near high automobile traffic, for example). Simple sealable food storage bags, or dry cleaning bags for larger pieces, will inhibit tarnish from accumulating on stored pieces. Make sure that the item is thoroughly dry before storing, however, as trapped water will cause corrosion.  

Several sources indicate that storage in plastic bags can do more harm than good, since poor quality plastic emits gases that cause corrosion and tarnish. Make sure you use a good quality polyethylene sealable food bag in conjunction with a silver cloth or acid free paper.  This will provide good protection.

== Washing ==
Don't wash sterling and stainless together. If they touch, a chemical reaction may occur, resulting in black spots on the sterling. Use a mild dishwashing liquid, and don't apply undiluted dishwashing liquid directly to sterling. Detergents containing phosphate can turn sterling brown.

== Section: Using Formal and Informal Pronouns in the Family ==


Using &quot;Sie&quot; with grandparents or parents is outdated.

Sorry, I changed the paragraph about using &quot;Sie&quot; with family. To me, this is ridiculous. So far, I only have once actually met somebody who did that, and his family only came back to Germany after the Iron Curtain came down, having lived in a German settlement in Hungary for a long time. Maybe this is also the case in German communities in the US (Pennsylvania German etc.), if they emigrated at least 100 years ago. But I think this is rather an interesting factoid than something somebody new to the language has to know. If you insist, change it back, but I really don't think this should be portrayed as current usage... [[User:Thamane|Thamane]] 22:25, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

==Better German==
: Never call your parents Mutter or Vater, it's normal to say &quot;That's my mother&quot;, if you talk to someone else, and there are very few
: people who say &quot;Mutti&quot; or &quot;Vati&quot;, but &quot;Hallo Mutter und Vater&quot; sounds really strange and it's really bad German

::: In the text was the name of the grandmother &quot;Lieschen&quot; that means &quot;small Liesa&quot;. I think that would even strange in english to call your grandmother such a childsname. I have corrected it. --[[User:SvonHalenbach|SvonHalenbach]] 12:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

== Section: Nationality ==


You are switching order German/English during the list

[[User:HolgiDE|HolgiDE]]

Yes, I know, and I'll get to those problem, thanks for informing me.
--[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 22:54, 30 March 2006 (UTC)


== Noun or Adjective Nationality ==


&quot;Ich bin schwedisch&quot; is bad German - better would be &quot;Ich bin ein Schwede&quot; (I am a Swede.) or &quot;Seine Nationalität ist die Schwedische&quot; (His nationality is the swedish.)--[[User:HolgiDE|HolgiDE]] 14:45, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

Yes, I know, but I'm giving an example, I will note about the bad German part though.--[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 20:10, 11 April 2006 (UTC)


==Banks==
If Bank of issue means the Deutsche Bank issues the currency, this is wrong. They are a bank like any other, just very very rich ;-) Coins and notes use to be issued by the Bundesbank, which was also in Frankfurt, and was a completly different institution. They did not have accounts or ATM. This institution has been replaced by the European Central Bank / Europäische Zentralbank (EZB), which is in Frankfurt, too.[[User:Thamane|Thamane]] 21:44, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

There are other banks in Frankfurt, too, and I think theire headquarters are in Frankfurt, because Frankfurt is the centre of Banks and economics in Europe (without the British Isles). Just throw a look at the Frankfurt skyline at www.frankfurt.de, Frankfurt is the onla European city, where such a skaline is allowed, almost all the towers belong to banks.

== Volk vs. Nationalität ==

Bitte ersetzt Volk durch Nationalität. Das Wort Volk wird meist von einer politischen Diskussion gefolgt und bietet eine große Anzahl von Fettnäpfchen. Grundsätzlich gilt, dass die Zugehörigkeit zu Volk, Nation und Staat in Deutschland nicht deckungsgleich sind. Hierbei sind nur Staat und Staatsangehörigkeit sauber definiert. Nationalität wird meist als Staatsanghörigkeit verstanden, da Staatsangehörigkeit sperrig und formal klingt.

There are many variations of '''Soto Ayam''' depending on the ingredients, the way it served, and the amount of spices used. 

==Ingredients==
* 1 whole chicken with bones or 1 kg chicken parts with bones

* 200 g cabbage, thinly sliced
* 200 g [[Cookbook:Bean Sprouts|bean sprouts]] blanched
* 4 potatoes, steamed, peeled, deep fried until golden brown
* 2 fresh tomatoes
* 25 g sohun vermicelli, soak in hot water for 10 minutes
* 25 g fried shallots
* 3 hard boiled eggs
* 1.8 chicken stock

* 3 [[Cookbook:Kaffir Lime Leaf|kaffir lime leaves]] 
* ½ stalk [[Cookbook:Lemongrass|lemongrass]] 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]] 
* 1 stalk [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]] 
* 25 g [[Cookbook:Galangal|galangal]] 
* 2 tbl. cooking oil

Spice paste, grind the following ingredients by using food processor:
* 5 g [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] 
* ½ tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Candlenut|candlenut]] 
* 15 g [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] 
* 3 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] 
* 2 tsp. salt

==Procedure==
#Stir fry spice paste over slow fire until fragrant.
#Make soup by cooking the whole chicken with spice paste, galangal, lime leaves, lemon grass, and bay leaves in a pot for at least 30 minutes until the meat is tender. Use pressure cooker for faster cooking time and better broth. for traditional aisan cooking bring soup to boil, cover and turn off heat and let steep for 30 to 40 minutes. this makes meat more tender.
#Add a little bit of salt or pepper to taste
#Leave the chicken in a pot until the soup is cool
#Remove the meat from the bones and slice the meat into tiny bit size using fork and knife, then set aside
#Put back the bones into the soup, put sliced green onion and bring the soup to the boil right before serving

==How to serve==
#In a bowl, arrange in layers: sliced potatoes, sliced tomatoes, vermicelli, cabbage, bean sprouts, sliced egg, and the meat on top
#Pour the boiling soup over the ingredients, but no bones or chicken skin may go into the bowl
#Put fried shallots on top, squeeze a slice of lemon
#Serve with hot steamed rice or slices of lontong (steamed rice roll)

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Many versions of soto Ayam don't have tomato.
* Some prefer not to mix cabbage with bean sprouts.
* As fried potato substitute, some like to put potato chips into the soup.

==Text Ideas and Planning==
Like [[Latin/Chapter 2 Verse|the Latin]] and [[Japanese/Reader|the Japanese]] Wikibooks, there should be stories for the student to read. For level one, one or two should come at the end of the level. For level one, one or two should come at the end of the level. For levels two and three, these should come after every few lessons. For level four, these should be included in every lesson.  They should not be arbitrary, but should relate to the taught subjects. The problem at first is finding stories simple and short enough for a beginning student to learn.

== Article usage for organization ==

I'm choosing to ignore articles (the words ''the'', ''a'', or ''an'') when organizing the books.  As long as it is done consistantly, I don't see too much of a problem here, although it does make automating this in the future somewhat of a problem.  Feel free to gripe about this or concurr about this idea if you choose.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:18, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Where to go from here ==

Here are some thoughts I had about what to add to this page.  I was thinking of setting up a standardized template for Wikibooks that would include more than just the title, but also include the stages icon, book of the month status, print version (if available)  and perhaps other sorts of information like a links to all of the subpages (via prefix-index) or other similar kinds of information that you might want to find out regarding a particular Wikibook, mostly to indicate quality.  This is a display template, not a template to indicate status within the wikibook (which is another issue entirely).

If is primarily for this reason why I insisted on going this route rather than going through categories, although there are benefits both ways.  Any other suggestions for additional information about specific Wikibooks?  Icons for each type of book (aka bookshelf icon)? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:33, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

:I think for the sake of neatness (i.e. having all titles lined up) the icons should go to the RIGHT of the title rather than the left (as they are now). On the other hand, this also makes them stand out less. Perhaps BotM/CotM icons could go to the left (since these deserve to stand out) and the more &quot;general&quot; icons (development stages, infoboxes) to the right?

A fresh seitan sausage is similar to a bratwurst. Gluten inflates in a hot pan but deflates nearly as quickly when it cools down. The cooled down sausage may look somewhat flat but tastes as well as the spices you used (gluten is almost without taste). With sausage spices, especially [[Cookbook:Curry|curry]] you can create a vegetarian bratwurst or currywurst]] few unaware meat eaters would suspect to be vegetarian.

'''Hint''': The sausage could be seen to benefit from a higher amount of dietary fiber.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Gluten|Gluten]] (see [[Cookbook:Seitan|seitan]] for how to gain gluten from wheat flour)
* Water, [[Cookbook:Soy_sauce|soy sauce]], [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
* additional spices, e.g., [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]], [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]] and [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* optional: [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]

==Procedure==
# Use 25% (volume) more water than gluten flour.
# Mix liquid ingredients (e.g. soy sauce) with the water.
# Mix solid ingredients (e.g. spices) with the flour. It is much easier to mix solid and liquid ingredients separately than adding ingredients to the gluten dough later, as it is very rubbery and sticky.
# mashed tofu can be added to the solid ingredients because tofu remains juicier after longer roasting.
# Make gluten dough from 100% gluten flour (or use wheat flour, see [[Cookbook:Seitan|seitan]]) and water. The dough should be suitable for kneading. Knead the dough until it is well combined and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.
# Roll the dough into sausages and fry them in a pan.
# To fry the sausages an oiled non-stick pan is recommended. To fry the sausages on a grill they must be cooked first in order to make the gluten dough less rubbery.
# The gluten inflates but is also bit runny. To form round sausages you have to turn them on all sides and squeeze from both sides with two spatulas.
# For an original currywurst you add ketchup and sprinkle curry on the sausage.

== Attention ==

* If the sausages aren't eaten fresh they deflate a lot but still taste good. (You clearly have to recognize the inner values over the outer appearance here).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is for contributors. Previous knowledge of Arabic is assumed.




This transliteration system will be used throughout the book. 

Arabic Definite Article: el
Arabic Definite Article before a sun letter: èl
No dashes are written after the Arabic definite article, to connect it to the next word.

Any one letter meaning units in Arabic will not be written as part of the next word.
So:
e.g. The following are always written as separate words and not as prefixes: sa, fa, la, ka, wa

Long vowels: aa, ii, uu&lt;br&gt;
Short vowels: a, i, u&lt;br&gt;
Tanwiin:ân (indicates an alif after the tanwiin) /ań (indicates no alif after the tanwiin),&lt;br&gt;iń,uń
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Taa'uń Marbuutžätuń: ä &lt;br&gt;
Alifuń/Yaa'uń Maksuurätuń: aà&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
uu with a silent Alif after:uù&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hamzätuń: '&lt;br&gt;

Possessive adjectives are separated by a dash from the word they are a suffix of.&lt;br&gt;
e.g. kitaabu-ka, kitaabu-haa&lt;br&gt;
The exception is the first person singular which does not take a dash. Instead it's second &quot;i&quot; is  written with a circumflex.&lt;br&gt;
 kitaabiî OR kitaabîya (depending on pronunciation)

Object pronouns also must take a dash.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


The names of the letters of the Arabic alphabet transliterated:
&lt;br&gt;

Alifuń, Baa'uń, Taa'uń, Thaa'uń, Jiimuń, Hžaa'uń, Kħaa'uń,Daaluń, Dħaaluń, Raa'uń, Zaa'uń, Siinuń, Sħiinuń, Sžaaduń, Džaaduń, Tžaa'uń, Dħžaa'uń, Rħainuń, Għainuń, Faa'uń, Qaafuń, Kaafuń, Laamuń, Miimuń, Nuunuń, Haa'uń, Waawuń, Yaa'uń

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One can also write it with the modified z, h, and n capitalized, and later change them. The best way to do change them is to use find and replace in a text editor.&lt;br&gt;
AlifuN, Baa'uN, Taa'uN, Thaa'uN, JiimuN, HZaa'uN, KHaa'uN,DaaluN, DHaaluN, Raa'uN, Zaa'uN, SiinuN, SHiinuN, SZaaduN, DZaaduN, TZaa'uN, DHZaa'uN, RHainuN, GHainuN, Faa'uN, QaafuN, KaafuN, LaamuN, MiimuN, NuunuN, Haa'uN, WaawuN, Yaa'uN

&lt;br&gt;
Anything silent in a sentnece must be underlined. So tanwiin at the end of a sentence must be underlined. Transliterated Arabic words within English text do not need the case endings written.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Go is almost 4,000 years old and is the oldest game to still be played in its original form. The creation of the game has been credited to Yao, (Traditional Chinese: 堯, Simplified Chinese: 尧) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_(ruler)], an ancient king of China, as a means of educating his less than brilliant son but this is most likely not the actual beginning of the game. Many scholars believe that the origins of go are in divination and fortune telling. Wherever this game has it origin one thing is clear the game was first played in china.

Moreover, Cygwin is NOT a Linux emulator and it CANNOT run native Linux binaries. It's more or less just POSIX/source compatibility environment. If you need native Linux environment on Windows, use coLinux, VMWare, VirtualPC etc.

      <comment>/* Hollins Fluency System (Ronald Webster) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hollins Fluency System (Ronald Webster)==

&lt;p&gt;Ronald Webster's Hollins Fluency System is an intensive, residential stuttering therapy program. Clients practice at the Virginia speech clinic seven and a half hours a day for 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hollins program begins with extremely slow, two seconds per syllable speech. This is even slower than Perkin's two seconds per word speech. It also makes all syllables the same length. E.g., at two seconds per word, &quot;American&quot; is a half-second per syllable, which is too fast for stutterers to speak fluently. At two seconds per syllable, &quot;American&quot; takes eight seconds to say and even severe stutterers should be completely fluent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hollins program doesn't use DAF devices. Instead, clients watch stopwatches to time their speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After mastering slow speech, you work on &quot;gentle onsets&quot; or gradual onset of phonation. A &quot;voice monitor&quot; device (now a computer program) provides biofeedback on the &quot;gentle onset&quot; target behavior. A second biofeedback device is used to train diaphragmatic breathing.&lt;/p&gt;Clients also practice stretched syllable including stabilization of the first sound position, definite completion of the final articulatory position and bringing articulators to neutral.

&lt;p&gt;When these targets are mastered, the two seconds per syllable speech (ten times slower than normal speech) is reduced to one second per syllable (five times slower than normal speech), then half-second stretched syllables (half the normal speaking rate) and then quarter-second per syllable &quot;slow normal&quot; speech, which is a little slower than normal speech but has normal prosody. This speech rate is still too slow for normal conversations with other people unless you force them to wait. 

&lt;p&gt;Transfer is first done with telephone calls to local businesses, and then is done in shopping malls.&lt;/p&gt;. There is not enough transfer into the real world but this is good for Hollins as it protects them from being blamed for the failure that many clients experience after they leave Hollins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Frequency-shifted auditory feedback (FAF) shifts the pitch of your voice in your earphones. A FAF upshift makes you hear your voice sounding like Mickey Mouse. A FAF downshift makes you hear your voice sounding like a gravel-voiced radio announcer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarter-octave pitch shift reduces stuttering about 35%. A half-octave pitch shift reduces stuttering about 65-70%. A full-octave pitch shift reduces stuttering about 70-75%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:FAFeffect.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAF Stuttering Reduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting pitch up or down is equally effective in short-term studies. But there may be long-term differences between up- and downshifts. FAF causes non-stutterers to speak at a higher or lower vocal pitch, depending on whether the device is set for an up or down frequency shift.{{ref|Elman1981}} This higher or lower pitch vocal pitch results from changing vocal fold tension. In other words, FAF induces changes in vocal fold tension in non-stutterers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocal fold relaxation is a primary target of [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency Shaping|fluency shaping therapy]]. A study found that a half-octave FAF downshift didn't cause a change in vocal pitch in stutterers.{{ref|Natke2001}}  But, anecdotally, speech clinics have reported that FAF devices adjusted to one octave downshift, using newer headphones with better bass range, induce vocal fold relaxation in stutterers. A one-octave downshift has also been anecdotally reported to induce a slower speaking rate with stretched vowels. If these reports are true, then FAF downshifts appear to imemdiately induce, with little or no training or effort, the target behaviors that take weeks of fluency shaping therapy. And, if these anecdotal reports are true, then an FAF downshift should induce long-term carryover fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, anecdotal reports suggest that an FAF upshift (the Mickey Mouse voice) induces vocal fold tension and faster speaking rates. If this is true, then a FAF upshift should result in poor long-term performance (e.g., no carryover fluency, and possibly &amp;quot;wearing off).&lt;/p&gt;

==Types of FAF==

&lt;p&gt;All published studies of FAF used &lt;i&gt;octave-scale&lt;/i&gt; FAF. Octave-scale FAF requires lots of computing power (a &lt;i&gt;fast Fourier transformation&lt;/i&gt;). When you set these devices to a one-octave upshift, the 125-Hz fundamental frequency of an adult male voice is shifted up to 250 Hz. The 250 Hz first overtone of your voice is shifted to 500 Hz. The 500 Hz second overtone of your voice is shifted to 1000 Hz. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you instead use a one-octave downshift, your 125 Hz voice is shifted in your earphones to 62 Hz. Your 250 Hz first overtone is shifted to 125 Hz, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OctaveFAF.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Octave-Scale vs. Frequency-Compression FAF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some FAF devices don’t have enough processing power to produce octave-scale FAF. Instead, a simpler process uses &lt;i&gt;frequency compression/expansion&lt;/i&gt; FAF. The upshift adds 500 Hz to your voice (or 1000 Hz or 2000 Hz, depending on the setting). Thus, your 125 Hz fundamental frequency is shifted to 625 Hz, or more than two octaves up. Your 250 Hz first overtone is shifted to 750 Hz. Your 500 Hz second overtone is shifted to 1000 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you switch frequency compression/expansion to downshift or &lt;i&gt;subtract&lt;/i&gt; 500 Hz from your voice, your 125 Hz fundamental frequency vanishes. 125 Hz minus 500 Hz is nothing (there are no negative frequencies). The 250 Hz first overtone of your voice also vanishes. And the 500 Hz second overtone of your voice vanishes. You can only hear the weak third (1000 Hz) and higher overtones of your voice. With such a device, you may hear your voice in your ear &lt;i&gt;rise&lt;/i&gt; in pitch as the FAF is adjusted lower!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No published studies have investigated whether frequency compression/expansion FAF has an effect on stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

==Long-Term Effects of DAF Combined with FAF==

&lt;p&gt;Nine stutterers used a DAF/FAF device about seven hours per day. Their fluency was measured after four months and after twelve months.{{ref|Stuart2004}} {{ref|Stuart2005}} The delay was set at 60 milliseconds and the frequency compression FAF at 500 Hz up. The subjects received brief speech therapy, specifically to prolong vowels and use &amp;quot;starter sounds&amp;quot; such as &amp;quot;um&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ah.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SpeechEasy-small.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term effectiveness of DAF/FAF device&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare these effects to the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Delayed Auditory Feedback#Long-Term Effects of DAF|long-term effects]] of a DAF device (without FAF). 

&lt;p&gt;The two anti-stuttering devices had similar immediate effects. The DAF device reduced stuttered &lt;i&gt;words&lt;/i&gt; about 70%. The DAF/FAF device reduced stuttered &lt;i&gt;syllables&lt;/i&gt; about 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both devices show a small but statistically insignificant &amp;quot;wearing off&amp;quot; effect over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two studies is the  &amp;quot;carryover fluency,&amp;quot; or the subjects' speech without the devices. The DAF users had more than 50% carryover fluency. The DAF/FAF users had no statistically significant carryover fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did one anti-stuttering device produce carryover but another device didn't? Hypothetically, upward FAF has positive immediate effects but negative long-term effects. Hearing your voice shifted up (sounding like Mickey Mouse) may correct your auditory processing underactivity but make your speech motor activity worse (i.e., make you speak with a higher vocal pitch and tighter vocal folds). If the auditory processing effect goes away when the device is removed, but the speech motor changes are retained, then no carryover would result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hypothesis is that using an anti-stuttering device for practice, rather than wearing it all day, may produce better long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;A device with masking auditory feedback (MAF) may provide relief if you have silent blocks (blocks in which you can't even make a sound).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAF is a synthesized sine wave at your fundamental frequency (not “white noise,” as some experts claim).This sound fools your brain into thinking that your vocal folds are vibrating. Your vocal folds relax and start vibrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Edinburgh Masker, popular in the 1980s, helped many stutterers improve their speech over time, until they no longer needed the device. Other stutterers found that the device &amp;quot;wore off&amp;quot; and became ineffective. Still other stutterers have used the device for more than twenty years with no carryover or &amp;quot;wearing off.&amp;quot; No research investigated why the device had different effects on different people. Hypothetically, the users who developed carryover fluency may have used the device to help them overcome fears and anxieties, or they may have used the device to enhance stuttering therapy.
For the users who experienced &quot;wearing off,&quot; the device may have made these users talk louder, which increased vocal fold tension, and some users habituated to speaking with too-tense vocal folds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <comment>Included the result of the publication of &quot;Effect of monaural and binaural altered auditory feedback on stuttering frequency&quot; of A. Stuart</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
==Sound Quality==

&lt;p&gt;A study comparing two DAF/FAF anti-stuttering devices made by different companies found one device to be more than twice as effective as the other.{{ref|Hyde2003}} The difference in effectiveness was likely due to differences in sound quality. It's like the difference between listening to Beethoven at a concert hall, or as a cellphone ringtone.&lt;/p&gt;

===Frequency Range===

&lt;p&gt;Different anti-stuttering devices have different frequency ranges. Generally, the bigger the microphone and earphones, the wider the frequency range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of human voices is about 125 to 5000 Hz. If you use one-octave FAF downshifting you'll need 60 to 5000 Hz frequency range. Some anti-stuttering devices have this range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, hearing aids typically have a frequency range of 200 to 7000 Hz. The frequency ranges typically aren't flat, but instead are tuned to sound best between 3000 and 4000 Hz{{ref|Stuart2003}} (where most people lose their hearing). Hearing aids can't reproduce the low range of human voices, especially the fundamental frequency of phonation that's key to stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

===Monaural vs. Binaural Sound===

&lt;p&gt;Binaural (two ears) sound is 25% more effective than monaural (one ear) sound.{{ref|Stuart1997}} Some devices can be either binaural or monaural. Other devices are monaural only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research based on eleven participants has tested which ear is better, if you use a monaural anti-stuttering device (&quot;''Effect of monaural and binaural altered auditory feedback on stuttering frequency''&quot;, A. Stuart). Non significant differences in stuttering frequencies for right versus left monaural conditions has been found (p = 0.54). Nevertheless, the right ear connects to left side of the brain, which processes speech and other rapidly changing auditory signals, and, hypothetically, is the better ear for using an anti-stuttering device. In contrast, the left ear is better for tones and music.{{ref|Advance2004}} But brain scans have found that stutterers have more right-hemisphere activity during speech (in contrast, non-stutterers have more left hemisphere activity during speech). If stutterers process speech on the right side of their brains, then a monaural anti-stuttering device should be worn in the left ear. It would be interesting to investigate left- and right-ear altered auditory feedback with brain scans. This might shed light on the question of whether the unusual right-hemisphere activity of stutterers during speech is speech processing or heightened emotions (such as speech-related fears and anxieties.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Or maybe if you're gay and live on the east coast, you wear your anti-stuttering device in your left ear, but&amp;#133;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

==Background Noise==

&lt;p&gt;Some anti-stuttering devices work well in quiet speech clinics, but are unusable in a noisy restaurant. A variety of features help solve the background noise problem.&lt;/p&gt;

===Noise-Canceling Microphones===

&lt;p&gt;Positioned correctly, a &lt;i&gt;noise-canceling directional microphone&lt;/i&gt; eliminates background noise at the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, &lt;i&gt;omnidirectional microphones&lt;/i&gt; pick up background noises. Hearing aids typically use omnidirectional microphones designed to pick up environmental sounds louder than your voice.&lt;/p&gt;

===Push-To-Talk Button===

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;push to talk&amp;quot; button also eliminates background noise. You push a button and the device switches sound on. Llet go of the button and the sound switches off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In noisy environments you're usually in a group. E.g., you go out to a restaurant with three friends. You talk one-fourth of the time. Most of the time you sit and listen, with clear hearing. When you have something to say, you push the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A push-to-talk button also works well for a child in school, who mostly listens and occasionally is called on by the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

===High-Frequency Filters===

&lt;p&gt;Most anti-stuttering devices have high-frequency filters to reduce noise above your vocal range.&lt;/p&gt;

===Voice Activation===

&lt;p&gt;Voice activation switches on sound when the user talks, and switches off sound when the user stops talking. Voice activation works well if  the device has a noise-canceling directional microphone. If the device has an omnidirectional microphone, loud noises switch on sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some anti-stuttering devices analyze your speech and switch sound on when (or before) you stutter, and switch sound off when you're speaking fluently (or not speaking). Typically such devices analyze vocal parameters such as pitch and volume to determine whether your vocal folds are tense or relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

===Dynamic Expansion=== 

&lt;p&gt;Some anti-stuttering devices have dynamic expansion. This makes loud sounds louder and quiet sounds quieter. If you're using a noise-canceling directional microphone this makes your voice louder and background sounds quieter. With an omnidirectional microphone it can make your voice quieter and background noise louder.&lt;/p&gt;

===Acoustical Transparency===

&lt;p&gt;Listening to someone talk, while you wear a DAF device that's picking up the other person's voice, is like reading the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Difficulttohear.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That says, &amp;quot;difficult to hear another person speaking.&amp;quot; You hear the person speaking twice, with the words out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, small FAF pitch shifts, without a DAF delay, have little impact on your ability to hear. It's like hearing music played on a violin vs. on a viola. Or hearing your friend's voice drop a little when recovering from a cold. This is known as &amp;quot;acoustically transparent.&amp;quot;{{ref|Stuart1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Warranties, Returns and Repairs==

&lt;p&gt;Read price sheets and warranties carefully. Are there hidden fees? How long is your trial period for returning the device? Do you get a full or partial refund?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toss the device onto a hard floor (before you pay for it!). How breakable is it? How long is the warranty? Are repairs covered in all situations, or excluded if it was your fault that the device broke?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How easy would it be to lose a device, especially for a child?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask about the company's return rates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi again,

Yeah, I guess the world belongs to the daring. Sorry if I was too intrusive. Delete this page if you see it fit, I meant no harm.

Take care and have a good one!

PS. Does that mean I can be an editor for wikibooks/wikipedia???? 

Just kidding, don't get all worked up.


== [[The Storyteller by Martha Whittington]] ==

Hello Platinumpony. You took a bold step and created the page, [[The Storyteller by Martha Whittington]]; the willingness to add new content and click &quot;Save page&quot; without hesitation is a good trait for a wiki editor. However, you seem to not understand what this wiki, '''Wikibooks''', is about. So let me try to introduce it to you.

As it says on our '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome page]]''', Wikibooks is for &quot;collaboratively writing textbooks and related non-fiction books&quot;. We have a [[Calculus]] book, a [[Cookbook]], a book about [[Overcoming Procrastination]], for example. [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]] are using this wiki to write entire non-fiction books, all available for free through the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] so that anyone can copy and modify them.

'''Wikibooks is not a wiki ''about'' books.''' The intention of this wiki is ''not'' to create a wiki page here for each book or collection of printed books that exist outside of this wiki. Wikibooks is not a community place for finding persons who like to read the same books. We have a policy, '''[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]''', describing what Wikibooks includes and excludes. It states, &quot;Wikibooks is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising.&quot; Thus, it is likely that someone will '''delete''' your page, [[The Storyteller by Martha Whittington]].

However, some books at Wikibooks can be about books; they can be study guides or references. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] is a reference to the many ''Harry Potter'' books; [[Illustrated Guide to the world of Spira (FFX and FFX-2)]] is about a video game. If you are planning to do something similar, ''The Storyteller'' might stay on this wiki; otherwise it belongs not here. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

&lt;/ul&gt;

==Efficacy Studies==

===DAF Long-Term Carryover Fluency===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nine severe adult stutterers used Casa Futura Technologies DAF devices for an average of thirty minutes per day (ten minutes reading aloud, ten minutes conversation with family member, ten minute telephone call). After three months their stuttering had diminished more than 50% (when speaking without the devices).{{ref|VanBorsel2003}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SchoolDAF-small.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A single-subject study with an eleven-year-old boy found that fourteen hours of structured therapy with mediated learning and a Casa Futura Technologies DAF device reduced stuttering from 9% dysfluencies to 5% dysfluencies (when speaking without the device). One year later his stuttering was still 5% dysfluencies. Another fourteen hours of similar treatment reduced his stuttering to 4% dysfluencies.{{ref|Radford2005}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Compared to Other Anti-Stuttering Devices===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Casa Futura Technologies DAF&amp;#047;FAF device was more than twice as effective when compared to another company's DAF&amp;#047;FAF anti-stuttering device.{{ref|Hyde2003}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Immediate Effects on Stuttering===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven adult stutterers called businesses using a binaural (two ears) DAF&amp;#047;FAF anti-stuttering telephone device. Stuttering was reduced on average about 80%.{{ref|Brenaut1995}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nine adult stutterers called businesses in New York City using a binaural (two ears) DAF&amp;#047;FAF anti-stuttering telephone device. Stuttering was reduced on average about 60%.{{ref|Zimmerman1997}}&lt;/li&gt;Binaural (two ears)  DAF reduced stuttering 71% and FAF reduced stuttering 64% in eleven adult female stutterers; DAF reduced stuttering 33% and FAF reduced stuttering 31% in eleven adult male stutterers.{{ref|Grosser2001}}
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Grosser-2001.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
Stuttering (left scale) while reading five text passages (bottom scale), in women. About 17% of words were stuttered without the device (NAF). Stuttered words with DAF or FAF varied between 2% and 8%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binaural (two ears) DAF reduced stuttering in all eight stutterers; FAF reduced stuttering in four of eight stutterers.{{ref|Natke2000}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Effects on Parkinson's Disease===
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2-octave FAF upshift improved intelligibility and naturalness of Parkinson's patients' speech.{{ref|Lowit2004}}&lt;/li&gt;

What worked for me?  Learning not to care so much.  Yes, I still stutter - sometimes badly, and sometines I do care.  But by learning not to worry about lesser lacks of fluency, the incidences of the greater ones has decreased.

The big breakthrough was in my early twenties.  During my childhood and adolescence, my stutter was 'hushed up'.  Nobody dared talk openly about it to me (other well-meant but unhelpful advice to slow down or calm down).  But one day I found a book about stuttering in a library.  This gave me the impetus to see a speech therapist.  I must have exasperated her by not being particularly interested in anti-stuttering techniques.  But the process of 'coming out' made the difference.  For instance - most of the secondary effects such as eye-closing and head movements have long stopped.

I'm now in my 40s.  Yes, sometimes I can be anxious about stuttering on the phone, or embarassed if I fluff a punchline - but it doesn't hamper me socially or professionally.  And I can talk about it.

It's the least of my worries!

&lt;hr&gt;

What worked for me was also to just stop caring about it. Just say the words even if it took time for me to say them and not care about what people say. 

I struggled alot with my speech when I was younger and my life revolved around it. I lost all confidence in my abilities. Later a friend of mine asked me about my speech and didn't get why it was such a big deal for me. I would just practice saying words with her and slowly learnt to not care about how I'm saying it, as long as I end up saying it. The satisfaction and feeling of triumph I felt saying words I avoided for years before made all the effort worth it. 

I'm 21 now. I still have problem speaking fluently but that doesn't stop me from being free with my speech. I have stopped using methods like word substitution and saying sounds like &quot;uhh&quot; before saying difficult words. I feel confident and my speech is not a constant source of anxiety for me like it used to be.

I've checked this lesson several times against several sources, and can't find any mistakes.  However, I am very new to Ido, and would value a second pair of eyes for this page.  Also I am not the writer of the original six lessons, so I hope I am not stepping on someone's toes by creating this.[[User:80.5.221.167|80.5.221.167]] 23:50, 27 March 2006 (UTC)E</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Nissan 240SX}}
This guide is intended to give in-depth descriptions and exact procedures to modify the Nissan 240SX to be a more proficient sports car. This guide is not intended to provide styling advice or to provide info on body conversions or bodykits. If you are new to the Nissan 240SX and not familliar with the vehicle at all you should probably start with the Nissan 240SX entry on Wikipedia.org

==Power Modifications==
The goal of power modifications are to increase the overall power of your 240SX. Power goals can be attained through modifications of the stock engine, or by swapping in an altogether different engine than the KA24 that came in your car. 

:[[/KA24DE and KA24E/]]
:[[/Engine Swaps/]]
:[[/Non Nissan Engine Swaps/]]
:[[/Ignition and Fuel Management/]]

==Drivetrain Modification==
Power is nothing unless you can get it to the wheels. If you plan on upping the horsepower of your vehicle you should also look into modifying your drivetrain to handle it. 

:[[/Transmission/]]
:[[/Differential/]]
:[[/Driveshaft/]]
:[[/Final Drive/]]

==Suspension and Brake Modification==
What good is all that power if you can't turn or stop? Overlooking suspension and brake upgrades is a common and sometimes costly mistake.

:[[/Coilovers/]]
:[[/Control Arms/]]
:[[/Sway Bars/]]

==Chassis Modification==
Trying to get that extra bit of performance out of your car? Making it lighter and stiffer is a good way to make the car handle better.

[[User:Saen1978|Saen1978]] 00:55, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

: Please add a sentence, even an introductory one. All you have is section headings. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:21, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

I think this book needs to be broken into submodules, but I'm not sure how. any help from an advanced wikibook writer would be appreciated
[[User:138.162.128.46|138.162.128.46]] 15:08, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

: Then first decide the scope of the submodules. For example, one could split the book into four submodules, being &quot;Power Modifications&quot;, &quot;Drivetrain Modification&quot;, &quot;Suspension and Brake Modification&quot;, and &quot;Chassis Modification&quot;.

: Or one could use one submodule for each part to install, being &quot;KA24DE&quot;, &quot;S13 DOHC&quot;, and other modules. I am not sure which strategy to use. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:06, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

I think the four submodules sounds like a logical way to do it. how do I go about doing that?
[[User:Saen1978|Sean1978]] 19:42, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

I broke the page into multiple submodules, this should be the best approach for the scope of this wikibook
[[User:Saen1978|Sean1978]] 23:16, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

like this book. wanted to start a similar one, but not specific to 1 car.  I have added this book to the new engineering-automotive category.  there are some others I have collected in that category from wikibooks, you can browse them(if you haven't already...)the electric conversion is a goodie.

Someone contibuted a lot of info, but the entered it all onto the top layer menu. I moved some of it and deleted the parts that where redundant

I appologize for not seeing this earlier, but I went ahead and changed a bunch of things and added quite a bit to the differential section.  I cleaned up the main page as well.  DJPimpFlex

don't worry about it, it's all good as long as you are contributing, I screwed up the first wiki I went on diving right into it
[[User:Saen1978|Sean1978]] 02:29, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

well I think its comming allong well, I just dont want to step on anyones toes - djpimpflex

4/6/06 - Updated brake section - DJPimpFlex

yea guys this is my first time doing a wikibook. Im the one who pretty much added a ton of things looking like I was the first edit beyond the initial pages. Just kinda piled it in there sorry bout it being messy.
Please make sure to keep trim and model specific specifications clearly labeled when putting things in here... Someone posted in the swaybars section in addition. I edited the section again to format it in the same manner of the rest, as well as remove redundant information
There wasnt a 16mm bar option for the s13 so I labeled everything there appropriately.

-Djpimp, you just killed my whole writeup and pictures of the 180sx brake swap and wrote its basically the same as stock even though it is far from it. How am I supposed to recover this?

-Edit I just found it in my contributions so I re-added the correct information. Djpimp, You added alot of information but spoke as if the 240sx from 89-98 is the same car. Please make sure to specify s13/s14 and trims in your future edits
[[User:Tastyratz|Tastyratz]] 9:07, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

Alright guys I don't want to make this wikibook into a pissing contest, on contriversial stuff (Like Clutch LSD vs Welded Diff) you need to remain neutral. I don't want the last comment on Clutch LSD's to be &quot;Welded Diff's are Better&quot; - that has NOTING to do with a clutch LSD. 
Saen1978

Absolutely agree. I am trying to keep a very unbiased informative approach with my entries. Dont make decisions for people and say x is better than x or you should do x to your car. In your entries simply put information regarding a certain part of modification, pros and cons of that specific one, or notes on that one etc. Let people make up their mind on what part or modification is best for them based on the materials provided. 

On a side note, There was alot of inaccurate information in the braking thread that was added and some overly common misconceptions. I revised and reworded a good amount, and provided technical descriptions and entries on true slotted/cross drilled rotor functionality. Basically added the whole &quot;general notes on braking&quot; section.
[[User:Tastyratz|Tastyratz]] 16:17, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

added information to roll cages, as well as tidied up suspension section removing redundancies, orgonizing, and rewording a few things.
[[User:Tastyratz|Tastyratz]] 19:13, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

I cleaned up some of the wording in the differential page and fixed quite a few spelling errors. I changed some of the wording and added a bit to the helical paragraph to make it accurate.
--knate

Eliminated some superfluous info and added alot of detail to the SR20DET portion of the engine swap category. --Kevin / mrmephistopheles

Updated RB25DET info. [[User:RBoosted|RBoosted]] 01:01, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

Added the stock brake specs and available replacements back into the brake page [[User:Tastyratz|Tastyratz]] 15:39, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

Lots of work going into creating something that already exists at 240sxTech.com....

== electronics mods ==

How 'bout adding a section on fixing and modding electronics? It'd be a nice place to add info about gauges (like wiring, BSPT to NPT fittings, compatabilities with stock senders and such). Could also have info about gauge cluster swaps, ECU identification and swapping, adding more sensors and monitors, harness chopping, fuse and breaker locations, common problems... just to name a few.

== Engineering Bookshelf ==

Why is this book listed on the [[Wikibooks:Engineering bookshelf|Automotive Engineering]] bookshelf?  This is more of a how-to book for a specific car than a book to learn general or specific engineering information. - [[User:71.204.246.126|71.204.246.126]] 02:19, 11 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Efficacy Studies==

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirteen adult stutterers were tested using the SpeechEasy anti-stuttering device for reading, monologue, and conversation. On average stuttering was reduced 36%, however, the effectiveness &quot;varied greatly across participants.&quot; The subjects were then given speech therapy (training vowel prolongation) and the combination of therapy and the device reduced stuttering 53%.{{ref|Armson2006}}&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nine stutterers used a DAF/FAF device about seven hours per day. Their fluency was measured after four months and after twelve months.{{ref|Stuart2004}} {{ref|Stuart2005}} The delay was set at 60 milliseconds and the frequency compression FAF at 500 Hz up. The subjects received brief speech therapy, specifically to prolong vowels and use &amp;quot;starter sounds&amp;quot; such as &amp;quot;um&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ah.&amp;quot; The device reduced stuttered syllables about 80%. The users had no statistically significant carryover fluency.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SpeechEasy-small.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An unpublished study{{ref|Ellis2007}} found that SpeechEasy devices were effective for reading aloud but not effective in conversations.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unpublished study{{ref|Runyan2005}}  raised questions about whether the devices in the study  “wore off” or lost effectiveness over time. Only the data from the study are available, not the written explanation of the results, so the following may be a misinterpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18 adults and one child tried SpeechEasy devices. The DAF and FAF settings weren’t provided in the results. Of these nineteen subjects, twelve (63%) had excellent initial results, with 1% or less stuttering (the results don’t say whether this was % stuttered words or syllables). Two subjects (11%) experienced no improvement in their speech. On average, the devices reduced stuttering initially about 75%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine subjects purchased the devices, seven didn’t purchase them, two purchased and then returned the devices, and one purchase was “pending.” The nine who purchased were re-evaluated an average of seven months later. Four continued to have excellent speech (1% or less stuttering). One person who had only good results initially now had excellent results (an improvement over six months). One person who had excellent results initially now had only good results. Two others had speech worse than before using the device. On average, the devices now reduced stuttering about 57%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six subjects returned for a second follow-up, on average of eighteen months after purchasing the devices. Two subjects were stuttering about as much as before they purchased the device. The other four subjects were worse. On average, the device now &lt;i&gt;increased&lt;/i&gt; stuttering about 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Runyan-study.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five subjects were tested at a third follow-up. They averaged 30 months using the device. One subject appears to have better speech after 30 months than before using the device (his stuttering dropped from 30% to 17%). Four subjects appear to have worse speech after 30 months than before using the device. Two of these were slightly worse (e.g., stuttering increased from 12% to 13%), one was moderately worse, and one had substantially worse speech (stuttering went from 2% to 9%). Adding the three additional subjects who were tested at the second follow-up but not the third follow-up, this study raises questions of whether seven of eight SpeechEasy users had worse stuttering after long-term use of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter focuses on long-term studies of fluency shaping stuttering therapies, published in peer-reviewed journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Satisfaction with &amp;quot;Smooth Speech&amp;quot; Fluency Shaping&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;In a study of a &amp;quot;smooth speech&amp;quot; fluency shaping stuttering therapy program, about 95% of stutterers were &amp;quot;very satisfied&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;satisfied&amp;quot; with their speech at the end of the treatment. A year later, their satisfaction dropped to 43%.{{ref|Craig1991}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ISTAR Comprehensive Stuttering Program&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;A rigorous study followed 42 stutterers through the three-week program at the [http://www.ualberta.ca/~istar/ Institute for Stuttering Therapy and Treatment] (http://www.ualberta.ca/~istar/)(ISTAR) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.{{ref|Boberg1994}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fluency shaping program was based on slow, prolonged speech, starting with 1.5 seconds per syllable stretch, and ending with slow-normal speech. The program also works on reducing fears and avoidances, discussing stuttering openly, and changing social habits to increase speaking. The program includes a maintenance program for practicing at home. The therapy program reduced stuttering from about 15-20% stuttered syllables to 1-2% stuttered syllables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 to 24 months after therapy, about 70% of the stutterers had satisfactory fluency. About 5% were marginally successful. About 25% had unsatisfactory fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Attrition in a Long-Term Study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study of a &amp;quot;prolonged speech&amp;quot; fluency shaping stuttering therapy program had 32 stutterers initially speak about five times slower than normal speech, then gradually increase their speaking rate. Six subjects (19%) failed to learn the &amp;quot;prolonged speech&amp;quot; technique during the two-week residential therapy program. Eight subjects (25%) completed the residential training but refused to participate in a six-week, weekly therapy &amp;quot;phase II&amp;quot; program. Six subjects (19%) completed the six-week &amp;quot;phase II&amp;quot; program but refused to participate in the year-long &amp;quot;maintenance&amp;quot; program with infrequent therapy at the speech clinic.{{ref|Onslow1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year later, the twelve subjects (38%) who stayed in the program were able to speak nearly fluently. Was this therapy program a success? 100% of the stutterers who completed the program were successful. But two-thirds of the stutterers didn't complete the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SLPs vs. Parents vs. Computers&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;A study of 98 children, 9 to 14 years old, compared three types of stuttering therapy. The three types of therapy were:{{ref|Craig1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Intensive &amp;quot;smooth speech&amp;quot; fluency shaping trained relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing; a slow speaking rate with prolonged vowels; gentle onsets and offsets (loudness contour); soft articulation contacts; and pauses between phrases. The children did this therapy in a speech clinic for 35 hours over one week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Home-based &amp;quot;smooth speech.&amp;quot; This was similar to the first group, but parents were included, and encouraged to continue therapy at home. Therapy was done in a speech clinic for six hours once a week for four weeks (24 hours total).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Electromyographic biofeedback. The children used an EMG biofeedback computer system about six hours a day for one week (30 hours total). The EMG system monitored the child's speech-production muscle activity. The children were instructed to tense and then relax their speech-production muscles. The goal was to develop awareness and control of these muscles. The children then worked through a hierarchy from simple words to conversations, while keeping their speech-production muscles relaxed. After mastering this while watching the computer display, the children did the exercises with the computer monitoring but not displaying their muscle activity. The speech pathologists did relatively little with the children: &amp;quot;Constant clinician presence was not necessary as the computer provided feedback as to whether the child was performing the skills correctly.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth (control) group didn't receive any stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each therapy program, all three therapies reduced stuttering below 1% on average. The control group had no improvement in fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year after the therapy program, the percentage of children with disfluency rates under 2% were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;48% of the children from the clinician-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;63% of the children from the parent-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;71% of the children from the computer-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results for children with disfluency rates under 1% were even more striking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10% of the children from the clinician-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;37% of the children from the &amp;quot;parent-based&amp;quot; program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;44% of the children from the computer-based program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;I.e., the computers were most effective, the parents next most effective, and the speech-language pathologists were least effective in the long term. At the 1% disfluency level, the computers and the parents were about &lt;i&gt;four times&lt;/i&gt; more effective than the speech-language pathologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years later, all three groups had average stuttering reductions between 76% and 79%. This may have been due to the more dysfluent children receiving additional speech therapy.{{ref|Hancock1998}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Computer System for Reducing Short Phonation Intervals&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Another study had five stutterers use a computer that trained reduction of short phonation intervals. Normal speakers switch their vocal folds on and off many times each second, as they pronounce vowels and voiced consonants, such as /b/ and /g/, and then unvoiced consonants such as /s/ and /t/. A core stuttering behavior is an inability to quickly switch from voiceless to voiced sounds, i.e., to instantly switch on your vocal folds. The computer program trained stutterers to slow down that part of speech without slowing down other parts of speech (and so maintain natural-sounding speech). One year post-therapy all five subjects were able to speak nearly fluently. Larger clinical trials are scheduled for 2006.{{ref|Ingham2001}}&lt;/p&gt;

What does it mean to be a stutterer?
by Matt Goodman
What does it mean to be a stutterer?
Can't talk, can't speak, and can't communicate.
I go though more pain than you will ever know.
My life has been a hard one,
filled with pain, and sorrow, and disgust.
My voice can be changed to British,
to Scottish,
... to Texan,
... to sometimes a New Yorker,
... and yet I cannot speak.
But what is normal?
Is it not being able to speak,
being thought of as a freak,
not being able to communicate your ideas.
Is that normal?
Maybe not for you, but it is for me.
I am a stutterer now and forever,
one of the few, the proud, the ridiculed,
the Stutterer!
I have been a stutterer for 14 years now,
and it has not been easy for me.
I have gone though the pain of childhood.
Elementary school was terrible.
Kids make fun of you,
just because they do not understand you.
Junior High was worse,
The teens made fun of you
because it was accepted,
as normal.
I survived, but why?
Why me?
Why me, to suffer for all these years!
Just because I was born with this?
I know the question all stutters are asking!
WHY US?
Maybe it developed over time,
or yet... maybe... it just happened,
maybe... we learned it,
or better yet... maybe... its just a phase,
or maybe... it is Genetics.
Oh, yes that's the one, huh.
And maybe if there was more knowledge
there would be a cure?
or better yet a cause.
Day and night
Day and night,
Day and night,
24 to 7 you are fluent.
24 to 7 I am not!
I am one of the few, the Proud, and the disgraced.
And you are the Majority, the Normal, the fluent.
This is my life, my challenge, my dream.
Oh, when will this curse,
this wretched curse be over.
I will survive, now and always,
Forever, I will never give up,
my fight for fluency,
for if I do, ALL IS LOST,
but all is not lost, there is hope.
There is always hope.
That is what it means
to be a stutterer.

&lt;hr&gt;

It means trying not to be afraid of doing things that others take for granted; ordering a meal at a restaurant, booking a reservation over the telephone.  It means preparing yourself to appear like a fool every day - but you grow a thick skin: you have no choice - you have to get on with it, but you have a feeling that you are never going to reach your full potential, primarily because other people prevent you from doing so.

By this, I mean the job interview.  I have lost count on how many I have had.  Sure, some of it is that I'm not quite the right person for the job, but in other cases it is evident that I am the subject of other peoples misconceptions.  I now tell people that I have a stutter to try to make them feel more comfortable, but you still see their wringing hands and stressed eyes, even though you are a lot less embarassed than they are.  &quot;Was my speech an issue when it came to choosing the right candidate?&quot; I asked once when seeking interview feedback.  The reply was, &quot;it was a concern for one of the members on the panel&quot;.  I was told that the company had a profit to make.  This implied that if I was employed I would have reduced their profitability.  Of course, I raised this with the personnel department, but by then they had figured out their excuses.

For me, age brings it's benefits.  The older that I get, the more I am happier in my own skin, the more fluent I become.  My early teens were the worst - all that angst and stress.  If only I knew then that it would get better.  When I was younger I could barely speak at all.  I wasn't teased so much, it was the situations that one had to endure.  Now, a whole week can pass without realising that I speak in a clumsy way.

Although I hate giving presentations and know I freak out the audience, I try to go ahead and do it anyway (although I don't actively seek out these situations).  I try to remember that whatever doesn't will you makes you stronger.  Most people are accepting, but there are some who give you a wide birth, not knowing how to deal with you or what to say to you.  I want to tell these people, &quot;just be normal... after all, in every other way, I am as normal as everybody else&quot;.

I've participated in two different periods of therapy when I was young.  I enjoyed the first, and liked the therapist and was interested by the whole experience, but then I moved home and went into remission.  My second session was as a teenager.  The therapist saw me as a stutter rather than a person who has had the stuffing knocked out of them what feels like a million times.  The whole person needs to be considered - how they feel about themselves, and what they think others think about themselves too.

It's never going to go away, but I have already achieved more than I thought I would achieve, yet I still have a desire to do more with my life.  You get reminded of who you are from time to time, when you put yourself in difficult situations and get knocked back, but I try to think that this isn't your fault.

You have to be 'superhuman' to move forward.  You have something that most other people don't have.  I take solace in the fact that I am undeniably special - I am gifted with a unique way of experiencing life.

&lt;hr&gt;

Here are my words of advice to stutterers - do not give up. There is hope.

I am 56 years old and have been a stutterer all my life and know first hand how embarrassing and debilitating it can be. It has severely limited my social life and has prevented me from making female friends. We all know the horrifying situations, speaking to strangers, answering the phone, ordering in a restaurant, public speaking or speaking to someone in authority.

As a child, I remember being taunted by my uncle and cousins. In hindsight, I believe that relatives and peers have exacerbated the problem which may not have occurred if less attention was given to it.

I recall a classmate in high school who was a severe stutterer. When he was required to answer a question in the classroom he would block completely, and yet, outside in the playground he would be yelling for the football at the top of his lungs.

Some of my most fearful stuttering experiences occurred in my teenage years. In high school they tried to introduce us to public speaking. We had to make oral presentations in front of the class. On another occasion, for five straight days each student had to read passages of scripture in front of about twenty priests gathered for lunch at the local seminary.

In my first year at university I realized that I could benefit from professional intervention but could not afford it as a student. In the end I never received any direct treatment. The turning point for me came in my university years. I started to get involved in committees. I became president of a student club. I started to gain confidence speaking in front of the class on subject matter of which I was knowledgeable. It was much easier for me to speak out when I had the floor. But it was never easy in speak in random conversation within a group.

What was my most embarrassing moment as an adult? As the president of a local community club, I had to make a short presentation to city council. Even though I was well prepared with script in hand, the words just did not want to flow. I must have sounded like an incompetent fool. Fortunately my vice president was with me and he did an excellent job of delivering what I had failed to do.

The following is simply my own experience and analysis and does not represent any formal academic thesis on the subject. I characterize my experiences and observations of stuttering into three stages, repetition, blocking and facial contortions. Repetition appears at an early age and is common in children. It is like trying to start a car engine that just doesn’t want to go. Or it is like having &quot;to make a running start&quot; in anticipation of getting over the hump or block. Blocking is the real manifestation of stuttering. Repetition is a learned habit of attempting to overcome the block.

Facial contortion represents the more severe manifestation of blocking where the facial muscles, through a lifetime of undesirable training and exercise just would not let go of old habits and the words just would not come out. Forcing the words out while blocking will only reinforce the problem. Sometimes severe blocking is accompanied by slapping the hand on the legs or thighs, or by foot stamping.

Some consequences of stuttering are avoiding certain situations such as answering the phone or talking to people. You tend not to participate in group discussions or to provide verbal answers in class. Word substitution becomes common. When you anticipate that you will stutter on a certain word, you substitute it with another word sometimes resulting in lesser impact or conveying the wrong message. Common stuttering words are &quot;but&quot; and &quot;and&quot;. I used to think that certain consonants such as &quot;b&quot; or &quot;p&quot; cause me the most problems but I believe that this is no longer true. Multi-syllabic or difficult words such as &quot;meteorology&quot; or &quot;epidemiology&quot; are examples of stumbling blocks. The strangest of them all is I stutter saying my own name. To this day I still do. I took a year of learning Spanish. For whatever reasons, my stuttering increased when speaking a different language.

Stuttering is not a neurological disorder. It is a developmental disorder. It is an involuntary habit trained and exercised since early childhood. If you began walking with a limp you would end up walking with a limp. If you walked slumped over you will end up like that. If you speak ending every sentence with an um or eh you will continue to do so. The difference is stuttering is involuntary and it is very difficult to break out of the rut. You have to literally untrain your muscles in order to break out of the habit. I agree with the statement that &quot;stuttering is what stutterers do trying not to stutter&quot;. Speaking is an art form of expression. Just like dancing or playing a musical instrument, it takes years of training and practice to be able to do it automatically and fluently. Ideally, I would like my speech to be automatic and I should not have to be conscious of my efforts. The more I think of my stuttering the more likely I am to stutter. The chapter on [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Zen in the Art of Stuttering|Zen in the Art of Stuttering]] is wonderful reading. Another section that I find very useful is the discussion on [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Motor Learning and Control#Three Stages of Motor Learning|autonomous motor learning, Three Stages of Motor Learning]].

Here is what appears to work for me. First of all, I have a lot of self confidence in what I do. I have high self esteem. I believe that this is very important. You have to believe in yourself and know what your strengths and weaknesses are. Here are the things that I have done in the past. I began by reading aloud privately. I read slowly and quietly at first. I paid attention to my breathing, trying to be slow and controlled. I focussed on articulation and exaggerated the spacing between words. When I became comfortable with this I gradually increased my volume. I pretended that I was in a large room and tried to project my voice as if I were speaking to the person at the back of the room. 

In general, I have found that taking a deep breath appears to be the wrong thing to do. I am more likely to block by doing so. Instead, I take a deep breath and exhale slowly. Now while halfway through exhalation, I say the words I want to say. I believe this makes my muscles more relaxed. I certainly want to avoid hyperventilating. If I find myself blocking, I stop. I must not force my way out of a block. I know that doing so continues to exercise the wrong muscles.

Perhaps, what has had the most significant impact is learning to control stress and anxiety. As I grow older I grow mellower. I don’t sweat the small stuff and I am more relaxed. For example, I watch my driving habits. I have slowed down to the speed limit. I don't try to beat the red lights and I stop at all stop signs. I try to be courteous and I let the other drivers in. I don't switch lanes just to get ahead. Instead, I slow down for the slower driver in front of me and I give myself lots of space. Overall, I am a much calmer and happier person.

I was 47 when my father died and none of my siblings would give the eulogy at his funeral service, even though I am the youngest of his children. I willingly took myself to the task and I am pleased to say that my delivery was flawless. As an adult, I have served on a club executive, serving as president for one year. I now teach at a major university. Two of my professors were severe stutterers and yet they were able to conduct lectures in front of three hundred students. On another occasion I was emcee at the memorial service for a professor with about 150 people in attendance.

I have four wonderful children. When one of my sons was about three we witnessed incidences of stuttering. Knowing what I have gone through in my life as a stutterer I did not want him to have to do the same. My wife and I discussed this at great length and mutually agreed on our set of strategies.

1. We recognized that some degree of disfluency in children is normal and quite often they outgrow it.
2. We agreed that bringing the child’s attention to it or the attention of those around him would do more harm than good. 
3. We agreed to model both good speaking and listening habits by speaking slowly and clearly and by listening without interrupting.

Most importantly, we allowed the child to speak without interrupting, giving our full attention with eye-to-eye contact, whether on a one-on-one basis or in a group at the dinner table, for example. Today he is eleven, a bright and confident young man and speaks fluently.

In retrospect, I believe that reading and writing have helped me to overcome my stuttering. As a child and teenager I did very little of both. Being a stutterer caused me to be introverted which resulted in my having poor verbal communication skills. I never did dwell on the thought that I might have poor language skills as well. I am now made aware of this having read &quot;Boys of Few Words&quot; by Adam J. Cox. Another book, &quot;Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus&quot; by John Gray, discusses how men and women can be so different in communication skills.

As a young adult, witnessing the birth of personal computers and desktop publishing, I became the editor of a club newsletter. I have read and written a lot more since then. I now see the importance of developing language skills and how this has helped me. Being introverted did not necessarily mean that I was capable of internalizing all my thoughts and feelings clearly and fluently. I needed to develop my language skills as well.

I have created my personal book of &quot;Writings&quot; for no other reason except for enjoyment. This is not a diary or journal but a collection of thoughts, ideas, theories or personal analyses of anything that comes to mind, usually about religion, philosophy, politics, economics, conservation, etc. I can write a lot more fluently now than ever before. When I speak I have difficulty finding the right words to say. Quite often I know the word I am looking for but it doesn’t come to mind quickly enough. Writing has allowed me to improve my sentence construction and words appear to come more quickly and fluently.

The goal as a stutterer is to be able to say the words without having any thoughts of stuttering. As said before, &quot;stuttering is what stutterers do when they are trying not to stutter&quot;. Let the sleeping dog lie. I can declare myself to be one hundred percent fluent, despite the fact that I do stumble occasionally. I say this because I am no longer afraid to speak to an audience. I can handle all situations that I was so fearful of in the past. I no longer use word substitution. I know that I can speak fluently. When I speak, the words come more easily and I no longer have to think about stuttering. On the few occasions that it rears its ugly head I revive the techniques to allow me to glide over it and put it aside. My life is so much richer now that I have the confidence to speak in public.

12 September 2008 - Update
I am happy to announce that I have been a very active member of Toastmasters, an internationally renowned organization that promotes building confidence in communication and leadership. My purpose for joining Toastmasters was not to overcome my problems with stuttering but to prepare me for the greater role of becoming an effective public speaker. Joining Toastmasters has been a very rewarding and entertaining experience for me.

==Audience Reaction Video==
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After performing in a play I interviewed audience members asking what they thought about seeing an actor who stutters.&lt;/i&gt;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 01:33, 28 March 2006 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;[http://www.casafuturatech.com/Books/NoMiracleCures/GardenInterviews.mov Watch the video.]&lt;/p&gt;

===First Interview===

&lt;p&gt;WOMAN: I thought you did a great job. And at first I didn't know if it was part of the acting or not. I even asked Richard if it was part of it or not. I couldn't even tell if you were acting or if it was real. But I thought you did a great job and I didn't think it made it any worse than it would have been if you didn't stutter. I thought it was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

===Second Interview===

&lt;p&gt;WOMAN: I thought you were excellent. I met you before the show so I already knew. But it was like part of the act. I didn't know that was an anti-stutter device. I just thought that was part of your costume. I thought you were great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Third Interview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: What did you think of my stuttering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAN: It just seemed natural, like a part of who you were. And also there were times when you used it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: If you heard that another play had an actor who stuttered in it, would that make you less likely to go see the play, or would you not care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FAST-TALKING WOMAN: It gives the opportunity to slow down and actually the words that are being said. Otherwise if they're flying by too fast then it just kinda does just that, you're not even able to catch it as it rides by. But if you slow down and catch, you syllabalize it goes then that would seem to me to be a good thing. Just kinda slowing down the gears a little bit, snapping them back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fourth Interview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: What did you think about me stuttering?

&lt;p&gt;SETH'S MOM: Well, what I first thought that it was part of your act. Then eventually I caught on and I just thought it was great that you were performing and just being who you were and being an actor and making us all comfortable with that. It's not an experience I have every day, communicating with someone that has any kind of speech difficulties. And then the part where you said, &quot;No, I just stutter,&quot; after the crushed nut episode, that was just a real, it just helped us all, kind of, yeah, it was a joke, and broke the ice, along with everything else being, talk about rawness of human emotions and kind of everything laid open, it was very helpful, and once again remembering that we're all human and we all have things to contribute and we all have things we don't like about us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SETH DREAMSEEKER WAXING MOON BRAUN: I felt like it's engaging to watch you perform because what's engaging about a performer is presence, and you're ability to stay present with the dynamic of your character, even though you're stuttering. It's very interesting, it's like, if you're that committed as a performer, to move through what might be difficult, it engages me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: What did you think of my electronic anti-stuttering device? Was it weird or distracting that I was using this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SETH DREAMSEEKER WAXING MOON BRAUN: Well, since I know you, David, I thought, OK, I wonder if that's an anti-stuttering device? But I didn't even think about that until I'd seen it like ten minutes into the show. It was just like, maybe this is character. I really that it was part of a shift of character because you used it really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: There's a group of teenagers who stutter in New York City who've formed an acting company. Is there anything you'd like to tell them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SETH DREAMSEEKER WAXING MOON BRAUN: Hell yeah! I support you in training as young warrior artists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fifth Interview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: What did you think about me stuttering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUNE: I just saw these different characters on stage, and it was just a quality of that character. Every different, completely different character. It took on a different quality, just like any other attribute that a person would have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: A group of teenagers who stutter in New York City have formed an acting company. Is there anything you'd like to say to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUNE: Right on! Just keep doing what you're doing. I mean, I think that watching the performance, people that are trying out these different aspects of themselves, I want to do it. So I think that anyone that's doing it, go for it. It must be really a freeing thing, and takes a lot of courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Sixth Interview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: Nir Banai was also in this play. What was it like working with a person who stuttered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIR BANAI: It was great. It was very inspiring to see you do such a performance with stuttering and having so much confidence to do it. It was really impressive. It was so impressive that you even used it as a joke in one of the skits. I was really impressed that you feel so comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Seventh Interview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: If you heard that another actor in another play stuttered, would that make you less likely to go to the play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAN: Well, no, I don't think so. I mean, no. Definitely not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: There's a group of teenagers who stutter in New York who have formed an acting company.  Is there anything you'd like to say to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAN: Well, um, so, I think if they are looking for some inspiration then, um, well, if I was them I would have found that tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Eighth Interview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: What did you think about me stuttering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GIGGLING WOMAN: I thought it was beautiful. You did a great job, I thought it was very real.  Yeah, I was convinced&amp;#151;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: Well, it was real, I do stutter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GIGGLING WOMAN: You do stutter? No, you don't really stutter, do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: Amazingly real, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GIGGLING WOMAN: It was. It was very very real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: Wow. Great. I achieved that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GIGGLING WOMAN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: What did you think of the electronic anti-stuttering device I was wearing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GIGGLING WOMAN: Oh this thing? I thought that was super cool. I did, I thought it was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ninth Interview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: What did you think of me stuttering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WOMAN: It was beautiful. For real. I thought, I was much more, like, into the creativity of the play and thought that you guys pulled off a really beautiful creation, that you guys made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDK: You weren't wishing they had someone who wasn't stuttering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WOMAN: No way, man. No way. I thought it was beautiful. It was great. You were great. I was very impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

30 juin 2005. – Une centaine d'hectares de forêt a brûlé jeudi après-midi en région Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur.Le Centre opérationnel départemental d'incendie et de secours du Var a déclaré que le terrain était « très difficile d'accès en raison de la densité de la végétation ».

Toutefois, avec l'aide d'importants moyens (huit avions, et deux hélicoptères), les pompiers espèrent maîtriser l'incendie avant la nuit bien que le feu soit attisé par un vent d'ouest. Les raisons de l'incendie restent inconnues, une enquête est ouverte.

Ce premier feu de forêt de l'été fait craindre une situation difficile pour les pompiers : les spécialistes craignent une situation similaire à celle de l'été 2003 lors duquel plusieurs centaines d'hectares du massif des Maures avaient été ravagés.

== Questions ==

# Why was the area where the fire had burned difficult to access?
# Why do the firefighters want to control the fire before nightfall?
# What happened during the summer of 2003?

      <text xml:space="preserve">One may wonder where exactly is the top of the atmosphere, and with good reason. We know that the atmosphere consists primarily of the gaseous envelop around Earth, and that pressure decreases with height, according to they hydrostatic approximation. Does the atmosphere end only when the pressure reaches a vanishingly small value? No, but there is not a good definition of the top of the atmosphere, and it changes with sub-discipline. For our purposes, we can usually take the top of the atmosphere, often abbreviated TOA, as somewhere in the low to mid-stratosphere, or even simply the tropopause. In this chapter, we can imagine it is the level at which the downward shortwave radiative flux is negligibly different from the solar constant and where there is negligible downward longwave flux (that due to the sun, which is small). 

Now that we have an idea of what the TOA is, we can ask why it might be useful.

First consider conservation of energy in an equilibrium system. This  could be a tank of water with a heating lamp above it all enclosed in a box. It could be a simple blackbody system, or any isolated system. Conservation of energy means that the total amount of energy does not change, which is equivalent to saying that any energy that is input to the system must be balanced by an outward flux of energy. In the case of Earth (as the &quot;system&quot;), this means that the energy coming in (the sunlight) must be balanced by outgoing radiation. We know the solar constant (&lt;math&gt;1367 W m^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;), so if we integrate over the Earth's surface, we know how much incoming energy there is. This incoming energy, sometimes called solar insolation or downward shortwave radiation, needs to be balanced. Why? Well, if it is not balanced by an equal loss of energy, then the temperature of the system must change (this is the 1st law of thermodynamics). Wien's law tells us that the wavelength of peak emission from a blackbody is inversely related to the temperature, and for normal Earth-like temperatures that puts the emission in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thankfully, this light is invisible to humans, and because the wavelength is longer than visible light (solar or shortwave), the terrestrial infrared radiation is often referred to as longwave radiation. The amount that is radiated to space (which differs from that emitted by the surface because of the greenhouse effect) is often called ''outgoing longwave radiation'' (OLR). The OLR (which is equal to the net longwave at TOA) balances the net shortwave at the top of the atmosphere when the system is in equilibrium. 

Is the net shortwave radiation at TOA equal to the incoming shortwave? The answer is no. The net shortwave, which when averaged over suitable time and over the global, is the source of energy to the climate system, but not all the solar insolation is absorbed by the earth. Let's not beat around the bush. What happens to incoming solar radiation when it arrives in the atmosphere? There are really just three paths a photon (a &quot;particle&quot; of light) can take. First it can be absorbed, either in the atmosphere or at the surface. Absorption means that the energy associated with the photon is imparted to some atom or molecule, resulting in a higher energy level in that particle. Second, the photon can be reflected, which means that the path of the photon is reversed. More generally, we should say that the photon can be scattered, with some probability of being scattered back in the direction it came from, but we do not need to deal with scattering right here. Third, the photon can continue unimpeded, ultimately reaching the surface and being absorbed or reflected; while the photon is traveling through a medium without interacting, it is said to be transmitted. To study climate, one need not (usually) worry about individual photons, but the effects of the light in aggregate. Since we now know what can happen to each photon individually, we can sum over all the photons that make up the solar insolation such that &lt;math&gt;F_\downarrow = A + R + T&lt;/math&gt;, where F is the total downward shortwave flux, A is the fraction of light absorbed by the atmosphere, R is the fraction reflected back to space before reaching the surface, and T is the light transmitted to the surface. 

From our understanding of the downward shortwave flux, we can continue the analysis by considering the surface. The amount of light absorbed by the surface is not exactly equal to the transmitted light, T. Why? Well, the surface can be highly reflective. For example, snow and ice reflect up to 80% of incident light, while open ocean surfaces reflect almost none. The reflectivity of the surface is usually called the albedo, denoted &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and is simply the fraction of incident light that gets reflected. Knowing that the surface has a given albedo, we can now say that the amount of light absorbed at the surface must be equal to &lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{absorbed}} = (1 -\alpha)^{-1} (F_\downarrow - A - R)&lt;/math&gt;. This says the absorbed light at the surface is equal to the transmitted insolation that is not reflected by the surface. Note that the albedo is constrained by definition to always be between 0 and 1, with typical global average of about 0.3. 

It should also be noted that the shortwave light reflected by the surface does have a chance of being reflected (by clouds or particulate matter) or absorbed by atmospheric constituents. However, for most discussions of climate, and for the purposes here, we will neglect this process. Furthermore, we can (to a reasonable approximation) assume that the atmosphere is transparent to shortwave radiation, meaning there will be no absorption. This simplifies our previous expressions by eliminating the term A. To further simplify our notation, we can say that the total &quot;planetary albedo&quot; is the sum of the atmosphere albedo (later will will call this the cloud albedo) and the surface albedo, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_p = \alpha_s + \alpha_c&lt;/math&gt;. These simplifications allow us to write the &quot;net shortwave at TOA&quot; as &lt;math&gt;F_{net} = F_\downarrow - F_\uparrow = (1 - \alpha_p)F_\downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

As mentioned above, the radiative flux from the surface acts approximately according to the Steffan-Boltzmann and Wien's laws of blackbody radiation. Even if we take the total energy from the solar constant spread over the full surface area of Earth, the emission must be in the infrared. The calculation is left as an exercise. 

When we assume that the surface absorbs some fraction of the incident shortwave, &lt;math&gt;(1 - \alpha_s)F_{sfc}&lt;/math&gt;, and that the temperature reaches equilibrium, the emitted flux is then &lt;math&gt;Q_{sfc} = \sigma T_{sfc}^4&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, in reality there is some emissivity associated with different surface types, but we neglect that here. Once emitted, these photons face similar consequences as the down-welling shortwave radiation. The difference in the longwave is primarily that the atmosphere is much more opaque in the infrared than visible, so the absorption can not be neglected. Various atmospheric constituents absorb infrared energy, then emit at a wavelength commensurate with the temperature of that part of the atmosphere. This is the natural greenhouse effect, and the active gases are often referred to as greenhouse gases; primary among these are water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. 

The consequences of the natural greenhouse effect are crucial for life on Earth. In the absence of an atmosphere, the longwave radiation emitted to space would be exactly equal to the shortwave absorbed, and the surface temperature would be a chilly 255 K. Because greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation, they act to warm the planet. How? We can think of the effects in two ways. First, the gases are heated by the absorbed radiation, and then radiate isotropically (equally up and down), sending energy back toward the surface to act as an extra energy source. Second, the absorption and subsequent emission by greenhouse gases changes the effective emission temperature of Earth (as seen from space). This second effect is a useful way to understand the greenhouse effect, and can be easily applied to changing climates. As a thought experiment, consider all the absorption by greenhouse gases happening in a thin layer of the atmosphere, which can effectively be thought of as a thin shell around the Earth. From space, the emission from the planet will be coming from an elevated level, with a much colder temperature than the surface. Of course, that means that the flux from that surface will be less than the incoming flux of solar insolation. The only way the climate system can achieve equilibrium, which is required by conservation of energy, is for the lower levels to warm, emit more energy as longwave radiation, which in turns warms the atmosphere, and changes the effective emission height and temperature. This adjustment continues until the shortwave and longwave budgets are balanced at the top of the atmosphere. 

The figure below shows a rough cartoon of the radiative balances in the atmosphere. So far, we have focused only on the clear-sky scenario (on the left of the cartoon). Later we will consider the modifications that arise in the presence of clouds, and we will also explore the implications of changing the atmospheric composition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">International Relations has not come out of the Cold war. Many may think the Cold war ended with the demolition of the Berlin Wall or with the decline of the USSR. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the Cold war is a virus-like phenomena. It has changed the outlook from being a tussle between the West and the Communist block to a war between the developing and developed economy. The manifestations are the north south dialogues. The Russian President and U.S President all spoke the same language. Whether they spoke different languages in the so called Cold War period is it self to be questioned. Thus in the 21st century only the players change but not the game plan. Its always between the haves and have-nots.

== General Overview ==

'''''Godric's Hollow''''' is where Harry's parents lived when he was a baby. This is also where they were killed and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] met his first downfall. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] did not actually visit the place until Christmas of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 16|the seventh year of our story]]. It is notorious, however, as the place where Harry Potter became known as &quot;the Boy Who Lived&quot;.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

It is not said where Godric's Hollow is physically located. However we have some indication from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|At the start of the story]], Hagrid brings back the one year old Harry Potter from Godric's Hollow to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey Surrey] on a flying motorbike. He says to Professor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and Professor [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]] that Harry ''&quot;fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.&quot;''

If we assume that Hagrid flew an approximately straight line, there are only two places where Godric's Hollow can be: Southern Wales or Southern Ireland. Apparently, the author has indicated that Godric's Hollow is located in Cottonbridge, England, though a map search for that name does not seem to return any useful results.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we are told that, in ''A History of Magic'', [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]] writes that Godric's Hollow, a &quot;West Country village,&quot; is one of a number of villages where wizards settled in relatively large numbers after the ratification of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689.

It appears that the Dumbledore family moved to Godric's Hollow when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]]'s father [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percival Dumbledore|Percival]] was imprisoned. Albus and his mother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]], sister [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], and brother [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] lived here, until Kendra's and Ariana's deaths. At the time, Bathilda Bagshot was their neighbour. Godric's Hollow is famed as the birthplace of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]], and also as the final resting place of at least one of the Peverell family.

There is some connection between Godric's Hollow and the Peverell family, who we first hear about in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], and we know that Harry lived there for a while, though we believe he was not born there.

== Analysis ==

Bathilda Bagshot's note that Godric's Hollow is the home of a relatively large number of wizards does not indicate that it is a purely Wizarding village; in fact, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade village]], according to what we are told, is the only purely Wizarding village in Britain. As such, wizard residents of Godric's Hollow must still avoid open use of magic to avoid disturbing the Muggle residents of the village. This is why the monuments to the Potter family must be hidden: the sculpture of the family appears to be an ordinary cenotaph except at certain angles, and presumably only wizards can see it at all; and the Potter house on the edge of the village is charmed to be invisible to Muggles. One must assume that a charm similar to the one that hides [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]] must be in use at the latter site, to prevent Muggles from trying to build on the apparently empty lot as the village grows.

Given the Dumbledore family experience with Muggles, it is a little surprising that the family chose to settle at Godric's Hollow rather than Hogsmeade. However, it is possible that there was some family history that connected the family to this village; and it seems likely that the Dumbledore family chose to live in a part of the village that was primarily wizard-occupied.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#Why was it that the Potter house in Godric's Hollow is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|almost destroyed]] on the day when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] tried to kill [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It should be noted that Ignotus Peverell, one of the three brothers who, according to the myth, received the three [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] from Death himself, is buried in the church yard at Godric's Hollow; Hermione discovers his tombstone there. It is possible that Ignotus was the brother who owned the Invisibility Cloak, and that it had passed down through the generations until Harry inherited it from his own father, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]].

Prior to the release of the seventh book, there was a great deal of discussion on various fan sites about the &quot;missing day&quot;; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] had been dead for a full day before [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] appeared at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] with Harry. It was believed by many fans that the occurrences during that day would be important, possibly even pivotal, to events in the seventh book. It is entirely possible that, because of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fidelius|Fidelius charm]] still being active, Hagrid would have been unable to find the place until one of the parties to the secret was there. We can safely assume that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], as one of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marauders|Marauders]], would have been aware of the Potters' location; in fact, he does say, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], that he had seen &quot;the bodies and the destruction&quot; of the house, so he must have known the secret, either before the Fidelius charm was performed, or by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] informing him of it later. It is entirely possible that Hagrid was unable to enter the remains of the house to recover Harry until Sirius appeared on the scene; and it would have been Sirius who actually removed Harry from the wreckage and passed him to Hagrid to carry back to Little Whinging. However, against this we have Hagrid's word; he says that he had entered the house himself. So we can safely assume that either the Fidelius charm had ceased operation with the death of the Potters, or that Hagrid had been made privy to the secret.

That does, however, leave the entire day unaccounted for; in Voldemort's memory of the night the Potters died, it appears that the events occur early in the evening, and Harry is left at the Dursleys late the following night. The only explanation we can find is one of distance: it is four hundred miles, approximately, from where we believe Hogwarts is, to where Godric's Hollow seems to be, and two hundred fifty miles from Godric's Hollow to Surrey, and Hagrid, driving a flying motorcycle, probably is only traveling at about 60 miles per hour. Thus, it would take at least seven hours for Hagrid to reach Godric's Hollow, probably getting to the house early in the morning, and then another four hours to reach the Dursley home. We don't know what he was doing during the ten or so daylight hours; we can only guess that he was entertaining Harry, it being then unsafe for him to fly &amp;ndash; even if Hagrid weren't so very large, a flying motorcycle in broad daylight would be bound to excite comment.

The mention of the &quot;wreckage&quot; of the house is also interesting; the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] does not destroy things, it only kills people, so it is unlikely that the house would have been destroyed by the reflected curse that killed Voldemort. In two cases later, in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', Voldemort casts the Killing Curse at Harry and has it rebound upon him, and both times there is no damage except to Voldemort. So how did the house get destroyed? There was speculation that in fact it was Peter Pettigrew who destroyed the house, in a fit of madness at seeing his master, &quot;the most powerful wizard of all time&quot; (or so the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] think), killed by an infant. Peter would not have tried to harm Harry, out of fear at possibly meeting Voldemort's fate. Also, Peter, recovering Voldemort's body, could have chosen to blast his way out of the house rather than maneuver Voldemort's body down from the upstairs bedroom. When we visit Godric's Hollow at Christmas in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', we see that the damage seems to be confined to that one room, which would seem to lend weight to this line of reasoning. This also means that Hagrid and, possibly, Sirius are guilty of exaggeration, when they talk about the damage done. 
&lt;!-- 
I feel that I should interupt as here you have forgotton that this Killing Curse was no ordinary killing curse. As it backfired from Harry to Voldemort it is likely the curse contained something much more powerful, as to ruin such a unstable soul as Voldemorts'. This extra power could easily have been the reason why the house was destroyed. (86.167.236.42)

I disagree, as the similar backfires in the Forbidden Forest and the Hogwarts Great Hall did not cause explosions. -- Chazz. 
--&gt;

At the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Harry expresses a determination to go back to Godric's Hollow. There were suggestions that the death of one or both of Harry's parents might have been used to create additional [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], and there was a wide-spread belief that Harry's own death was intended to create another Horcrux; there was some suspicion that Harry might find either Horcruxes, or valuable artifacts meant to become Horcruxes, in Godric's Hollow when we get there in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. As it turns out, Harry never entered the house where his parents died; if there were such artifacts there, they did not enter the story.

One other point has been brought up that might be worth mention. There is mention that it was Albus Dumbledore who arranged the place where the Potters stayed, which leads us to believe also that this is Dumbledore's home turf. In fact, both the Potters and the Dumbledores apparently were neighbours to Bathilda Bagshot, making it possible that the Potters were living in Dumbledore's ancestral home at the time they died. It might have still belonged to the Dumbledore family, in fact; in interviews following publication of the final book, the author has said the the Potters did not own that house, but did not suggest who did. If that is the case, what is the relationship between Dumbledore and Godric Gryffindor? Could Albus Dumbledore be a lineal descendant? Given that the Dumbledore family reportedly moved there after Percival's imprisonment, we cannot be certain, but the possibility remains.

== Wikiversity/Wikibooks in the News ==

[http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,17852820%5E15306%5E%5Enbv%5E,00.html See this news article for more information]

In short, Wikiversity is an intersting experiment, but remains to be seen if it will actually develop into a seperate project.  I am curious about some of the quotes, especially as to Jimbo's attitude about the whole thing.  Still, it is interesting that Wikibooks is starting to make some major ripples to become international news.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:38, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

: Please, remember to add such news to [[Wikibooks:About#Wikibooks in the News]] (maybe we should create separate page?).
: I'm a bit embarrased by Wikiversity, because it seems to aim to split from Wikibooks and become its competitor. If Jimbo Wales managed to remove all &quot;non-textbook&quot; content from Wikibooks, we would become actually a copy of Wikiversity. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:22, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

::I beg to differ on that point about Wikiversity, but that is a point of disagreement I can live with.  While textbooks are a primary focus, I think Wikibooks can be more than that.  I also think that Wikiversity could be doing somethings as a seperate project that are completely outside of the scope of Wikibooks, such as the original research proposals and critical review of Wikimedia projects, that could potentially compliment the rest of the Wikimedia projects as well.  I will admit that the current organization of schools vs. Wikibooks bookshelves is almost identical and is in some ways a duplication of effort.  Schools could potentially be much more than what we envision for bookshelves, however.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:31, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibook Structure ==

I want to create a wikibook on Chinese Tractor Maintenance.  It seems to me that I need at least six levels of hierarchy to keep the individual pages from getting too long.  For example:

Manufacturer
     Model
          System
               Subsystem
                     Component
                           Task

An instance of the hierarchy would be:
Manufacturer: Kama
Model Number: 554
System:  Engine
Subsystem:  Head
Component:   Valve
Task1: Adjust Valve Lash
Task 2: Adjust Decompression Link
Task 3: Remove and Replace Valve

Is a Wikibook a realistic approach for this kind of manual? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:63.165.62.3|63.165.62.3]] ([[User talk:63.165.62.3|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/63.165.62.3|contribs]]) 18:15, 31 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

:You would probably have page titles like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/Kama/554/Engine/Head/Valve/Adjust Valve Lash]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. This is a realistic approach for Wikibooks. Wikibooks will automatically make upward links to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/Kama/554/Engine/Head/Valve]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/Kama/554/Engine/Head]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, ..., &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Chinese Tractor Maintenance]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. On the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Chinese Tractor Maintenance/Kama/554/Engine/Head/Valve]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; page, you would have subpage links like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Adjust Valve Lash/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Adjust Decompression Link/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;,  &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Remove and Replace Valve/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to all valve tasks.

:I suggest that you start with only one page. Pick a bookshelf (like [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf|How-tos bookshelf]] or [[Wikibooks:Miscellaneous bookshelf|Miscellaneous bookshelf]]) and add a link like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Chinese Tractor Maintenance]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. Use that red link to start your book. Then, when ready, make subpage links like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Kama/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and move everything to manufacturer pages. Repeat the process whenever you want to add a new level. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:06, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

== Serious? ==

How can Wikibooks expect to be taken seriously with stuff like [[Wikiversity:School_of_Magic]] around? [[User:84.69.5.63|84.69.5.63]] 14:02, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

: Apart from the fact that [[Wikiversity]] is not [[Wikibooks]] and Wikiversity in general are messing things up here at Wikibooks by adding dozends of empty books and/or adding articles more suitable for [[Wikipedia]] I also belive that [[Wikiversity:School_of_Magic]] has the same right to exist as [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]]. But then my idea of [[w:Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] goes further then that of most other people.

:::::The whole issue is really in the hands of the Wikimedia Foundation Board at the moment, because a formal request was presented, with proper notification and Wikimedia-wide voting as well, to create Wikiversity as a totally seperate multi-lingual Wikimedia sister project.  There is some give and take going on between those who want to get the project started and some of the policies that the board wants to see implemented before Wikiversity gets the green light.  The Status-quo is to simply let Wikiversity remain here temporarily until the seperate domain is established.  What will happen if the board simply says a resounding '''&quot;NO&quot;''' is speculative at best, but I think it might get ugly.  Most Wikiversity participants are wanting to say simply &quot;to hell with Wikimedia&quot; and try to start their own project on an independent server with their own seperate fundraising and server farm.  What to do with Wikiversity content if that happens is going to be certainly a subject of a huge debate.  I would prefer that the board simply approve the proposal, which would make life easier for just about everybody involved.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:14, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

== Removing Sysop Status ==

Has there ever been a discussion about the pile-up of inactive administrators here? Many are quite old and haven't edited in quite some time. Others still stay active but rarely actually use their sysop abilities. To me this gives a bad impression of the role of admins here. Should there be a process for removing sysop access? I find it dangerous that some users have sysop abilities when they don't use them for the reasons the rights were given to them and simply stay isolated within their own book project. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 01:12, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
:I agree. Sysops that have been inactive for extremely long periods of time should probably not keep the status. Even if they do come back to the project after a while, they would be so far out of the loop, and so ignorant of recent policy changes and discussions that they would not even be able to be effective admins immediately. If you don't use it, you should lose it. However, I think that deactivated sysops should get preference if they decide to become active, and apply for sysop status again. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Windows Programming|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:33, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

: We do need to be at least a bit careful with sysops that are active authors but have not been using their sysop rights outside their own projects.  I suspect that some of them have '''''very''''' sensitive toes.  As good an idea as it is to do a little sysop housecleaning, I don't know that a royal brouhaha would be worth the effort.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 19:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

:Actually, there was a substantial [[Wikibooks talk:Administrators#Time limits for Admins|discussion about removing inactive admins]] that ended up with the concensus of the group of active users and admins that were involved with Wikibooks at the time to simply keep the admins who havn't contributed for a substantial amount of time as inactive admins.  This distinction is only to let people who are trying to contact an admin to get a better idea of who is still doing stuff and who may not necessarily reply to any request for some time.  Other Wikimedia projects have other policies, which vary to a large degree over what would be cause for deadminship.  I had the opinion that inactive admins perhaps should be desysoped without prejudice, with it mainly being a formality to request sysop status.&lt;p&gt;The ugly part of this whole issue is that we don't have anybody locally who can remove sysop status from any user, and instead we need to appeal to a steward.  That does involve other politics as well, but most stewards are willing to do actions they may even be somewhat against as long as there has been widespread community concensus about the topic.  The Wikibooks user community certainly has changed somewhat since this discussion last occured.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:06, 3 February 2006 (UTC)
::That discussion didn't seem to involve many users. I would like to hear what the community thinks of inactive admins now. A lot of those listed as inactive admins most likely wouldn't be up to speed on policy if they just came back suddenly. In a way I think they've become &quot;obsolete&quot; and should have their status removed just like how an old component upgrades (which they're not doing) or gets dropped. Also, some admins listed as &quot;active&quot; don't seem to actually actively use administrative privileges. I see that as dangerous because they have powerful features and don't use them for the good of the community, even sometimes possibly using them inappropriately solely for their own benefit. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 22:58, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

:: I think we could remove status from sysops inactive for a year - it's a practise used for stewards at Meta, so I think it would be fair to apply it here. When it comes to sysops that don't make use of admin tools, well, I think it would be hard to reach consensus here, although I also think that such users shouldn't have sysop priviledges if they don't help with cleaning up Wikibooks. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:25, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

I agree. There's nothing wrong (and indeed everything to be said for) a &quot;if you don't use it, lose it&quot; approach. Having inactive sysop accounts creates a security risk (someone could guess their passwords and hijack the account), plus when people return after a long lay-off, they will take a bit of getting up to speed on current practices. Returners can always be re-appointed sysops afterwards. Derbeth correctly comments that it is a good practice adopted on Meta, so why not apply it here. As far as active users with sysop privileges who don't happen to use them, there isn't the same risk of the account coming into the wrong hands, and having the tools may encourage them to help clean-up tasks at a later date. From my experience elsewhere in wikiland, I have a viewpoint that there really should be no problems with any active, reliable editor who wants sysop privileges having them, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 14:29, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

: I made a list of sysops who haven't made any edit for more than half a year: [[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]], [[User:Karen Johnson|Karen Johnson]], [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]], [[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]], [[User:Reytan|Reytan]]. I think it is fair to remove sysop rights from them. And another list of sysops who hardly ever used admin tools: [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Eclecticology&amp;page=] (zero times, and 21 edits totally!), [[User:Marshman]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Marshman&amp;page=], [[User:Perl|Perl]] (zero times), [[User:Traroth|Traroth]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Traroth&amp;page=] (zero times, no reverts, 141 edits), [[User:Cyp|Cyp]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Cyp&amp;page=] (zero times, no reverts, 108 edits). From this list I would like to see sysop status removed from Eclecticology, Traroth and Cyp. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:31, 12 February 2006 (UTC)
::I'd like to see sysop status removed from every single one of those users. I've looked at their recent edits and I definitely don't think they're using the tools appropriately or at all even. One seems to be using it to further his/her own book project and nothing else, which I think is a perfect example of power in the wrong hands. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 02:34, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

:I don't think you've weighted moves to sysop status properly. Sysop tools can be very dangerous; users can easily delete pages and wipe out all status of a module. With the smaller (compared to something like Wikipedia) amount of activity here, that could go unnoticed. It's too dangerous to leave this laying around in my opinion. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 06:10, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

I think clearing out some of the &quot;dead wood&quot; is a good idea. I support removing those sysops with no edits in the last 6 months. I'll have to think about some of the others, but Eclecticology, Perl, Traroth, and Cyp should have their status removed for lack of use. To satisfy the stewards, we'll need to formulate a policy for sysop removal, and find a location to have these discussions (which might be at RfA).

:: Oh dear, not another new policy. I think we won't do such &quot;cleanup&quot; more frequently than twice a year, so I think we can make a short discussion every time without introducing new policy and discussing about it for one month. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:49, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

Somehow I doubt that de-sysoping admins who have been inactive for more than a year is going to be controvercial, but I may be mistaken.  The one danger to this is that I don't want to see this time limit be shortened substantially without some very serious thought going into why it must be shortened.  Another thing to note is that we are not going to block these accounts but rather remove just the sysop privileges.

Where the real danger comes from is if the main password database on the Wikimedia servers is compromised by a vandal, who then gains access to potentially several inactive admins' accounts, blocks the active admins, and then performs widespread damage on the project.  This happened on Distributed Proofreading's website, which led to a strong recommendation of all users to change their passwords.  The MediaWiki software seems to be slightly more secure, although I'm sure some attempts to hack into the password database have occured.  MySQL (the db that is running the Wikimedia servers) uses a password encryption hash that is difficult to reverse and has been publicly scrutinized and widely implemented on many websites besides just Wikipedia and Wikibooks.  This doesn't mean the passwords can't be compromised, just that it would be very difficult to do so and requires more than even developer access to the database.  It would be easier to capture passwords through spyware instead.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:48, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

:Two points. (1) Are you saying we should wait for one year of inactivity rather than six months (as suggested by some above)? (2) An admin blocked by another admin still has admin powers, and can therefore unblock himself - only a steward or developer can remove sysop powers. A compromised sysop account would not be pleasant - but could be dealt with by getting a steward to block (which would happen on anyone's request if a sysop was unambiguously creating havoc) - and then there would be lots of tidying up of the damage done by the compromised sysop account. Maybe we'll have a brief discussion on 6 or 12 months, and about whether active sysop accounts where sysop powers are not being used and make it official policy. My take on this is 6 months, and I have no problem with an active account having sysop powers that are not, in practice, being used, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:40, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

::I do advocate a full year of inactivity, at least for an initial policy.  If there are further problems this time period can be shortened, but there are several admins who have not been on Wikibooks for well over a year (some for more than two years).  As far as one admin blocking another admin, I've never tried this out to see what might happen.  Can you even log on when you are blocked and access sysop functions?  If so, you could in turn block somebody who blocked, you... not too pleasant of a problem if you are trying to fight a rougue admin who is clearly violating policies for whatever reason and is willing to crash and burn his account and can still cause havoc with his admin status even if he can't edit pages.  I would hope that you could block another admin during a very heated edit war for a couple day &quot;cooling off period&quot; at the very least, with some strong explaination of the action on the user page and hopefully the Staff Lounge and mailing list (an avenue of reply if blocked).  So far the admins here have been rather reasoned and &quot;professional&quot; about their status, but this may not always be the case in every situation.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:20, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

::: I was in such situation, when someone blocked an IP which was afterwards assigned to me. I could not edit pages but I unblocked myself without any problems. There are not many admins inactive for a year (only three). Should I understand that you are against de-sysopping admins who were active recently, but haven't done any deletions or reverts (see my list)? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:35, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

::::I'm just suggesting that we start with a minimum standard that everybody can agree upon and then if there doesn't seem to be much of a resistance to tighten the standards later with a subsequent policy vote.  That anybody can be removed from the list at all with even the most loose standards (like not a single edit for more than a year) indicates that some problems exist and this minimum standards can be effective.  UncleG was particularly against even this minimum standard, and I see he hasn't joined into this current debate either.  As far as being blocked, was this IP address blocking (which can be overridded by design through being a registered user) or was your user account blocked.  This sounds like something for Bugzilla to deal with as a potential issue in the future.&lt;p&gt;BTW, I would like to point out that at least two people on the current inactive list, [[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] and [[User:Brion VIBBER]] are very active Wikimedians, but generally participate on other Wikimedia projects and not here.  [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] is very active on Wiktionary and Meta.  I'm almost certain if these were de-sysoped that some very loud yelps would come from these individuals and would be heard all the way at the top of the Foundation board.  It would be meaningless anyway to de-sysop Brion as he is a developer who has direct access to the server farm on an OS level with root access at that.  Indeed he is the one you run to when all else fails.  Something to consider at least with some of these individuals.  In the past some people became admins on Wikibooks simply because we were short on even having anybody experienced capable of serving in this capacity, and some admins from other projects were brought in to help out from time to time.  Being an admin on another project is no longer a major advantage to becoming an admin on Wikibooks anymore.  There are also some people who collect adminships like souviners and try to become admins on all Wikimedia projects for some reason.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:11, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:::::I hope we can agree that we don't want to give out sysop powers to souvenir hunters! Also, I hope we can agree that where there is a specific reason why a non-active editor may need sysop status (possibly because they are a developer), we should respect this. Maybe after 6 months of complete inactivity we ask the individuals via email whether they have any reason for wishing to retain sysop status. If they don't reply within a month, say, or if they reply to say there is none, then desysop them. If there is a reason then leave them with sysop status until a year is up and if they haven't become active again by then, desysop them, unless there are special reasons (eg required for development, which even then could be confirmed every six months - after all, if we make a mistake here, it can be quickly rectified by a bureaucrat). Also, maybe declare &quot;inactivity&quot; to be fewer than 10 edits, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:08, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:: Rob, I wasn't talking about Brion Vibber, I don't know why are you pointing him. I showed 8 people who in my opinion should be de-sysopped - and I'm talking only about these 8 people. I'm completely not interested who are Maveric149 and Eclecticology and you are unfair talking who they are, not what they have done ''here''. Eclecticology has done completely nothing and I'm convinced he/she is not familiar with our policies. Maveric149 has been inactive for 10 months - I think that's enough. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:00, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:::I mentioned Brion only because he is currently on the list of inactive admins, not because he was on your particular list.  The others I mentioned only because they are well known and will likely protest a desysop move unless this policy is affirmed clearly by the Wikibooks community as a whole and enforced for all admins.  We may be surprised, however, and have them not object to being desysoped as well, and it is possible to get their attention at the moment on other Wikimedia projects.  Mav was very instrumental in building Wikibooks before I got here, and helped to build many of the structures on Wikibooks that make Wikibooks largely what it is today.  He is now doing many other things for the Wikimedia Foundation, but Wikibooks does need to thank him for what he did accomplish.  BTW, Wikiversity was also substantially his idea as well, to cite another significant contribution of his.  Why he hasn't made a contribution to Wikibooks for more than 10 months is something I can only speculate about.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

After noticing an admin's inappropriate comments on a user's talk page, I wondered how admins regulate themselves. Is there any place where discussions happen to remove admins who are not just inactive, but violating other &quot;expectations&quot; of a sysop? I'd like for this discussion to actually turn into something, so do we contact someone on Meta regarding removing rights or what? Should we hold a tally for each person we wish to remove or not? -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 05:27, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:Although I don't know of a single case where an adminship has ever been removed during the whole history of Wikibooks for any reason (even self-nominated), there is a process to nominate an admin for deadminship on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]], where you can mention the user and state your case why you think they are abusing their role as an administrator.  I don't know why the deadminship section was removed, and that is just an oversight from some cleanup.  See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship&amp;oldid=47700 this archived page from July 2004] that shows the deadminship section was always intended to be on this page.  Nomination can happen from any user on Wikibooks (although a registered user is likly to be taken more seriously).  Mind you, deadminship does not necessarily mean having the account blocked as well, just that you feel the user is abusing their position as an admin.  Once community concensus about the issue has been reached and the conculsion is to remove the sysop privileges, it is a trivial act to get the attention of the Stewards, any of which can remove the status as a formal procedure.  This can be done on [[Meta:Requests for permissions#Admins for Wikibooks]].  Note the Meta page is for notification of discussion resolution, not a place to carry on the debate, although you can certainly request assistance from the Stewards if you think things are getting very out of hand and you are being stoped and blocked from even being able to add a nomination (or having it reverted) to the request for deadminship section.  I put up [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship&amp;oldid=201952 a request for deadminship] earlier but it was removed due to the previous discussion, and I accepted that decision at the time.  You are certainly welcome to add those names or other back for the same reason.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:30, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

== Dealing with the Wikibooks Help pages ==

I started a VfD earlier regarding the deletion of the redundant help pages that are also found on Meta.  The resulting VfD discussion has been rather divisive of the whole community, although it seems to break down on older vs. newer users.  I'd like to try and reformulate the whole discussion into something a little bit more pro-active and talk about what we would like to see on Wikibook for the user help system, including the &quot;Editing Help&quot; link that appears on the editing page.

[[Help:Wikibooks]] has a good collection of useful links to Wikibooks specific content, and I was thinking that perhaps this ought to be the primary page for all other help content on Wikibooks, including links to content on Meta and other Wikimedia projects as well.  Other Wikimedia sister projects have their own customized help pages, particularly Wikipedia.

Most of this content I would like to see kept in the Help namespace, as it is to be useful to new users.  I would also like to see this to be original (to Wikibooks) content.  My feelings about [[Help:Editing]] and other similar pages I hope are well known enough by now.  This can be improved, and I would like to perhaps get a group together that could help with the development of this (very much needed) content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:29, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

:Check the example of [[Wikisource:Help:Contents]]. Wikisource recently upgraded their project-specific help. There is a link from [[Wikisource:Help:Contents]] to [[MetaWikipedia:Help:Contents]]; the mirror help pages at Wikisource are mostly ignored and they seem to be forming a [[Wiki:WalledGarden|walled garden]]. There are also conflicts: [[Wikisource:Help:Introduction]] is an introduction specific to Wikisource, but it occupies the space where one would mirror [[MetaWikipedia:Help:Introduction]]. If you edit an English Wikisource page and click &quot;Editing help&quot;, you arrive at [[Wikisource:Help:Editing Wikisource]], not any Meta page, mirrored or not.

:I think that some books would benefit from having their own editing guides. For example, [[Guide to X11]] would give the wiki markup for Unix commands, while [[NetHack]] would give the wiki markup for keyboard presses and NetHack characters.

Can anyone tell me how to link from a book to an audio file in ogg vorbis format? The file is here: [[Image:Modern_greek_vocab_1.ogg]]. I'm not sure why the result of the upload process was to make something with image: on the front, or whether that's a problem. Should it be media:? Does it matter? Looking at examples on WP, people seem to be using certain templates that don't exist here on wikibooks. I would like it to show up the way you see sound links on WP, with a speaker icon, so that clicking on the link plays the sound in your browser. Also, I'd be interested in opinions on whether what I'm doing is even a good idea. This for the modern greek wikibook, and the recording is me saying some Greek words that are introduced in the first lesson. I'm not a native Greek speaker, but I think my pronunciation is at least understandable, and reasonably correct, although accented. My philosophy would be that the recording could be explicitly marked as being made by a non-native speaker, with an invitation for native speakers to replace it with something better. However, my wife is a language teacher, and is scandalized that I would do this, since I'm not a good enough speaker, and she feels it will mislead people. Any opinions?--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 17:21, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

Yes, &quot;5&quot; is certainly *closer* to &quot;20&quot; than &quot;1&quot;.
Is it obsessive to want these little bugs fixed?

:To be honest, when I do a search for content on MediaWiki servers, I prefer to use google using the '''site:''' tag, such as this URL:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=salad+site%3Awikibooks.org

==Ref Physics Electromagnetism:Electromagnetic induction==

You say that.

'Remember: the magnetic field must increase or decrease in intensity perpendicular to the wire (so that the lines of flux &quot;cut across&quot; the conductor), or else no voltage will be induced:'

If this is the case how does a transformer work when all then lines of flux are in the Iron core and do not 'cut' the conductors?

== Requesting Content in a book ==

I am quite new to Wikibooks, and really think that it is an excellent initiative. I am busy writing a book, [[Western Music History]], and would like to know if there is any way of requesting or 'advertising' for someone to submit pictures or other multimedia content, or am I to simply await another's own compulsion? Also, as I am progressing through the exercise of creating this wikibook, I am finding that it may eventually become suitable as a textbook for Wikiversity. Am I able to add this book to wikiversity as well as having it under the Arts:Music bookshelf? [[User:Ralfe|Ralfe Poisson]] 09:04, 6 February 2006 (UTC)Ralfe

:You are doing just fine.  I see that you have put the name of the Wikibook up on the New Wikibook list, and have also put it on the Art bookshelf.  A few suggestions for further &quot;advertising&quot; on Wikimedia projects could include:

:*Sending an e-mail out on [[Wikibooks:Mailing lists|the Textbook-L mailing list]]
:*Adding links on related Wikipedia pages, connecting those pages to your new Wikibook.  Just make sure it really is a related link, for example don't add a link on [[w:George W. Bush]].
:*Don't forget other Wikimedia projects like [[s:|Wikisource]] or [[wikt:|Wiktionary]].  You may want to request help for adding links in their main project discussion areas.
:*I would strongly suggest that you post some message on [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Music|the Wikipedia Music Wikiproject]], where a fairly large number of people interested in music related discussions.  There are several &quot;sub-projects&quot; related to that main Music project, so you may be able to focus your audience even further there.

:Other than doing all of this, I would simply recommend that you work on developing the content of this Wikibook as best as you reasonably can.  I know this seems like a lonely job, but the better Wikibooks eventually do start attracting their own audience and get additional assistance once you have been able to get over the initial &quot;hump&quot; of having just a Wikibook stub, people will start coming in to help you out.  Ironicly, once you have quite a bit of useful content, it is easier to get more people to come and join in the effort to add even more.  It is simply getting that initial bunch of coherant text together in the first place that can be difficult.  Just don't assume that &quot;if you write it, they will come&quot; and leave just an outline for others to come and fill in the details.  Still, welcome to Wikibooks, and I hope that your Wikibook will succeed.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:22, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== Does this &quot;book&quot; belong? ==

I've been watching with interest the new books that pop up.  However, [[Rosacea]] appears not to be a text so much as a Wikipedia article at best.  But I'm new here; does this book really represent what Wikibooks is about?  [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 17:48, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

:While it does have some similarity to [[w:Rosacea]], this is just fine for the beginnings of a well developed Wikibook, but only a beginning.  I wouldn't nominate this for Book of the Month (even with some of the poor quality books that have won there, unfortunately), but this is certainly something that could become that valuable with time and effort.

:Keep in mind that if there is something that is a copyright violation that we can't have that on Wikibooks.  Copying content from Wikipedia is not necessarily a copyright violation (as it can be copied under the terms of the GFDL), but we generally discourage that practice unless you have added a substantial amount of new information here on Wikibooks.  This attempt at writing a book about Rosacea does seem to try to make that extra push to go beyond the Wikipedia article, although I would admit it needs even more work.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:06, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

::[[Rosacea]] appears to be too large for a Wikipedia article. Edit summaries acknowledge that much of the material is copy from http://rosaceagroup.org/wiki/. (A vandal blanked their main page; use http://www.rosaceagroup.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=7832 for now.) --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:50, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
:::I guess my question goes to the heart of the concept; I'm still trying to figure it out.  I understand Wikibooks as a place for books that teach you about a subject, e.g.: mathematics, or C#, or Quenya.  I see a book like this one, and I think that all it is is an expanded WikiPedia article; it isn't really a &quot;subject&quot; about which one &quot;learns.&quot;  But, then, I see more than one WikiBook about which that can be said.  Do we care about this?  If not, goodness knows there are a lot of things that I find interesting that I can write a &quot;book&quot; about.  :)  [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 14:06, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

::::Thanks for the note about this material coming from the Rosacea Group.  I had forgotten about that, and the fact that this Wikibook was put together by several of the contributors to that website you mentioned.  GFDL license was explicitly mentioned somewhere for this content, but I would have to dig around to find the mention of that.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:37, 7 February 2006 (UTC)

==Renaming a page==
Can anyone tell me how I can rename [[Modern_Greek/Reading]] to [[Modern_Greek/Lesson_1]]? Thanks! --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 00:40, 9 February 2006 (UTC)
:You can use [[Special:Movepage/Modern_Greek/Reading|this page]] to move the page to that location. All links to the old page will redirect to the new one automatically. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 03:34, 9 February 2006 (UTC)
::Keep in mind that the MediaWiki software doesn't automatically grant to privilege of moving pages to new users.  There is a time and edit count limit before you have access to that feature, although it is something that is available to any registered user once you have been on here for some time.  I am not sure what the specific limits are on that at the moment, however, and when you can use the move page.  This was disabled from brand new accounts due to malicious vandalism in the past that really made a huge mess that was also hard to cleanup for admins.  This affects all Wikimedia projects.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:44, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

==Comments from a newcomer==

Having come anew to this site (I've just started a book on [[Taxation in the United Kingdom]], I have a number of, what I trust will be taken as, constructive comments on the site:

#I can't immediately see what books are complete (or near-complete), and therefore particularly useful for readers.
#The Main Page isn't particularly helpful - it doesn't really say what Wikibooks is, doesn't tell you what books are complete - doesn't highlight the true textbooks (eg GCSE and A-Level guides). I'm sure it can be redesigned in a more user-friendly way.
#It's not easy to find out what wikibooks really is. The page that describes it does so in negative terms ([[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]] rather than actually explaining what it is (WP makes this mistake for almost all its policies, which never say what you should do, but what you shouldn't).
#It's not obvious to me how you are meant to find a book. Would it be useful to divide books up into &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;in development&quot;, and then subdivide them into, say - &quot;For young children&quot;, &quot;UK study guides for students&quot; (GCSE and A-Level), &quot;University subjects&quot;, &quot;Professional&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Adult-Learning&quot;?

In particular regarding the first point, f I were, say, to develop a new Main Page design to illustrate some of what I meant, would that be helpful? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 14:18, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

: I agree with you that main page is not very friendly for newcomers. I think that we should make a serious selection, leaving only best books available from the main page. It's not discrimination - all books, includings stus, will be still available in bookshelves. But lists like [[Template:Mathematics bookshelf]] should be reduced only to books which provide real help and are useful for readers (I would remove entries like [[Applied Math Basics]] and [[Real analysis]]). Because main page consists of list of such templates for all bookshelves, cleaning up these pages would also simplify main page.
: I'm thinking of lanunching a special page to gather completed books from all bookshelves. By completed I mean either having development stage of 75% or 100%, or being significantly larger than other books. Such list will serve as a separate page (useful for Card Office Catalogue and links from navigation bar) and base for templates like [[Template:Mathematics bookshelf]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:02, 10 February 2006 (UTC)
::It's a major problem that potential readers have to sort through a massive list of books that aren't really books in hopes of finding books that really are books. One problem I'd foresee with using a cutoff at 75% development stage is that it would encourage even more inflation of the development stages, which are already extremely inflated. I don't know how helpful it would be to launch a separate page, either, since the typical potential reader will probably never see that page. The real problem is that the main page makes it extremely difficult to find useful content. I think we should encourage Jguk to create the mockup of a new main page.
::One really simple change I'd suggest would be to move the ''New Wikibooks'' section down to the bottom of the main page. Every book on that list is guaranteed ''not'' to be useful to readers.
::In general, a lot of this boils down to the problem of having to evaluate which books have reached the stage where they're complete and of good quality. I don't think Wikibooks has a viable mechanism for doing this, since it lacks a critical mass of people. Maybe it would make sense to have some kind of mechanism for linking to the very best wikibooks from someplace on Wikipedia, and asking WP's membership to see if there's a consensus, in a process similar to what happens when a WP article is nominated for FA status. --[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 16:46, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:I agree 100% with Jguk. Couldn't have said it better myself.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 17:54, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

== [[Japanese/Reader/第三夜]] ==

Is this valid as a separate book, and if so can it go in the list of new books if it is moved out of the Japanese book? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 17:54, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

:A point to look at with this is that the &quot;Readers&quot; are intended to be for beginning Japanese students.  I love how the full vocabulary is listed and a cross translation between Japanese and English.  Content of this nature would also be fairly easy to translate into 3rd languages simply by the nature of the format.

:As far as being a seperate book on Wikibooks, I would like to discourage that idea, but mine is just one voice here so don't take my word as law on the subject.  This is something that compliments the Japanese Wikibook, and is a part of the curriculum for learning the Japanese langauge.  In that regard, it really needs to stay together and not get lost or misunderstood as something which needs to be put into Wikisource or removed from Wikibooks.  It should also be discouraged to simply add raw Japanese texts to the &quot;Reader&quot; section simply to have them somewhere.  All text for these readers should have some sort of instruction component to them that is meeting some sort of learning objective for people using the Japanese Wikibook as a textbook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:18, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

== Invariant Sections allowed? ==
I've written a fairly large part of the &quot;squid user's guide&quot; book, available at [http://squid-docs.sourceforge.net/ sourceforge], and would like to release the book &quot;into the wild&quot;. The current process of editing the book (docbook-sgml) is way too arduous for any users to actually contribute.

The document is already released under the gnu free documentation licence (see the copyright under the [http://squid-docs.sourceforge.net/latest/html/book1.html index page].) However, it has invariant sections that credit my previous and current employers, both of whom have given me full consent to make the document available under the GFDL - so long as the invariant sections are included.

Is there any way to release this onto wikibooks? Can I include the invariant sections in the copyright? Or is this against policy?

Thanks!

[[User:Oskarpearson|Oskarpearson]] 00:03, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

:: I suggest that you look at &amp;rarr; '''[[Wiki:WikiFarms]]''' &amp;larr; to find a place where you can start a wiki for your book.

Is it possible to do footnotes in wikibooks? I couldn't find any templates, or anything in the help pages, that seemed relevant. If there isn't already a provision for it, should I just copy some of the footnoting templates from WP?

== Gardening books, how-tos, garden category ==

Hi! Having a bit of trouble finding my way around here... rather a different structure than the wikipedia. Are there project pages here? How do I go about creating a gardening category? 

My main interest is writing &quot;how-tos&quot; about gardening techniques, such as growing particular plants, soil improvement, etc. I'm not sure if these should be all chapters in one book, or just a bunch of books within a category. I've recruited some people from web forums to help write these, so it would be nice to know what structure they should follow before starting. 

I noticed on one of the archival pages that some folks don't want to be a &quot;dumping ground&quot; for the 'pedia's how-tos. Are wikibookians hostile to how-tos? Maybe rename them &quot;practical guides,&quot; instead? [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 12:47, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:Welcome to Wikibooks!  I'm glad to see that you are interested in helping us out.  For now, you can add books of this nature to [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf]], and once there have been several that have been added we can discuss trying to create a seperate gardening bookshelf.  If you want to create a seperate section just for gardening right now within the How-to bookshelf, feel free to add it right now.  As can be seen from this main bookshelf page (not necessarily from the front page of Wikibooks) there are many How-to books already on Wikibooks.

:From personal experience, it is generally better to start a books with a strong focus and theme rather than try to write a general purpose book that can include a huge number of items.  For example, &quot;How to Grow Roses&quot; would be better than &quot;How to Garden&quot;.  Especially for the first book experience on Wikibooks, a narrow themed book seems to do better, and gives you a focus on where to proceed.  Portions of it may end up in the more inclusive Wikibook in the future anyway.

:As far as the &quot;dumping ground&quot; aspect from Wikipedia, there is a tendancy to take all content removed from Wikipedia by a VfD and dump it on Wikibooks if they can't find a place to put it.  How-to guides in particular have had this occur, as this is something which seems to come up as a regular item on Wikipedia for some reason.  As long as it fits within our guidelines (see [[WB:WIN]] for details) and as long as the material can be used under the GFDL license (no copyrighted material without permission for redistribution) you should be fine to add it here.  In general, how-to books are welcome on Wikibooks and have been a part of this project for most of the history of Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:27, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks, Rob. Still figuring out how it works here, though. Are there project pages for discussing templates, etc.? Or should that just be done on the 'pedia project pages. I was just thinking it might be nice if &quot;how to grow daylilies&quot; had a similar layout to &quot;how to grow foxgloves&quot;, etc. 

::Also, I'll ask here rather than look for somewhere else to ask: is there a shortcut tag to link a book from the 'pedia? (Similar to the w: shortcut here, I mean.) [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 18:20, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

:::Not only is there a tag for Wikibooks (it is b:page_name for Wikibooks, and b:xx: like b:de:page_name for other Wikibooks langauges when linking on other projects), but most other Wikimedia projects also have specialized templates that also include the cool ''stacked books'' logo for Wikibooks to provide a link.  See [[w:Template:Wikibooks]] for an example, and look at [[w:Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Wikibooks|some of the articles]] that have included this template.  This is a method, BTW, to add a highly visible link to some Wikibook that you are working on from Wikipedia that is also accepted on Wikipedia without looking like linkspam.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

== Wikimania proceedings, transwikiing, and related issues ==
:''See also: [[User talk:Kernigh#m:Transwiki:Wikimania05]], [[User talk:Robert Horning#Wikimania redirects]], [[MetaWikipedia:User talk:Eloquence#Wikimania on Wikibooks]], [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion#Wikimania 2005 proceedings]]''

The [[Wikimania05|Wikimania 2005 proceedings]] were being collected here on Wikibooks.  They were nominated for transwiki to Meta (though it is unclear that this is where such a collection belongs) by Kernigh; and recently Rob Horning in a flurry of activity moved over all of that content and deleted the original pages.

Whether or not this is the right way to dispense with that content, there are a few points here worth noting:

1) This was a large effort, yet the many people who cared weren't notified about it ahead of time.  For a few reasons... transwikis out of Wikibooks are rarely applied to bodies of content this size, and mainly applied to interlanguage transwikis or transwikis of fledgling content.  The procedure for suggesting modules for transwikiing is far less formal than that for deletion.  In this case, almost no one on Wikibooks was made aware that this move was taking place; there was no note on this page or on VfD.
: This was not some random book or project; it was very directly associated with the Wikimedia projects and with free knowledge.  A dozen editors had worked on over a hundred pages associated with the proceedings project, over the course of months.  None of these editors was contacted via talk page or email or mailing-list about the move-without-forwarding-address.   It might help avoid future confusion to have some sort of sanity check re: notification when large-scale changes are made.

2) There are many hundreds of external links to the pages that have now been deleted, which links are completely broken; with no record that any page ever existed there, and no simple way to find the new location; not to mention no way to access the old page histories.  

Can we please minimize this chaos?  
* Simply undeleting the pages would be simplest, until we can work out where such collections should go.  I do not know if Meta is the right place any more than Wikibooks is... but they've already been moved there. 
* Second easiest: undeleting the pages in question, and replacing them with redirect links (so as to both avoid breaking old external links and to preserve the diffs between historical revisions of pages), would resolve the most immediate issues.  
:Cheers, [[User:Sj|Sj]] 07:58, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

::Note that the Wikimania content violated at least [[WB:WIN|several Wikibooks policies]], including the following:

::*'''Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works'''
::*'''Wikibooks is not a mirror or a repository for source texts'''
::*'''Wikibooks is not for developing new Wikimedia projects'''
::*'''Wikibooks is not a soapbox'''
::*'''Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider'''
::*'''Wikibooks is not a general repository for nonfiction works'''

::: Unfortunately, you do not seem to be joking... the only points here which seem to apply are the second and the last.  Both apply to some degree, although neither is violated in the canonical sense.

::Violating even one of these is grounds not just for deletion but a speedy delete, although we do try to take some time to remove content that has been added in good faith.  
::: I regret the use of the royal we here, and your framing of this discussion as between people in different universes.  As of August 7, when the first Wikimania ended, this was ''not'' speedy deletion policy.  [[User:Sj|Sj]]
:::: With very, very few exceptions, none of the participants of the Wikimania content contributed to Wikibooks outside of the Wikimania content, and very few Wikibooks regulars participated in the development of Wikimania content.  In this regard it really is two totally seperate universes of users that are involved... which is precisely why there is such friction going on between these two groups.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]
:: Plenty of time was given to the content for the Wikimania proceedings, and dispite efforts to convince the contributors that the content didn't belong, it was expanded anyway.  
::: What kinds of efforts were made to convince &quot;the contributors&quot; that the content didn't belong?  [[User:Sj|Sj]]

:: The nail in the coffin, for me anyway, was that the content had no internal links from within Wikibooks, either from the main page, or from inside any of the current list of Wikibooks.  There was absolutely no attempt whatever to integrate this content with the rest of the content on Wikibooks, and all participation on the Wikimania content was essentially acting as a seperate project, including the adding of non-english content that also would have normally been removed and added to the other language Wikibooks projects.  
:::  This was unfortunate, and a result of not refining the goal of the resulting wikibook (is it to be a straight publication of abstracts accepted to Wikimania, by alpha of the author? a review of that literature, with bonus multimedia content of people giving audio and video presentations?)  It was difficult to figure out where to link to the proceedings from other bookshelves, as well.  The &quot;adding of non-english content&quot; [eventually with translations] is something which certainly should be acceptable for any sort of compilations.  Is there currently a policy against that?  (link?)  [[User:Sj|Sj]]
:::: As compilations of this nature are inappropriate for Wikibooks in the first place, this point is moot.  This is English Wikibooks, and there are other languages that are available for non-English content if you want to have it on Wikibooks, and it was from this perspective I made the preceeding comment.  I have no problem with the use of foreign langauge material as instructional content for learning another language.  That was not the point of the Wikimania content, however.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]

:: I wanted to also send a clear message that we don't want to have the Wikimania 2006 content on here either, and I hope that message has been sent loud and clear.  Wikimania is a cool concept, and I hope that the proceedings can be developed.  Wikibooks is not the place to do it, however, and it should never have been here in the first place.  The admins were earlier bullied into keeping this content here, and that was a wrong decision.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
::: If you have a policy point to make, please make it directly -- you have not spoken loudly or even softly in any public forum about the placement of Wikimania 2005 or 2006 content in the past months until after you moved quickly to delete vast amounts of content and edit history.  I don't know what kind of bullying you are talking about when the content was first added, or how you think &quot;the admins&quot; on Wikibooks were as a whole subjected to it; please elaborate.  If such a thing happened, it too seems not to have been discussed openly in any wikibooks forum. [[User:Sj|Sj]]
::::Since you have interrupted me several times... I complained about this on Foundation-L when this content was first added, and was bullied into leaving the content alone.

I will openly admit, however, that my current actions were prompted by [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] who started the transwiki process... and I agreed with him completely. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]

Can you just please undelete the pages and give us a deadline (for instance something around/before Wikimania 2006). We're going to finish and tidy it and afterwards some kind of redirects or warning signs could be put at the most important pages. Thank you for your effort to keep Wikibooks tidy but this was just a bit too rash and uncoordinated. There are editors who submitted content and now they have to sign in with a new account at meta and all relation between user and pages via edits is lost. Wikimania proceedings have always been a bit chaotic - this incident is a good kick behind to the editors to finally finish it but having to work without the old location and the version histories is  a pain. We just need some additional time! -- [[User:JakobVoss|JakobVoss]] 10:13, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

There are also discussions about this [[meta:User_talk:Eloquence#Wikimania_on_Wikibooks|here]].

:I want to thank Jakob for at least bringing this up in the Staff Lounge instead of trying to fight this outside of the Wikibooks commmunity.  The appropriate forum for trying to undelete content is here: [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]]  If you think that an admin has deleted something when it should have remained, this is the appropriate place to hold that discussion.  Content has been undeleted in the past, and sometimes even policy changes have happened to accomodate the undeleted content.  It should say something, however, that there is currently not a single Wikibook at the moment where the decision to remove has been questioned and is going through the undeletion process.  Typically, the discussion there can last for months before resolution although this situation is a little more unique.

:As far as giving you time... the content is all on Meta at the moment.  We havn't actually removed any content at all... just changed where it is located at.  And this wasn't a rash decision either.  The notice that the content was going to be transwikied was up for more than a month, with some considerably older comments that the content didn't belong in the first place going back over six months.  And the relationship between the users and the page edits is not lost, although it is harder to revert the content to an earlier version.  As for having to create a new account on Meta... I agree, that is unfortunate.  And that is something the Mediawiki developers are working on right now (and think they have a solution which might work to make this a thing of the past).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:07, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

== Transwiki processes in general ==
Transwikis by their current implementation remove granular histories.  You can cut and paste the history page html, but you lose the diffs and actual knowledge of what content each author provided.  How can we fix this?  [[User:Sj|Sj]]

:We can fix this by simply getting the page import/export feature working the way that the developers claim it should be working.  Presumably you should be able to get the full XML of a page including its full edit history and complete set of page diffs on each edit.  Just like a raw CVS dump can be done.  Unfortunately, we need to put a bug into the ears of the developers to get this feature working correctly.  See [[Special:Export]] for some example of how it might work, but the current export feature is just a joke.  Also note the results of accessing [[Special:Import]], which ideally would allow you to complete a transwiki including page history.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:48, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

== Conference proceedings and similar collections ==
There is a general question about where, if anywhere, one should work on producing an educational resource from the papers, talks, and tutorials given at a conference.  Either they are source materials to be left at wikisource; or digests of source materials -- sourcebooks -- which can be edited and refined over time.  In the latter case, do they belong on wikibooks?  
: The Wikimania proceedings are not a sourcebook, but the latter question about collections of sources has relevance to general Wikibooks policy.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 15:24, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

:It's out of question that they don't belong on Wikibooks. Wikimania 2005 proceedings are a ''special'' case and they have never meant to stay on Wikibooks forever. -- [[User:JakobVoss|JakobVoss]] 10:13, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

::Who decided this was a special case?  It certainly didn't get widespread support from the general Wikibooks community, just from a few active contributors and &quot;senior Wikimedia&quot; individuals.  I have repeated asked on Foundation-l about this topic, and the resounding concensus from that forum (including from at least 3 different Foundation board members) is that Wikibooks is not to be a development site for a brand new Wikimedia project.  Wikijunior and Wikiversity are explicit exceptions and moves have occured to remove both of those sub-projects from Wikibooks as well.  If you want to start something that doesn't fit on a Wikimedia project, you have three choices:

::: I believe Jakob was suggesting that this was a special case on face value, because it contains content developed by dozens of contributors to many wikimedia projects, for a purely wikimedia-focused goal, involving many editors who are obviously well-meaning.  I still have no idea why you were so eager to get this done without activating a discussion; it was a fair bit of work, as you noted; and you recognized ahead of time that there would be an outcry.  [[User:Sj|Sj]]

:::: And what would have been the appropriate forum for discussion of this, where Wikimania participants would have been aware of what was going on?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]

::*[[m:Proposals for new projects|Create a new proposal on Meta]]
::*Create a new Wikicity
::*Buy your own computer and static IP address with internet connection and start your own server.

::Wikibooks is not to be a place to start new projects of this nature, and everybody participating with the proceedings knew this.  This is not a web hosting service here at Wikibooks, and that has been policy for several years now.  The only difference between this content for Wikimania and other similar documents that have been removed from Wikibooks is merely the visibility of this content on other Wikimedia projects and the political pull of some of the participants.  By your own admission, Jakob, Wikibooks was only a temporary place to host this content.  What is temporary?  A few months?  A few years?
::: There are no 'similar documents' that have been removed from Wikibooks.  (Truly not.  Try coming up with one.)  Your repetition of 'political pull' notwithstanding, the differences with this project have nothing to do with politics, and everything to do with community identity and spirit.  You do not seem to feel any association with Wikimania, and have been treating anyone who was working on the proceedings here as though they were some sort of invading force.  I regret this; and hope you will come to see things differently.

::Given the very high visibility that Wikimania held and the fact that a Wikimania wiki was established anyway (see http://wikimania.wikimedia.org ) why could it not be started for the proceedings as well?  I'm certain that as as new proposal this would have been fast-tracked through the new project proposal process and could have been started very quickly.... much easier and paltable for the Foundation board than apparently Wikiversity has been.  If you think the new project proposal process is dying due to bureaucracy and needs to be circumvented, I would have to agree.  Dispite Jimbo's personal assurances that no project is given special status due to its association with board members, the whole of this proceedings Wikibooks is proving that to the contrary.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:48, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
::: &quot;Producing Wikimania Proceedings&quot; is not a Project in that sense.  It is a project on the scale of producing a single book; similarly easy to begin and difficult to complete.  Please do not project your sense of the new project proposal process onto this discussion.  I concur with the idea that we could start a separate wiki for academic content; this is probably a good idea.  The question of the moment remains, why was this content removed with so little politeness or sense of perspective?  Why did the work of dozens of people on hundreds of pages disappear overnight without any of them receiving a polite talk-page message?  How can we improve on the process in the future?  Do we need a process for searching google for inbound links when deleting pages, to avoid breaking popular outside-world links?  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 00:18, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
::::The Wikimania Proceedings is a serial scholarly journal (serial, because it is an annual event).  In some regards, this IMHO would have been a perfect addition to Wikiversity, especially if Wikiversity is given &quot;permission&quot; from the Wikimedia Foundation to allow some limited original research.  These proceedings, together with other similar scholarly content, need to have a specialized team of people who are capable of doing that scholarly review of original submitted abstracts and published papers with a point of view.  From this perspective, I consider this to be an attempt to start a new Wikimedia project, however.  It is precisely this major restraint on Wikiversity at the moment that I think Wikiversity needs to move out into its own space.  As far as trying to make Wikiversity a seperate project... I've done as much as I or any ordinary Wikimedia user can do to get it up and running.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:25, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

The *main* problem that you are entirely missing Robert, is that hundred of links have been broken. These proceedings were linked a lot by outside websites or blogs. Those following the links have absolutely no chance to find them back. All they get is an empty page. I think this is really something unfortunate. Since the beginning of the projects, we have tried very very very hard for this to never happen. When I joined wikipedia, the address was www.wikipedia.com for the english speaking wikipedia. When we turned www.wikipedia.org, links followed. When we later created the general portal page, the pages moved to en.wikipedia.org but redirection were always preserved so that our readers will never find a broken link, something very unpleasant on the net. In deleting even the redirections, you ruined many hours of activities, you ruined the chance to find an article which was linked only 6 months ago. On the net, this is a disastrous occurence imho. 

Now, why not preserving the redirection ? What are the arguments for not keeping them and preserving flow of information ?
Even if the proceedings are kept on meta (which I personnaly find a very stupid place to keep them), all the connexions to access them will be lost. For those who put a lot of time to organise wikimania and to have these proceedings, this is entirely heartbreaking. And I am not sure the benefits wikibooks gets in kicking out the proceedings outgrows the loss for our organisation. [[User:Anthere|Anthere]]

:I think Robert is hitting the main point spot on. The Wikimania 2005 proceedings are not within Wikibooks purview and do not belong here. Wikibooks at the moment needs some organisation so that it is clear what is on offer, how to contribute, what to contribute, etc. Re-introducing lots of text that is entirely inconsistent with the project's aims will not help in that task.

:I'm also mindful that those who wish to find information about Wikimania 2005 should be able to find it. Is there any evidence that people are in reality clicking on those links, or, if not, is it possible to look for this evidence? For instance, to give one example of the items shown in a google search sj did, there was a mailing list post six months ago. Realistically, is anyone (1) going to read that now; (2) then choose to follow a link to Wikimania? In other words, is there a real problem or just a perceived one? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:24, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

BTW, see also the VfD Discussion at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Wikimania 2005 proceedings]] --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:12, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

I want to add that I am not against a &quot;general&quot; redirection, just that adding such links would be a major pain in the a** and needed somebody with a lot of extra time... time I didn't have.  If half of the effort to complain about this content and get senior Wikimedia people involved was spent instead to create those redirects in some reasonable fashion, it wouldn't be a problem.  The main reason to delete all of the content is to keep vandals from making a mess of all of this content, and have somebody that actually cares to monitor and maintain the content.  I still strongly object to people telling me what '''''__**I**__''''' '''must''' do with my time as a volunteer.  I am not an employee who can have his chain yanked whenever somebody &quot;higher up&quot; feels I'm being lazy.  That is not a way to deal with volunteers in any organization.  If there is a percieved need to recreate some links with a redirect to where the new content can be found at, OK, that seems like a reasonable request.  Put it on a list of things to do by Wikibooks volunteers or people interested in helping out with Wikimania content.  Just don't demand that one individual must do it or somehow lose karma, adminship, or money.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:20, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:The interesting thing is that you apparently spent hours over a couple of days deleting hundreds of pages; so I'm guessing you do in fact have some free time. :)

:If you used an automated bot to do the deletions, making a redirect instead would have taken pretty much no additional time.

:If you did them manually, a little cut-and-paste shouldn't have taken much longer -- and it would take less time still to ask someone who does operate a bot to run redirects over them instead. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 20:33, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

::And automated 'bots are absolutely perfect as well?  On your undeletion spree, you undeleted several &quot;images&quot; that only included very minor text in the comments, and didn't return the images themselves.  You also undeleted several pages that were clearly marked &quot;please delete me&quot; and double redirects.  Furthermore, where should the redirect point to?  One page on Wikibooks or individually to the page where the content was moved to?  I was hoping that the VfUD would take care of deciding this issue as well.&lt;p&gt;I hate 'bots for the most part, as I think they tend to really screw things up, especially when there is a lot of personal judgement that needs to take place.  And the transwiki of this Wikimanian content was fraught with a bunch of little decisions and stuff hid away in various namespaces, some orphaned content, and pages that weren't even named Wikimania for any part of the title.  By going through this process, I also discovered some content on Meta that perhaps should be merged into the Wikimania proceedings content as well that was never on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:56, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
----
The impression that I have so far is that most Wikibookians did not know about the large number of external links pointing to [[Wikimania05]], while most Wikimania05 editors did not know about the transwiki notices that appeared on the [[Wikimania05]] for about two months.

Some of you seem to be confused about what &quot;speedy deletion&quot; means. At ''this'' wiki, any exclusion listed on [[WB:WIW]], such as the &quot;personal essays&quot; of [[Wikimania05]] ([[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not a soapbox]]), is eligible for &quot;speedy deletion&quot;, which means that it can skip the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] process. At some other wikis, for example at [[Wikicities:Wikicities:Candidates for speedy deletion]], a page does not enter &quot;speedy deletion&quot; status until after it is transwikied. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:20, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Image licenses ==

I edited [[WB:ICT]] to discourage users from use of GFDL license for images. GFDL requires full text of the license to be always provided with the image, so if you want to use only one image from Wikibooks in your paper, you'll have to print the whole license (which is not short). Creative Commons licenses don't have such problems and I gave them reccomendation. I also created {{tl|CC-self}} tag (CC-BY-SA-2.5 license) to be a friendly substitute for {{tl|GFDL-self}}. Also, there finally is {{tl|GPL}} template. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:52, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) 2.5 is the recommended license at [[Commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]], so I see no problem with recommending it here also.

: But the requirement to provide the text of the license is not the only difference between CC-BY-SA 2.5 and GFDL 1.2. Minor differences cause the two licenses to be incompatible, thus one cannot combine a CC-BY-SA work and a GFDL work into a derivative work (unless one work was multi-licensed). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

::The problem with the GPL license for images is that the definition of &quot;source code&quot; is not apparent, hence the need to rework to make the GFDL.  Unfortunately, the GFDL and the GPL are mutually exclusive and can't be used with each other (unless you dual license the content right from the start... and even that causes problems).  &lt;p&gt;I was not aware of the issues of combining CC-BY-SA with GFDL into a derivative work, as that is precisely what Wikipedia is doing... Wikipedia is GFDL and as you point out Commons has substantial quantities of CC-BY-SA images.  I was under the assumption that you could use CC images within a GFDL work but not the other way around.  The GFDL does need some serious rework from what I've seen.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:23, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

::: AFAIK, images are separate from text. You can use any license for images and GFDL license for text - combining CC images with GFDL text is ok (and, as for me, should be normal). I wrote a note discouraging use of GPL for your own work - this template should be used only for screenshots. I hope anyone is aware that screenshots of GPL software can be only licensed under GPL, '''not''' GFDL?
::: When it comes to GFDL, I don't like it. German Wikipedia is trying to move away from it (some kind of dual-licensing, I don't know), describing its clauses as &quot;idiotic&quot;. I'm not so much radical, but in my opinion GFDL license applied for images is not a free license, as it forces unreasonable restrictions (printing the whole license with the image). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:34, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

== Imaging and copyright laws ==
Hi all ! I started editing the book Oceanography - An Introduction. I base my book on lectures given in the university. The course was based on various books. I wanted to know about inserting pictures to the wikibook. 
First, if I redraw pictures with a vector graphics program  based on the pictures of those bookes, do I violet the terms of use in the book ?
Second, what about copying pictures from other websites ? 
thanks [[User:Fisheye|Fisheye]] 12:00, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

: I think redrawing is ok as long as these images are not something exclusive and uncommon. You have to decise whether an image is just a schema or original work (second one may cause problems). And copying from other webistes - don't do it unless their content is available at [[WB:ICT|free licenses]]. I reccomend you using [[commons:|Commons]], our media repository. The advantage is, you don't have tu upload any images from there here - they are treated as they were present here. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:07, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
:: Thanks alot. for the quick answering. It is giving me alot of motivation to know I am not alone here :-). Anyway how do I know if a picture is original ? I guess they mostly use schemas in sceince book, no ? [[User:Fisheye|Fisheye]] 12:24, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
: You must judge it by yourself. If something is simple and does not show anything new, I think you can safely redraw it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:26, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

::Please, if you upload a picture, include an attribution as to where you obtained the image, including if you took the image yourself.  A good weblink to the source of the image is usually sufficient to verify the copyright status of an image and there are some people who are very good at tracking down the licenses.  If you were the original photographer, you would clearly know if the work is truly original.  As far as redrawing images as a scaleable vector graphic image (doing a free-hand sketch or something similar), I've seen various ideas suggested in multi-media ethics course and several legal theories about that topic.  The real trick is to make sure that the content is somewhat different from the item you are trying to roughly copy, or is trivial by comparison.  Doing an SVG of the French Flag, for instance, would be a trivial exercise and copyright would be hard to prove (except by the French government).  Generally courts are more friendly to individuals who show creative expression, so if you do a starfish, for example, that is somewhat abstract even through you used the proportions and position of that starfish from an oceanography book as source material, you are fairly safe.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:35, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

== Anons can not create books ==

I think that non-loged in users should not be alowed to create pages in the main namespace '''except subpages of ''existing'' pages'''. The reason is that new users seem to get it wrong, and pages can get lost. Comments? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 16:21, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
:Sounds like a good idea to me. RC constantly has anonymous (and new, but that's a different issue) editors dumping all their book pages on the root, and it would be great to block it. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 17:16, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

::As it is trivial to create a new user account, I don't see what the problem is.  By stopping anon users from creating new Wikibooks pages, it provides a speed bump for new contributors to try and take notice about what they are doing and make sure that they intend to create the content and keep it maintained.  It would also stop the creation of pages like red-linked content that was copied from Wikipedia without giving any thought about how the book should be organized.&lt;p&gt;Question:  If we agree to do something like this, who do we turn the request in to?  I know this is being done &quot;on an experimental basis&quot; with en.wikipedia at the moment, but is this something we need to get general support for and throw on Wikitech-l?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:24, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

: I don't think that fact of registering would change user's behaviour. I'm opposed to such plans, because I patrol recent changes mainly looking for anon changes. I don't have time to check all registered users changes and it's easier for me to spot an edit by an anon. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:09, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
::This would be for root-level page creation (assuming it can be specified). You can still see anonymous edits of sub-pages where a lot goes down anyway. I think this is useful because it makes people think before creating some random entry somewhere. With restrictions to sub-pages, the editor has to at least put it inside something already existing. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 04:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

: There's a problem, because such templates are used twice: in normal size in bookshelves and in smaller size on the main page. Font size can be easily changed but the image won't resize. Apart from this, I think that if we insert image to every bookshelf on the main page, it will start to look like a christmas tree - even now it's a bit messy with all the development stage icons around.

== Change in the format for page deletions ==

[[User:Brion VIBBER]] has posted a note on Foundation-l that may be of interest to the admins here on Wikibooks:

I've changed how the Special:Undelete view works a little bit. The last deleted
page text is no longer displayed above the revisions list; it tended to be
rather annoying for big pages and could make things hard to deal with if the
page had hostile CSS (eg obscuring the buttons).

The revisions also now display the wiki source code by default, making it easier
to examine the code of a deleted page or copy-and-paste if necessary. Rendered
preview from there is optional.

Please copy this notification to whereever your wiki's curious sysops may be
hanging out.

:: [[MediaWiki:Talkpagetext]] contains a link to [[{{PAGENAME}}]]; thus it is broken when you edit a talk page outside of the &quot;Talk:&quot; namespace. For example, when editing &quot;Category talk:XXX&quot;, the link to the article goes to &quot;XXX&quot; instead of &quot;Category:XXX&quot;.

:: I know of no easy way to fix this. One solution might be to make the link go to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{Document {{NAMESPACE}}}}:{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

== Vote called at [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote/Naming policy]] ==

There is an ongoing vote that folks should participate in.  I have tried to make the brief summary below as neutral as I can.  However, I am a partisan in the vote and cannot guaranteed I have succeeded.  Here is the summary.

* We have been evolving toward a naming policy where only the slash convention (“Book/Chapter/Page” or “Book/Page”) is accepted  in the main (wiki) namespace.  A proposed policy was written up and a vote was taken.  The policy was not approved, but the policy was amended in light of the objections.  A [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Naming_policy&amp;oldid=347269 version] still recognizing only the slash convention in the main namespace remained a proposed policy.

* Offense was taken at cleanup notices for one or more books that did not follow the proposed policy.  A [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy|long discussion]] broke out.  The [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|current policy statement]] now contains two competing proposals.

* In an effort to start the decision making somewhere, the page [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote/Naming policy]] was started.  This is not a vote on the policy as a whole, but on whether to require the slash convention for new books.  Existing book names can, with some minor restrictions, remain unchanged.

You are encouraged to vote at [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote/Naming policy]].  Voting ends at March, 1st 00:01 GMT  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:22, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

==updating development stage==
Is it considered OK for people working on a book to change the development stage, or is that supposed to be done by a third party who's impartial? I think the Modern Greek book should be moved up from 25% to 50%, and I've done that on the bookshelf. Couldn't figure out how to do it for the main page, however.--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 19:29, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

: The box that appears on the Main Page is the template called [[Template:Languages bookshelf]]. This box also appears at the top of the [[Wikibooks:Languages bookshelf]]. The easiest way to change the status of [[Modern Greek]] is to use the ''edit template'' link in the lower-left corner of the box.

: I have already changed the status of Modern Greek to 50%, to match the status that you put on the bookshelf. Book authors can change the development stage. I think that every user knowledgeable about the book should be able to edit, so I do not want a rule that requires third parties to adjust the development stage. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:14, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

== Attention: Speedy deletion of redirects ==

:''&quot;A redirect where it is unlikely that anyone will inadventently search for a page under that name ... is a candidate for speedy deletion.&quot; -- [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]''

I, [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]], recently reduced the number of pages in [[WB:SD]] to 83 from more than 200. Many of these pages which I speedily deleted were redirects left behind after a page move. Deletion of such redirects creates the danger of broken links. Some users seem to have the impression that preserving redirects is always important. I counter that our old URI at http://textbook.wikipedia.org/ is broken.

In particular, '''I am deleting redirects when the module name does not include the book name.''' Many of these redirects were chapter names, thus they were confusing and misleading, for example &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Index]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (to [[Wings 3D: User Manual/Index]]) and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Good coding procedures and adherence to standards]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (to [[Web Development/Good coding procedures and adherence to standards]]).

However, some redirects are a result of ''name change in a book'', for example, [[A-Level Computing]]*, [[Guide to UNIX]], and the subpages of those two redirects, and the obsolete hierarchies of [[Talk:A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Archive 3|A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Open Source OSs]]* and [[Talk:A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Archive 1|A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/Proprietary OSs]]*. There are also &quot;shortcut&quot; redirects like [[BSD]], [[DBT]]*, and [[LD]]*. (The * indicates modules listed in [[WB:SD]].)

I do not think that we can keep so many redirects in our current state. I think that we have two options concerning '''redirects cause by name change in a book''':
# Delete such redirects - but we need to be careful whenever a user opposes a naming change to a book.
# Establish a registry for allowed redirects, but delete the others. For example, [[DBT]], [[LD]], and the subpages of [[A-Level Computing]] and [[A Level Mathematics]] might be listed as allowed redirects.

Should we delete these redirects, or do we allow some of them? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:03, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:I'd ask for caution. Unfortunately &quot;what links here&quot; only lists links in WB, not on the other WM areas. Deletion of redirects here might end up causing red links on the other sites. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 12:39, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
::That is psuedo red link.  Interwiki links are always blue (at the moment) because it takes too much computing power to check the link within the MediaWiki software, and some interwiki links (like [[uncyclopedia:Main Page]]) don't even go to Wikimedia projects.  Still, see my remark about broken links from external sites below: --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:42, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

This is an issue where the culture and practice on Wikipedia is running into a brick wall here on Wikibooks.  On Wikipedia, it doesn't really matter if a complete nonsense page name like [[Contents]] is redirected to somewhere else.  Indeed, it is the nature of Wikipedia that encourages redirects and the more that an article has... either misspellings or related terms to a topic the better &quot;connected&quot; the article becomes.

On Wikibooks, however, the seeming range of possible links soars to unmanageable numbers and it is difficult to try and determine just how far to go and be reasonable.  The other issue is that redirects really do need to be watched and maintained just like any other page on Wikibooks.  That is fine if you are talking just 5 redirects to one article, but if you do a title change on Wikibooks with a 50 module book (not uncommon), that one rename (even if just to change naming conventions) is now 50 or even more redirects that have to be added to a watch list, or vectors that a vandal can deal with.  Indeed this is a vandal vector that is being completely ignored at the moment, and something our current tools can't deal with.  (See [[bugzilla:5040]] for a suggested change that would help here.)

There is a point that redirects become simply absurd, and at that point it seems to be obvious that they should be a speedy delete candidate.  At the same time, it is very hard to determine (just as the recent uproar over Wikimania content has shown) if a particular page or redirect actually has something linked to it from outside of Wikibooks.  It is especially these pages that are linked which we need to be careful with, so people coming to Wikibooks will know where the content has been moved to, with the usual double redirect issues as well.

I'm not so sure what to do with pages like [[Periodic Table]] that point to modules within a Wikibooks as a redirect.  This is really where the difference between Wikipedia and Wikibooks is huge.  We may not have a single periodic table on this project, and some minor forking of content like this is reasonable under the circumstances where two different Wikibooks would have very different goals for what they want to emphasize on this same subject.  Wikipedia deals with this through disambiguity pages, although this has been seldom done on Wikibooks.  Generally the approach here has been to jump to [[Main Page]] and try to choose a Wikibook, or run through one of the bookshelves instead to find the content you are looking for.  Randomly typing in a word to get to a page is not done too often, as you are unlikely to actually get an article hit on the term.  Modules having the word within the text, but not the word itself as a module name.  Yeah, this is a tough issue.  I need to give some more thought on it as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:42, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

==Internal medicine==

I'm sorry if i don't know well your procedures, I promise will learn them soon. The page [[Symptoms and Signs in Endocrinology]] has been copied from [[W:Ximelagatran]] an is absolutely off topic. bye [[User:The Doc|The Doc]] 11:49, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

: Speedy delete? (I don't know how to mark for that...) [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 13:09, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:: You can mark it with '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|state your reason here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' if you want to speedy delete something on Wikibooks.  It will then get a quick review by one of the administrators and likely deleted if they agreee with your reasoning.  Blatent forking of Wikipedia content is grounds for deletion, unless you are adding substantially new material or the Wikipedia page is going to be cut down to get below the 32K limit of articles.  I'll look at this page, however.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:57, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Fair Use Policy]] request for comments ==

I started this page in response to a huge discussion on Foundation-L about copyrights and specifically fair use issues on various Wikimedia projects.  In particular, [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2006-February/006065.html this reply from an administrator] at the Italian Wikipedia got my attention as something that perhaps we ought to consider here on Wikibooks as well.  The actual Italian Wikipedia policy can be found here:  [[w:it:Aiuto:Copyright immagini#.28d.29_Fair_use]]

Doing some digging around, here are some other &quot;policies&quot; that are related to this to consider perhaps where to take this policy, and some things to consider with regards to this policy:

*[[Wikibooks:Image use policy]] - where a small section on fair use is already present
*[[w:Wikipedia:Fair use]] - the current guidelines on en.wikipedia.  Note how unlike it.wikipedia they only make this a guideline and allow much more freedom to the authors.
*[[w:Wikipedia:Fair use criteria]] - going into more of what policy actually is on en.Wikipedia for fair use content

We've had a bit of discussion about this on the VfD pages as well, and I think there is a basic misunderstanding of the role of fair use within this project.  You can't simply copy a bunch of stuff from other web page elsewhere on the internet and claim to use them within a Wikibooks module under fair use considerations.  This is an attempt to narrow the focus of what is acceptable, and to make the content of Wikibooks more universally available, especially to countries other than the USA.

This is just a call to review what I've put down here.  Feel free to completely overhaul this page as you see fit, as nothing is sacred on this at the moment.  I would like a serious discussion about this topic, however, and you are welcome to be critical on the [[Wikibooks talk:Fair Use Policy]] page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:21, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

Hi! Would be good to get more feedback and ideas from a range of Wikibooks users to the ongoing discussion [[Wikibooks talk:Annotated texts#New discussion|here]].

:I'd think the programming bookshelf makes the most sense.  By the way- can you look up my talk page and explain what I divert socket is?  I've done some networking work and a decent amount of unix programming, and I've never heard of them.  I'm curious.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:57, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

== main page is a big ontological pile up ==

hi. I posted at the main page discussion regarding this. I have been eyeing wikibooks for a while now, but i can never get past the main page. Frankly, i understand that essentially what has happened is an organic sort of start up. But it looks like disordered chaos.
Rather than just make noise, I copied the main page to my user talk box, and there, proceeded to make a list of reasonable headings for new &quot;book Shelves&quot;, Considering what your content actually is.

Obviously, I am talking about a very serious re-organization of the main page. I was able in my early game to cut and paste away most of the books in the environmental sciences area in only about a half hour or less. This won't take a lot of time, and could be mostly painless, especially if done elsewhere and then troubleshot and then &quot;moved&quot; in.

=== [[w:fr:Accueil]] ===

I like the french wikipedia main page. The little icons the compact layout etc. pp. It would mean reducing the front page books dramaticly. I think that would be good - but can only be sustained if the template are protected so new books can only be added by the administrators.  But are we ready for such a step? 

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:16, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

----

We certainly need a major overhaul of the main page. I was going to propose one myself, but found things so cluttered already, that I couldn't really see how to structure a new main page without finding out what is really in Wikibooks. I have begun some re-ordering, and started a new list of all books on [[Wikibooks:List of all books]]. I'm going through all pages on here, tidying things up so that all book pages start with the name of the book, and marking the redirects for deletion. It's taking some time, but only then will I be sure of where to go.

Incidentally, it seems odd that if you type in http://www.wikibooks.org the first thing you see is link to the Old English wikibooks. We probably need to change that page ''à la'' what happened with http://www.wikipedia.org, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 10:12, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

==Wikiresearch==

I note that {{bad link|Agile Programming Language}} claims to be a {{bad link|Wikiresearch}} project (and also that ''wikiresearch'' is a red link). I thought we dealt in textbooks rather than research. Am I wrong, or should this book go to vfd (or be speedily deleted)? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:53, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
: No discussion is necessary, this is a perfect example of original research (being by definition candidate for speedy deletion). We are not a place to discuss and develop new programming language. I will write to the contributors to copy source of the book because we are deleting it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:34, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

::This is an ideal opportunity to invite the development or project team to move their documents or discussion or whatever to Wikiversity's School of Computer Science!  If it is a serious team that develops useful standards, introductory material, tutorials, etc. it could really help launch Wikiversity.  Particularly if they start comparing and contrasting with other local materials for the eddification or input of other participants.  If it is actually an original language development in progress and they succeed at the Wikiversity .... well every innovation and gold rush in human history requires a few visible successes to reach critical mass or a tipping point.  If they are not the initial critical mass for us, then at least they will be ready and waiting to help absorb the public web traffic when some other participants at Wikiversity achieve fame, utility and slash/dotting. Thanks in advance for your valuable assistance in launching Wikiversity while avoiding the ire and bad press of spurned contributors at Wikibooks. [[User:70.110.35.3|70.110.35.3]] 11:38, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

There is some discussion going on with the [[Wikiversity]] proposal to include original research under some limited conditions.  As I suggested above with the Wikimania content, I think having a Wikiversity sponsored set of pages for some topics of this nature might be the one thing that can really set Wikiversity apart from Wikibooks, and realisticly require a completely seperate server with a seperate group of administrators and editors.  I mention Wikimania specifically because it is common for a University group to sponsor and organize scholarly conference proceedings.  I was actually involved at one point in developing a CD-ROM full of hyperlinked conference proceedings for [http://www.calico.org/ CALICO] about 10 years ago, and even presented a couple of papers there as well.

I realize that the real reason for the &quot;no original research&quot; is mainly to get rid of the UFO and alt.science groups (like free energy and perpetual motion machines) from contributing.  A bureaucracy of some sort needs to happen if formal reasearch is to occur, mainly to weed out the really silly and far out proposals.  When Wikipedia (and Wikibooks as well) was just starting out, the project participants simply weren't ready to deal with these issues and justifiably tried to stay away from the whole mess in the first place.  There are enough legitimate scientists and scholars participating now that it may be time to get something like this going.  It is however going to require some new policies that I think are better left alone within the context of Wikibooks, and we should simply stick to writing textbooks here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:21, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

== Highly ambitious books ==

I noticed recently that there are red links on the Natural Sciences bookshelf:
* M-theory
* Quantum mechanics
* Quantum chromodynamics
* Quantum electrodynamics
* Quantum field theory
* String theories
Since these links are red, I suppose they belong in [[Wikibooks:Requested Wikibooks]], but I'm going to claim that they don't belong there either.

I'm sorry if I come off as a naysayer, but we just can't write these books. We're struggling with introductory texts as it is. Leaving them on the bookshelf or the requested list implies that we ''might'' write them in the near future, and they might distract people who would otherwise work on more feasible projects. These books would need writers with an almost unrivaled understanding of physics. I'm going to ''be bold'' and delete these links entirely. [[User:Brian Brondel|Brian Brondel]] 03:19, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

:::Please be extremely careful deleting Quantum mechanics .... in fact perhaps you should run some searches on modern physics or related keywords.  There is a very comprehensive modern physics book with links to other volumes such as what you list above.  It would be unfortunate if you deleted some University Physics Department's efforts to join or utilize Wikibooks as a collaboration zone for textbooks or class notes.  Please keep in mind that a single student or instructor eventually talks to most of the people in his department or specialization over a period of a few years.  Apparently related links:
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Modern_Physics:Quantum_Mechanics:Contents
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Modern_Physics:Symmetry_and_Quantum_Mechanics
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Quantum_programming

* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/String_theory
::: There were another ten pages of links resulting from a search on quantum but you get the idea.  About one link in five had significant text and equations that did not look trivial to code in html.  Maybe when we get the en.wikiversity.org domain operational incomplete materials can start there and copies fork to the bookshelf when texts are ready for general public use.  [[user:lazyquasar]]


: By the way, there are also red links on the Mathematics bookshelf. These might be less impossible to write, but I wouldn't know. I'll leave those for someone else to work out. I think I've been enough of a wet blanket for today. [[User:Brian Brondel|Brian Brondel]] 05:43, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

:: Red links are not allowed on the bookshelf templates and are only allowed in &quot;suggested books&quot; sub-chapters on the normal bookshelfes.

:There is nothing inherently difficult about writing an introductory quantum mechanics textbook for someone with a PhD in physics, in fact anyone who has studied physics at bachelor level in the last ten years must surely have passed a number of exams in the subject (I did and that was nearly thirty years ago).  Surely it should still be on the requested books list.  If I were a student and I wanted a book it would seem strange to me to have my request removed simply because there was no one currently willing and able to write it.  I agree that it doesn't belong on the bookshelf but there is nothing in the requested books list that implies that the books will be written.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 17:02, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

::If you're talking about a book aimed for beginning undergrads or nonscience majors, I agree that's something we might be able to do. I consider writing any textbook to be a difficult task, whether it's about quantum chromodynamics or basketweaving. I've taken a quantum class and passed tests myself, but that doesn't at all mean that I can write a textbook on it. I think writing even a low-level quantum textbook will be a major challenge, even for a Physics PhD. I'll believe we can write a QCD textbook when I see it. --[[User:Brian Brondel|Brian Brondel]] 18:39, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

:I have no problem with deleting red links on bookshelves, they ought to be gone.  But I disagree that those topics can't be done.  Quantum mechanics is only a sophmore level class.  I had to take it as a computer engineering major.  In fact, anyone who passed the Physics C (with calculus) AP test generally took it their first or second semester of college.  Its not simple material, but it hardly requires a phd to produce.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:38, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
::Most red links on bookshelves date back to when Wikibooks was still trying to come up with a basic structure about what kinds of books might be written here.  It is still a good idea in terms of trying to come up with some potential areas of growth, but I think [[Template:New]] has plenty of nice book ideas now that the need to completely make up nothing but new book titles is more something in the past.  Often now on the various bookshelves have red links in part because the Wikibooks in red are deleted content rather than a suggested title, and those should have the red link removed.  The bookshelf is usually the very last thing to be deleted when removing a Wikibook (due to a VfD or whatever), and is (unfortunately) often neglected by admins.  If you see this happening, help us out, please, and simply delete the book title!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:08, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Topography==

Southeast Asia extends from the Tropic of Cancer to south of the Equator, and from the Himalayan foothills of Burma to the tropical islands of the Philippines and Indonesia, a distance of more than 6,000 km west to east. It encompasses a wide variety of habitats, and is the meeting place for species from two continents. Burma, Thailand, Indochina and most of Malaysia mark the southernmost limit for Asian species, and the islands of eastern Indonesia, including western New Guinea, lying on the Australian continental shelf, contain many Oceanian species. This warm, fertile region contains some of the wildest places still remaining anywhere in the world, both on land and in the seas.

Overview of biome:
[http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/se_asian_rnfrst.htm]

===Dynamics===

The region has long been a focus for case studies of evolution and the impact of economic growth on the integrity of tropical forests.  This really began when Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) travelled widely in the region.  He was the co-publisher with Charles Darwin (1809-82) of the theory of natural selection, coming to the same conclusions as Darwin by recognising a clear-cut division of species distribution in the area. 

During the last ice age the countries of mainland tropical Asia and the Greater Sunda Islands - Sumatra, Borneo and lava - were connected by dry land; they were separated as melting ice caused sea levels to rise again. Before this wildlife was able to move along the land bridges, and the islands still have plant and animal species in common with those of the mainland, characterized by tall dipterocarp trees and by monkeys, native deer and hornbills. These habitats, together with their plants and animals, fall within the Indomalayan biogeographical region.

By contrast the islands of eastern Indonesia - Irian Jaya (western New Guinea), Kai and Am - lie on the Australian continental shelf and belong within the Oceanian biogeographical region. Here there are mound-building birds, bowerbirds, parrots and birds of paradise, while wallabies take over the ecological niche of deer.

Wallace's dividing line, separating these two biogeographical regions, runs through the islands between Bali and Lombok, Borneo and Sulawesi, and Palawan and the rest of the Philippines. Still recognized as the biogeographical boundary for many families of plants, and of birds, mammals, insects and other animals, it is a reminder of Southeast Asia's dynamic geological past.  On the edges of these two biogeographical regions the islands of Sulawesi, the Philippines, the Moluccas and the Lesser Sundas form a mixing ground for plants and animals from both east and west. They include many species that are found only here.

Southeast Asia was created between 15 and 3 million years ago when outlying fragments of ancient drifting supercontinents collided in the vicinity of the island of Sulawesi. Moulded by its geological past, at a crossroads for animal and plant migrations, the region has some of the most spectacular and diverse tropical habitats in the world. These range from muddy coastal mangroves and peat swamp forests to moss-draped cloud forests and shrubby alpine plant communities.  There are tall, lowland dipterocarp (two-winged fruited) forests The tops of these giant dipterocarp trees do not overlap. One explanation for this &quot;crown shyness&quot; is that it inhibits the spread of leaf-eating caterpillars. It also allows light to penetrate through the trees, and has led to the evolution of jumping and gliding mammals and reptiles.  The eastern islands have palm-thick jungles. There are tidal wetlands and multicoloured crater lakes of still-active volcanoes; craggy limestone hills with spearlike pinnacles and vast underground cave systems to harsh, nutrient-poor heathlands.  The cloudy moss forest at 3,500 m in Northern Borneo is one of the wettest places on Earth, and in the highlands it is also very cold. The trees are stunted, being no more than 10 to 15 m (30 to 45 ft) high; as there is only a single canopy layer enough light penetrates to promote the growth of hanging lichens, mosses and other epiphytes, as well as ground plants.  Lava and ash on a volcanic peak weather to a fertile soil, the radiating ridges and channels formed in the lava flows are colonized by wind-blown seeds, and vegetation begins to cover the mountainside.

==Human settlement==

The region has had a long history of human settlement, and people have left their mark on the landscape. The open rolling grasslands of Thailand, east Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands, which extend from Bali to Timor, are great swathes of once forested land that was cleared for agriculture a long time ago and subsequently abandoned.  Traditional peoples living at low densities were once able to practice shifting cultivation in ecological balance with their environment. The Land Dayaks of Borneo, the Muong people of Laos and the hill tribes of Burma all cleared land, grew their crops and then let the land lie fallow for several years before returning to cultivate it again. As human populations have grown and remote areas have been opened up for new settlers, more forest areas have been cleared, often on vulnerable lands with nutrient-poor soils. These fields may provide crops for a year or two, but with regular burning they cannot return to secondary forest.

Eventually these abandoned fields become a sea of alang-alang (cogon) grasslands. These are becoming increasingly common throughout tropical Asia. The tough, tall grass is difficult to supplant, has little value except for new grazing and thrives on burning. Fires sweep through the grasslands, destroying adjacent plantations of newly planted trees and eating into the natural forest.

The demands of agriculture now place tremendous pressures on wilderness areas in the region. Forests are being felled by farmers who cultivate the land and then move on, for plantations, and to satisfy the world's seemingly insatiable appetite for hardwoods. Tropical rainforests are disappearing at an alarming rate. Malaysia, where an estimated 230,000 ha (570,000 acres) are cut down every year, will lose all its remaining forest during the 1990s if this rate continues.

Forests have also been lost as a consequence of war, as in Vietnam where 2 million ha (5 million acres) of forest and mangroves were sprayed with herbicides such as Agent Orange during the conflict with the United States between 1964 and 1975. In Borneo large areas have been lost to forest fires, which consumed 3.6 million ha (8.9 million acres) in Kalimantan, in the center and south of the island, and another million in Sabah in the north during the drought year of 1983. Fires started by farmers practicing shifting cultivation raged out of control and were spread by the underlying coal and peat seams; they swept through forests that had already been logged, and damaged the edges of primary forest. In 1987 east Kalimantan was a sea of fire again until the flames were quenched by the late monsoon rains.

Most countries in Southeast Asia have already lost at least half their forest cover. In densely crowded Java only 9 percent of the island remains forested. Even on Borneo, renowned for its vast tracts of tall dipterocarp and swamp forests, the forest boundaries are being pushed back farther and farther inland and every major river is congested with floating logs. Until people throughout the world become aware of the threat and there is a dramatic reduction in the use of tropical hardwoods, the destructive deforestation of Southeast Asia will continue.

Sometimes the need for conservation is understood only too well by the local people but ignored by governments and business interests, more concerned with short-term profit than the long-term cost of environmental folly. The Penan of Sarawak, hunter-gatherers who harvest wild meat and a few minor forest products for their own use, are now building blockades to halt the timber trucks of the companies that are destroying their traditional lands. Local people, struggling for a livelihood from shifting cultivation, are often blamed for starting the fires that lead to forest losses, but the areas that burn most intensely are those that have already been logged.

Many countries in the region are suffering the environmental consequences that follow the loss of natural landscapes -droughts where there was once rain, floods sweeping down deforested valleys, and erosion of coasts and hillsides. Lowland habitats, particularly on the fertile alluvial lands along river valleys, are the first to disappear. Swamps, mangroves and wetlands are drained for development and agriculture, forests are cleared, limestone hills are quarried for cement, coral reefs are burned for lime and damaged by blasting to kill the fish.  As these habitats are lost, so too are the benefits they provide: natural products, fish nurseries, coastline and watershed protection. 

==Politics of logging==

The politics of conservation in South East Asia first captured the World’s attention when the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad threatened to boycott the 1992 United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED) in Brazil because of what he saw as &quot;abuse&quot; of Third World Countries from First World environmentalists.  This situation was reviewed by William Steiff in the November 1991 issue of ‘Monitor’ with an article entitled Deforesting Malaysia

The original article by Steiff may be viewed from here:
[http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1991/11/front.html]

This perceived affront seemed to focus on a book published the previous year by Philip Hurst entitled Rainforest Politics: Ecological Destruction in South-East Asia.  Hurst presented six case studies of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Burma.  From personal experience of the area he set out the human and economic consequences of forest destruction.  His analysis revealed that its causes are rooted in an exploitation of natural resources for western markets going back to colonial days.  In addition, a range of other factors play a role including land hunger of small farmers deprived of their traditional farming lands, wrongly conceived development strategies and the pressures of foreign debt. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it was received wisdom in the development agencies that the main pressure on tropical forests came from the poor.  Many NGOs put a lot of effort into demonstrating the links between deforestation, landlessness and poverty and the processes of land and wealth concentration, which were in turn driven by macro-economic forces and global trade. They called for secure tenure for indigenous peoples and participatory agrarian reforms for peasants to address the linked problems of ecological injustice and deforestation.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that forest loss caused by logging was far more than had previously been thought. NGO case studies showed how the demands of the timber, and later paper and pulp, industries were heavily simplified and degraded both boreal and temperate forests.  They also exposed the corruption in the timber industry, explored the political ecology of forest loss and drew attention to the activities of migratory loggers who have been expanding their operations out of South-East Asia and posed an increasingly serious threat to the world’s forests. 
 
===WWF and World Bank Alliance===

In 1997, the World Bank and the WorldWide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced the establishment of a new ‘Alliance’ to be shaped around a joint strategy designed to meet the WWF’s dual campaign targets of ‘setting aside’ 10% of all major forest ecosystems as protected areas and bringing an additional 200 million hectares of the world’s forests under sustainable forest management, both by the year 2005.  The alliance brought together the WWF’s abilities to work with a wide range of ‘stakeholders’ and the financial power of the World Bank.  It was important to visualise what was actually happening to forests on the ground. Improved data about rates of deforestation have also sharpened concerns about whether these targets are realisable or even too modest. Revised FAO and WRI figures suggest that forest loss at this time was still accelerating with global annual loss now estimated at 15 million hectares per year. 

According to World Bank/WWF projections, by 2050 a further 200 million hectares of the world’s total 3.2 billion hectares of forests would be lost to agriculture, while to service a projected demand of 3 billion cubic metres of industrial roundwood per year, up to half of the worlds’ remaining forests will be subject to logging at an intensity of 2 cubic metres/ha/year.  This may be taking logging up to the limits, as according to one study up to half of all forests are likely to remain inaccessible to logging for the foreseeable future.
 
An ‘Intensification Model’ was therefore put forward by the WWF/World Bank Alliance to meet market demands – a ‘model’ which corresponded closely with the Bank’s existing forest policy.  Under this model, 200 million hectares of forests would still be ineluctably lost to agricultural expansion, but intensive management of silviculture and plantations, on 600 million hectares of forest yielding up to 5 cubic metres of roundwood per hectare per year, would service the global market, potentially freeing an additional 900 million hectares of forest for additional protected areas, while still leaving a further 1.5 billion hectares of forests relatively inaccessible and untouched.

This alliance and the outcomes it predicted were critically reviewed by Marcus Colchester in 2000.

In May 2005 the WWF and the World Bank renewed their Alliance for Forest Conservation and Sustainable Use (Forest Alliance) with a programme aimed at reducing global deforestation rates 10% by 2010. The two organizations signed on to the Forest Alliance agreement for another five years on 26 May 2005, during the fifth session of the UN Forum on Forests. The programme was designed to support the establishment of new forest protected areas; more effective management of forest protected areas, and improved management of forests outside of protected areas. It will also facilitate regional cooperation and the adoption of policies in support of more effective forest management.

The following year (Mar 2006) the &quot;Heart of Borneo&quot; conservation initiative was officially launched today with the three Bornean governments - Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia and Malaysia - declaring their commitment to support it. The tri-country initiative aims to preserve one of the most important centres of biological diversity in the world, including approximately 220,000km2 of equatorial forests and numerous wildlife species. A recent WWF report had highlighted that 361 new species have been discovered in the last ten years.

Today, only half of Borneo's forest cover remains, down from 75 per cent in the mid 1980s. According to WWF, all lowland rainforests in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, would disappear by 2010, if the current deforestation rate of 1.3 million hectares per year continues. That's an area equivalent to about one-third the size of Switzerland. Forest fires, the conversion of forests to plantations, and logging are also driving the destruction of Borneo's forests. 

In addition, the three Bornean governments recently announced new conservation measures within the ‘Heart of Borneo’. Malaysia declared it will protect more than 200,000ha of key forest habitat in Sabah for the protection of orang-utans, elephants and rhinos. Brunei has established two conservation areas. And Indonesia has proposed a new national park of 800,000ha.

According to WWF, the Heart of Borneo initiative spells the end of plans to create the world's largest palm oil plantation in Kalimantan along Indonesia's mountainous border with Malaysia. The scheme - supported with Chinese investments - was expected to cover an area of 1.8 million hectares and would have had long-lasting, damaging consequences on the Heart of Borneo. WWF repeatedly said new oil palm plantations should be established on degraded, non-forested land. 

==East Kalimantan==

East Kalimantan was the first of Philip Hurst’s case studies, a region which occupies about 200,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. of Borneo.  In 1981 there were an estimated 173,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of forest, of which 130,000 had been designated for logging.  In the 1980s Kalimantan as a whole supplied almost one-third of the country's timber exports.  Despite this contribution to the economy the profits accrued to a small minority and did not generally improved the living standards of the local people. By 1984 Kalimantan had more than 10,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 'critical lands', a dangerous situation for an agricultural region.

As an introduction to the politics of logging Hurst presented the case of the U.S. Weyerhauser Corporation provides a good example of logging concession politics in this region at this time.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hurst’s story begins in the late 1960s when Weyerhauser's logging concessions in the Philippines were becoming unprofitable. Wishing to expand operations Weyerhauser went into partnership with an Indonesian company: the International Timber Corporation of Indonesia (ITCI). In 1971 ITCI gained rights to 386,000 ha of primary hill forest in East Kalimantan.

Weyerhauser could never buy out its partner because ITCI was a trust set up personally by President Suharto. On paper, Weyerhauser owned only 65% of ITCI but they provided the operations' total investment of US$32m.  Both parties gained: Weyerhauser had financial control over ITCI and ITCI acquired a large working capital with no investment. ITCI's major shareholders were the top 73 Generals in Suharto's 'New Order' government.  In effect the partnership was a form of pay-off from Suharto for the loyalty of Indonesia's military elite. Over the first seven years ITCI's log sales averaged US$37m annually.  In 1977, output from this one concession reached 1.6m tons of logs worth US$66m.

How much of this figure was straight profit for Weyerhauser is not clear. The forest expert, Norman Myers, estimated that for a similarly funded operation the foreign shareholder gained more than US$3m profit per year.

The ‘Three Ministers Decree’ of 1980 put pressure on all logging operations to reinvest profits in processing facilities, but this did not suit Weyerhauser who pulled out of ITCI in 1984. In short, Weyerhauser was not interested in timber processing or managing the forest after they had extracted the highest value timber, an attitude typical of foreign investment in Indonesia's timber industry at this time.  The concessionaires left behind an overcut forest and a tinderbox, which was revealed when during 1982-3 fires swept through 3.5m ha of the region.  An estimated 20 million cu. metres of timber from primary forest and a further 35 million c. metres from secondary forest were destroyed. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1993 came the report of the Southeast Asia Sustainable Forest Management Network ‘Communities and Forest Management in East Kalimantan: Pathway to Environmental Stability. This was edited by Mark Poffenberger and Betsy McGean of the Center for Southeast Asia Studies, International and Area Studies of University of California, Berkeley.  This report provides a preliminary discussion of selected research findings from the Indonesian members of the Southeast Asia Sustainable Forest Management Network. With nearly three-quarters of the country's land area officially under forest cover, national planners have viewed forest utilization as a vehicle to stimulate economic growth and as a land pool to absorb Java's growing population. Migrants seek forest land for farming. Businessmen see profit-generating opportunities. Non-government organizations perceive the richness of the cultural and biological diversity and hope to preserve it. Indigenous peoples view the forest as their ancestral home, the foundation of their traditions and their continuity.  The East Kalimantan case studies did not attempt to justify any of these views described above. Rather, the researchers reported changes in the environment and society occurring in the provincial study sites in recent years through human forest interactions. The study found that forest utilization practices by concessionaires, developers, migrants, and local populations had led to a rapid process of forest degradation, especially in high pressure areas nearer roads and urban centres. The researchers raised the question, &quot;How can Indonesia best manage its millions of hectares of degraded forest lands?&quot; They concluded that while some of this area can be developed for settlements, agriculture, and fast-growing timber plantations, a sizable majority might best be left to regenerate naturally under the protection of local communities. 

They found that indigenous Dayak communities in Datarban and Diak Lay both showed a deep knowledge of forest ecology and regenerative processes based on centuries of experience with long rotation agriculture. Traditional wisdom combined with more recent scientific experimentation indicates rapid regrowth can be achieved if cutting and burning are controlled. The productivity of valuable timber and non-timber forest products could be greatly increased through enrichment planting and other manipulations of the natural environment. The Dayaks, as well as the Kutai and migrant groups, were concerned about the future of their communities and the natural resources upon which they depend. The researchers concluded by urging planners, academics, and community development specialists to empower forest people with the legal custodial authority to heal disturbed forest ecosystems and make them once again ecologically rich and economically productive.

Illegal logging and fire have continued to be major issues in East Kalimantan for the next quarter of a century.  According to a 2006 report by Ferdinandus Agung Prasetyo and Krystof Obidzinski from the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) the East Kalimantan provincial government is losing over US$ 100 million a year in lost business tax revenue due to illegal logging and unreported timber processing. This does not include the intangible costs of the loss of biodiversity and water services. Nor the future social cost of natural disasters and loss of jobs from forest destruction. 

Demand for timber is now far exceeding the amounts that can be produced sustainably.  According to the CIFOR study, East Kalimantan's timber industry has the capacity to produce about 9.1 million cubic meters of wood a year. For all of Indonesia the capacity exceeds 60 million cubic meters. This is in stark contrast to the Ministry of Forestry's allowable cut of 5.7 million cubic meters in 2004.  The report takes a fairly standard estimate that the industry in East Kalimantan is working at only 60 percent of its potential capacity, which equates to the need for timber in the region being around 5.5 million cubic meters&quot;   Figures for the past five years show that the official quantity of log production from natural forest has been around 2.1 million cubic meters per year. Subtract this official figure of 2.1 million cubic meters from the 60 percent estimated output, and there is an apparent deficit of 3.3 million cubic meter of logs. This 3.3 million cubic meters of timber is being processed without any taxes being paid to the provincial government.  There is also the lost revenue incurred through illegal timber smuggling to neighbouring countries. This was over two million cubic meters in 2000. .  In total, undocumented timber processing and illegal logging amount to a revenue loss of Rp 856 billion a year - about $US107 million a year - half the annual revenue of the region. This is money that could be spent on poverty reduction programs, job creation schemes, new schools and health centres. 

The price of timber is decreasing despite a rise in demand for wood and a decline in the legal production of timber. Given falling supply and increasing demand, economics dictates that prices should be rising.  That prices are not going up means there is an oversupply of timber on the market, and this appears to be from illegal or at least undocumented sources. This timber costs less because the suppliers do not have to pay tax or meet the other financial obligations associated with legally producing timber.

It appears that the days of East Kalimantan being the main source of timber to Indonesia are over.  In 1974, official government statistics listed the region as producing 6.6 million cubic meters of timber. The estimate of the Ministry of Forestry for 2004 is only 1.6 million cubic meters.  The decline in output is due to a number of causes. These range from the 1997/98 forest fires and recent land use changes, through to unsustainable and illegal logging, which is also contributing to the steady deforestation of East Kalimantan.
There are many issues underpinning illegal logging. One of them, but not the major one, is the lack of law enforcement.  The most significant underlying cause of illegal logging is the client-patron relationship. Illegal logging is difficult to eliminate because both suppliers and purchasers benefit from the profitability of the trade, especially by evading tax.

Current timber prices are reaching as low as US$45-50 per cubic meters. These levels are bound to make legal timber production unprofitable. Another reason for the low prices is that workers involved in illegal logging earn much less than legal workers because of their poor bargaining position.

The authors of the report suggest a number of solutions to the illegal logging problem.  Restructuring the timber industries, increasing the supply of timber from plantations and improving the management of natural forest would reduce illegal logging and slow down deforestation. Other solutions include making timber industry regulations more transparent and improving law enforcement practices. 

Forestry is the main source of livelihood in East Kalimantan. If illegal logging is not properly addressed, Prasetyo and Obidzinski predict unemployment in the region will increase due to the short-term benefits and unequal distribution of profits from the business of illegal logging will harm the environment and the economic future of the region.  

In 2005 the system for verifying the legality of timber known as the ‘legality standard’, the outcome of an MOU between the governments of Indonesia and UK, had clearly not been agreed upon by the stakeholders in East Kalimantan.  However the independent parties that instigated the system – i.e. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) of America, the Department for International Development (DFID) of UK and SGS/URS Forestry (a TNC consultant) continued to attempt to spread information about it in East Kalimantan.  The East Kalimantan Working Group on Forests, (Coordinator, Yoga Sofyar), the Director of BEBSiC (Ade Fadli) and the Coordinator of Working Group 30 (Public Policy Advocacy Foundation), Kahar Al Bahri. Yoga, Ade Fadli and Kahar hoped that later there would be a system which supports the conservation of the forest and takes the part of the local communities. They admitted concern for the situation of the forestry sector. Up to now, after almost 40 years selling timber, Indonesia has not yet been able to say that the timber from the forest is harvested according to law, i.e. that it is legal. “This is a very shameful situation,” said Ade Fadli on the web site ‘Illegal-logging.info’.

Meanwhile, the headline in the The Jakarta Post, Feb 9, 2006, 'Illegal logging rolls on', has an air of resignation about it, as the paper reported the latest news on the logging issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some 20 ships loaded with illegally cut logs and sawn timber are docked outside Tanjung Balai Karimun Customs Office in Riau Islands province.
The ships were detained by the customs office while attempting to smuggle their illegal cargo into Malaysia and Singapore, the head of the office, Bambang Prasodjo, told The Jakarta Post.
Eight of the ships were detained in January, carrying over 613,000 cubic meters of illegally cut timber worth an estimated Rp 3.5 billion (US$376,344). Last year, the office detained about 30 ships. Bambang claimed Monday there were no signs that the smuggling of illegal logs in the province's waters was slowing down.
&quot;It is still difficult to break up the networks smuggling illegally cut logs into Singapore and Malaysia. Complicating the situation is the fact that the under the Customs Law, the smugglers are considered to be the ones carrying (the illegal goods), in this case, the captain and crew. (Arresting) the owners of the ships is outside our authority,&quot; he said.
He said smugglers carried the logs at night, even during rough weather, believing there would be fewer police patrols.
In Riau Islands, five areas are believed to be the main suppliers of illegal logs to neighbouring countries. They are Tembilahan, Selat Panjang, Dumai, Tiga Island and Dabo Singkep. (JP/Fadli)

==The industrial politics of the Orang-utan==

To view the orang-utan crisis:
[http://www.orangutans-sos.org/orangcrisis.php] 

The orang-utan - whose name, appropriately, means 'man of the woods' - is the only great ape living outside Central Africa. It is also the most arboreal of the great apes, and well adapted for life in the trees. It moves through the forest swinging by its arms from branch to branch, a style of movement that has led it to develop arms that are half as long again as its legs; when hanging loosely they reach almost to its ankles. The orang-utan's long, narrow hands and feet are, similarly, adaptations for grasping branches. On the ground it moves awkwardly on its hind legs with arms held over its head. When moving more quickly it uses its long arms like crutches, pivoting on clenched fists and swinging its body between them. Usually it lives either singly or in twos, occasionally in small groups of up to four individual animals. Old males live apart except briefly when mating. The orang-utan feeds mainly on fruit-notably the evil-smelling but pleasant-tasting fruit of the durian tree - supplemented by leaves, bark, birds' eggs, freshwater crustaceans, and insects.
Females and young sleep in the trees 10 m/30 ft or more above the ground. Each female makes a nest in the form of a simple platform in the fork of a tree, put together in a matter of minutes. Nests are seldom used more than once.

The orang-utan has a low reproductive potential; females do not become sexually mature until about ten years of age, and reproduce only every fourth year. The single young is suckled for at least 12 months and does not become completely independent for four years. There is moreover a high (40%) infant mortality rate. Thus a female orang-utan may succeed in raising no more than two or three young during her lifetime.

The Sumatran orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus abelii) differs genetically and physically from the Bornean orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus), and the population is smaller. Both species are highly endangered due to habitat loss and poaching and it is imperative that they are saved from extinction. The population of Sumatran orang-utans declined in number from over 12,000 in 1994 to 7,300 in 2003.

There may be as many as 180,000 orang-utans in Sumatra and Kalimantan, with another 4,000 or so in Sabah and Sarawak. But although these figures are higher than earlier estimates, numbers are believed to be declining at the rate of several thousand a year. The only orang-utans that can be regarded as reasonably secure are the 20,000 or so estimated to occur in established reserves; but these reserves are in need of more rigorous protection and higher standards of management.  Orang-utans are a &quot;keystone&quot; species for conservation. They play an important part in the forest's regeneration through the fruits and seeds they eat. Their disappearance may represent the loss of thousands of species of plants and animals within that ecosystem.  The Sumatran Orang-utan has been placed on the &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). 

In Sumatra, with their jungle environment burnt and logged and their food sources lost, the Sumatran orang-utan population has been forced to move into upland forest. Current estimates suggest that they could become extinct in the wild in less than 10 years. Illegal logging and the deliberate starting of forest fires in order to convert virgin forest to timber and palm oil plantations are the main factors responsible for the loss of over 80% of orang-utan habitat over the last 20 years. 

Habitat destruction has arisen from the need to provide cultivated land for the constantly expanding human population, and from extensive commercialised exploitation of the primary forest in which the orang-utan lives. Fire is a further hazard: in 1983, a huge fire destroyed about 30,000 km2 of forest, including 8,000 km2 of primary forest. Most of the orang-utans in Sarawak and Sabah occur in 'forest reserves', a designation implying protection, but the term is misleading. Forest reserves are expressly earmarked for licensed timber extraction by contractors from whom the government draws a royalty. Clear felling of the forest has had the effect of splitting the orang-utans into small, often isolated, groups, making their survival difficult. Heavy losses have also been incurred in capturing orang-utans both for medical research purposes and for the pet trade. There is a lucrative market for baby orang-utans in many parts of the Far East, and the high prices paid prove an irresistible temptation to smugglers. The capture of baby orang-utans generally involves slaughtering their mothers; few of the young survive the separation. Young orang-utans are delicate animals and are susceptible to the same diseases as human beings. Captured animals are generally kept under unhygienic conditions and forced to exist on an unnatural diet, with the result that most of them die from malnutrition or disease. For every young orang-utan that survives in captivity, ten die. 

Trade in young orang-utans is now illegal, with the governments of Singapore and Hong Kong prohibiting their import and export. The International Union of Directors of Zoological Gardens has also introduced stringent regulations governing the acquisition of orang-utans. Biological field stations have been established in both Borneo and Sumatra with the purpose of rehabilitating confiscated pets and smuggled orang-utans for reintroduction to the wild. Certain medical research organizations in the US have undertaken to establish their own private breeding centres in an attempt to minimize the need for wild-caught animals. These measures have succeeded in almost completely halting the illegal trade in orang-utans. But there remains the need to establish a series of large and well-managed orangutan sanctuaries, in addition to Sumatra's existing Gunung Leuser National Park (9,464 km2).

Gunung Leuser National Park is one of the biggest national parks in Indonesia (950,000 hectare). Actually, it's a collection of various nature reserves and forests: Gunung Leuser, Nature Reserve Kappi, Nature Reserve Kluet, Sikundur Langkat Wildlife Reserve, Ketambe Research Station, Singkil Barat and Dolok Sembilin.  Most parts of the national park lie in the region Aceh Tenggara (SE Aceh). Other parts are situated in the region east Aceh, south Aceh, and Langkat (a part of North Sumatra).  The Gunung Leuser National Park comprises more than 100 kilometres of the Bukit Barisan Mountains. It has been declared a world heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation because of its complete ecosystem.  The park consists of steep, almost inaccessible mountainous terrain. The altitude ranges from 0 metre, in Kluet (South Aceh), to 3,381 metre, on top of the Gunung Leuser (Southeast Aceh). The Alas river cuts the park into an eastern and western half.  Apart from mountains there are several other ecosystems: beach forest, swamp areas, lowland rainforest, alpine and mountain forest.

The latest threat to this ecosystem is the rehabilitaion project to rehouse the population of Aceh made homeless by the tsunami that hit the coastal region in 2005.  The epicenter of the undersea quake was at Meulaboh in western Aceh.  In Aceh, more than 70 percent of the inhabitants of some coastal villages are reported to have died. The official death toll is at 111,171, while more than 127,000 others remain missing. The exact number of victims will probably never be known.  The Indonesian Ministry of Forestry estimated that about 8.5 million cubic metres of timber are needed to build 123,000 houses for Acehnese who survived the Dec. 26 tsunami disaster. Of the total figure, six million cubic meters will be in the form of logs and the remaining 2.5 million cubic meters will be sawn.

The only area in Sabah to have a legally protected population of orangutans is the Tabin Wildlife Reserve (1,205 km2 / 465 sq mis). The species' prospects have been greatly improved by the establishment of the Danum Valley Conservation Area (427 km2 in Eastern Sabah, an  area unsuitable to agriculture which is believed to contain a substantial number of orang-utans, as well as a group of Sumartran Rhinoceroses.

Sarawak Lanjak-Enomau National Park was created primarily for the protection of the orang-utan in 1983, with the proposed Batan Ai National Park adjoining the Lanjak Entimau Sanctuary's southern border. This wildlife sanctuary in southwestern Sarawak lies adjacent to the international border with Indonesia and falls within the Sri Aman, Sibu, Sarikei and Kapit divisions. It covers an area of 187,000 hectares and originally created as a protected forest in 1940. It was gazetted as a wildlife sanctuary in 1983, primarily as an orang utan reserve.  It comprises rugged and steeply dissected terrain with hills and ridges that are commonly over 300m. Steep slopes with narrow V-shaped valleys predominate the area. The sanctuary has three peaks, namely Bukit Lanjak (1,284m), Bukit Entimau (975m) and Gunong Spali (966m). The region is an important water-catchment area and is drained by the Ensirieng, Mujol, Poi, Ngemah, Katibas, Bloh, Apoh and Kanowit rivers.

Through biodiversity surveys, the sanctuary is now known to contain 2,807 species of vascular plants, 218 species of medicinal plants, 158 species of jungle fruits, 108 species of jungle vegetables, 500 species of fungi, 42 species of lichens, 6 species of primates, 48 species of small mammals, 235 species of birds, 73 species of reptiles and amphibians, 82 species of fish and 1,053 species of insects.

In 1990, the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) recommended that the Lanjak-Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary to be developed as a Totally Protected Area. This development is crucial to the conservation of tropical biodiversity because of the richness of its flora and fauna and its close links to the Bentung Kerihun National Park in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Other than biodiversity conservation, the project also aims to support sustainable livelihoods among local residents living on its periphery.
Therefore, in 1993, the Sarawak government embarked on a cross-border cooperation with the Indonesian government to develop and establish the Lanjak-Entimau/Bentung Kerihun as a Totally Protected Area, in which ITTO acts as a catalyst and facilitator. In Sarawak, the project began in 1993.  On the Indonesian side, the first phase commenced in 1995. This combined areas of 1.1 million hectares is not only the region's first tropical forest transboundary biodiversity conservation area (TBCA) but and also one of the world's largest. This TCBA constitutes the most important sanctuary in Borneo for about 3,000 orang utans, perhaps 10% of the world's remaining wild population of the species, and other rare and threatened plant and animal species.

An effective survival programme for Sumatran orang-utans is imperative because they have been neglected for a long time and have received almost no international help for years. Deprived of their forest cover, they are increasingly confronted by ever-expanding human populations. The search for food forces them to stray into farms and palm oil plantations where they are often killed or fall victim to poachers. The only hope for these orang-utan refugees, and for orang-utans taken captive and kept as pets both in Sumatra and abroad, is rescue and re-introduction into the wild.

Although there are several active rehabilitation centres for Bornean orang-utans, until 2002 Sumatra had only one, the Bohorok Orangutan Centre (BOC). Unfortunately, the BOC was forced to close its doors to new arrivals in 1996. Essentially, the centre had too many orang-utans and no place to put them. These reasons, coupled with the tourist explosion in the 1990s at Bohorok, left Sumatra without a working centre.
The latest conservation strategies recommend against the re-introduction of ex-captives into wild populations, due to the threat of disease. This eliminates the vast Gunung Leuser National Park, adjacent to the Bohorok centre, as a viable relocation site. Despite this, the orang-utans living at Bohorok still remain and need to be cared for.

==People and the forest==

In his case study of the impact of logging on indigenous peoples, Philip Hurst reported in 1990 that than 2,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Sarawak's forests were being logged annually. Along the Baram river alone more than 30 logging operations were working on approximately 400 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of forest. This highlighted the relations between the longhouse communities in the upper reaches of the Baram and Limbang rivers and the logging companies which had been deteriorating since the mid 1970s.

Since the 1960s, the timber industry had profoundly disrupted the lifestyle of the Penan people and only half of the 10,000 Penan continued to live their traditionally nomadic life style in the forests. Most settled Penan had relocated in government resettlement schemes.

[http://www.earthisland.org/borneo/news/articles/010403article.html]

In response to deforestation the Penan have generally attempted to avoid the logging companies by moving towards the Kalimantan border. By the mid 1980s, however, logging roads extended so deep into the interior that even the most remote Penan groups could no longer avoid logging concessions. As a result there have been constant problems, with logging operations scaring away wildlife, causing the silting of rivers, killing fish and contaminating drinking water supplies. The environmental damage forms the crux of opposition to logging in these districts, but the logging companies' attitude has undoubtedly exacerbated the situation.

===Conflict===

Hurst quotes one example of the conflict between Limbang Trading and Along Sega, a Penan headman from Long Adang ('Long' is the local term for 'Longhouse'). The 1,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Limbang concession was owned by Datuk James Wong, the Tourist Minister for Sarawak. The trouble started in 1985 when Limbang Trading destroyed the graves of Along Sega's parents and five other relatives. It was one of the first cases in which a more militant stand began to emerge. The logging camp manager offered Along a MS$ 100 (US$40) note as compensation, which Along refused. 

In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I told him, even if I have to die of any cause I shall not trade the bodies and souls of my parents and relatives to save mine because our bodies, dead or alive, are not for sale. I refused the money and pleaded with him also that if you have so much money already please don't come here to take our land. But he just shook his head, laughed and replied; 'We have been licensed to work on this land. There is no such thing as your land in the forest because forest belongs only to the government. Take this money or you get nothing.' I still rejected the money.
&lt;/blockqote&gt;

The Penan, however, are not the only tribal group to be angered by the timber industry. In 1981, 500 Kenyah from Long Apoh on the Baram river approached the Sam Ling Timber Company logging camp and demanded compensation for damage to their land. Previously they had sent a number of petitions asking the company to enter into negotiations over compensation proposals for their longhouse. All these had been ignored and when there was still no response to their suggestion of MS$40 (US$16) compensation for every ton of timber extracted they threatened to burn the camp. The Kenyah leaders were promptly arrested.

Later that year 80 people from 22 longhouses descended on the Lamat logging camp demanding MS$2 (US$0.80 cents) per ton of timber extracted. The longhouses had applied for their own timber licenses a number of times but had been refused and the 68,000 ha concession had gone to Lamat.187 Another incident occurred in the Niah area where a camp manager was stopped and forced to pay MS$7,000 (US$2,800) as compensation for damage caused by logging. The local longhouse had earlier been promised compensation, but it never arrived. Once again those involved were arrested.

In 1983 the Ulu Nyalan logging camp in Niah was threatened by a small group of Iban demanding MS$100,000 (US$40,000) as compensation and MS$10 for every ton of timber extracted.189 They threatened to burn down the camp and were arrested two days later. In October of that year several blocks of living quarters in the Batu Niah logging camp were burnt to the ground. In January 1984, 200 Iban barricaded a timber road with logs at Lubok Lalang in Sungai Medamit. They demanded MS$2m (US$790,000) in compensation from another company owned by Datuk James Wong, to no avail.

In other cases, however, compensation has been agreed although the sums that change hands are clearly inadequate for the loss of resources. At Long Piah, in the Baram District, loggers drove roads through swidden fields without permission. According to the local people the sites are now useless as all the top soil has been scraped or washed away. They did not bother to take the company to court for this illegal damage on Native Customary Land, as they could only claim the maximum MS$5 per metre compensation for the damage.190 There is a general mistrust in the justice handed out from the courts within Sarawak's Dayak community. This has built up from a number of cases in which logging companies have broken the law but received no punishment.

The law can, however, even act against tribal people attempting to stop logging on land they own. In 1985, Laeng Wan, a Kayan from Long Miri, was arrested for building a fence across a logging road leading to his land. He was charged with unlawfully restricting a trespasser from encroaching on his own land. In 1977 he had signed an agreement leasing his land for ten years to a timber company. In 1983, however, when the initial cut had been completed, the timber company moved out and was replaced by a new contractor, and logging continued without Laeng Wan's permission or any offer of compensation for the extra damage caused. It was then that Laeng took matters into his own hands and built the barricade.
Due to the extremely intimate relationship between government officials and timber concessionaires, many longhouses complain that the authorities are not interested in their problems. One example, in late 1986, from Long Tepan on Ulu Tutoh, a major tributary of the Baram, illustrates this lack of concern. 

The Dayaks described their experiences when some government officials took the unusual step of visiting an area where complaints had emerged.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;As we are not able to write we were happy that they [government officers] came, so we told them about our problems which are mainly caused by the logging activities of Samling Timber Snd Bhd, which started operations about six years ago in Sungai Puak. They wrote all what we told them down and we were assured that they would take the necessary action to protect our land as requested. But merely two weeks after they left the bulldozers roared mercilessly around us. Then we realized it was just another empty promise from the officials.
Samling Timber gained their logging rights direct from twelve longhouses by giving them MS$2,000 (approximately MS$7 per person; US$3) in return for allowing timber contractors to clear the land.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Blockades===

In March 1987,12 major logging roads were blockaded by more than 2,000 people from three ethnic groups, the Penan, Kayan and Kelabit. The Penan formed the majority although most sites were located on Native Customary Land controlled by the other groups. Nine timber companies were affected, including: Samling Timber, Limbang Trading, Wong Tong Kwong, Merlin Timber, Sarsin Lumber, Marabong Lumber and Baya Lumber. The sites formed a 150 km swathe across the upper Baram and Limbang rivers.

The authorities immediately sealed off the areas and arrested those whom they thought were instigating the trouble. Several members of SAM were charged under the Internal Security Act and held in prison for up to one month. The blockades, however, remained in place.

One primary aim of the blockades was to publicize the problems and this strategy proved to be successful. In East Malaysia, however, the national papers are directly owned by the various political parties, all of whom are involved in logging. The ruling Sarawak National Party (SNAP) claimed that outside agitators had incited the Penans and that a lawyer from Kuala Lumpur had visited the areas just before the blockades to stir up local people.

In June 1987 a delegation of Penan headmen went to Kuala Lumpur to appeal to the King and Prime Minister. They saw neither but gained considerable press coverage, and sympathy was developing abroad as international press agencies picked up on the story.

===Deforestation as an anti-development issue===

As outside support developed, the press within Sarawak began to show less tolerance. A few reports attempted to turn the blockades into an anti-dvelopment issues, claiming that SAM and other groups supporting the cause wanted to keep the Penan as museum pieces. 

Those who choose to maintain a traditional way of life depend utterly on wild game, fish and edible plants. Sago, supplemented by a wide range of fruits, nuts and berries, forms the vegetable base to their diet, while boar, lizard, monkey, various birds and fish provide the major protein source.  The Penan establish a camp in an area for three to six weeks, moving on when food becomes scarce. The social groups are small, 20 to 30 individuals, and material possessions limited. Their rough, open shelters, constructed entirely from forest produce, quickly deteriorate and are reclaimed by the forest after abandonment. This life style restricts them to a few material possessions that can be carried, such as metal cooking implements, large machete-type knives (parangs) and a few Western consumer items, such as watches and radios are all bought by trading forest produce. 

In the 1990s blowpipes were still in use, although rifles were more popular. Only the older Penan men continued to wear the traditional loincloth, 'T' shirts and shorts were more common. The women usually wore some form of sarong, a single piece of material wrapped around the body.

The nomadic lifestyle is undoubtedly hard; life expectancy is low at 40 years. For many years the government has attempted to restrict the Penan's movements and to establish them in settled villages in order to provide basic health care and education. The other side of this seemingly benevolent policy is the claim that the Penan are a threat to the development of the timber industry. In physical terms they have an absolutely minimal effect on the forests, it is their political influence that creates a challenge to the authorities. The timber industry destroys their forest environment and consequently their culture and lifestyle. The interests of the two groups are entirely incompatible.
Clearly, the Penan feel seriously threatened by the type of development to which they have been exposed. As nomads they can make no legal claims over the forest land they use because it has not been cleared; they are, therefore, trespassers on state-owned land. The Penan in the government plantation settlements live in an atmosphere of grudging acceptance rather than in hope for an improved lifestyle.

By July the Peoples Mirror of Sarawak was running a general smear campaign againstthe Penan and the blockades. One reporter described the Penan and their lifestyle thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A society without doors - a life of mere existence with no material possessions. . .. Children with phlegm-smeared faces tug to their mothers sarongs [Malaysian dress]. Sucklings and toddlers - children -could very well be their only possession and no doors can keep them safe ... if the Penans are not ready for change now, then when will they ever be? ... The Penans, being a very simple people are being easily swayed. The truth is that logging does not deprive them of their food and water supply.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The blockades stayed in place until October 1987 when an amendment to Sarawak's Forest Ordinances made it a criminal offence - even for the land owner - to block any logging road. Forest Officers were empowered to arrest without warrant, and conviction brought a MS$6,000 (US$2,400) fine and up to two years in prison. There were 42 arrests at the blockade sites as troops were used to end the protests.

Since the publication of Philip Child’s account of the bad relations between the Penan and their government, the situation that caused the blockades has not changed in the last quarter of a century. 

An immense quantity of statements have emerged from the people involved and one, signed by 61 tribal leaders, clearly presents the Dayak view of their situation:
Some people say we are against 'development' if we do not agree to move out of our land and forest. This completely misrepresents our position. Development does not mean stealing our land and forest. . . . This is not development but theft of our land, our rights and our cultural identity. Development to us means:

# recognizing our land rights in practice;
# putting a stop to logging in our lands and forests so that we can continue to live;
# introducing clean water supply, proper health facilities, better schools for our children.

This kind of development we want. Why don't you give us this development and progress?

===The Government viewpoint===

The internet is full of the websites of organisations presenting the view of forest peoples, and urging  western folk to lobby and boycott aimed at supporting the likes of the Penan.  On the other side the Malaysia government makes statements that it continues to strongly support international efforts to promote and ensure sustainability in forest management. Its long term view is that, if the global community wishes to halt deforestation and improve forest management and conserve biodiversity it should be willing to share the cost entailed. Some additional US$125 billion a year is estimated to be required to achieve the necessary improvement in forestry management practices world wide. Since UNCED in 1992 the additional resources pledged by the developed nations to assist Third World countries in this field are still not forthcoming. On these ground tropical forests are undervalued. In particular, the international community which values tropical forests for their biodiversity as a carbon sink is still unprepared to pay for these services. 

In Peninsular Malaysia alone the estimated cost of implementing sustainable forest management is about RM1.7 billion which will have to be financed through royalties and levies imposed on forestry products .The achievement of sustainability cannot be attained overnight nor are the goals static . The whole process is dynamic and evolving. Malaysia says it remains committed to ITTO's Objective Year 2000, definite steps are already in place to pave the way towards this direction, notwithstanding the lack of transfer of resources, as promised, from the developed North. 

In the view of Y.B. Dato' Seri Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, Minister of Primary Industries of Malaysia the package of measures that have been agreed upon and are being implemented represents a comprehensive and concerted effort by all segments of the community and stakeholders towards sustainability. In other words, Malaysia is confident that it will achieve sustainable forest management within the given time frame and that Malaysia will remain &quot;green &quot; for future generations to come.

==Human impact on forest primates==

The human impact of people on forest primates ranges from the outright destruction of their arboreal habitat, through felling or damming river systems, to the isolation of small populations in isolated pockets of forest, which are below the threshold required to maintain a viable population.  Apart from logging and clearance for agriculture, other impacts are removal of primates as agricultural pests, as food for human or pet consumption, as bait, and the taking of live animals as pets or for laboratory research. 

[[Image:Impact_primates.jpg]]

In most parts of the primate habitat of Asia, habitat disturbance commonly takes the form of commercial logging as well as shifting cultivation. The effects of logging on primate survival are tied to the type of logging practices and the requirements of the animals. One key factor in survival is whether or not timber sought by loggers is also their food resource.  In this respect it has been shown that Malaysian primates in a given area can survive the destruction of up to half of the forest.  Also, high densities of some primates can be reached in surviving ‘islands’ in a ‘sea’ of monocultures.  These situations only apply to a limited number of species.

Hunting of primates is not as great a problem in Asia as in Africa or South America because three of the major religions there (Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism) have proscriptions against eating primates. Nonetheless, hunting by aboriginal groups is common in Indonesia, and Chinese hunt all species of monkeys in China and in other Asian countries in which they live.  In Asia, the major direct threat to primates is that they are traded commercially.  The commercial use of wild monkeys for biomedical research is responsible for the decline in macaques, an Asian genus.

Although non-timber products provide a justification for the conservation of forest, if the markets for them are successfully developed, the result could be overexploitation, leading to clear-cutting for areas of commercial cultivation. Understory clearing, often for fodder for domestic animals or for plantations of shade-loving crops, destroys seedlings, and with them, the possibility of the regeneration of canopy trees. 

Shifting cultivation increases the proportion of secondary forest at the expense of primary forest. In Asia, this change favors cercopithecines at the expense of colobines.  In peninsular Malaysia, the primate biomass in primary forest is dominated by colobines (Presbytis spp.), whereas secondary forest, riverine swamp, domestic orchards, paddy fields, and so forth commonly host cercopithecines, particularly long-tailed macaques. For open-country monkey species like most macaques (Macaca spp.) and the Hanuman langur (Presbytis entellus), any kind of disturbance that results in landscapes such as the meadow like communities created by clear-cutting, grazing, and crop planting mimics the forest edge or savanna to which they originally were adapted. It has been argued that the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatto), which prefers feeding on ground herbs that occur in disturbed sites, has spread with the disappearance of the forests of Asia during the Pleistocene glaciations and that continues to prosper in the face of the human colonization of forestlands.

Despite the Indo-Pacific’s unsurpassed biological richness, many species other than primates are in immediate danger of extinction. The number of current extinctions globally and regionally, in fact, rivals that of the end of the Age of Dinosaurs. Given the increasing scale and scope of current threats such as logging, agricultural expansion, and increasing demographic pressures on natural resources, new conservation strategies and fieldwork with local governments and communities are clearly necessary if biodiversity in the Indo-Pacific is to be protected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Educating through case studies==

It is practically impossible to think about a single habitat that has not been modified by human culture, either by the deliberate dismantling of its food chains or by pollution at a distance.  Even landscapes that from a far vantage point appear to be free of human interference, will probably be found , on closer inspection, to be the product of human activity of one kind or another.  However, there is no doubting the power of landscapes as educational entry points to case histories of applied ecology.  The study of disease transmission begins with a view of the dense network of duck farms scattered across drained marshes of South East Asia where people, domestic livestock and migratory birds live cheek by jowl; a wetland engineering project catches the eye of the speeding motorist passing by a linear stretch of reedbed devised to clean up the motorway runoff; an effort to breed and reintroduce rare species begins with a shot of cattle grazing on former rainforest.  The point is that learning about applying ecological principles to repair or redress our ecological predicament is best done by studying real outcomes of conservation management in actual units of human occupation, whether they be farms, towns or the ‘nature sites’ we conceptualise from rare patches of geology and vegetation.  Another important reason for educating through case histories is that environmental projects do not fall neatly into one or other of the nine sections of applied ecology, which have been summarised in the other modules.  Case histories will therefore be presented in this module.  They will have been chosen because they provide a cross-module perspective according to the practical ways in which the environment and its resources are utilised in the light of the human dimensions of global change.  This means selecting exemplars that illustrate the establishment of new contractual relationships between human society and the environment that will not just be economically and ecologically sustainable, but morally sustainable as well.

The areas from which these examples should be drawn were broadly defined in the 1988 Tokyo International Symposium on the Human Dimensions of Global Change Programme as:

*Nature conservation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To improve the scentific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interactions with ecosystems.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Community development:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To identify social strategies to prevent or mitigate undersirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes that are already unavoidable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Ecological economics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To explore new tools that can provide a replacement for GNP as a measure of human progress.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Industry
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To assess attempts to restructure industries in developed countries in relation to the inevitablity of rapid industrial development elsewhere.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Nature conservation==

Three useful definitions of nature conservation strategies are:

*The management of human and natural resources to provide maximum benefits over a sustained period of time.  In farming, conservation entails matching cropping patterns and the productive potential and physical limitations of agricultural lands to ensure long-term sustainability of profitable production. Conservation practices focus on conserving soil, water, energy, and biological resources. Contour farming, no-till farming, and integrated pest management are typical examples of conservation practices aimed at minimising loss of biodiversity whilst maintaining crop production.

*Preserving and renewing natural resources. The use, protection, and improvement of natural resources according to principles that will ensure their highest economic or social benefits.

*The protection of an area, or particular element within an area, accepting the dynamic nature of the environment and therefore allowing change.


At a practical level, the European Union is taking three routes to stop biodiversity decline by 2010.  These are:

* to increase the connectivity between nature and nature areas in Europe
* to increase the interest and involvement of people in Europe with nature
* to improve the implementation of European policies for nature, and to link policies to practice, and practice to policies

===Connecting nature===

Populations of species can only survive if they have large enough habitats and/or enough possibilities to interact with other populations. Due to fragmentation of their habitats as a result of changes in land use, many species in Europe have disappeared or may disappear in the near future. Good landscape connectivity will give species a better chance of survival.
Due to the impact of climate change on vegetation and habitats in Europe, species are slowly but surely moving northwards. In order to accommodate for these changing environments, it is necessary that species are able to adapt. Insurmountable barriers may result in a further decline of populations. Therefore a fully functional European Ecological Network with proper connections between nature areas is needed in the near future. 

Land use in Europe is changing. Important developments are intensification of agriculture in some parts of Europe, and massive abandonment of agricultural land in other parts. The extension of road and rail infrastructure in vulnerable regions in Europe, urban sprawl and increased tourist infrastructure are other developments impacting on the connectivity of nature. 

Besides the threats posed by climate change and development in land use, there are also various promising opportunities. Taking advantage of these opportunities will not only benefit nature conservation, but also other sectors of society. 
 
===Connecting people and nature===

In nature conservation the role of people often receives less attention than the intrinsic value of nature and biodiversity. However, nature conservation is per definition a human activity. The support, awareness and involvement of the public and stakeholders are vital in order to be able to reach the conservation targets. The decline of nature can only be stopped when the interaction between people involved in nature conservation and land use sectors is intensified, and common ground is found. 

Civic opposition to the implementation of Natura 2000, has already resulted in a greater interest by the European Commission and EU member states in communicating this issue. On the Pan-European level, the PEBLDS Council (Pan-European Biological Diversity and Landscape Strategy) has adopted a European action plan for public participation and awareness for nature in Europe.
At the conference more opportunities to increase the interest and involvement of people with nature will be discussed.
 
===Connecting nature operations with policies===

Organisations that manage nature areas and National Parks have a lot of experience in connecting practice to nature conservation targets, while involving people. Other organisations have more experience in influencing policy. 

Europe’s nature would benefit greatly if the site management organisations were more policy orientated and if the policy-influencing organisations were more involved in the implementation of the policies. 

The conference may create new alliances that assist in linking policies to practice, and practice to policies and stimulate co-operation between these organisations.

==Community development==

A community’s complex of economic relations are basic to all social life: notably, the ways in which people interact with the natural world, especially through using natural resources.   Society  emerges out of the natural world and is sustained by it, yet most people are now alienated from elemental natural relations. The origins of alienation lie in pre-capitalist societies with their monarchical, agrarian and craft hierarchies that gave way to the social divisions and economics of mass production.  We now live with its consequences of global consumerism present in every niche of social life. If we go further back in social evolution from the 18th century, human social behaviour is seen as a continuation of the evolution of the rest of nature. The big question of ‘sustainability’ is whether our social nature can adapt to the fact that no other society can ever reach the level of the North American way of life, because our planet will not survive the necessary sevenfold increase in the day to day use of materials and energy by the rest of the world.

Changes are therefore necessary in a social-ecological future organised for sustainability, at an environmental level, a personal level, and a communal level.  Appropriate institutional frameworks and an ethical vision are necessary.  According to Peter Staudenmaier we must turn our attention to the social structures that might make free nature and a free society more likely.  Instead of handing over decision-making power to experts, professionals, representatives, or bureaucrats, social ecology he foresees all people participating directly in the self-management of their communal affairs. This has to take place as an historical process in which communities move smoothly from their past to the present.  Local history in this context is a stabilising force for future change. Murry Bookchin expressed it this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“We are thus in a position either to follow a path toward a grim “end of history,” in which a banal succession of vacuous events replaces genuine progress, or to move on to a path toward the true making of history, in which humanity genuinely progresses toward a rational world. We are in a position to choose between an ignominious finale, possibly including the catastrophic nuclear oblivion of history itself, and history’s rational fulfillment in a free, materially abundant society in an aesthetically crafted environment”.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ecological economics==

Since they are based on tapping the capital of natural resources, human economies are parts of larger natural ecosystems and develop with these systems. In our utilisation nature, ecosystems provide materials and energy to maintain relations between human economies and the supply materials and energy for the production of goods and services.  The economic process is a circular flow of money between families and companies.  Families spend money on goods produced by companies and companies spend money to buy inputs for production, such as materials, energy, land, labour and capital.  These inputs are owned by households, either directly or indirectly because they are vested in the State.  This model, which was first used as the basis for economic theory by Adam Smith in the 1770s, concentrates on the total volume of the circular flow generated by demand and supply, which is described as the gross national product (GNP).  GNP is the primary focus of the economic policies of nations.  It is assumed that when GNP grows, human wellbeing increases; year on year growth of GNP is what keeps a democratic government in power through increases in jobs, wages and goods.  The economic cycle is isolated from the environment because it is designed to continue regardless of changes in the environment.  

For two centuries after Smith published his book ‘The Wealth of Nations’ the environment was simply an inexhaustible supply of raw materials and an infinite sink for wastes.  In Smith’s model there are no ties between economics and environment.   When sources of inputs are exhausted, others are discovered or new inputs are invented.  In the 1970s it suddenly dawned on people that the production of wealth on the Smith model can only be sustained when economies are small in relation to the environment available for human growth and settlement.  Flows of wastes from human production systems now rival the flows through some natural systems and many of the impacts are irreversible or are only remedied over a very long time.  In this situation, reliance on the GDP as a major tool of economics is an obstacle because it just measures production for any purpose resulting from any activity.  A nation encouraged to maximise GNP may do so by choosing to exhaust its natural resource capital, such as felling all its forests.

The simplest way of organising an economics that involves putting the enironment into accounting is:

* Measure the value of services provided by the economy and the environment
* Measure the specific costs of environmental deterioration due to depletion and pollution
* Keep track of environmental capital such as clean water and ecosystems

These measuements would enable the correction of GNP by subtracting from it depletion of natural capital.  It would also be possible to balance theextraa benefits of increased consumption against the extra environmental costs.

===Hamburger economics===

If cattle gain 50 kg per hectare per year, and are slaughtered after eight years, and half the weight is non-meat (skin, bones, etc.), then each cow produces 200 kg, or 1,600 hamburgers.

It takes one hectare of cleared tropical moist forest, turned to pasture, to feed that one cow and to produce the 1,600 hamburgers. Because the land is fertile for grazing for only a few years, this is a one-shot deal, and an expensive one. After ten years—a generous estimate of the life of the soil—the return on the land from the hamburgers it produces will have been $3 US per hectare per year.

The cumulative effect of this hamburger consumption is equivalent to millions of years of evolution, and to thousands of species.

Conversion of all of Amazonia—4 million square kilometres— to cattle pasture would produce one month of hamburger for the world's population and no more—since the soil would be depleted and the forest irreversibly lost.

==Industry==

In 2003 the Environmental Policy and Global Change section of the German Political Science Association (DVPW) and its partners organised a conference in Berlin on the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change.  It addressed the theme “Governance for Industrial Transformation”.  Its three major divisions set out why we need to change the orientation of industry, the causes of the mismatch between industry and its sources of materials and energy and the core challenges for practical solutions.  The structure of the conference sets out the strategic questions, which have to be answered by establishing operational systems. 

===The Need for Industrial Transformation===

Current patterns in the production and consumption of goods, energy and services fail to meet basic requirements of environmental sustainability in both industrialised and developing countries. The use of natural resources and the utilisation of the environment as a sink for emissions exceed tolerable rates, and most producers and consumers are still able to externalise costs caused by their emissions or by the extraction of materials at the expense of future generations or of other world regions. Although some indicators point to an increasing decoupling of economic growth from environmental degeneration, most observers agree that this is not sufficient for sustainable economic and environmental conditions. A more comprehensive industrial transformation towards sustainability is hence needed, in particular in the richer countries of the North. But what forms of governance are likely to pave the way for such transformation? 

===Problem perceptions and policy approaches: Market versus State Failure===

Some scholars view market failure as the chief cause of the problem. They see the state as the appropriate actor with sufficient capacity and legitimacy to correct these failures. Others argue, however, that in addition to market failures, the limited capacities of governments to intervene in market activities are part of the problem. They claim that ‘state failure’ results from conflicting policy objectives for governments to protect the environment and to further economic growth and employment at the same time. In addition, governments often lack the necessary information and knowledge required for the effective and efficient correction of market failures. Governmental regulations therefore at best support the ecological modernisation of economies by redirecting modernisation processes towards environmentally sounder technologies. Ecological modernisation alone, however, will not overcome structural rigidities, and in many cases, its achievements are compensated, and often overcompensated, by economic growth. 

The conclusions based on this state failure diagnosis vary considerably. Some scholars stress the need to better involve other stakeholders to compensate insufficient state capacities. Others hope that in the long run, autonomous trends of technical modernisation will automatically reduce emissions. A third group of studies stresses the deficits of traditional command and control but also simple incentive based policies. More complex strategies, often in an evolutionary spirit, such as strategic niche management, transition management, or recently “time strategies” and other types of innovation policies and ‘ecological industrial policy’ which build on and aptly use and modulate ongoing innovation dynamics and rely more on the interaction of political and broader societal forces, have been advocated for. Yet it is open if these strategies are likely to bring about the necessary changes.

===The Core Challenges===

Given this dilemma of simultaneous market and state failure, the 2003 Berlin Conference aimed to bring together new and innovative research in this field — in particular with an empirical emphasis — that indicates possible pathways for the successful governance of industrial transformation processes. The papers addressed one or several of the following issues: 

; History : Case studies that draw on historical experiences with the management of industrial transformation and the stimulation of ecologically friendly innovations and markets: What were the driving forces — autonomous market mechanisms, state regulation, or a combination of both? What conclusions can be drawn regarding the dynamic nature of economic and political development, in particular with a view of economic globalisation and a possible retreat of the capacity of states to act?
  
; Foresight : What methods are available to forecast future patterns of production in order to devise and implement appropriate policies as early as possible? Which indicators are necessary and available for the application of foresight methods?
  
; Scope : What should be the scope of industrial transformation? Are efficiency improvements as a result of modernisation processes a sufficient condition for industrial transformation? Are markets or governments the proper institutions to cope with this requirement? Or are the options for change limited for example by deeply rooted cultural norms, consumer (and voter) preferences or the infrastructure. Which policies are likely to address these issues successfully?
  
; New Generation of Strategies and Instruments : In how far are evolutionary strategies such as strategic niche management, transition management or time strategies likely to bring about the necessary changes? Are the so-called 3rd generation instruments that build on collaboration and information — such as the eco-management and audit scheme, sustainability reporting of companies or voluntary agreements — likely to contribute to the required changes, and under which institutional settings, incentive structures and actor constellations is this the case?
  
; Multi-actor and multi-level Governance : What institutions, actors, strategies, instruments are most likely to bring forward substantial changes in the relationships between societies and the natural environment? Which governance structures are promising to provide a sustainable use of regional and local resources? Are dialogues between industry and environmentalist NGOs an effective and legitimate instrument to regulate a globalising industry? Which other actors (e.g. financing services, consultants or trade unions) are able to intervene successfully in favour of, or as an impediment to, an industrial transition? What role can international organisations play in this respect? How can the different levels from global to regional be co-ordinated?

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Revisions =

* Define Scalable, Vector, and Graphics in terms of web base pictures.
* Add example of drawings lines. 
* In circle example, expand description to discuss keyword &quot;stroke&quot;
* Remove blanks from code examples.
* Remove line numbers from code examples.
* Adjust headings, for example &quot;Getting Started&quot; -&gt; &quot;Getting started&quot;
* Add summary at the end of the chapter.
* Move objectives to the top of the screen in table format.

== Editorial Board Suggestions ==

I like your suggestions for the chapter revisions. Some of your suggestions are contained in the checklist. The checklist also explains other revisions you can use for your chapter (e.g., changing &quot;style sheet&quot; to &quot;stylesheet&quot;).

Questions and Notes:

* Example of drawing lines--do you mean lines only? The triangle shape example does illustrate use of drawing lines.
* Two different spellings in the chapter: &quot;standalone&quot; and &quot;stand-alone&quot; (you should pick one and stay consistent with it).
* Some code one-liners are within a box/table, and others are not. This should be consistent in the chapter.
* The learning objectives can be more specific.
* In comparing SVG with raster graphics, when the chapter says there are no font limitations with SVG, it seems to imply that there are font limitations with raster graphics. Quote from chapter: &quot;Users will see the image the same way you do.&quot; This is also true for raster graphics, so what is the difference? This wasn't clear to me.
* Is the information about the SVG Viewer incompatibility with Mozilla still the same? The chapter implies that the SVG Viewer does not work at all with Mozilla, but I'm able to use the SVG Viewer in Firefox to view SVG files (that is all I can do, though). It might be helpful to clarify/update this.
* The chapter does a good job explaining the advantages of SVG over raster graphics, but it could go into more depth regarding SVG's advantages/disadvantages compared to Flash. The section on SVG vs. Flash doesn't clearly articulate the similarities and differences between SVG and Flash. ''A table with a comparison/contrast of the two might be useful''. When I did a Google search on this topic, the results showed that there's a debate on whether SVG is more advantageous than Flash. Some feel that the two are best suited for different purposes; this kind of information might be interesting to include in the chapter since Flash is such a well-known vector editor among graphics/animation folks. 
* The chapter says that SVG can be viewed with sound media (via RealPlayer), but sound can not be embedded, correct? It would be nice to know this information in learning the scope of SVG's capabilities and limitations.
* Please remember to use the checklist.

Overall, this is a very interesting chapter! I look forward to your chapter presentation.

==Professor==

This is a good chapter and the main effort is to make it even better rather than fix major problems.
The chapter was written about 2 years ago and has not been updated since then so some of the material is dated (e.g., Firefox support for SVG). Check all the material to ensure it is current and specificially look at table 3. 

The could be more links (eg a link to the Adobe SVG viewer)

Reformat code to author guidelines and check that it works and put comments in the code rather than referring to line numbers. We want the comments to go with the code.

as a more personal note, I would like to say that I am very curious about where your new Wikibook, [[Writing: A Guide To Urban Calligraphy]] is going to be going.  Please note especially our policy about always maintaining a neutral point of view.  I know that is difficult to do sometimes, but please be respectful with others that you will be having contact with on these projects.  From my experience, you are pouring gasoline onto Wikibooks with a page like this, but I'm going to try to give you some breathing room to get this idea of yours up and going.

Note that I also marked the [[:Image:Grafftop.jpg|image you uploaded]] as a copyright violation.  I'm not trying to stop you from uploading content like this, but we do need to know exactly where you got this photo, even if you claim that you shot the photo with your own camera.  If that is the case, you can remove the copyright violation markup and simply add a note that you took the picture yourself.

On the whole, this is a very interesting concept for Wikibooks, and I hope that you add more content here.  I really am interested in what you are planning to do here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:50, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

(moving content from my talk page to here to continue the thread.... --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]])

Hey Rob;

Finally,a site that isn't ran by an admin that just does nothing but delete things! Now, on my talk board, you said, at one point or another, something like this would be like pouring gasoline on Wikibooks. My page(s) are not intended to promote vandalism or graffiti. Although you dais I should keep a neutral point of view, take a look at graffiti this way: What if, instead of on a wall, the artist did it on a large canvas and sold it to millions of people? What if graffiti were an art form? Well, to most artists, it is an art form. My two purposes for writing the book is to promote the art form and discourage vandalism.

However, if you still feel the book is suggestive in anyway, tell me and delete it.

Thanks for your concern,
C.A.ONE

:I'm just trying to point out that there are some people here who do try to delete things at the drop of a hat, and I've been quite annoyed with it.  Heck, it even happened to me where somebody who thought the content I added was inappropriate to Wikibooks... and I was an adminstrator at that time too!  Writing books in particular can be very demanding, and it simply takes time to come up with an approach to how you are going to deal with a subject.  Sometimes there are fits and starts in the process, and you can't simply judge what you see in the first couple of days.  For this reason in particular, I pushed through a policy to give new authors who otherwise are giving a good faith effort to produce a new book at least a month to prove themselves... even if parts of what they are doing may seem like violating basic policies like NPOV or even copyright violations.... seriously.

:There is far too much of a backlog of older content anyway that needs to be culled for an admin to worry about the new stuff that is being added.  Indeed, we have a very delete happy admin that was just appointed who is removing stuff all over the place, and the deletion logs show it.  The nice thing is that Wikibooks really needs somebody like that and he is for the most part removing the really bad stuff and not messing much with content under current development.

:As far as having something about graffiti, I looked at it and simply said &quot;WOW! that is a cool idea!&quot;.  I even love the title... &quot;Urban Calligraphy&quot;... what an idea.

:My only concern is the appearance of suggesting illegal activity.  Jimbo himself has come down on previous attempts to add content of that nature, like a manual of crime and [[A guide to cheating during tests and examinations]], (he tried to kill this book by deleting all links to this content leaving it as an orphaned book).  Explicit advocacy of criminal behavior is usually disclaimed in most cases like this, but there is a fine line that can easily be crossed.

:I know that in some cases graffiti is even encouraged under a certain context and with permission of the building owners.  On the other hand, there is a problem where some symbols are associated with certain &quot;gangs&quot; of organized criminals, largly to mark out turf in a manner like dogs and cats mark their territory with urine.  I think the ananogy fits in this situation too on multiple levels, even though I know this is an explicit POV.

:Contrasting that with genuine artwork that can be done with common graffiti tools makes this into more of an artform that is worthy of exploration.  I'm hoping that you emphasis this, and document techniques that use spray paint effectively, along with things to watch out for and avoid, just like any art media would require.

:My main worry, BTW, was that this was going to be a gateway by hard-core wikivandals as a forum to coordinate their attacks, or do other BS.  If this is a legitimate book concept... please continue and have fun! --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:24, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

I drew that myself, it's just a very horrible drawing I did of an outline for the text adventure game in one of the lessons. I don't care whoever uses this image, and it's good where it's too photobucket lets you upload images for free.

== General Diccussion &amp; Update Information ==

'''Please keep comments constructive and polite'''

&quot;I mean this in the nicest possible way, but I don't think u know enough about programming to be writing something like this dude?&quot; - =PRoF=


----


I'm sorry you feel this way but I believe I have enought knowledge of DarkBASIC to write
a book on it which I'm doing, I want to share my knowledge, if you think I'm doing 
things wrong share some of your knowledge in the book by all means. I am relatively
new to programming but not to DarkBASIC. Thanks, however for your pleasant compliant that
was not meant to offend me. - Jonathan/Dbtutor

----

Hey guys, I'm working on the book again, it will be done by July I promise!!! - Jonathan

----

Unfornately, due to alot of stuff I want to get done and my own quest to learn
more then just about DarkBASIC, the book probably won't be done this summer, I will
work on it when I get the time but for now it won't be done for awhile.

-Jonathan

----

Hey DarkBASIC fans, update coming soon I'm hard at work on the Space Invader clone! Hope you've all been having a great summer.

- Jonathan

----

Does it matter what kind of DarkBASIC I'm using?

RE: Probably not at this point in time, however I used DarkBASIC Classic in this book.

----

I think you made an error in Lesson 8 - 2d Game Programming Pt 2, where the first piece of code is. 

----

== Grammar ==

Hi - thanks for the DB tutorials.

A bit of constructive criticism - get a friend to proof read your text as there are a lot of grammatical mistakes.

Cheers

Richard C

RE: Yes I have a big problem with grammar! Point taken. :)

== Note ==
Update: I definately will not finish the book. School is very demmanding,
and I no longer use Windows. If anyone wants to take up the task and finish
writing the book I would be very happy. Please continue to edit and contribute
to this book hopefully it's helped many.

I don't think I can finish this book. I'm too busy with school, and learning
more about programming. Please, if you think you can finish it for me. I will
sometimes add to this book but only in small amounts.

Sorry,
Jonathan/Dbtutor


great stuff!

please continue!

i know a lot of people read this and i need more info too.</text>

darcs, from my perspective:

I had a directory called minhaskell. Minhaskell contained lots of source files. Every time I would be satisfied with the state of minhaskell, I would copy the whole directory. This became unwieldy since I had 15 or so directories named &quot;minhaskellbackupmonthday&quot;

darcs to the rescue

I change directoried into minhaskell and I said &quot;let there be a repository&quot;:

darcs init

and I saw the repository, that it was good. In english: &quot;darcs init&quot; means &quot;minhaskell and all its subdirectories are now a repository&quot;

and I said &quot;let us populate this repository with files&quot;:

darcs record -am &quot;Initial import.&quot;

and I called patch &quot;Initial import.&quot; In english: 'darcs record -am &quot;Initial import.&quot;' means 'record every change that's been done so far, namely &quot;darcs add -r&quot;. The -m Initial import.&quot; tells darcs to name the patch &quot;Initial import.&quot;. Furthermore the -a tells darcs that I do not wish to be prompted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Specifications=

For model years 1989 and 1990 the Nissan 240SX used a KA24E. 

The '''KA24E''' is a 2.4 liter single overhead cam (SOHC) 12-valve engine .It uses SEFI fuel injection, and contrary to popular rumor among KA24 owners, they do not feature forged steel connecting rods, but an internally half-counterweight one-piece cast crankshaft, and a cast aluminum intake manifold.

* Bore &amp;times; Stroke: 89.0 &amp;times; 96.0 mm
* Max power: 140 hp (105 kW) @ 5600 rpm
* Max torque: 152 ft·lbf (206 Nm) @ 4400 rpm
* Valve Configuration: SOHC, 12 valves
* Compression ratio: 8.6:1 (9.1:1 for early 1989 240SX )

The '''KA24DE''' is the stock engine for 1991 to 1998 S13 and S14 240SX 
vehicles. It is a 2.4 Liter DOHC Engine. 

* Bore &amp;times; Stroke: 89.0 &amp;times; 96.0 mm
* Max power: 155 hp (115 kW) @ 5600 rpm
* Max torque: 160 ft·lbf (217 Nm) @ 4400 rpm
* Valve Configuration: DOHC, 16 valves
* Compression ratio: 9.5:1 (S14/95-98) 9.0:1 (S13/91-94)

=NA Modifications=
Basic N/A tuning can net you average increases out of your KA24DE / KA24E engine. The KA24 is a larger displacment 4 cylinder motor. It was mainly built with low end torque in mind. It also uses a long piston stroke to achieve it's torque. This prevents it from having the high rev limit that is seen with other Nissan 4 cylinder motors. With the basic bolt-ons, you can expect to see an additional 30whp depending on the condition of your engine.  Don't expect any huge horesepower gains from inexpensive NA modifications. While it's possible to reach 200+ horsepower, it will take superior tuning skills, along with pretty deep pockets. Most of this power is had through [[ECU]] tuning and custom parts, including cams, ITB's, larger valves, port and polish, and upgraded valvetrain. A complete engine overhaul is also recommended if any modifications are to be planned. These bolt-on parts are usually installed for KA24 NA buildups:

      <comment>/* JDM Engines */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
Engine swaps are one way that Nissan 240SX owners increase the power of their vehicles. Swapping in engines from Japanese market vehicles such as the 180SX, Silvia, and Skyline can be both rewarding and frustrating. Less common engine swaps like VQ series engines (from the US Market 350Z and Maxima) and Domestic V8's have also been done.

==Sourcing An Engine==
JDM Engine swaps can be purchased from several sources in the United states. JDM Engine swaps usually are available in 2 forms. 

A motorset usually includes everything you need to get it into your chassis, however, it is usually shipped as a mass of parts that might be a bit confusing for a novice mechanic. 

A front clip consists of the entire front portion of a car, cut behind the dashboard and shipped from Japan complete. Clips are a bit easier for novice mechanics to make sense of because they can see where every part belongs before they install them on their own cars. As an added bonus, clips might sometimes include aftermarket parts or JDM body parts. the downside of clips is that they usually cost more to purchase and ship than motorsets.

==Legality==
===JDM Engines===
JDM engine swaps are legal for on-road use in the US in a select few states. California 240SX owners have many additional inspection requirements that make owning a 240SX with a JDM engine swap a bit more of a hassle than other states.

===USDM Engines===
In some circumstances, USDM (sold in the united states) engine swaps are legal, as long as the engine is newer than the chassis it is installed in and the new engine retains all of the smog equipment it came with from the factory.

For 1995 and newer 240sx's this includes the fully functioning OBDII system. 

Check with your state and county emissions regulation authorities for specifics on required pollution control equipment and testing procedures.

The most common swap is to an LS series (aluminum block), which is most popular from the Corvette (but was also used in other vehicles such as the Trailblazer SS, Cadillac CTS-V, &amp; 05/06 Pontiac GTO).  The iron LT blocks should be do-able also.  There is a 6 speed manual transmission available.

==Modifications:==
===Short Shifter===
A short shifter changes the fulcrum point of the shift linkage, this allows for a shorter throw to engage the gears.

[[/short shifter reviews/]]

===Clutch===

A clutch exists in Standard Transmission (manual) cars in order to separate the motor from the driveshaft for shifting and stopping. A clutch consists of a Flywheel, which is bolted to the Crankshaft of the motor, and a Friction Disc, which is bolted to the Manual Transmission input shaft. Depressing of the clutch pedal (which can be hydraulic, fluid, actuated or manual) separates the friction disc from the flywheel face, thus allowing the engine to spin free of the driveshaft/tires. Engaging the clutch by releasing the clutch pedal forces, via springs, the friction disc to contact the flywheel, which causes the transmission to spin the driveshaft and tires.


----


Old Definition:

In a car, you need a clutch because the engine spins all the time, but the car wheels don't. In order for a car to stop without killing the engine, the wheels need to be disconnected from the engine somehow. The clutch allows us to smoothly engage a spinning engine to a non-spinning transmission by controlling the slippage between them. 

(Thanks to http://auto.howstuffworks.com/clutch.htm)



[[/Clutch Reviews/]]

===Flywheel===

A flywheel is another component of the drivetrain in a Standard (manual) transmission vehicle. The Flywheel is bolted to the crankshaft of the motor. The job of the flywheel is to cause the transmission to spin via friction from the friction disc (which bolts to the manual transmission).

While lighter flywheels are theoretically better, the reduction of inertia between firing cycles of the motor can in effect reduce efficiency of the motor, countering its own intended purpose.

----

Old Definition:

An aluminum flywheel is a great modification to free up drivetrain loss, Create less shock damage on hard shifting from reduced inertia, Help the engine rev and respond quicker, and reduce time for the RPM to drop between shifts so during racing a rev match may be achieved sooner.

[[/Flywheel Reviews/]]

== 300ZX Transmission Upgrade ==
A '90-'98 300zx VG30DE or VG30DETT manual transmission can be installed using an adapter kit made by Mazworx Racing, which includes the adapter plate, shifter re-loaction bracket, transission crossmember, steel driveshaft (optional aluminum or carbon) and assoiciated machining of the bell housing to fit the SR20DET or KA24DE.

Xcessive Manufacturing also makes an adapter kit, which allows the use of an un-modified 300ZX (z32) transmission/bellhousing.

The 300zx tranny upgrade is the best thing for high powered sr(s) that are blowing through transmissions.

=Automatic Transmission=
==Automatic to Manual Transmission Swap==
===WHAT YOU NEED===

shifter &amp; transmission.

'''(EDIT - TYLOR DURDAN - Also need the manual spacer plate between the motor and the transmission)''' - Not necessary

clutch &amp; brake pedal. - Auto brake pedal can be cut

master &amp; slave cylinder.

5 speed bellhousing to engine bolts(flange is thicker on manual needing longer bolts)

steel hydraulic lines, which will deliver pressure from the clutch master cylinder to the clutch slave cylinder, which pushes on the throwout bearing. - braided line can be used instead of steel ones

manual tranny crossmember.

manual flywheel w/ bolts.

manual transmission driveshaft or custom one piece driveshaft for a manual transmission.

Computer for a manual transmission car. (Not always necessary. A ground loop can be installed to the starter circuit connector under the hood [Black w/ White stripe and Black w/ Yellow stripe wires are the two wires on this circuit, and jumpering eliminates the need for the new ECU]) '''(EDIT-WRONG! regardless of which ECU you use, this is a needed jumper. This part of the harness is a mechanical break in the starter circuitry interupted by the transmission itself. - Tylor Durdan)'''

Pilot bushing to install in crankshaft of engine. - called spigot bush

Shop manual (these are available on ebay.  You will need it for the wiring modifications needed to install the neutral safety switch and clutch safety switch so the cruise control will work.)

===MODIFICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE===

The hole for the clutch master cylinder and the 2 mounting bolts must be drilled out of the firewall. This is very easy, as they are clearly marked out on the firewall.

I found that a 1 3/8&quot; hole saw works perfect for the hole for the master cylinder to mate to the firewall. Use a center punch to line it up before drilling or you'll be disappointed with the fitment. (WJ)

The hydraulic hard lines for the clutch must be installed.

The brake pedal must be replaced with the assembly for the manual transmission (don't forget the brake light switch).

You can cut your auto brake pedal down to size with a grinder, dremel, etc. instead of performing the long task of swapping the brake pedal. (WJ)

Clutch pedal from your model year is the best bet. I used an S13 pedal on my S14 but had to fab two spacers (1 1/8&quot; or so) to make it work for the mounting bolts as the S14 pedal has spacers built into the pedal assembly whereas the S13 uses spacers attached to the interior firewall. If you are using spacers ensure that the clutch pedal assembly lines up successfully with the existing or swapped brake pedal. (WJ)

The shift lock feature of the automatic transmission must be defeated. This can be done two ways. 1: Run a new wire from the ignition cylinder to the starter solenoid. 2. Bypass (short)the switch.

If retaining the auto radiator, block off the transmission cooler lines located on the bottom of the radiator.

Remove the automatic bushing adaptor from the crankshaft and install the manual pilot bushing. The automatic adaptor is a real PITA to get out. The most effective way that &quot;I&quot; know of is to use a carbide side cutter and carefully cut a slot in it, then compress it with a good set of vice grips and then pull it out. I have broken 3 pilot bushing pullers trying to get it using the &quot;right tool&quot;.

I successfully used the bushing puller after cutting the automatic bushing with a dremel and cutting wheel at 12/3/6/9 o'clock and then at 1:30/4:30/7:30/10:30. Warning! Be careful to NOT cut into the crankshaft with any tool. (WJ)The boy's over at Team Clockwork Performance use a large pipe wrench (monkey wrench) inserted into a large pipe for leverage and use a twisting motion to get the bushing out. One person holds the crank from spinning with a socket and breaker bar while the other spins the bushing enough times for it to slide off. Use this method with caution.

      <comment>/* Welding your Stock Differential */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The rear differential affects how your 240SX puts power from the rear wheels to the ground. Several types of diff are available for different types of driving. 
=Welding your Stock Differential=
Weld locking the stock differential is a popular but controversial modification. Welding a differential is typically done to a drift-use car, and is unfavorable to daily-driving conditions. With the proper knowledge daily driving a welded differential can be a livable experience. 

The &quot;welded diff&quot; is done by welding the spider gears together in the factory differential. Special care should be taken to make the most durable welds possible, some have welded thick bolts onto the spider gears to make for a stronger weld. Failure could result in an immobilized diff which would cause an unsafe condition for you, and those around you. 

Pros:

- Breaks traction consistently, makes drifting much easier than open diff.

- It's cheap, a welder will charge something near 50$ USD to weld. Replacement differentials can be found used for around 40$ USD. 

- It's extremely durable when done properly.

- Little to no maintenance. 

Cons:

- Requires a different way of taking corners. taking care not to break the tires loose and cause oversteer.

- Tires make noise at very low speeds (typically parking, or U-turns) as the wheels &quot;fight&quot; each other. The wheels are traveling at the same speed, but along different radii, which causes the inside wheel to shake, hop, and break loose at low speeds. This will increase tire wear in normal use, but if you really care about tire wear over performance, you wouldn't be welding a differential. Let it also be known that most 2-way LSD's exhibit this same characteristic, especially the more aggressive ones. 

- Not recommended for inexperienced grip driving. Can be very effective and far more consistent than an open differential, but requires advanced driving techniques.

- If the welds break, they can cause differential lock, and lead to a potential accident.

[[/How to weld your stock diff/]]

=OEM LSD's=
==Viscous Limited Slip Differential (VLSD)==
[[Image:S13HICAS.jpg|200px|thumb|A S13 HICAS VLSD]]

A viscous differential works by heating a thick fluid, making it expand. The diff has 2 plates close together (one for each axle), similar to a clutch type diff, but they never touch each other.  When the wheels spin in opposite directions the fluid between the plates is heated up and expands, locking the plates together.  As you can imagine its not a very efficient lock, but the smooth power transfer makes it the most streetable limited slip differenital.

VLSD may not be a direct drop into the S chassis cars.  The LSD that works best on a 240SX is the R200V.  Depending on what vehicle the R200 comes from, the differential cover, output shafts, and drive shaft may need to be swapped as well.  The S14 only has a 2 bolt rear cover while the S13 has a 4 bolt.  Also the output shafts may be 5 bolt outputs, so the axles may also need to be changed from the stock 6 bolt axles.  They were an option for all 240sx, but are more rare in the US.  The drive shaft on a factory LSD equipped 240sx is about 3/4&quot; shorter than non-LSD models, and likewise the VLSD unit is about 3/4&quot; longer than the open differential.  Some have reported using a non-LSD drive shaft with a VLSD and not having issues.  The R200V differential came on many other cars, such as the Infiniti J30, Q45, Skyline R32, S13 240sx W/ Hicas, and 300zx (n/a only; the turbo models have an R230 that won't fit without more complex modifications).  Because of the availability of these differentials, the VLSD is an obtainable and practical LSD upgrade for the stock 240sx.  Be careful about the gear ratio, though.  There can be a difference in the gear ratio depending on the vehicle you source the R200V from, and this can affect the accuracy of the speedometer and also make the engine run at a different RPM at a given speed when compared to the stock unit.

The Z32 (1991+) 300ZX non-turbo has a R200V differential; the turbo has a 220mm ring gear and won't fit S13/14/15. It has the 5 bolt axles, which you can source from a 1991 J30. They are the proper length and spline to fit at least the S13.

==S15 Helical LSD==
The S15 differential has gears that are cut in a fashion that when the car is turning the gears mesh together and transfer power to the tire with more traction.  It does not lock like a clutch diff, but is very smooth.  The best thing about a helical diff is that it practically never wears out.  You can treat it the same as an open diff: change the oil regularly and it will likely outlast the car.

The S15 helical differential is probably the best diff for road racing applications.  It is not recomended for drifting because it never actually locks. The differential can only multiply the torque it can apply at the side with low traction, so if one tire has very little traction (such as on ice or in the air) then the differential will act the same as an open differential.

=Aftermarket LSD's=
==Clutch Type==
The Clutch type differential works much like you would expect.  There are a number of wet clutch plates close together and when the power needs to be transfered the clutch plates lock together helping the power get to the wheel with more traction.  
There are three common types of clutch differentials used:  1-way, 1.5way and 2 way, each with its own advantages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Stock=
The stock drive shaft is a 2-piece unit which weighs in at approximatly 18 lbs.  The front section is transmission specific (auto or manual) and the rear section is ABS specific (either you have it or you dont).  There is a carrier bearing in the center of the 2 pieces which can be used as a catch if you were to upgrade to a aftermarket one piece drive shaft.

=Aluminum Drive Shaft=
Many places sell them for arround $400.  The are substantially lighter and stiffer helping you transfer more power to the wheels.

=Carbon Fiber Drive Shaft= 
These are not very much lighter than the aluminum version, but they are safer.  If you drop the aluminum one it will break and then rotate around destroying the bottom side of your chassis and possibly making you crash.  The carbon fiber one will disintegrate as soon as it hits the pavement, not harming anything besides itself.  IMO is not worth the extra money, just be sure to use have a drive shaft catch and check the bolts before and after every track day.

A 1 piece driveshaft can be installed in lieu of the stock 2 piece. This will by nature reduce weight and decrease drivetrain &quot;slop&quot; over stock. There are various companies that produce these in steel, aluminum, and carbon fiber based tubes. You may also bring your current one to a local driveshaft repair facility to recondition the stock U joints and convert it to a single piece tubular steel driveshaft for low cost. Note that driveshafts are all different based on whether or not its an s13 or s14/auto or manual/and if equipped with abs or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">shocks and springs are an inexpensive alternative to full coilovers to give your car a lower, stiffer, more sporty ride. Lower springs with a stiffer spring rate will make your car ride rough, the tradeoff is reduced weight transfer and greater stabillity when cornering. 

=Shocks=
Shocks keep the springs on your car from constantly bouncing by providing resistance to the lateral motion of the shock and spring assembly. 

Aftermarket shocks usually have features like adjustibility or support for lower height springs. 


[[/shock reviews/]]

=Springs=
Springs dictate the ride height of the car and the motion of the dampers. 

Stiff, low springs allow of reduced weight transfer when accelerating and cornering at the cost of reduced ride comfort.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=COILOVERS=


== Benefits over Spring and Shock Assembly==
This is a set (spring and shock) sold together.  It is better than a spring and shock assembly for many reason.  They usually come with stiffer springs, and the shocks are matched to the spring rates that they come with.  Also they are usually ride height adjustable so you can lower your car at will, as well as corner weight it.  A lot of them are also dual ride height adjustable.  This means that the spring can be preload at will and the rest of the assembly can be lowered as a whole.  The shock as a whole descends through the knuckle and makes it so the shock piston is at the optimal range while being lowered to maintain optimal suspension travel.

Front options for S-chassis

S13 USDM ('89-'94) rotors are 252x20mm (non ABS) or 257x22mm (with ABS)

S13 Silvia/180SX (CA18DET) rotors are smaller than S13 Silvia/180SX (SR20DET) brakes. Maybe they are the size of S13 USDM brakes?

S13 Silvia/180SX (SR20DET) rotors are 280x22mm

Altima rotors are 280x22mm

Z32 rotors are 280x 26mm or 30mm


rear options for S-chassis

S13 - 10&quot; non-vented rotor, smaller single piston caliper, integral handbrake

S14/S15 - 10&quot; non-vented rotor, larger single piston caliper, integral handbrake

A31 Cefiro - 10.5&quot; non-vented rotor, smaller single piston caliper, drum handbrake

J30/Q45 - 11&quot; vented rotor, large single piston caliper, drum handbrake

Z32/R32 - 11.75&quot; vented rotor, 2-piston caliper, drum handbrake

=Stock Brake Improvements=
The factory brake system can be optimized by using a good brand of sport/racing pads, high quality rotors and fresh high quality brake fluid.  These items will assist in getting the most out of the hardware provided by the manufacturer, and are generally the best bang for the buck upgrade. This is considered sufficient for many owners and can lock some very sticky tires easily while retaining the most linear modularity.

Late model 5-lug S14s('97-'98) have slightly larger rotors and use a considerably larger pad than other models.

=Maxima / 180SX spec Brake Swap=
The owners of S14's ('95-'98), can upgrade their brakes using 1995 Nissan Maxima calipers, rotors and pads, and for those with 4 bolt use 1995 Nissan Altima rotors with a 3mm spacer between the caliper and the spindle.



For the owners of S13s ('89-'94) You can upgrade your stock front brakes to JDM 180SX spec using USDM parts. This upgrades main benefit is the additional mass to the rotor for heat dissipation. The caliper pistons are not so large as to impact braking bias more than a trivial amount. The following will be needed for this swap: [[Image: S13vs180brakes.jpg|thumb|stock non abs s13 brakes VS 180sx style brakes]]

('93-'97) 1st generation Nissan altima rotors. These are 280x22mm and have a 4x114 bolt pattern.

('89-'99) 3rd and 4th generation Nissan Maxima brake calipers

('89-'99) 3rd and 4th generation Nissan Maxima brake caliper mounting brackets

('89-'99) 3rd and 4th generation Nissan Maxima brake caliper mounting bracket hardware kit

('89-'99) 3rd and 4th generation Nissan Maxima brake pads

These parts all directly bolt onto the s13 with no major modifications needed. This swap retains near stock
[[Image: Padoverhang.jpg|thumb|stock non abs s13 brakes VS 180sx style brakes]]
Before and after pictures of swap done on '90 240sx without abs:



Concerns worth noting:

-The brake swap will not fit anything smaller than a 15&quot; alloy wheel. This will not clear a stamped steel wheel and drags on the caliper paralell surface.

- The stock rotor dust shield no longer clears the larger brake rotor. Modifications or removal to this are necessary for fitment. 2&quot; deep slices with shears spaced 1.5&quot; apart should be sufficient to allow the outside edge to be bent flat.

-The pad hangs over the edge from this setup by approximately 5mm. Although it is visually striking, it does not negatively impact braking performance or cause any reliability issues. 



*** YOU CAN USE 2000-2003 Nissan Sentra SE-R 11 inch rotors instead of altima rotors and there is no gap, they work perfect and are the same size as 180sx rotors exactly. -Boyce boycelaforest@aldatas.com


The sentra SE-R Rotors are the exact same thing. There are 2 different part numbers. One is the exact same rotor as the U13U. The other is a different part number but the only difference is that the hat is painted black...THATS IT - Someone who actually knows what they're talking about
***update***
Boyce is correct:

Tried the 2001 SE-R rotors, they are same size as my old 180sx rotors and I have no gap on mine, friends car with altima rotors has gap. (verified by chad)

=300ZX (Z32/r32/jdm silvia) Brakes Swap =
300ZX Brake 4 piston Calipers and Rotors are an available swap for the stock 240SX braking system. They require the following parts:

('xx-'xx) 300zx calipers or alternative compatible replacements

('xx-'xx) Skyline calipers

('xx-'xx) Jdm s14 silvia calipers

('xx-'xx) Rotors

('xx-'xx) Pads

('xx-'xx) R32 ebrake cable (optional if rear brakes are swapped to retain optimal brake bias and ebrake functionality)

('xx-'xx) Master cylinder (optional if rear brakes are swapped to retain optimal brake bias)

Q45 Brake Upgrade:

Hi guys, this is AmatsuDorifuto of ImportFanatix.com Forums here to give some input of what is needed for the Infiniti Q45 brake upgrade for the 240sx.

Step 1: Purchases =
A) 90 - 96 Q45 front brake calipers
B) 90 - 96 Q45 front brake pads
C) 90 - 96 Q45 front brake rotors

Step 2: Removal of old equipment =
A) Loosen the lug nuts on the front two wheels
B) Jack up the front of the car and support on jack stands
C) Remove both wheels
D) Remove calipers by removing the two 14mm bolts
E) Remove caliper brackets by removing two 19mm bolts
F) Your pads, rotors, and any other stuff will come off now.

Step 3: Installation of new equipment =
Pretty simple, it's the opposite of removal.

Enjoy your new brakes! They will perform much better than stock.

=Aftermarket Brake Systems=
Several aftermarket braking system upgrades are available and for sale for the nissan 240SX such as AP Racing, Wilwood, Project MU, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">5 lug hubs allow for a wider wheel selection this is a popular upgrade among 240SX owners with 4 lug hubs.
=S13=
Front: 2-3hrs


Aftermarket 5 lug hubs are available from GTO/Attain. This makes swapping the front very easy. The hub and bearing are already pressed together, eliminating the need for a hydraulic press.&lt;br&gt;
Parts:&lt;br&gt;
Aftermarket wheel hubs w/ bearings&lt;br&gt;
5-lug rotor (300zx if converting to larger 4 piston caliper, otherwise redrilled stock rotors or S14 rotors should work)&lt;br&gt;
New cotter pin&lt;br&gt;
Process:
# Remove wheel, brake caliper, and rotor.
# Remove the dust cover, cotter pin, and the nut cover from the hub.
# Before removing the hub nut, make sure that the threads are clean and free from debris. The nut is torqued down tight, if an impact gun is not available, you can brace the hub assembly between the lug studs with any suitable item, you will not need the studs, as there are new ones already pressed into the new hub.
# Now is a good time to clean off any rust and to remove the dust shield if you are planning on using 300ZX brakes.
# Assemble in reverse order. Torque the hub nut to 75-85 ft-lbs and replace the cotter pin.

Rear: 3-5hrs
The rear requires a bit more work than the front and more time should be allowed to accomplish.&lt;br&gt;
Parts:&lt;br&gt;
S14 rear wheel bearing with flange&lt;br&gt;
S14 5-lug rear wheel hub (make sure to get the 5-lug hub, not all S14's have 5-lug hubs)&lt;br&gt;
S14 5-lug rear rotor&lt;br&gt;
New cotter pin&lt;br&gt;
Process:
# Remove wheel, brake caliper, brake rotor.
# There are 4 bolts on the back side of the hub that have to be removed to get the wheel bearing separated from the axle housing. All four can be removed without removing the axle housing, just turn the hub to gain access.
# Remove the cotter pin, nut cap, and wheel bearing lock nut.
# If you are lucky you will be able to remove the wheel bearing and hub assembly. Chances are though that the wheel bearing is seated very well inside the axle housing. If this is the case, the axle housing will have to be removed.
# The suspension links need to be disconnected, this includes the damper, lower control arm, upper control arm, and the traction rod. When disconnecting the lower control arm use a ball joint separator ( not the pickle fork type) and carefully separate this joint. If the rubber boot is damaged, the ball joint will need to be replaced.
# Remove the axle from the axle housing. It is a good idea to protect the threads and the boots of the drive shaft with a cloth. Separate the drive shaft from the axle housing by tapping on the axle end with a rubber or copper mallet (never hardened steel).
# With the axle housing removed, you should be able to tap out the bearing from the back side with a rubber mallet. Be careful not to score the machined surface of the axle housing.
# '''*This step can be accomplished before hand*''' Take your new hub and bearing to a local machine or auto shop (or a good friend with a hydraulic press) and have the two pressed together.
# Clean the axle housing of all rust. Now might also be a good time to install new bushings, as it is almost all apart anyway.
#* An alternate rear hub removal solution for those stubborn hubs is to...
#** remove the four bolts on the back of the hub axle housing.
#** remove axle nut and washer.
#** unbolt the control arms from the rear suspension housing with the exception of the lower control arm...leave it bolted to the housing.
#** unbolt the rear shock from the housing.
#** lean the housing forward and remove the axle spindle from the hub.
#** at this point you should have the hub still pressed into the housing and the housing still bolted to the lower control arm.
#** lean the housing forward towards you, careful not to put too much stress on the ball joint.
#** get a large hammer (BFH) and distribute several well placed blows on the back of the hub while holding the housing with your other hand.
#** the hub should simply pop out.
#** '''Warning, it is possible to ruin the hub you're trying to remove with this method.  The hub will come out but could be unusable afterwards.  Since you are replacing it anyway who cares, it's only a 4 lug hub'''
#** Continue steps 10 and beyond.
# The new hub and bearing assembly should slide nicely into the axle housing, if it does not, you can &quot;clean up&quot; the axle housing with some fine emery cloth.
# Torque the 4 bolts that connect the hub assembly to the axle housing to 58-72 ft-lb.
# Re-install the axle housing, don't forget to re-install the axle in the housing, taking care to protect the threads.
# Torque values for the suspension components are: RUCA- 57-72 ft-lb, RLCA- 52-64 ft-lb, traction rod- 57-72 ft-lb, Damper- 65-80ft-lb. All final torque values should be accomplished with the vehicle on the ground. (Good luck)
# Install the wheel bearing lock nut and bearing, torque to 152-203 ft-lb, install nut cap and new cotter pin.
# Install new brake rotor.
# It is a good idea to check the wheel bearing axial end play. It should be less than .05mm or .0020in

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;nowiki&gt;Insert non-formatted text here&lt;/nowiki&gt;Chassis Strengthening adds rigidity to the chassis.


Chassis Bracing
Several modifications may be done to the 240sx to strengthen the chassis.

'''Strut Bars'''
Strut bars are designed to make a monocoque or unibody chassis design stronger and much more rigid than from how it was built in the factory. Most strut bars are commonly found on a Mac Pherson strut system chassis car. Strut bars prevent what is known as chassis flex from occurring and allowing the monocoque or unibody chassis from twisting or creating torsion due to horizontal movement in the strut towers. Strengthening the strut towers allows the chassis to stabilize under harder and stronger G forces making it much more superior to the common factory suspension.

'''Strut Tower Reinforcement'''
The strut towers on the 240sx were &quot;economically&quot; produced using a form of epoxy to bond the turrets to the caps. A popular and efficient modification is to grind out the epoxy, drill holes, and weld the pieces together for reinforcement. Any bracing for the 240sx strut towers can be considered positive.

'''Fender Braces'''
These stiffen up the front by providing a strong link between the bulkhead and just past the firewall. This can help increase overall chassis rigidity making your front end stiffer, and turn in, the steering response is better. However, there have been reports that these can dial in understeer.

'''Tension Rod Braces'''
The tension rod mounts tend to be thin and flex substantially, so a form of reinforcement in that area produces noticeable results. Using a Nismo power brace will replace the mounts with a permanently welded bar and plate reinforcements. There are also other replacements that include adjustable bars which don't replace the mounts. Examples such as the Powertrix tension rod brace. Additional T/c rod brace solutions include Tanabe, Nismo, C-Tune, Cusco, etc. These bars are a guaranteed performance increaser. There is some ambiguity about the over/under steer tendencies so an adjustable bar can be useful there.

'''C-Pillar Bars'''
The s13 hatch in particular has a fair amount of flex in the c-pillar area due to the extensive size of the rear opening. A viable upgrade would be a c-pillar reinforcement bar that bolts to the rear seatbelt mounts. It should be noted that the mounts on the s13 Zenki ('89-'90) are more towards the glass and the s13 Chuki ('91-'94) hatchback seatbelt mounts are parallel. A solid metal bar may be economically produced by measuring the distance between the 2 points and drilling mounting holes for this model. 

Note: These bracings are produced as well for coupes, but in those instances tend to mainly just be cosmetic since its not a weak point for them.

'''Lower Rear Tie Bar'''
Connects rear lower control arm to the center of the rear sub-frame to help stiffen the chassis. They are a good thing, but the difference is very minute. It is minor and considered more of a cosmetic part than a functional one. This should be last on your list if at all.


'''Misc. Chassis Bracing'''
Other options such as ladder bars, drivetrain tunnel bracing, lower shock tie bars, and floor bars are also available, but do not produce as much of a noticeable gain as the parts mentioned above. These aren't quite popular as they tend to require custom fabbing instead of them being a straight bolt-on affair.


=Roll Cage=
Keep in mind that if you are going to add a cage you need to pay attention to the type of material and construction (I.E. cold rolled steel, chromoly, etc) If you are serious enough to put in a cage you probably compete with your car in different classes. Keep in mind that there are minimum requirements to compete in certain classes. A cage suitable for your local drag track might not be acceptable as a GT3 class car, or an SCCA competition.

===Custom Made===
A custom built roll cage is usually built to fill a requirement in a specific racing class. Roll cage guidelines for different classes can be found here (Insert Links)

===Prefab===
Several companies produce roll cages for the 240sx such as Autopower and Cusco. You can get a cage as simple as a 4 point and as complicated as 8 points premade (as many as you want when custom)

''Welcome to NYC, where, around every corner, there is something on the wall. Each bend you turn there is another piece sprayed or written on the wall. They all vary: KEZ1...SUBJECT...TKZ...You watch people turn their heads in disgust as they look at this vandalism.''

''I turn and smile at it.''


Welcome to the world of graffiti. However, before you turn your head from this page, know this:

If Leonardo Da Vinci had painted Mona Lisa on his neighbor's wall, then they would have turned their heads in disgust. But it was a professional canvas painting, and is now famous. But, due to the massive abuse of spray paint on walls, any form of calligraphy that has arrows, dots, stars,and fast curves in it is looked at with disgust.If anyone did that to my house, I'd get them locked up for it.

But as an artform, it's beautiful.

      <comment>/* 96+ s14 DOHC engine */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This section is for people who have a 1989 or 1990 240SX and want to install a later model KA24DE. 
Before we get to each of the engines, here is the car prep that needs to be done. 

-The accelerator cable needs to be changed. The sohc cable is shorter and doesn't have enough travel. I have heard that people have stretched it across the engine and when I tried that it held the throttle plate open. Maybe it can be done, but it will look like crap.

-The power steering lines need to be changed over. The s13 lines work better, but with a little bit of finesse (adjusting) I was able to make s14 p/s lines work in the s13 coupe. The s13 dohc p/s resevoir will bolt right on the strut tower. tThe s14 resevoir doesn't fit quite as well, but can be made to work. If using a s14 engine, the ps pumps have different connections for the ps lines. I.E. If you get a s14 engine and want to use that ps pump, you will need the s14 lines. If you are using a s13 engine and are using that pump you will have to get s13 ps lines. The lines won't interchange with the pumps, but the pumps will interchange on the engines. (this will be posted again further down).

-The tachometer will need to be changed out to a dohc s13 unit. The signal is different between the two. The tach can be removed from the cluster, or the whole cluster can be changed. (The s14 tach won't work, because the physical size of the tach is different.) 

-The water temperature sensor from the SOHC engine needs to be used. For some reason the resistance is different. If you use the stock sensor from the DOHC engine, it will register on the gauge as being higher than with the SOHC unit.

-Go ahead and remove the coil assembly from the car. The SOHC one won't work on the DOHC engine. I'll explain more on this further down. 

==S13 DOHC engine== 

To swap a S13 DOHC, all the above needs to be done. 
-Use the coil setup from the DOHC donor car. 

-The engine wiring harness and ECU will need to be replaced with one for the S13 DE engine. The dash connector will need to be cut off the SOHC engine harness (where it meets the dash harness), and soldered to the DOHC engine harness in the same location. There will be wires that are left floating so don't worry. All the wires that need to be connected will be color matched. For example: just put red to red, and white to white, etc.

-If using a stock exhaust system the down pipe from SOHC will bolt to the S13 exhaust manifold there won't be any issues. The EGR will work as well.

-The MAFS from the DOHC car will need to be used. The SOHC's MAFS won't work with the DOHC's ECU. If you want to change the plug you can even use a S14 mafs, it has a bigger opening. NOTE*** I haven't done this! I am basing this on the fact the SAFC II shows both MAFS to be the same type. (Type 5 in the SAFC library)

-The heater core hose locations are the same and will work between each.

-The S13 PS pump has to have S13 PS lines. S14 PS lines won't bolt up without modification.

==95 s14 DOHC engine==

-The 95 engines have the same electrical connectors on the intake as the s13 dohc engines. You can use a s13 dohc wiring harness and ecu with no problems. 

-If you use the s13 engine harness you'll need to change the distributor to a s13 dohc unit and add the coil assembly. (All s14 distributors have internal coil). 

-If you use the 95 s14 harness there are a lot more wires to weed through. You will also need to make sure you update to a s14 tranny if you want to keep the ecu happy. Because the crank angle sensor is located on the tranny bell housing. The s13 tranny doesn't have a provision for the crank angle sensor. If you don't care about the check engine light, then use a s13 tranny and don't worry about the crank angle sensor.

Boats and hoes*

-If wanting to use a 96+ harness and ecu, then all the sensors have to be changed including the tps. Best thing is to not use a 96+ harness and ecu.

-Regardless of which harness/ecu combo the mafs will need to be updated to a dohc unit. Easiest thing is to use the mafs that fits the plug (minus the sohc unit).

-The egr tube will need to be changed because the angle and placement to where it connects with the exhaust manifold is in a different location between s13 and s14. I don't know if a s14 after market header will have clearance issues on a s13. Best thing to do is to change the exhaust manifold/header over to a s13 unit and change the egr tube or eliminate it altogether. (I don't condone this, I'm merely pointing out the possibilities.)

-The heater core hoses are different sizes between the s14 engine and s13 chassis. You will have to rig something up to work. The location of the outlets on the engine is different as well. On the s13 engine/intake plenum they come out the back of the engine. On the s14 engine/intake plenum they come out the side underneath the plenum. Break vacuum line will have to be extend about 3-4 inches because the sohc is too short.  

-The s14 ps pump has to have s14 ps lines. s13 ps lines won't bolt up without modification.

{{FULLPAGENAME}}==96+ s14 DOHC engine==

-The easiest thing to do here is replace the intake manifold with a s13 manifold and electronics. And then just follow directions above.

-And again the 96+ engine harness and ecu can be used, but the wiring is more involved. With the exception of the engine harness and electrical connectors, everything else swaps just like above.

-The s14 ps pump has to have s14 ps lines. s13 ps lines won't bolt up without modification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The SR20DET is the most commonly swapped engine into the 240SX Chassis. The Availibility of the engine and the relative ease of the swap make this a popular choice for 240SX owners who want more power. 


==Specs and Versions==
SR = Block

20 = 2.0L Displacement

D = Dohc
E = Electronic Fuel Injection

T = Turbocharger



SR20DET Red Top

2.0L DOHC Turbo 

Turbo Type: T25 

Compressor A/R: 0.80 

Injector Size: 370cc 

Bore x Stroke: 86.0mm x 86.0mm

Displacement: 1998cc 

Performance: SR20DET:

Power (HP): 208@ 6,000 rpm

Torque (TQ): 204@ 4000 rpm

Compression Ratio: 8.5:1 

Speed Limiter:180 Kmh -112 mph

Stock Boost: 7 psi 

ECU: 62 (redtop) OR E5 (blacktop). 63 (automatic) will also work. 

MAFS: 89-90 240sx mafs works. MAF is a 52F00 for SR20DET. the 40F00 from the 89/90 240SX works, but resolution is off a bit. Not the same power/drive ability potential as factory SR MAFS

Rev Limit: 7500rpm (no need to really go over 7000) 


The SR20DET is available in several different stock forms ranges in power from between 205HP and 250HP.

S13 &quot;Redtop&quot; - Came from S13 Silvias and 180sx 1990-94 (Garrett T25 turbo). Easily identifiable by bright red valve cover. Equipped with 370cc injectors and a side mount intercooler. Uses 'Skinny' O2 sensor. With raised boost to the s13 Redtop motor can push 250hp safely with no modifications. Maximum Safe boost on the stock turbo is 13psi-15psi. The Engine Should produce 230-250rwhp on safe boost. With a larger turbo (e.g. GT2871r), bigger MAF (e.g. Z32 N62) and upgraded fuel delivery (e.g. 255lph pump, 740cc injectors) 375-430 can be had on stock internals (yes, It's actually true).

S13 &quot;Blacktop&quot; - Came from 180sx's 1994-1998 (Garrett T25 turbo). Most of the same physical construction as S13 &quot;Redtop&quot;, with black valve cover and additional cooling fins on the front. Uses slightly different engine management configuration (higher bit fuel map) and uses a different 'Fat' O2 sensor'''. The pistons are made from a denser aluminum for higher strength. the port design on the heads are more  open to allow more air flow. Maximum Safe boost on the stock turbo is 13psi-15psi. The Engine should produce 230-250rwhp on safe boost. With a larger turbo (e.g. GT2871r), bigger MAF (e.g. Z32 N62) and upgraded fuel delivery (e.g. 255lph pump, 740cc injectors) 375-430 can be had on stock internals (yes, It's actually true).


S14 - 94-98 Silvias (also referred to as a notch top by some to avoid confusion with the S14 and S13 &quot;blacktop&quot;) - Variable Timing Control aka VTC was introduced. Equipped with 370cc injectors and sidemount intercooler. Intake manifold is significantly different from S13 SR20DET, and valve cover is black with a large lump on the forward portion. Maximum Safe boost on the stock turbo is 13psi-15psi. The stock engine should produce 250-260 RWHP at safe boost using stock turbo. Upgrading turbo, fuel and rest of need parts will yield 300-375.

S15 - 2000+ Silvias. (Garrett Ball Bearing GT28R turbo and 6 speed transmission) Equipped with 480cc injectors and larger sidemount intercooler. Valve cover is black with a large lump on the forward portion. The easiest way to tell if you have an S15 motor and not an S14 is the ECU plug. Also the A/C compressor part number. other than that, the S15's front cooling fins on head surface appear to have been sanded off. The stock engine should produce 250-260 RWHP at safe boost using stock turbo. Upgrading turbo, fuel and rest of need parts will yield 300-375.


{{DEFAULTSORT:}}===Fluid Capacities===
Oil(with filter change): 3 1/4 qt (3.7 L)

Cooling System (including reservoir): 5 1/2 qt (6.2 L) 

Manual Transmission: '''*GL-4*''' 4 1/4 pt (2.4 L)

Differential carrier gear oil: *GL-5* 3 1/8 pt (1.8 L)

Automatic Transmission: 7 qt (7.9 L)

Power steering 3/4 qt (0.9 L) ATF recommended

==Swap Guide==
===Required Items===
If you are swapping into a chassis that had the KA24E, and want to retain power steering, DOHC power steering reservoir and lines are needed. Keep the KADE power steering pump as they are interchangeable if you have the SR20det pulley and bracket.

An aftermarket electric fuel pump(z32 or sr20 stock pump).

A twin cam 91' and above cluster for s13 models due to Rpm reading not working with a pre 91' cluster (how to tell the 2 apart?... pre 91'reads 115mph post 91' reads 110mph.

If you are swapping from auto-manual, you will need the manual driveshaft or a custom one piece.
*Drive shaft lengths differ with ABS(shorter) and Non ABS(longer), earlier base models may require separating drive shafts and using half auto/manual to fit.

Custom wiring is required as well. You can either splice the KA harness with the SR (which can get hectic at times) or purchase a pre-made harness from a provider or specialist such as Wiring Specialties or run a standalone such as a Painless harness.

===Step by Step===
====1====
-Relieve fuel pressure. Do this by removing the fuel pump fuse in the engine bay, start the car, let it die, crank the motor over a few more times.
-Drain all engine and transmission fluids. Be sure to drain the coolant from the block if you don't want coolant all over your work area.
- Disconnect battery.
- Remove anything in the way, items like intake piping, fan shroud, and radiator.
- Disconnect exhaust.
====2====
-Disconnect all harness connections and then plug everything back in the other engine.

===Upgrades===
Greddy Oil Pan - Worthwhile upgrade.  Baffled interior and extra port for temp sensor is very nice.

Greddy Oil Catch Can - Nothing Special, just a catch can!

Greddy Pulley Set - Lightweight aluminum, blue in color.  Easy install.

Greddy VSPL Intercooler Kit - Must modify or remove front bumper support.

Koyo Aluminum Radiator - Consider this upgrade when doing the swap.

HKS SSQV - Universal application, extremely loud when not recirculated (depending in insert), pull type so it wont leak under vac.''It is not recommended to run an open BOV, without the aid of some type of fuel controller.  Some people have had success from tightening down the BOV (resulting in the BOV not opening within cruising RPM range), but in general it causes the car to run rich due to the air that has been metered is being dumped to the atmosphere. Since the ECU thinks the engine will be receiving that mass of air, the amount of fuel is still injected into the engine even though that mass of air is missing which in thus causes it to run rich temporarily. (not really necessary as this costs extra money, those on a budget should consider putting the MAF sensor after the BOV i.e. in between the BOV and the block itself, its probably a better idea anyways).

Nismo Thermostat - Another part to help with keeping the engine temps down. This is not necessary for most SR owners that do not track their cars for the Nismo unit opens at a lower temp than the OEM one.

Greddy Airnix Air Filter - Foam cone style with 2 different layers of foam.  The inner is denser than the outer for better filtration.  Good product. (Non-oiled filter recommended for MAF-operated cars)

Samco Silicone Radiator Hoses - More reliable than standard hoses because silicone can stand up to temperatures better than the standard rubber hoses.

Flex-a-Lite Dual 12&quot; Fans - Extremely nice fans.  I have them hooked up with a painless wiring kit which turns them on at 190 and off at 170 and it takes them less than a minute to do that.  Very impressive and fits perfectly on the S13 SR20 Koyo radiator. Or a set of Altima Electric Fans, from the '93-'97 Nissan Altima, these fans have a higher CFM rating than Flex-a-Lite and are cheaper to boot. You can pick a good set with shroud for $40-$60. They wire up just as easy and the shroud allows for more air flow. E-fans are a common upgrade. The stock clutch fan is prone to slippage, and robs power (up to 20hp), E-fans are a much better choice. (FAL's often burn up if not wired with an independent relay for each fan. do not wire the fans both through one relay - Taylor Durdan)'''

Power Enterprise V-belts - the best belts that I've ever used. They hold up strong

      <text xml:space="preserve">The CA18DET is another possible swap into the nissan 240SX.  
==Specs and Versions==
The RWD CA18DET can be sourced from two different JDM chassis, the 1987 - 1988 Nissan Silvia S12 GT-X and the 1989 and 1990 S13 Silvia or 180SX.

The 1.8 L CA18DET produces 175 hp (130 kW) and 168 ft.lbf (228 Nm). It has a DOHC aluminum head with 16 valves. It has a Garrett T25 (.60 A/R), Multiport Fuel Injection, Bore is 83.5mm, and stroke is 83mm. This near square design, coupled with the head design, allows CA18DETs to revv well beyond 7,000RPMs, even in stock trim.

==Swap Guide==
The original items from the 240sx will work. All you have to worry about is the wiring harness, exchanging of cross members and steering rack.


For a wiring harness you can either splice the KA harness with the RB (which can get hectic at times) or purchase a pre-made harness from a provider or specialist such as Wiring Specialties or run a standalone such as a Painless harness.

'''RB25DET'''&lt;p&gt;
Displacement: 2498cc&lt;br&gt;
BoreXStroke: 86mm X 71.7mm&lt;br&gt;
250PS or 246.58HP @ 5600rpm&lt;br&gt;
216.90 ft/lbs @ 4800rpm&lt;br&gt;
Compression Ratio: 9.0:1&lt;br&gt;


===Required Items===

*Engine R33(S1 or S2)
*Transmission 
** Use of the RB25DET transmission is highly suggested since it is much stronger and specific to this exact engine.  RB26 owners commonly use this transmission since it bolts directly up, and can handle high torque loads.  This is very similar to the Z32 N/A internally which helps when sourcing parts.
*Engine's accompanying ECU
** Make sure you receive the proper ECU to match your engine (S1 &amp; S2 - they _ARE_ different)
** A'Pexi Power FC stand-alone can also be used.
*Engine's harness
*Your chassis' harness
*Custom wiring is required. You can either splice the KA harness with the RB (which can get hectic at times) or purchase a pre-made harness from a provider or specialist such as Wiring Specialties or run a standalone such as a Painless harness. 
*Clutch - Z32 N/A
*Flywheel - RB 25 flywheels are specific and are not interchangeable with any other engines.  Also do not be fooled by thinking you can use a flywheel from the 25DET Auto.  This will _not_ work.
*Modified 5-speed driveshaft, or aftermarket
**McKinney Motorsports, Top Hat Performance, Shaftmasters
*R33 cross-member or aftermarket motor mounts
**McKinney Motorsports, Top Hat Performance, Syko Performance
* 6-cylinder calibrated tach
** LSauto
** Tach recalibration using the stock DOHC (S13-DE or S14; NOT SOHC 89-90 &quot;Pignose&quot;)
* Modified Downpipe
** Depends on whether or not you use the R33 x-memeber and which chassis. For the S14, a custom one may be needed, but results vary depending on the mounts you've gone with.  SR20 downpipes are commonly used with the stock turbo since they both share a 2.75&quot; flange.  In my instance (S13-DE with R33 cross-member) I had to lengthen the 'down' area of the SR20 downpipe approximately 2&quot;, but it cleared the steering shaft by about 1/4&quot;.

===Step by Step===

The RB26 Swap a wonderful thing in it's self. In this Web booklet i'll give you some insight on what it takes to do the swap. For starters don't believe the hype about the motor costing 7-10k. This is not true, there are many places you can buy the engine for around 3-4k. Now here are some hidin cost that come with the swap. You will not be able to buy the engine and directly swap in. You may be saying &quot;yes,I know that&quot; but I'm comparing it to the sr20. The rb26 unlike any other swap requires a different Tranny then the one your clip comes with. Yes, I said clip make sure you buy a clip. If you just get the motor then you mite as well spend a million dollars on donuts. The clip will carry everything you don't want to buy. RB26 is a great swap but parts are not cheap and most of the time you can even get breaks with the deal. Anyhow back on subject. You will need to purchase a RB25 Tranny. They run around $900-1100. Any thing more then that is a rip off. Next for the fun part, wiring is a big issue and if your not a wiring God then this is for you. I suggest sending the harness to Mckinney Motor Sports. They are a very reputable shop dealing with thousands of 240's and what not every year. I would also suggest buying their wonderful motor mounts. Some times you can get a set on Ebay or so but Mckinney made the mold on them. The wiring cost about $400 for s13 and $450 for s14. The mounts will run you around $625 but well worth the money. Now that you have that info the rest should be your basic swap setup. There is no banging or cutting required. I encourage the rb25 swap because of price but if you must do rb26 then these are a few things to help get you started. Here is the web page for Mckinney. www.mckinneymotorsports.com. Happy Building

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Specs and Versions==
===VQ30DE===
FWD, Comes out of a 95-01 Maxima. The Intake manifold will point towards the firewall, so modification will be necessary. The 00-01 Maxima with a VQ30DE-k has an improved intake manifold and a better power band. It is plastic and thus easier to modify. Tend to be found pretty cheap.
95-99: 190hp 205tq;
00-01: 222hp 217tq

===VQ30DET===
RWD, Comes out of a JDM Cima or Cedric. Turbocharged version of the Maxima engine with stronger rods, pistons, and a beefier crank (50mm rod journal vs 48mm). The intake manifold is setup for RWD, but the stock turbo and header setup may require modification. Most have changed the setup before the swap. Uses the same sensors as the Maxima engine and but will require different tuning. Rare to find.
270hp 280tq

===FWD VQ35DE===
Comes out of a 02+ Maxima, Altima, Murano, Quest, and others. Same long block as the RWD, but different motor mounts, oil pan, and intake manifold. Custom motor mounts are required as with the other FWD engines, but most other parts will swap directly over from the RWD VQ35s. 
Rated at around 255hp 265tq, but after the manifold swap and some modifications it will be the same as the RWD
===350Z and G35 VQ35DE===
Includes the &quot;Rev up&quot; and regular 287hp DE from the 03-06 350Z and G35 engines. Very little modification to fit in. More expensive than the FWD versions. 
&quot;regular&quot;: 287hp 274tq
&quot;Rev up&quot;: 300hp 260tq
===VQ35HR===
07+ G35 Sedan or 350Z. Very rare and expensive. Uses a different transmission bolt pattern from the other VQ35s, but believed to be the same as the VQ40DE. Lots of top end. Revs to 7500.
306hp 268tq
===VQ40DE===
05+ Pathfinder, Xterra, and Frontier. More rare and expensive than the VQ35 and believed to have a taller block. More low end torque based. Uses a different transmission bolt pattern from the VQ35s, but believed to be the same as the VQ35HR. 
261hp 281tq

==Swap Guide==
===Required Items===
'''Engine''' - 350z, Maxima, Altima, G35

'''Tranny''' - 6 speed from the 350z, G35

'''ECU''' - 350z, Maxima, Altima, G35 or standalone (Many use the MegaSquirt II standalone or a stock VQ35 or Maxima VQ30 ECU). If using a Nissan ECU you'll need the key, NATS module (mounts around the key cylinder) and ECU out of the same vehicle in order for the ECU to let the car start - a security feature on most new Nissans (if you get them out of separate vehicles you'll need to take your car to Nissan to have them program the ECU to the key)  What all else will be necessary to run a stock Z/G ECU remains to be seen!

'''Radiator''' - I'm using the stock one.

'''Coolant pipe''' on back of heads - Z/G works best as it hugs the back of the motor tighter giving you better firewall clearance and puts the rad inlet on the RH side of the engine bay which works out muuuuch better.

'''Intake manifold''' - Z/G (all 3 pieces) for FWD VQ35, custom built or a modified Maxima/Altima unit

'''Exhaust manifolds''' - Z/G, the LH must be modified slightly to clear the steering shaft.  This also depends on how low you mount the motor, the lower you put it the worse the clearance problem is. I had to hammer in the LH header about 1/4&quot; or so.

'''Throttle body''' - depends mostly on what ECU your running and what intake manifold, I'm using a modified Z unit (converted to cable operation) on a Z manifold.

'''Motor mounts''' - custom like me if you're using a FWD motor, if using a RWD Z/G motor their motor mounts just might work as is.

'''Shifter''' - Z shifter on shortened Z linkage, as the shifter would normally be much farther back than the stock shifter. 

'''Drive shaft''' - custom made consisting of a Z/G front yoke and your stock rear joint with a custom length tube. Either the 5AT front yoke or the 6MT front yoke will work, I'm using a 5AT unit.

'''Oil pan''' - RWD Z/G upper and Z/G/Maxima/Altima lower (metal pan) is necessary for crossmember clearance

'''Throttle position sensor''' - Depends again on what intake manifold, throttle body, and ECU you are using. I'm using a modified Z/G TPS

'''Tranny mount''' - stock 240 mount flipped 180 degrees with custom spacer made out of some hard rubber

Most food historians agree that the union of spaghetti with meatballs is an American culinary invention with Italian roots.

According to Alton Brown, early 20th-century Italian immigrants in New York City were the first to make these dishes. However, food critic and author [http://italianfood.about.com/bio/Kyle-Phillips-1661.htm Kyle Phillips] says he has found evidence to the contrary.

:&quot;...though Spaghetti with meatballs are rare in Italy there are Italian precursors: I have had spaghetti with tiny meatballs in Puglia, Pino Correnti (a Sicilian cuisine expert) notes that meatballs were a common addition to feast day pasta sauces in Sicily, and [http://italianfood.about.com/library/weekly/aa030303.htm Ada Boni] gives a recipe for pasta with meatballs in [her book] ''Il Talismano della Felicità''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://italianfood.about.com/od/regionalcuisines1/ss/aa040406_5.htm Info on origins of Spaghetti and meatballs on About.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the vast majority of cases, however, Old World-[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian cuisine]] calls for mixing heavy meat sauces with [[w:fettuccine|fettuccine]] and [[w:Tagliatelle|tagliatelle]] but not spaghetti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culinariaitalia.wordpress.com/2008/06/29/ragu-alla-bolognese-authentic-recipe/ Info on pasta and meat sauce dishes on Wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Recipe==
===Ingredients===
====Pasta====
*3 tablespoons salt
*1 1/2 gallons (5.76 liters) of water
*1 pound (454 grams) dry spaghetti

====Meatballs====
*2 pounds (907 grams) ground [[w:chuck steak|chuck]]
*2 pounds (907 grams) ground [[w:pork butt|pork shoulder]]
*12 ounces (340 grams) seasoned bread crumbs
*1 cup (240 milliliters) grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] or [[w:Romano cheese|Romano cheese]]
*3/4 cup (180 milliliters) fresh [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]], minced
*4 eggs
*1 1/2 tablespoons finely minced [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[cookbook:garlic powder|garlic powder]] 
*1/2 teaspoon [[cookbook:onion|onion]] powder
*1/2 teaspoon  [[cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*1/2 teaspoon salt
*[[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*3 garlic cloves

====Sauce====
*1/2 teaspoon crushed red [[cookbook:chile|chile pepper]] flakes
*4 cloves garlic, crushed or chopped 
*1 small, finely chopped onion
*1 cup (240 milliliters) [[cookbook:beef|beef]], [[cookbook:stock|stock]] (available on soup aisle in market in small paper boxes) 
*28 ounces (794 grams) crushed [[cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]]
*A handful chopped flat-leaf parsley
*10 leaves fresh [[cookbook:basil|basil]], torn or thinly sliced

===Procedure===
#Fill your largest pot with one and a half gallons of water along with three tablespoons of salt. Place it over high heat on the stove.
#Combine ground meat, bread crumbs, grated cheese, minced parsley and lightly beaten eggs (add eggs one at a time while stirring ingredients together). Sprinkle with minced garlic, two tablespoons of olive oil and seasonings. Then mix well until everything is combined.
#Form meat mixture into meatballs, using an ice cream scoop or your hands, pressing lightly, just enough so that meat holds together, but not so much that the meat is very compressed or the meatballs will be tough and dry.
#In a heavy skillet, heat olive oil over medium low heat. Add whole garlic cloves. Turn the garlic cloves to color them on all sides, then when lightly roasted, press them into the oil; as they brown, remove them.
#As soon as the oil is hot, add the meatballs to the skillet, leaving about one and a half inches between them so that they can be easily turned. Turn them often using a spatula or large spoon so that they don't stick. Make sure there is enough oil in the pan (about one half inch). You don't need extra virgin olive oil for this, any good quality Italian olive oil will do.
#When the meatballs are browned well on all sides, remove from the pan and drain on paper towels. Then add the next batch to the pan and continue until all are cooked.
#Add the pasta to the water now boiling in your pot and cook until [[Cookbook:al dente|''al dente'']]. This should take about 12 minutes.
#Add pepper flakes, garlic and finely chopped onion in the same oil you used to cook the meatballs. Sauté five to seven minutes, until onion bits are soft. Add beef stock, crushed tomatoes, and herbs. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. 
#Toss hot, drained pasta with a few ladles of the sauce. Turn meatballs in remaining sauce. 
#Place pasta on dinner plates. Top with meatballs, sauce and extra grated cheese.

'''French''' (''Français''), {fʁɑ̃sɛ} is a Romance language spoken as a first language by around 136 million people worldwide. A total of 500 million speak it as either a first, second, or foreign language. Moreover, some 200 million people learn French as a foreign language. French speaking communities are present in 56 countries and territories. Most native speakers of the language live in France, the rest live essentially in Canada, particularly the province of Quebec, with minorities in the Atlantic provinces, Ontario, and Western Canada, as well as Belgium, Switzerland, Monoco, Luxembourg, and the U.S. states of Louisiana and Maine. Most second-language speakers of French live in Francophone Africa, arguably exceeding the number of native speakers.

French is a descendant of the [[Latin]] language of the Roman Empire, as are national languages such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian and Catalan, and minority languages ranging from Occitan to Neapolitan and many more. Its closest relatives however are the other langues d'oïl and French-based creole languages. Its development was also influenced by the native Celtic languages of Roman Gaul and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders.

It is an official language in 29 countries, plus the Vatican City, which form what is called, in French, ''La Francophonie'', the community of French-speaking countries. It is an official language of all United Nations agencies and a large number of international organizations. According to the European Union, 129 million (or 26% of the Union's total population), in 27 member states speak French, of which 65 million are native speakers and 69 million claim to speak French either as a second language or as a foreign language, making it the third most spoken second language in the Union, after English and German. Twenty-percent of non-Francophone Europeans know how to speak French, totaling roughly 145.6 million people.

In addition, from the 17th century to the mid 20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of Europe. The dominant position of French language has only been overshadowed recently by English, since the emergence of the USA as a major power.

As a result of extensive colonial ambitions of France and Belgium, between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to America, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, and the Caribbean.
== History ==

During the Roman occupation of Gaul, the Latin language was imposed on the natives.  This Latin language eventually developed into what is known as Vulgar Latin, which was still very similar to Latin.  Over the centuries, due to Celtic and Germanic influences (particularly the Franks), ''la langue d'oïl'' was developed.  A dialect of ''la langue d'oïl'' known as ''le francien'' was the language of the court, and thus became the official language of what was to become the Kingdom of France, and later the Nation-State of France.

From medieval times until the 19th century, French was the dominant language of diplomacy, culture, administration, trade and royal courts across Europe. Due to these factors, French was the ''lingua franca'' of this time period.

French has influenced many languages world wide, including English. It is through French (or more precisely Norman, a dialect of ''la langue d'oïl'') that English gets about one third of its vocabulary.

== Extent of the language ==
[[Image:Map-Francophone World.png|210px|thumb|French is spoken all around the world.]]

In modern times, French is still a significant diplomatic language: it is an official language of the United Nations, the Olympic Games, and the European Union. It is also the official language of 29 countries and the Vatican City. Spoken in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal, Haiti, the Ivory Coast, Madagascar, the Congo, Algeria, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Gabon, the Seychelles, Burundi, Chad, Rwanda, Djibouti, Cameroon, Mauritius, and Canada (mostly in the province of Qu&amp;eacute;bec where it is the primary language, but it is also used in other parts of the country.) All consumer product packages in Canada are required by law to have both English and French labels.

== Advice on studying French ==
{{see also|How to learn a language}}

French tends to have a reputation among English speakers as hard to learn. While it is true that it poses certain difficulties to native English-speakers, it may be noted that English is also considered 'difficult' to learn, and yet we learned it without the benefit of already knowing a language. In fact, the French language can be learned in only [http://web.archive.org/web/20071211081522/http://en.wikinerds.org/index.php/Learning_French_in_10_months 10 months], if only for the specific purpose of passing a standardized test, such as the Test d'Evaluation de Français. According to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, in order to reach the level of 'Independent User' (after completing Level B2), you must complete 400 hours of effective learning (so if you study 4 hours a week, every single week of the year, you would need two years to achieve it). Any way you look at it, learning any new language requires a long-term commitment. Remember, that like any skill, it requires a certain amount of effort. And it is likely that if you do not practice your French regularly, you will begin to forget it. Try to make French practice a part of your routine; even if it's not daily, at least make it regular.

Also remember that you are learning a new skill. Try to master the easier concepts before moving on to the more complex.  We all have to add and subtract before we can do calculus. French is a complete language; thus, while this book can teach you to read and write in French, these are only half of the skills that make up fluency. A written document cannot teach much about listening to and speaking French. You must train on all of these skills, and they will then reinforce one another.

The very best way to learn French is to visit France or another French-speaking country. This allows you to start with a clean slate, as babies do. However, since most of us are unwilling or unable to take that step, the next best option is immersion. If you are serious about learning French, a period of immersion (during which you live in a Francophone culture) is a good idea once you have some basic familiarity with the language. If you can't travel to a French-speaking country, then try listening to French-language programs on the radio, TV, or the Internet.  Rent or buy French-language movies (many American and U.K. movies have a French language option). Pay attention to pronunciation.  Grab a French speaker you meet and talk to him or her in French.  Listen, speak, and practice. Read French newspapers and magazines. Google's news page, which links to French-language news stories, is an excellent source that will enrich your vocabulary.

==Written versus modern spoken French==
While the French written language is highly standardized, and hasn't changed much in over two hundred years, the same cannot be said of the spoken language. This book, like all French training material, is oriented towards the written language. The speaking examples are straight from the standardized written language. If you were to become an expert in this French, you would probably be completely confused when you arrive in a French speaking country. Unlike the written language, the spoken language is very dynamic. The French people would not readily understand you, and you would not understand them. You can picture in your mind, a person learning English from a two hundred year old book, and coming to your town and saying &quot;Hast thou&quot; or &quot;Wherefore art thou.&quot;

The reason written French is stressed in learning (Schools and Internet courses), is that you can go from this standardized language to modern spoken French much easier than English to spoken French, and then going backwards to learning written French.

A simple example is: ''Je ne comprends pas'' (I don't understand). For a business person (not wanting to sound too plebeian) this would be spoken as: ''Jeun comprends pas'', with the ''Je ne'' joined together. But most people on the street simplify this even further.  The ''ne'' is deemed redundant and falls by the wayside, and the hard ''Je'' sound is reduced to a ''sh'' sound: ''shcomprends pas''. Another example might be ''Il ne fait pas ...'' resulting in ''y fay pa ...'' (ee-fay-pah), or ''Il n'y a pas ...'' becoming ''yapa ...'' (yah-pah...).

French is a language that is read, spoken, and sung. Each has different rules. Lyric and Poetry have pronunciation rules that are different than the written, and spoken French has no rules in comparison. Learning written French is only step one, and modern spoken French is your step two.  This book is for learning written French.

==What should I learn first?==
Many courses of language study assume you are going there for vacation, and so begin their lessons with common ''survival'' phrases that people use. There is some of that in this book, but consider that &quot;verbs&quot; are what makes a language. There are six verbs in French that, when memorized, will give you a head start when moving on to learning sentences.

The distinction between a phrase and a sentence, is that a phrase does not have a subject or verb. This is why they are easy to learn, and a main part of vacation type books. You can't go wrong with a phrase. Unlike a phrase, a sentence is a grammatical unit. You will need nouns, pronouns, adverbs (verbs for other verbs), adjectives (nouns for other nouns), etc. A sentence includes a subject (what/whom the sentence is about), and a predicate (words that tell us about the subject). There are also different types of sentences: ''declarative (statements)'', ''interrogative'' (questions), ''exclamative'' (exclamations), and ''commandative'' (commands). The structure of sentences, and not just phrases, must be studied and practiced in order to learn a new language.

Most important, at beginning levels, is to get your French face on. This means pronunciation is critical. You do not want to have to unlearn anything when you get to the next level. The textual pronunciation examples here are based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), and should be used to prepare your mind. The IPA symbols are designed by scientists, and are no match to listening to French people within their own environment. It is important to actually listen to a real French speaker at this stage. Use the example voices contained in the book, but also watch French media on the Internet. You should be cautioned about French songs. It is acceptable for artists to twist a word for style and for rhyme, and they love to embellish endings. You will also find that mutes are pronounced in lyric and poetry. It is often the case that a singer or poem recitation will say &quot;ewnuh&quot; for ''une'' and &quot;veeuh&quot; for ''vie''. You may also note, to prevent boredom, a lyric may be &quot;veeuh&quot; on one verse, and &quot;vee&quot; on the next. Examples, as to why songs and poetry are added experiences in learning and enjoying the French language.

The beginning verbs are:

* Être (''ehtr'') (To Be), Je suis (zhuh sewee) (I am)
* Avoir (''ah-vwahr'') (To Have), J'ai (''zheh'') (I Have)
* Savoir (''sah-vwahr'') (To Know), Je sais (''zhuh seh'') (I Know)
* Devoir (''duh-vwahr'') (Ought To, Must), Je dois (''zhuh dwah'') (I Must)
* Pouvoir (''poo-vwahr'') (Able To, Can), Je peux (''zhuh puh'') (I Can)
* Vouloir (''voo-lwahr'') (Want To), Je veux (''zhuh vuh'') (I Want)

Just as in English, you will use these as a base to create the fourteen (14) French tenses. Present, Future, Conditional, etc. Don't worry about tenses for this exercise. They are complications that will take months and years to master. Generally, only ten (10) tenses are used except for advanced levels of French.

The above verbs must be mastered to even begin. You might think the list is too short, so feel free to add verbs into your flash-card rotation.

The next verb examples, that are important to any language, are the movement type verbs. While you can &quot;have, know, can, etc&quot; you also need to &quot;go, come, or stay&quot; in many conversations. These verbs are considered basic building blocks.

* Aller (''ah-lay'') (To Go), Je vais (''zhuh veh'') (I Go)
* Venir (''vuh-neer'') (To Come), Je viens (''zhuh vy&lt;sup&gt;uh&lt;/sup&gt;ah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'') (I Come)
* Sortir (''sohr-teer'') (To Leave, Go Out), Je sors (''zhuh sohr'') (I Go Out/Leave)
* Partir (''pahr-teer'') (To Depart), Je part (''zhuh pahr'') (I Depart)
* Rester (''reh-stay'') (To Remain/Stay) Je reste (''zhuh rehst'') (I Remain/Stay)

Again, feel free to add others to your flash-card rotation.

That brings us to the &quot;Big Seven&quot; French question words. These, like the above will quickly become complicated as well. The following is obviously simplified, but your understanding at this level, will quickly get you to the next level.

* Où (''oo'') Where   ex: &quot;''Où'' est le taxi ?&quot; (Where's the taxi ?)
* Que/Qu' (''kuh'') What  ex: &quot;''Quel'' est le problème ?&quot;, ''qu'elle'', ''qu'il'', etc. (What's the problem ?)
* Qui (''kee'') Who  ex: &quot;''Qui'' a pris mon stylo ?&quot; (Who took my pen ?)
* Pourquoi (''poor-kwah'') Why  ex: &quot;''Pourquoi'' êtes-vous ici ?&quot; (Why are you here ?)
* Quand (''kah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'') When  ex: &quot;''Quand'' vous partez, nous serons heureux.&quot; (When you will go, we will be happy.)
* Comment (''koh-mah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'') How  ex: &quot;''Comment'' allons-nous trouver des informations ?&quot; (How will we find informations ?)
* Combien (''kohm-by&lt;sup&gt;uh&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'') How Much, How Many  ex: &quot;''Combien'' ça coûte ?&quot;, &quot;''Combien'' font six et trois ?&quot; (How much is six plus three ?)

Finally, one word that is very often needed:

* Parce que (''pahrs kuh / pahr suh kuh (Canada)'') Because  ex: &quot;''Parce que'' vous êtes trop vieux pour ça !&quot; (Because you are too old for this !)

Making flash-cards of all the above French words, memorizing them (forward to English/backward to French), will give you a head start in all French Language courses.

==Impediment of learning by tricks==
There are many methods for students to learn new subjects, and the first method is to use what are known as &quot;tricks,&quot; designed to make it easier (so it would seem). These tricks, in most cases, merely prevent the brain from storing the information for direct lookup. One example is the French word ''chat''. We can form a rule, whereby anytime you see a ''ch'' in French, you will substitute a ''c'' and voilà - there you go. Others, such as changing ''-ment'' to ''-ly'' or ''-ant'' to ''-ing'' are a similar waste of time.

A good example of the damage that can be done by these tricks, is in learning Morse Code. Many teachers will begin by showing the dit's and dah's visually, and then make the sound using the key following each symbol.  So that dah-di-da-dit &quot;-.-.&quot; will be stored in the brain as a ''c'', and somehow (magically) retrieved for use later.

Alas, this technique only works up to a certain speed, and then the students brain is so damaged, they have no hope of using the code any faster than 10 Words Per Minute. It was found (in the 1850's), that if you just associate the whole sound with a letter, and ignore the combinations of dit's and dah's, that new students listening to 20 Words Per Minute for several weeks, were able to go to work immediately. A famous Scottish-American named Andrew Carnegie went from a message boy to head telegraph operator by learning to associate sounds with whole words, and not just writing down each character, as the method used by his peers.

The advice offered in this book, is to avoid these tricks, and to associate word and sentence sounds with their meaning. Listen to the new word or sentence, and store the meaning in your brain. Do not try to translate one language into your native language before responding. When someone hands you a stick of /di.na.mit/ (''dee-nah-meet'') you should quickly drop it and run, and not stop to translate it into ''dynamite'' first. Simply associate the word or sentence, but do not translate it.

When you go shopping, and hear customers saying in English &quot;How much is that?&quot; then you form an association of that sentence to the person wanting to know a price. Similarly, if you hear people in the market asking &quot;Combien ça coûte?&quot; you don't have to translate the sentence, you associate it with people wanting to know a price (or more often wanting to know a lower price while smiling seductively at the assistant). After associating ten things about the word &quot;Combien&quot; the brain will simplify matters for you, much like it pulls the steering wheel with your arm, after the eyes see a pot-hole ahead. Forever more, &quot;Combien&quot; will be associated with a quantity &quot;How much&quot;, or &quot;How many&quot; just as pot-holes are associated with &quot;avoid.&quot;

Only 21, 31, 41, 51 and 61 (but not 71, 81, or 91) have ''et un'' without a hyphen; but past this it is simply both words consecutively (''vingt-six'', ''trente-trois'', etc) with a hyphen in between. For 100-199, ''cent'' is added before the rest of the number; this continues up to 1000 and onward. Many speakers of French outside of France refer to the numbers 70 to 99 in the same pattern as the other numbers.  For instance, in Switzerland and Belgium, 70 is {{French/Word|septante|IPA=/sɛp.tɑ̃t/}}, 71 is ''septante-et-un'', 72 is ''septante deux'', and so on; 90 is {{French/Word|nonante|IPA=/nɔ.nɑ̃t/}}, 91 is {{French/Word|nonante-et-un|IPA=/nɔ.nɑ̃t.e.œ̃/}}, 92 is ''nonante deux'', and so on. In Switzerland, 80 is {{French/Word|huitante}} or {{French/Word|octante|IPA=/ɔk.tɑ̃t/}}.

In French, the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are as follows:

: ''Calculez'': 
: un plus un = {{French/Section|(égale)}} deux  {{French/Section|(the final 's' of 'plus' must be pronounced)}}
: dix moins sept = trois 
: quatre fois trois = douze 
: vingt divisé par dix = deux

You may sometimes use ''un plus un font deux''.

The objective of this book is to provide a general guide for dealing with FBI name check. It is recommended that all users read the ''[[#Essential information|Essential information]]'' section, which consists of the first half of the article. ''[[#Lawsuit steps|Lawsuit steps]]'' contains step by step information about how to file a lawsuit by yourself. Also, readers are advised to review The American Immigration Law Foundation page on [http://www.ailf.org/lac/clearinghouse_mandamus.shtml recent mandamus litigation] which provides a comprehensive review of litigation strategy and recent mandamus litigations.

__FORCETOC__

==Essential information==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Name_Check FBI Name Check] is requested by USCIS for immigration benefit applicants. The FBI [http://www.fbi.gov/hq/nationalnamecheck.htm NNCP] conducts manual and electronic searches of the FBI’s Central Records System (CRS) Universal Index (UNI). The CRS encompasses the centralized records of FBI Headquarters, field offices, and Legal Attache offices. The CRS contains all FBI investigative, administrative, personnel, and general files. After September 11 2001, many immigration applicants have experienced significant delay due to increasing number of cases. FBI published [http://web.archive.org/20060308075529/www.fbi.gov/page2/nationalnamecheck.htm Frequently Asked Questions]recently regarding the delay which may not tell the whole story as practically the problem with delays is much serious and pervasive as per USCIS Ombudsman annual report for 2007. 

[http://boards.immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=17090&amp;d=1192717289 This document] has detailed information about the name check process associated with application for immigration benefit.

[http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/CISOMB_Annual%20Report_2007.pdf USCIS Ombudsman Report 2007] reported on page 55 that &quot;Name Checks and Other Security Checks
FBI name checks, one of several security screening tools used by USCIS, continue to significantly delay adjudication of immigration benefits for many customers, hinder backlog reductions efforts, and may not achieve their intended national security objectives. FBI name checks may be the single biggest obstacle to the timely and efficient delivery of immigration benefits. The problem of long-pending FBI name check cases worsened during the reporting period&quot;

Recent declaration of Michael Cannon, filed in a civil case in Georgia reinforces the fear that the name check process is not based on first in - first out principle: &quot;Another exception to the first-in, first-served policy is a near-term effort agreed to by USClS and the FBI to reduce the number of pending USCIS name check requests by prioritizing &quot;single hit&quot; name checks&quot;. Moreover, if a request is pending a long time, it may be required to go thru the process again multiple times! As Mr. Cannon says: &quot;Please note that additional searches against the FBI's Universal Index, additional manual name searches, and/or additional file review of a name check request, depending on the length of time a name check request is pending in the processing queue, may occur periodically during the name check process to ensure that stale information is updated&quot;. Therefore, if you have more than one hit the only recourse to avoid waiting for years and years is to file a lawsuit against the USCIS.

Check also [http://www.immigrationportal.com/showpost.php?p=1794235&amp;postcount=13601 this document] obtained as part of discovery in a civil case in Oregon. The document sheds more light on how the decision was made by FBI to search both main and reference files for all name check requests submitted by the USCIS. It also has more details about the name check process. All requests from the USCIS get the Priority Level 3 - requests from major customers '''without specific deadlines'''.

See also this [http://bibdaily.com/pdfs/Aslam%201-25-08.pdf court order] that reveals that the government was not ready to process required volume of name checks when the USCIS changed policy in 2004. The FBI needs to triple NNCP staff just to keep up with the daily flow of the USCIS requests. No wonder that the backlog is growing.

&quot;The government concedes that the agency within the FBI responsible for name checks, the National Name Check Program Section {&quot;NNCPS&quot;), is understaffed. Approximately 3.3 million name checks are requested each year, resulting in 330,000 checks that proceed past the second stage. As of 2006, NNCPS only employed 103 personnel, 59 of which are dedicated to performing name checks for CIS. To meet its internal goals, the FBI has
estimated that it needs 180 employees to process the CIS requests alone.&quot;

It's nice to see how the judge rebuffs USCIS arguments that they are trying to address the delay. 

&quot;There is no evidence of any efforts by CIS to take responsibility for and help remedy the existing name check process. Rather, CIS forwards the request to the FBI and then disclaims any accountability for a delay. This is the very definition of agency recalcitrance - an inability or unwillingness to fix an obvious problem that it helped to create.&quot;

==How do I know whether I am still in name check by FBI ==
*1. USCIS infopass/inquiry. Call the USCIS customer service and ask to talk to an immigration officer.
*2. Send inquiry to the CIS Ombudsman. Click [http://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/programs/editorial_0497.shtm here] for details.
*3. Send inquiry to your congressman/senator.
*4. Refer to the attached file in the following immigrationportal thread for some common FAQs on namecheck (http://www.immigrationportal.com/showthread.php?t=215932).

==Name check expedite criteria ==
There have been two Memos by USCIS that explain the criteria to expedite name check. The 2005 Memo (click [http://immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=16249&amp;d=1178839477 here]) indicates a pending writ of mandamus lawsuit as a condition for expedited name check. Later on USCIS had another Memo dated Feb 20, 2007 (click [http://immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=16250&amp;d=1178839495 here]) which removes the lawsuit as a condition to expedite name check.

==Filing Lawsuit ==

===Definitions ===
See [http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/index.html US Attorneys' Manual] for definitions of common terms (mandamus, service of process, etc.)

*AUSA = Assistant US Attorney. S/he is the lawyer who is representing the Defendants in cases when you sue the government (and of course, s/he is the counsel of the Plaintiffs when the government sues somebody, but this is irrelevant in such cases)

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_%28legal%29 What is a Motion?] 

*MTD = [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_dismiss#Motion_to_dismiss Motion to Dismiss] A motion to dismiss the complaint argues that there are legal problems with the way the complaint was written, filed, or served. Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure lists the following defenses that can be raised in a motion to dismiss the complaint:
**1. Motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In this type of motion the defendant argues that the court does not have the legal authority to hear the kind of lawsuit that the plaintiff filed.
**2. Motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant. In this type of motion the defendant argues that he or she has so little connection with the district in which the case was filed that the court has no legal authority to hear the plaintiff’s case against that defendant.
**3. Motion to dismiss the complaint for improper venue. In this type of motion the defendant argues that the lawsuit was filed in the wrong place.
**4. Motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency of process, or for insufficiency of service of process. In these types of motions the defendant argues that the plaintiff did not prepare the summons correctly or did not properly serve the summons on the defendant.
**5. Motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. In this type of motion the defendant argues that even if everything stated in the complaint is true, the defendant did not violate the law. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not appropriate if the defendant wants to argue that the facts alleged in the complaint are not true. Instead, in a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim the defendant assumes that the facts alleged in the complaint are true, but argues that those facts do not constitute a violation of any law.
*MSJ = [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_%28legal%29#Motion_for_summary_judgment Motion for Summary Judgment]

===Lawsuit steps ===
*1. Contact your Federal District Court and ask for a Civil Case Pro Se package. Read it.
*2. Prepare a lawsuit on Microsoft word (use appropriate complaint template for [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FBI_name_check#Example_document_for_pending_Naturalization_.28N-400.29 naturalization] or [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FBI_name_check#Example_Document_for_Writ_of_Mandamus_for_AOS_.28I-485.29_Applicants adjustment of status]). Print it and sign it.
*3. Fill out [http://www.rid.uscourts.gov/FORMS/JS44.PDF a Civil Cover sheet] and print it out. Note: some district courts have customized JS-44 and may have an extra page to fill up. Check with your local court before filing.
*4. Locate you federal district court using your zip code and [http://www.uscourts.gov/courtlinks/ this link]. 
*5. You can file the original complaint in person at the district court clerk's office or by mail. You need to have signed complaint (with exhibits if any) + cover sheet + check for $350 payable to &quot;Clerk, US District Court&quot; + summons if you file in person (see the next paragraph).
*6. Fill and print the summons for all defendants. Use [http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/General_Information/Court_Forms/ao440.pdf the summons form]. (If you sent the original complaint by mail, the court will send you blank summons with your case number.)
*7. Make copies of the summons and your complaint, one for each defendant and an extra copy for the US attorney in your district. You can find the name and address of your district US Attorney [http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/offices/index.html here].
*8. Put the case # on all copies. Make copies of summons to file a proof of service later on.
*9. Serve the complaint + summons + exhibits if any via CERTIFIED MAIL on all defendants and the Local US Attorney’s office with a copy to US Attorney General at Washington D.C. (if US AG is one of the defendants, no need to send two copies to him/her, one is enough). Each defendant should get a copy of complaint and summons with his/her name. Local US Attorney gets a copy of complaint and a copy of summons for each defendant. Some courts require the RETURN RECEIPTS in addition to certified mail. To be on the safe side, pay for the Return Receipts (you can request electronic return receipts as a cheaper option). Some courts accept the receipts for the certified mail and the USPS online delivery tracking as a Proof of Service. 
*10. Check the delivery of your summons on the USPS website. The 60-day count starts from the date AUSA receives your complaint. Note: some courts require that the summon to the AUSA to be address to &quot;Attn: Civil processing clerk&quot;, otherwise your summon will not be considered received. Check the local rules before sending summons out.
*11. Use the USPS online tracking record to fill &quot;Return of service&quot; section for all summons (back page or second page of the summons form). Attach return receipts or USPS printouts. File &quot;Return of service&quot; with the court.
*12. From here, every time you file something with the court, send a copy to your local US attorney and file a [http://boards.immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=17187&amp;d=1197974997 Certificate of service] with the court. 
*13. 2 weeks before the expiration of the 60-day deadline, call the US Attorney, introduce yourself, and ask about your case.
*14. Hopefully the name check will be cleared, and you'll get an approval within 2 to 3 months of filing the suit.

If you have any questions, post them on immigrationportal forum:
http://boards.immigrationportal.com/showthread.php?p=1781629

If the name check is not cleared, then file a request for Discovery (see [http://boards.immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=17091&amp;d=1192724494 example]), a Motion for Default Judgment, or a Motion for Summary Judgment, depending on your situation: 
* Discovery may not produce anything useful and may just prolong the case.
* A Motion for Summary Judgment is likely to be more productive than Discovery.
* A Response to Motion to Dismiss is useful, but is only appropriate if the defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss.

==== Example of a Case ====
(1) On 4/4/2006
Filed in Northern District of CA in San Jose by Pro Se. The Clerk gave me a bunch of documents and asked me to make copies and serve the Defendants with my complaint. I was assigned a judge on the spot, with location and time in San Jose Court building (all printed on a CMC sheet).
I also received the case number, the stamped Summon, the Proof of Service sheet.
By the way, the clerk even typed my name wrong, and I found it later. I did not bother to go back, so just corrected by hand the served all defendants.
For the address and info about the court: http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/

(2) On 4/5/2006
US Attorney I served: Kevin Ryan in San Francisco. http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/offices/index.html#a

(3) A week later,
Filed proof of service in the Court. It's very simple and easy. Just filled in the sheet and showed the Certified Mail Receipt. I did NOT have all the return receipt, as I know it will take forever to get anything back from Washington. I mailed everything with Priority + Certified + Return Receipt.
There is an email service from USPS web page -- will email you the status of your mail. I printed all delivery confirmation emails sent from USPS. 
The clerk was happy about the proof. She was busy at the moment, took all my doc, promised me to file them later (and also correct my name).

(4) Two days later, 
I received a mail from Court -- the printed confirmation showing the dates that I served all the defendants (which were the dates showed in email delivery confirmation from USPS). On this sheet, the 60-day deadline was also printed (started from those dates I provided). 

(5) I mailed the &quot;proof&quot; of &quot;proof of service&quot; -- the above sheet clerk gave me with all the serve dates and deadline dates -- to US Attorney in SF, Kevin Ryan, again. 

(6) 4 weeks later, I was thinking about to contact Attorney office about my case.....

(7) then on 5/2/2006, 
a secretary in Attorney office (SF) called me..... it's all done! She asked me if I know how to dismiss, I said I don't know. She then faxed me the template to dismiss, and agreed to let me dismiss after I received formal letter from CIS.

===== Case where judge denied MTD and ordered specific timeline for name check completion and adjudication =====
*''Yong Tang v. Chertoff'' (see [http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/cgi-bin/recentops.pl?filename=gertner/pdf/tangmtd.pdf court order]), 493 F.Supp.2d 148, D.Mass., June 26, 2007   
The opinion has in-depth analyses on the jurisdiction-stripping statute of the INA (8 U.S.C. §1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)) and on the applicability of the APA to the processing of AOS applications. Not only did the court deny the defandants' MTD, but also ordered them to complete adjudication of the plaintiffs' I-485 cases by August 6, 2007.
The judge wrote: &quot;I cannot accept the argument that, simply because adjustment of status is a form of discretionary relief, there is no limit to the length of time the USCIS may take processing applications. The duty to act is no duty at all if the deadline is eternity.&quot;

*''Singh v. Still'' (see [http://www.immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=16064&amp;d=1176397350 court order]), 470 F. Supp.2d 1064 (N.D. Cal. 2007)
Court ordered Respondents to complete the adjudication of pending I-485 application forthwith (i.e. immediately). Document  of Interest: Document #29 “Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion For Summary Judgement; And Denying Defendant’ Motion For Summary Judgement”
The court found mandamus jurisdiction to order adjudication of plaintiff's Adjustment of Status Application (Form I-485). The court held that there was unreasonable delay in the adjudication of plaintiff's applications and that plaintiff had no other remedy. At the time the court issued its decision, plaintiff's asylum-based I-485 application had been pending for more than seven years and his marriage-based I-485 application had been pending for almost four years. The court noted that the government itself conceded that it has a mandatory duty to process I-485 applications.

Court ordered on 10/24/2006 the USCIS complete its adjudication of plaintiff’s I-485 application forthwith (i.e. immediately, at once). Document of Interest: Document #40 “Order Awarding Plaintiff Fees” covers reasons to deny defendants’ motion to dismiss. The court found jurisdiction over the mandamus action and ordered USCIS to complete adjudication of plaintiff's Adjustment of Status Application (Form I-485). Plaintiff's application had been pending for approximately eight years when the court issued its decision.

The court found jurisdiction over the mandamus action and ordered USCIS to complete its adjudication of plaintiffs' Adjustment of Status Application (Form I-485) within 30 days and to inform the court of its decisions. The court stated that it would maintain jurisdiction over the case to ensure that USCIS complied with its order.

*''Song vs. Klapakas'' (see [http://boards.immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=16224&amp;d=1178162423 court order]), Song v. Klapakas, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27203 (April 12, 2007)
Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss and remanded to USCIS to complete adjudication of plaintiffs applications within thirty days. Court found that defendants’ failure to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status was not a discretionary decision. What is significant about the Song case is that the plaintiffs did not even file an opposition to the MTD from the defendants. The judge could have chosen to grant the MTD; instead, he went ahead and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered USCIS to adjudicate their AOS applications within 30 days.

CASE NO.: 07-20334-CIV; UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, MIAMI DIVISION; Decided June 21, 2007.
Court denied Defendats' MTD and orders &quot;reasonably prompt&quot; AOS:

* ''Liu v. Chertoff'' (see [http://immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=16896&amp;d=1188217690 court order]), 2007 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 61772 (E.D. CA. August 22, 2007).
Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgement. The order states: 
&quot;In short, while there is no specific time frame imposed on Defendants to process I-485 applications, delay of more than two-and-a-half years is unreasonable under the specific circumstances because there is no evidence in the record demonstrating that the delay is attributable to Plaintiffs nor is there any particularized evidence in the record sufficiently explaining the reasons for the extended delay.&quot; Also court refers to 8 U.S.C. 1571(b) and reasons that:
&quot;While Congress has not set forth a statutory time limit for adjudication of I-485 applications, the USCIS is required to conclude the matters presented to it within a reasonable time. See 5 U.S.C. SS 555(b), 706(1); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1571(b) [*18] ('It is the sense of Congress that the processing of an immigration benefit application
should be completed not later than 180 days after the initial filing of the application . . .').&quot;

* ''Li v. Chertoff'' (see [http://immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=16903&amp;d=1188317468 court order]), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53309 (US District Court for the District of Nebraska July 19, 2007)
The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss and ordered USCIS to complete adjudication of Li's I-485 application
within thirty (30) days. The court reasons that &quot;This Court concludes that the better reasoned view is that
courts have jurisdiction at a minimum under the APA because defendants have a non-discretionary duty to process the I-485 application within a reasonable time, as distinct from its discretionary authority of whether to grant or deny the applications.&quot; Further, the court refers to Haidari's case and states: 
&quot;This Court agrees with the Haidari court that 'the USCIS does not possess unfettered discretion to relegate aliens to a state of 'limbo,' leaving them to languish there indefinitely.'&quot;

* '' Liu v. Novak'' (see [http://bibdaily.com/pdfs/Liu%20DDC%208-30-07.pdf court order]), Civil Action No. 07-263 (EGS), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63683, UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (August 30, 2007, Decided)

&quot;[T]he defendants' alleged failure to take timely action on the plaintiffs' application is not itself a decision, let alone a discretionary decision, but rather unreasonable inaction, which is the proper subject of mandamus relief.&quot;

* ''Dong v. Chertoff'' (see [http://immigrationportal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=17016&amp;d=1189865279 court order]), 2007 WL 2601107 N.D.Cal. Sep 06, 2007
MSJ granted to the Plaintiff. It has a very good discussion about a number of arguments, including &quot;cut in line&quot;,&quot;national security requires the delay&quot;,&quot;agency burden&quot;, etc.
&quot;The Court, however, is not in a position to relieve the defendants’ of their obligation to comply with their mandatory duties. Under the APA, a court “shall” “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). In this instance, it is not the place of the judicial branch to weigh a plaintiff’s clear right to administrative action against the agency’s burdens in complying.&quot;

This is a case from N.D.CA. done by professionals not Pro Se. Court denied MTD, stating:
This Court has jurisdiction to hear plaintiff's complaint under both the writ of mandamus and the APA. The order states: &quot;The Court agrees with the many district courts that have held that, taken together, the APA, the INA, and section 245.2(a)(5) of the CFR establish a clear and certain right to have immigration status adjustment applications adjudicated, and to have them adjudicated within a reasonable time frame.&quot; 
Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that defendants have delayed over three years in adjudicating her I-485 application. Defendants have provided a detailed description of the FBI name-check process in an attempt to explain the delay. The Court has reviewed defendants' papers, and finds nothing to compel the conclusion that three years is a &quot;reasonable time&quot; as a matter of law. The amount of time that is reasonable is a fact-specific inquiry, which is premature at this stage.

The court found jurisdiction over the mandamus action and held that defendants must provide an explanation for the delay resulting from security checks or adjudicate plaintiffs' Adjustment of Status Applications (Form I-485). The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss and ordered plaintiffs to file a motion for summary judgment. The case was dimissed at request of plaintiff in Feb. 07.

== 1. What is the purpose of Scrapbooking? ==
There are several reasons for scrapbooking. It may be to record a special event in a Pathfinder's life, or it may be to remember a special person, or to act as a visual journal. At its very core, scrapbooking is a way of archiving photos safely and at the same time telling a story with those photos.

== 2. Why journal? ==
Pictures are only half the story. When the events happen and we &quot;snap the photo&quot;, we remember every detail about what happened, who we were with, and how we felt about the occasion. However, as time passes, these memories fade. Ten years later, we MIGHT be able to explain some of the details of the photograph, but we may have forgotten the names of some of our friends or acquaintances, and we'll probably have forgotten the feelings involved when the event was captured on film. Journaling helps us remember all this by having us put the story with each photo. We need to make sure that as journal for our scrapbook, that we don't just record the who and where of the picture, but also how we felt about that event and why. Some of you may ask - What do I write about? Here's one easy step: Pretend that you're telling a family member or good friend about the picture and why its in your album. Whatever you'd say to them is probably what you should journal for your scrapbook! In summary, journal the five W's: who, what, when, where, why.

Remember, Journaling is everything dealing with words that you do on a scrap booking page. It includes the title, headers, captions, and of course the journal event entries.

Journaling is often done by hand. Most scrapbook papers have tiny faint lines to help us keep our Journaling straight. This may take the jitters out of some who are afraid that the page won't be pretty when they are done. Other people don't feel like their handwriting is preferred for Journaling in their scrapbook. If you're one of these, you might enjoy the sources online to download FREE fonts that will give you lots of choices when using your computer and word-processing software to print journal entries, headers, and captions.

'''Some creative Journaling ideas:'''
* Write around the perimeter of a single photograph.
* Write around the perimeter of the entire page, framing the grouping of photographs.
* Use colored pens in inks that will complement or contrast the rest of the page.
* Sometimes write in complete sentences, Other times, write just the facts in a bulleted list.
* Draw a shape (such as a fish, a ball, a star) on the page lightly in pencil. Write the Journaling within the shape, filling up all of the shape. Erase the pencil line. The Journaling remains behind in the shape of the original pencil drawing.

'''NOTE:'''These ideas and others are available at http://www.scrapbookingcenter.com

== 3. What is cropping and why is it done? ==
Cropping is the process of &quot;cutting-down&quot; the photos that you wish to place in your scrapbook. It is done so they can fit in the album, as well as draw attention to the main subject you wish to highlight. There are all kinds of fancy scissors to create perforated edges on your photos and of course &quot;scrapbook frames&quot; that can provide interest for the photos.

'''CAUTION:''' Don't over-crop your photos. Once its cut, there's no turning back. Maybe instead , create a &quot;frame&quot; from colored or designed paper to highlight the main subject. If you're using Polaroid photos never-ever cut them. The chemicals in the Polaroid paper will leak and ruin your pictures and potentially your whole album!

== 4. What are the four (4) main types of scrapbooks used? ==
There are three types of scrapbooks that '''should be used''' for scrapbooking and one type that '''should never be used'''.

1. '''Three ring albums''' - These albums come with three round rings inside a binder. Sizes vary from 
½&quot; to well over three inches. Overall, these are the easiest to use and allow you to rearrange pages 
readily. The down side is that they often aren’t as pretty on the outside cover as some of the other 
types of albums, and the pages on the “3-ring side” often bend, or curl if overfilled, sometimes ruining 
a scrapbook over time. The quick fix: Don’t overfill the album or buy the 3-ring albums with the 
“flat side ring.” Also, you may not want to use both sides of this kind of album page, since if you 
rearrange the pages, the events shown on the back of each page may no longer match!

2. '''Post-bound albums''' - Allow adjacent pages to lie relatively flat when opened, with no separation 
between them. Just like the Three-ring albums, the pages can be arranged, though not as easily. Also, 
you’re not as limited by the number of pages in an album. 

3. '''Strap-bound albums''' - This type of album has an expandable strap hinge. A disadvantage of this 
type of album is that the album must be taken apart to move pages. These albums, when opened, 
allow adjacent pages to lie flat without the hinge being seen. If you get an album where the page is 
bound to the strap, then you’ll need to get special page protectors. Some albums have the page 
protectors bound to the strap and pages can be slipped in and out through the top of the protector.

'''4. The Magnetic Album''' - This type of album lets journal entries and photos “stick” to the paper. Its really easy to get a nice looking album together fast. HOWEVER, the acid in the paper will 
quickly deteriorate your photos and memorabelia. See Caution note below!

'''CAUTION:'''Make sure that no matter what type or size of album that you end of using, that you get 
an album that is archival. That means that it uses acid free materials and that all papers / pages in it are lignin free. Also, never, ever use a magnetic album to store photos in. In just a few years, the 
photos will STICK to the magnetic stuff, and you’ll never get them free without ruining them. 

== 5. What is the purpose of using acid-free products? ==
Acid pages such as those used in magnetic albums will cause your pictures to age prematurely. This includes sticking to the page, chemically breaking down, and yellowing. Acid-free products help you PRESERVE your memories for years to come. Acid-free glue, pages, corners, stickers, pens, and much more will help you keep your album safe and pretty for years to come.

== 6. What are the four (4) different types of acid-free adhesive? ==
* '''Photo Stickers''' - Small squares of double-sided tape.
* '''Photo corners''' - These come in a variety of colors and are good for mounting square pictures.
* '''Double sided tape''' - Good for mounting lite-weight memorabelia.
* '''Glue''' - This comes in both temporary and permanent varieties.

== 7. What 'tool' is used to sharpen scissors and punches when they get dull? ==
To sharpen your scissors or punch, use them to cut fine sandpaper or aluminum foil. To keep them clean, use them to cut wax paper! More tips: http://scrapbook.lifetips.com

== 8. Name five (5) different types of acid-free paper used in Scrapbooking. ==
*'''Vellum''' - Really nice fancy paper for special projects. It was once made from animal gut, but is now manufactured from wood fibre which is, beaten until clear, or plastic. It has wonderful translucent quality and is slow to absorb ink.

*'''Cardstock''' - This is the easiest and cheapest scrapbook paper. It's available in lots of colors.

*'''Printed Paper''' - This may be cardstock or other type of paper, but it has designs pre-printed on the paper.

*'''Cover Paper''' - This paper is heavier weight, and is usually reserved for decorating the front-cover of your scrapbook. It comes in a variety of colors and designs.

*'''Paper Shapes''' - Pre-cut paper designs used to decorate themed pages. They can at times be 3-dimensional or artistically rendered.

*'''Textured Paper''' - is a category of paper that covers a wide range of embellished handmade papers. Examples include embossed, wrinkled, flex, thread, art, corrugated, crinkled. The texture could be bumpy, or rigid, or anything that has a ''feel'' to it.

== 9. Make a scrapbook of at least 12 pages (8 1/2 x 11 or larger) on one of the following themes, and incorporating the use of colored paper, stickers, decorative scissors, matting and journaling. ==
* School Year
* Sporting Events
* Vacations
* Holidays
* Building Projects (mission trips, new home, etc.)
* Wedding
* Birthday Party
* All About Me (birth to now)
* Family Reunions

'''Some tips for getting started:'''

1. Get organized. Find ''one'' place to put all the stuff you want to put in your album. This includes the photos, but may also include other “relics” or memorabelia that you wish to include. For example, if you’re doing a scrapbook on your school year, you may want to have a report card, a balloon from a special party, and the championship medal you won. These will all go into your scrapbook soon. 

2. Choose your Scrapbook type. Is your scrapbook going to be a chronological record of events, or a 
memory of a special theme or event? Once you’ve decided, start to organize your photos accordingly.
 
3. Collect, create, or organize your journal entries. See requirement #2 for more details.
 
4. Collect your scrapbooking supplies. Many stores sell scrapbook kits. Some basic supplies include: a scrapbook album, refill pages, acid-free adhesive, a acid-free pen, cardstock and printed papers (see req. 8), and a sharp set of scissors. Other helpful supplies such as paper cutters, corners, etc. can be purchased/used as necessary and as the budget allows. 

'''Note:''' Remember that Pathfinders come from many backgrounds, and you need to be sensitive to limited budgets and resources. In this AY Honor, we’re introducing them to the craft, not funding the craft! However, if there is someone in the Pathfinder community that will let the club borrow their scrapbooking supplies, enjoy them and say thank you when you return the well-cared for supplies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Finally, some clarity! ==
I finally figured out a way to look at it that makes sense. Let T be the time interval measured by each observer. This will be the dimension that's perpendicular to x. We can make a dimension perpendicular to another by proclaiming it, provided we don't arrange the math to be incompatible with the claim.

Then t is the pythagorean distance from (0,0,0,0) and (T,x,0,0). It is sqrt(T^2 + x^2). It is not normal to x unless v=0 or x=0. But that's OK.

When we change v, we don't rotate in a euclidean circle or a minkowski hyperbola. We merely extend or contract x. t= sqrt((T^2 + x^2)) extends or contracts to fit. The triangle gets longer or shorter, and one short side stays the same. This would be a hyperbolic rotation if t was perpendicular to x, but it's easier to see this way.

I can do lorentz transformations by using my function from T to t, and then continuing as usual with t. I don't need to compute t' because T^2 = t'^2 - x'^2. My Lorentz transforms all stay on a single T plane which I find easier to visualize. T is not changed by a Lorentz transform. No matter what you decide the other guys times and distances should have been based on your relative velocity, the time his clock measures will still be the same.

The light-cone turns into two different mappings. Sometimes you care about when light arrives at (_,0,0,0). If light from (T,x,y,z) arrives precisely at (0,0,0,0) then T=0. If it arrived 2 time-units earlier then T=2. Two time-units later, T=-2. The total distance is the same from (2,x,y,z) to (0,0,0,0) as from (-2,x,y,z). You can't be at (_,x,y,z) and have the distance be less than sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). So far, I have had no need to consider a distinction between time-like or space-like intervals. Sometimes, light can leave one location and arrive at (0,0,0,0) before time 0. Sometimes, light can leave (0,0,0,0) and arrive at (T,x,y,z) before time T. So far each problem I've worked may require me to know one or the other of those but not both. It is not important to either map or to calculations made from either map. It only matters when you must consider both maps at once.

So far I haven't seen that time t is directly connected to time measured at (_,0,0,0). It is calculated to be the time that would make sense for something else, somewhere else. t makes sense as the total euclidean distance. So v= space-distance/total-distance, rather than space-distance/time. At slow speeds these are almost the same, so Newtonian stuff works. 

I am not the first to do this, I have found a number of links using the keywords &quot;euclidean relativity&quot;. They tend to start out the same way I did, and then add extra complications. One added a fifth dimension. Another decided that we have four four-dimensional spaces that interact in some ways but not others. But the essentials here are not a crackpot idea, or at least they get a degree of respect.

I think you will need to keep your book on traditional lines even though they are probably harder to comprehend, because Wikibooks must follow the cultural traditions. Thank you for helping me see the problems and how to fix them.

I have removed some comments that I think don't help revision of the book. They are in the history and I won't object if you think any of them should be restored.

== Minkowski metric ==

:The more I consider your comments the more it seems that the book needs to be amended to emphasise that relativistic geometry is different from Euclidean geometry.  It is not good enough to just say that the metrics are different and then calculate using the Minkowski metric.  The approach taken in the book is simple but can be misleading.

::Agreed.

== another confusion ==
Here is my reasoning -- first, if it works with all the c's explicitly set out, then it will also work when we set c=1 and express velocities in fractions of lightspeed. So I will set c=1 and remove it from all the equations.

Earlier there was the claim that when s^2=0, -T^2 = (vt)^2 - t^2. 

:Strictly when &lt;math&gt;s^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;0 = (vt)^2 - t^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The metric is &lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - t^2&lt;/math&gt;. ( Although we should really be using &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; notation to indicate that the equations apply to intervals).

::Delta notation would help, and yet it would make it look more cluttered and harder for someone who's new to it to follow. But if they think they follow it easily but they don't understand that it's intervals, that isn't good either. 

:I say &quot;apparent&quot; because the capitalised symbols are being used for proper lengths and times, not for lengths and times in the moving or stationary reference frames.   Each section is complete in itself.  The section on coordinate times and lengths is correct and the symbols are consistent.  The section on phase is correct and the symbols are consistent within that section.  At first sight it seems that  the symbols have been switched in the phase example but in fact the capitalised X and T apply to proper lengths and times so are being used in the same way as in the previous section. However, as you are pointing out, this is not really good enough and misled us both.

:Specifically, in the section on proper lengths and times its says:

::'''A:''' John will also observe measuring rods at rest on Bill's planet to be shorter than his own measuring rods, in the direction of motion. This is a prediction known as &quot;relativistic length contraction of a moving rod&quot;. If the length of a rod at rest on Bill's planet is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then we call this quantity the proper length of the rod. The length &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of that same rod as measured from John's planet, is called '''coordinate length''', and given by

::&lt;math&gt;x = X \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

:And in the section on phase it says:

::'''B:''' But Bill's distance, x, is the length that he would obtain for things that John believes to be X metres in length. For Bill it is John who has rods that contract in the direction of motion so Bill's determination &quot;x&quot; of John's distance &quot;X&quot; is given from:

::&lt;math&gt;x = X \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

:Notice that '''X''' in &quot;A&quot; refers to a proper lenth in Bill's inertial frame of reference whereas in &quot;B&quot; '''X''' refers to a proper length in John's inerial frame of reference.  This is indeed misleading, as you say.

::I don't think that's the problem, but I'm having trouble saying what the problem is instead. I'm sure the issue is not whether we consider Bill's inertial frame versus John's inertial frame. I got a hint from you saying that proper lengths and times are not lengths and times in stationary reference frames. I had thought that I got a proper time when I considered the frame stationary.

:: I get T^2 = s^2  which for typical homework problems gives me a real s instead of imaginary, which happens with the stationary frame. That means, when Bill's clock measures 4 seconds it will measure 4 seconds regardless of what any other observers think their coordinate time t should be, so T is a relativistic invariant.   X is a proper length regardless whether it's John's or Bill's. John and Bill have symmetry anyway, and given similar circumstances will measure the same proper times and proper lengths. Won't they? (Is the issue that we mustn't compare one of their coordinate times or lengths to their own proper time or length, but only to the other's proper time and length?)'''

:I have been pondering how to overcome this problem.  We could use a lot of subscripts to clarify which observer is making which measurement but I am not sure that this will improve either the readability of the text or make it clear to the reader what is happening.  Perhaps the simplest change is to explain that the capitalised symbols refer to proper lengths and times.[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|discuss]] • 
[[Special:Contributions/RobinH|contribs]]) 17:55, 3 November 2013 (UTC)

::Maybe so. I had thought that it might be enough to just use a different symbol, like perhaps the tau that I used, with a note that it didn't refer to exactly the same thing as the T before. But now I don't in fact see why it isn't the same T. 

: Sticking with the old symbols &lt;math&gt;X = x \sqrt{1-v^2}&lt;/math&gt;. This is the classical length contraction result where moving lengths are measured by the conventionally stationary observer to be less than stationary lengths.  With your symbols when v=c:
:&lt;math&gt;c = X/T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = \frac{x/0}{t*0}&lt;/math&gt; which is infinity over zero. 
:with the correct symbols:
:&lt;math&gt;c = X/T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = \frac{x*0}{t*0}&lt;/math&gt; which is 1. 

This is two sides of a triangle congruent with the first. X is the long side, and x is one of the short sides, and the third side is vX. It is argued that vX=T. But (sqrt(1-v^2)/v)x = (1-v^2)/v)X = T. vX is not T. vX is the phase change of T, not T.

:This problem does not occur if the coordinate symbols are not mixed.  Notice in the symbol conventions of the article:
:&lt;math&gt;x = X \sqrt{1-v^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t = T \sqrt{1-v^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:not:
:&lt;math&gt;X = x \sqrt{1-v^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t = T \sqrt{1-v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

''I don't understand. The way the article is actually written, it says
''
: &lt;math&gt;t = T / \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;x = X \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

:::mea culpa. I rushed this and got hold of the wrong end of the stick. Having jumped to the conclusion that the problem lay with wrong IFRs I hastily got the wrong ones!  The actual problem lies with the symbols used in the section on phase in the article - see above.  I feel slightly chastened by missing the actual error and look forward to your comment on the changed text.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RobinH|contribs]]) 17:55, 3 November 2013 (UTC)

In the section on relativistic phase, we start with x^2 = X^2 - T^2.    X^2 = x^2 + T^2. But we already have t^2 = x^2 + T^2.  Somehow, the meaning of T has been changed.


As a minor matter, in the figure &quot;How clocks become out of phase along the line of travel&quot; you make T perpendicular to X. Probably people mostly won't look at it closely enough for this to matter, but it makes more sense to make T perpendicular to x, because X^2 = x^2 + T^2.

Consider the Lorentz Transformation for time:

[[File:Rellorent.png|thumb|left|Spacetime representation of Lorentz Transformation for time]]

Let &lt;math&gt;\tau = t - vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;, then, given that the moving observer sees that stationary observer move vT metres in T secs, from the Minkowski metric:

&lt;math&gt;(vT)^2 -(cT)^2  = - (c\tau)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T^2 = \frac {{\tau}^2}{(1-v^2/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

So:

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {\tau}{\sqrt {1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

or, substituting back for &lt;math&gt;\tau = t - vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {t - vx/c^2}{\sqrt {1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

{{clear}}

Notice that the Minkowski metric for 4D spacetime is used rather than the Pythagorean metric for 3D space. These metrics are just the relationship between the coordinate axes: Pythagorean 3 space: &lt;math&gt;r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2&lt;/math&gt;, Minkowskian spacetime: &lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

When the Minkowski Metric is used then:

1.  Time must always be at right angles to space in a given inertial frame of reference (IFR) because it is a coordinate axis like x,y and z.

2.  &lt;math&gt;s^2 = r^2 - (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt; not the Pythagorean &quot;square on hypoteneuse = sum of squares on other two sides&quot; ie: not &lt;math&gt;s^2 = r^2 + (ct)^2&lt;/math&gt;

In Special Relativity it is usually valid to use the Pythagorean form &lt;math&gt;s^2 = r^2 + (ict)^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i = \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Feynman says somewhere that he used ict to simplify calculations in developing QED before expressing them again in terms of real time. (Note however that imaginary time comes unstuck in General Relativity and the real form of the metric is used).

If we use the Pythagorean metric for 3D space to analyse the diagram above then:

&lt;math&gt;(vT)^2 +(cT)^2  = (c\tau)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T^2 (v^2/c^2 + 1) = {\tau}^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; T =  \frac {t - vx/c^2}{\sqrt {1+v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which is not the Lorentz transformation for time. However, if we resort to imaginary time then:

&lt;math&gt;(vT)^2 +(icT)^2  = (ic\tau)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

gives us:

&lt;math&gt;(vT)^2 -(cT)^2  = - (c\tau)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T^2 = \frac {{\tau}^2}{(1-v^2/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {t - vx/c^2}{\sqrt {1-v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the correct result, at least as far as SR goes...

So when T, x, and t are all real, we have an angle α so that v=sin(α) and w = cos(α). We can arrange T, x, and t in a right triangle so that 
&lt;math&gt;t = sin(\alpha)*x + cos(\alpha)*T = v*x + w*T. &lt;/math&gt;

:If we are going to treat time as just another spatial dimension - using a Pythagorean rather than a Minkowskian form of the metric - the complex form is needed.  Whichever convention is chosen for time (real or imaginary), time must always be at right angles to space in a given IFR, this means that the right angle should go between x and t. 

&lt;math&gt;x = v*t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T=w*t.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{vx}{w} = &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac {vx/c^2}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt; 

which makes T perpendicular to x.

[[File:Relfigure2.png|thumb|Geometric figure that appears to describe a relativistic relationship.]]


Similarly, 
&lt;math&gt;X=\gamma*(x-v*t)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w*X + v*t = x&lt;/math&gt;
And by the same reasoning &lt;math&gt;x = sin(\alpha)*t + cos(\alpha)*X.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t = v*x,    X = w*x.&lt;/math&gt;

If these are both true at the same time, we have t = v*x , x=v*t, t=v*v*t. Somewhere I have jumped to a conclusion.

You can surely see how eager I was to accept the idea that &lt;math&gt;x = X \sqrt{1 - v^2}&lt;/math&gt; as stated, rather than the other way round. That way it made sense.

:I think you have made an important contribution to the book.  You are obviously very capable of understanding the algebra but the book has failed to make the distinction between Pythagorean and Minkowskian metrics sufficiently clear and so is misleading in its current form.  The question is how to make the use of the different metrics sufficiently clear without losing the reader...[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RobinH|contribs]]) 17:49, 4 November 2013 (UTC)

== confusion ==

In the example right after Figure 5, it says that phase difference is proportional to v (which is clearly true) while time dilation is related to the square of velocity (which is not clearly true, time dilation is proportional to 1/sqrt(1-v^2)). It then compares (v/c)^2 to (v/c) to show that loss of simultaneity can be a dominant effect compared to time dilation.

:The binomial expansion of 1/sqrt(1-v^2)) leads to the expression being proportional to (v/c)^2 when v is less than c - of course, v is usually much less than c.  This means that phase can become become the dominant effect if x is large.  But this is an unimportant point in the example and only weakly relates phase to the Andromeda paradox in the next section. On balance I would still leave the comment out because it detracts from the worked example.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/RobinH|contribs]]) 09:48, 2 November 2013 (UTC)

:: I think I see! When v is small the first term of the binomial expansion dominates, and that's why you used it. Is this an example where classical physics is approximately correct? The larger v gets, the bigger the error in the classical approximation and the more necessary it is to use the relativistic form? It might deserve a longer explanation, somewhere else.

But aren't we actually trying to compare something like T/sqrt(1-v^2) to something like X*v/c^2? It might be simpler to compare (v/c)^2 to (v/c), but it isn't immediately obvious that this is what you want to compare.

== Inaccurate remark: “more properly, the time of the object as a function of position” ==

In this sentence,
: A world line is a plot of the position of some object as a function of time (more properly, the time of the object as a function of position) on a spacetime diagram.
I believe the remark “more properly, the time of the object as a function of position” is inaccurate.  Things can only be in one place at a given time, but they may be in a given place multiple times.  Hence, one should give the position as a function of time, not the other way around.  I’d be bold and change this if I had a tad more self-confidence (relativity is weird!).

Thanks for the great introduction to special relativity, by the way (I’ve only yet read this chapter).  This text has done more for me in fifteen minutes than my high school teacher could in months. —&amp;nbsp;[[User:Daniel Brockman|Daniel Brockman]] 10:43, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

:This is an interesting point. In mathematical terminology a graph with time as the ordinate should be describing change in time with x (ie: y is a function of x). A thing can be at any point on its worldline. The issue of whether a thing can travel up and down its own worldline is a different problem. The following discussions are about the hypothetical events due to space-time if it were actually possible to move around in the 4D manifold:

:1. In a 4D manifold such as spacetime each point is unique. This means that if you travelled back down your worldline by 10 secs you would be the person who was there 10 secs ago (you would not be the person 20 secs in the future).  If time exists then it would not be impossible that we are always jumping around our worldline - we would never know.

:3. Travelling back through space-time by 10 secs but off your own past worldline is a bizarre idea. Your brain would reset to its state 10 secs ago but when you looked around the world would be entirely different.  Your sudden materialisation would surprise the natives and surprise you because you would have no memory of 10 secs in the future. If such travel were possible you would certainly have travelled to a parallel universe because any description of space and time would need to contain both the place where you arrived without you in it and with you in it.

:4. Travel &quot;off world line&quot; has other problems, in SR material objects would become infinitely massive as they negotiated the space-time path from now to the past so could not make the trip without consuming a universe of energy, even if the trip were to a parallel universe.  However, this is not impossible in general relativity where, for instance, light cones can lean over in areas of curved space-time to provide circular paths through space-time back in time. Even this form of time travel would probably require the concept of parallel universes because the same volume of space-time, the volume where you arrive, could have two states.

:So, although visiting the same time coordinate many times is not forbidden by the nature of space-time other considerations make such visits either unknowable, require new theories such as parallel universes or energetically impossible.

:Notice that I introduced this discussion with the caveat &quot;if it were actually possible to move around in the 4D manifold&quot;. Relativity, whether Galilean, Special or General cannot explain change - QM cannot either.

== Intelligibility ==
Why is this explanation so much more difficult to follow than Einstein's original 1905 paper? (I refer to the 1923 translation to English).  
I can understand that modern understanding of the theory would be more complete, but modern explanations are much inferior when it comes to the ability of a newcomer to comprehend.      

[[User:PAS|PAS]] 02:50, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

:This book is about Special Relativity. Special Relativity is a theory that evolved between 1905 and 1915. It is the theory that the manifold of events that constitute the universe can be described using a metric with signature (---+). Physical laws and the constant &quot;c&quot; are consequences of the invariants in this metrical structure.  Einstein's 1905 paper is not the sole, or even definitive, text in the evolution of Special Relativity, Minkowski's 1908 presentation is probably more definitive. Einstein would probably have been given equal precedence with Poincare and Lorentz had he not produced GR in 1915.

:Einstein's 1905 paper is not an explanation of SR, it is the mathematical application of a particular assumption about a constant velocity for all observers. The assumption was immediately problematical because &quot;velocity&quot; is a relationship between length and time intervals (esp. in Galilean Relativity). Within 4 years of Einstein's 1905 paper the origin of the assumption about a constant velocity had become understood in terms of metrical geometry and Einstein's proposal was placed fully in a theoretical context. 

:In my experience students fail to understand relativity because the assumption of a constant velocity without any explanation appears absurd to them. If they are told that by making an apparently absurd assumption they can derive the Lorentz transformation many of them will feel that the whole exercise is apparently absurd. On the other hand I have not found any students who find the geometrical approach to be absurd and 100% understand SR having learnt it. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:57, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

:Einstein stated himself: &quot;After my theory of relativity has been dissected by mathematicians I don't understand it anymore&quot;. This seems to be a general problem of modern physics - mathematics and particularly mathematical models become more more primary over observation, experiment and conclusive predictions based on them. SR describes a set of laws of nature and as such it can and must be understood in terms of '''natural''' effects predicted by the theory, geometrical approach is secondary and cannot balance out lack of imagination or poor logic skills (both are ridiculously often demonstrated by students or even respectable full-size physicists).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:KA24ITB24.jpg|thumb|right|240px|KA24DE with ITB's]]
Individual Throttle Bodies (ITB's) are used on high-end NA race engines. ITB's have been experimented on with the KA24DE only to have limited success so far. Some Race-built KA/Datsun &quot;frankenstein&quot; motors have made over 200hp N/A.
=Custom ITB Setup For KA24DE using GSXR 750 or GSXR 1000 Throttle Bodies=
==Required Parts==
01' or higher Suzuki GSXR 1000 or 750 Throttle Bodies.

an KA24DE extra intake manifold. 

Rubber Plumbing Couplers.

==Step By Step==
===Manifold Assembly===
Cut the runners off approximately 5&quot; from the head flange. 

Go to Home Depot and get some rubber plumbing couplers. They're about $5 a piece with clamps.

Clamp the Mani and TB's together to yield this...

[[Image:KA24ITB2.jpg|100px|(step 1) Figure 2]]
[[Image:KA24ITB3.jpg|100px|(step 1) Figure 3]]
[[Image:KA24ITB5.jpg|100px|(step 1) Figure 5 with the couplers trimmed down, and the velocity stacks on...]]

Now make 2 brackets that brace the TB's to the mani, for extra strength.
I used 3/4&quot; by 3/16&quot; steel. You can find this at Home Depot. Bolted one end to the TB's and the other slips under the mounting point for the PCV rail. Make one per side. Should look something like this...

[[Image:KA24ITB7.jpg|240px|Step 2 Figure 1]]

Now make a bracket for the throttle cable to slip into. I used 1 1/2&quot; angle iron. This can also be found at Home Depot. Make it to bolt onto the mounting surface that the EGR used to sit on. 

[[Image:KA24ITB8.jpg|100px|(step 3) Figure 1]]
[[Image:KA24ITB9.jpg|100px|(step 3) Figure 2]]

Get a SOHC throttle cable. The DOHC one is wayyyy too long. The SOHC cable is too long too, but better than the DOHC one. The end of the Nissan throttle cable that slips onto the throttle wheel fits in the Suzuki throttle wheel perfectly. 

get two air boxes from a 01' and up GSXR 750. These have the shortest velocity stacks. Each airbox has two short stacks, and two long ones. Once you have 2 boxes, you will have two full sets of velocity stacks to help you achieve the best powerband down the road.

[[Image:KA24ITB10.jpg|100px|(step 4) Figure 1]]

That's it for the manifold part of things.

===Fuel Management===

I chose to use a MegaSquirt (MS) because of price, and because, well, I love DIY stuff as you can probably see. haha

Get your board and bags of components all lined up like so...

[[Image:KA24ITB11.jpg|100px|(step 5) Figure 1]]

Build the stimulator first. This will help you learn how to make proper solder joints befor you start soldering the actual MS together. The stimulator hooks up to Megasquirt and stimulates the MS such that it thinks it is running an engine. What this does is allow you to make sure all of your MS is built and running correctly before trying to start the car with it. It also allows you to download new codes to the CPU chip as you see fit, without having to have the MS in the car. Very trick.

[[Image:KA24ITB12.jpg|100px|(step 6) Figure 1]]

Follow the MegaManual at www.megasquirt.info and you will end up with this...


Now build the pigtail for the wiring harness...

[[Image:KA24ITB14.jpg|100px|(step 6) Figure 3]]

and here's a better pic of how many wires there are. This is the entire engine harness. Stock one gets removed completely.

[[Image:KA24ITB15.jpg|100px|(step 6) Figure 3]]

that's basically it for the MS.

===Ignition Setup===
Now for the ignition setup.

I chose to run a distributor-less system off of early 90's Ford Escorts. This system uses a trigger wheel that is mounted to the crank pulley to fire the ignition instead of a gear driven distributor. This has many advantages, the first of which being that it is more accurate than the stock distributor. It also gives full control of the ignition timing.

from left to righ in the pic below, we have the EDIS module, the VR sensor (reads the trigger wheel on the crank pulley) and the Coil.

[[Image:KA24ITB16.jpg|100px|(step 7) Figure 1]]

Here is a picture of the spark plug wires modified to fit down the spark plug holes in the valve cover. the boot that connects to the plugs has about a 30 degree bend in them so I bent them back straight, and trimmed the boots until they slid down into the holes in the valve cover.

[[Image:KA24ITB17.jpg|100px|(step 7) Figure 2]]

Next, you have to get a trigger wheel made. I have a friend who is a CNC machinist, so he made one for me, as well as prepping the crank pulley for the wheel.

[[Image:KA24ITB18.jpg|100px|(step 7) Figure 2]]

And the wheel fit onto the pulley looks like so...

[[Image:KA24ITB19.jpg|100px|(step 7) Figure 4]]

[[Image:KA24ITB20.jpg|100px|(step 7) Figure 5]]

Now make a bracket to mount the VR sensor onto. I put mine where the A/C compressor used to be. just some more of the angle Iron used before, long enough to mount the sensor on, facing the crank pulley.

Next, make a block off plate for the hole that the distributor used to occupy. I made mine big enough to mount the new coil to, as that is as far as the plug wires would reach. Just simple 1/8&quot; thick steel. when finished it looks like this bolted to the engine, with the new coil mounted on it.

[[Image:KA24ITB21.jpg|100px|(step 7) Figure 6]]

[[Image:KA24ITB22.jpg|100px|(step 7) Figure 7]]

On a side note, here is the stock KA24DE timing map I scaled down. I have used it and it works great. 

[[Image:KA24ITB23.jpg|100px|(step 7) Figure 8]]

===Final Assembly===
Putting it all together.

Now pull off your stock intake mani, and take out your engine harness. You will no longer need either of these. bolt the new mani onto the engine, it should look something like this...

[[Image:KA24ITB24.jpg|100px|(step 8) Figure 1]]
[[Image:KA24ITB25.jpg|100px|(step 8) Figure 2]]
[[Image:KA24ITB26.jpg|100px|(step 8) Figure 2]]

You can also see in those pics the wiring harness was finished. It's simply following the diagram, running each wire to each sensor.

the only things that were not on the diagrams were the tach signal, water temp gauge and the switched ignition power supply. the Tach signal was cake, run a wire from the Clean Tach Out pin on the EDIS module to the Tach input on the back of the gauge cluster. That's it. Speedo will still work. Run a wire from the second temp sensor in the intake mani to the coolant temp input on the back of the gauge cluster. that's all for that. And the B/R wire coming from the igntion switch on the steering column needs to be tapped into to get switched power to MS, and the ignition components.

However, the wiring diagram for the ignition is slightly off. the polarity of the VR sensor wires is opposite than in the diagrams, so wire that up accordingly. 

I used the stock injectors for now, but I have some SR injectors lying around waiting to go in. Stock injectors will be enough for now. 

for the brake booster, I used the stock PCV rail, and ran one line from its output to the brake booster. Has worked great. I also Tee'd a 1/4&quot; vacuum line out of this line, on it's way to the booster, for the fuel pressure regulator. Before doing any of this, I measured the vacuum in this line, and in the rest of the intake mani under all braking conditions, and the booster did not affect the vacuum in the engine. This being so, it is safe, and fine to run the vacuum for the FPR from the brake booster vacuum line.

the TB's come from the factory with a vacuum line from each port Tee'd into one. this is used for the map sensor. Simply run a line from this to MS. the MAP sensor is inside the MS box.

Then swap out the throttle cables, and hook the SOHC one up.

Finally, plug the EGR hole in your header.

If I recall correctly, this is about it for what I did on this whole project to get it running. for the specifics of the MS building and whatnot, and the ignition specifics and diagrams, visit www.msefi.com and www.megasquirt.info.

I specifically did not go into extensive detail in these areas because it is covered very well at those two sites.

So finally start it up and get it idling correctly. Do this by adjusting the screw that adjusts how far open the throttle plates are at &quot;closed&quot; so it has an idle speed you like, and adjusting the fuel amount in the MS. You can then get your own wideband to tune it, or take it to someone. Wichever's clever. 

After tuning it, GO DRIVE IT! Don't forget to give yourself a pat on the back too!

Please forgive me if I have forgotten anything, it is a very long project, there is so much to do. I may have left a few small details out, but this is the major stuff.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Turbocharging the KA24DE can produce great numbers if the tuning is right. It's easy to attain over 200rwhp with a basic turbo kit like the kind sold on ebay. Advanced tuning and internal engine modification has produced KA24 240SX's with 500+ horsepower.

For a budget turbo build, you can get a t25 turbo and 5-7 psi without having to upgrade the injectors or MAF.  You will need a fuel management unit (rising rate fuel pressure regulator).  A new fuel pump is recommended.  You also need to be careful with the ignition timing.  MSD's Boost Timing Master can retard the timing appropriately.

The stock internals have been proven to be quite resilient. There are individuals who have made 350+ rwhp on totally stock internals. Here are a few quick limits on stock KA24DE internals. Keep in mind these are NOT EXACT NUMBERS. True limits can vary signifigantly from motor to motor. Before undergoing any turbocharging project, it is a VERY good idea to do a compression test. The closer to 180 psi you are the better. Anything below 150 and you generally want to start to think twice about a turbo project. So without further adue...
 
 Pistons - Good for approx. 275-300 hp
 Rods - approx. 400 hp
 Crank - Indestructible
 Valvetrain - No known issues
 Head Gasket - approx. 320 hp WITH A GOOD TUNE (see below)
 Head Studs - approx. 300-320 hp
 
...Ofcourse, all of this is dependent upon a good tune. As long as your compression, timing, and air/fuel ratios are all within spec, and the motor is not continually beaten upon, you can expect extended performance out of these parts. Many individuals are making 300+ hp on stock blocks with 200k+ miles on them!

      <text xml:space="preserve">A free-flowing exhaust has been know to create increases in both horsepower and torque across the RPM range in the KA24-powered 240SX.

Unlike other 4 cylinder engines, the KA24DE responds very well to most of the 3&quot; exhausts on the market. Improvements have been made across the entire powerband, with no loss of torque.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Cold Air Intake is a performance system designed to allow for a greater volume of air to enter the engine, at a lower temperature.  The system is usually comprised of a replacement filter, an air passage tube, and mounting hardware.
 
The replacement filter generally substitutes a cloth element that uses special oil, applied to the cloth element to collect dust and prevent particles from entering the engine.  Although performance filters that work without the need for oiling have been introduced.  The cloth elements allow greater volumes of air and easier flow of air providing greater power and faster revving from the engine.

The air passage tube carries the air from the filter to the throttle body.  The tube is generally constructed of metal and designed in such a manner to move the physical location of the air filter to an area away from the heat of the engine, such as inside the fender or behind the bumper. resulting in a cooler intake charge.  Colder air has a higher density, offering more oxygen for combustion.  The tube generally has holes and fittings for attachment of factory fitted electronic sensors, and factory fitted vacuum tubes.
  
Mounting hardware usually consists of brackets to support the tube by bracing it on the body or engine. 

 
Several Cold Air Intakes are available for the 240SX

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Header is metal plumbing that directs hot exhaust gases out of the engine to the exhaust. There are two specific design features to the plumbing. The Plumbing is called runner lengths that are designed in what is called the 4-1 header design, or the 4-2-1 header design. The purpose of header design is to manipulate the way power is used in the power band. Power is manipulated through pulses in a process known as scavaging, either for function of low to mid-end power use, or for the function of high-end power use. 4-2-1 is designed to function as a low to mid end power header. The stock header is restrictive and can be upgraded to a less restrictive unit for a slight increase in power, while the 4-1 header was made for high-RPM applications. Stock headers were created for maximum back pressure to regulate smog emissions, and in no way is the stock header a performance enhancer.

I am working within a school that has about 100 students of the Finnish Language studying at any one time. I am thinking of using WIKIs to develop learning materials.  The source material will come from professional teachers and will be translated (and improved upon) by the students into their home language if they so wish.

The logical place is to create this material is in wikibooks but I have seen you have already started one in English.   There will be grammars, readers, audio material, and exercises.  I can see you have spent a lot of time creating your particular material and I would not want to destroy it!  But I'd like to know how you think we can work together so that my objective is met also. 

[[User:Hauskalainen|Hauskalainen]] 13:18, 29 March 2006 (UTC)


Hello Hauskalainen, it's nice to see that others also want to take part in this wikibook. This book consists largely of exercises (made by me) and hasn't almost any grammar, readers or other texts, so your material is more than welcome! This book yet lacks main structure (lessons, which things are taught first) and needs working. 

If you have exercises that have been developed by professional teachers just put them on the suitable pages. The existing ones mustn't be deleted, but just perhaps edited or moved.

[[User:Erat|Erat]] 16:29, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

I won't delete anything but my knowledge is too far advanced for me to want to start writing any lessons.  However, I have introduced the books to the people at the school and also those who subscribe to the Yahoo! Finnish group. We also had a visit last Friday from people teaching at another school at Pori (Western Finland) and they were quite interested in the WIKI work we have done to date, not just in the English Wikibooks but in the Finnish and Russian books too. If they introduce it to their students, the numbers with exposure may rise. But that said, I have not seen much interest from the students in our school using their free time to develop anything. However, if the idea gains ground and I can get sponsorship to write more material, I may end up developing extra material.  But at the moment it seems rather unlikely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Normal Probability Distribution is one of the most useful and more important distributions in statistics.  It is a continuous variable distribution.  Although the mathematics of this distribution can be quite off putting for students of a first course in statistics it can nevertheless be usefully applied with out over complication.

The Normal distribution is used frequently in statistics for many reasons:

1) The Normal distribution has many convenient mathematical properties.

2) Many natural phenomena have distributions which when studied have been shown to be close to that of the Normal Distribution.

3) The Central Limit Theorem shows that the Normal Distribution is a suitable model for large samples regardless of the actual distribution.

== Mathematical Characteristics of the Normal Distribution ==

A continuous random variable , X, is normally distributed with a probability density function :

&lt;math&gt;\frac1{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\; \exp\left(-\frac{\left(x-\mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) \!&lt;/math&gt;

Recommend moving this section ahead of Particle Equilibrium.

Makes more sense to me to discuss this right after discussing forces as vectors, and then move onto a discussion of particle equilibrium.</text>

Welcome to my user page! My name is Terry. I am a stay-at-home [[w:homeschool|homeschool]]ing mom to two boys, an artist, writer, [[w:seamstress|seamstress]], designer, [[w:bibliophile|bibliophile]], and [[w:belly-dancer|belly-dancer]]. My background is in education and biology. While I have been a frequent user of Wikipedia for a long time, I discovered [[Wikijunior]] and have been inspired to start more formally contributing. I would also like to aid in the development of wikibooks geared towards pre-K-12 educators (both home and classroom). 

It is my personal POV, that the future of education is not in budget reform and testing, but complete revolution. High-quality open-content sources seem like a great place to do some good work towards that goal.



'''Current Projects:'''

#Proofreading [[Wikijunior Solar System]] - My plan is to start with the oldest, most complete books and work through them, one at a time until they are done. They seem to be stagnating in a state of near completion. 
#[[User:Starchildmom/Cell_Unit_Study|Basic Cell Unit Study ]] --I have been working on this book offline for sometime. I want to play with it on my own page for awhile before I turn it into an actual wikibook. I need to learn how to format it properly. It is written as a lapbook style unit study for middle school age children, or younger advanced students.
#[[User:Starchildmom/Lapbook]] - An how-to guide geared mainly towards homeschoolers, but useful for all educators. Nowhere near ready to be a wikibook. I am beginning to add the parts that need to be linked to from the [[User:Starchildmom/Cell_Unit_Study|Basic Cell Unit Study ]] . This will initially be a graphics heavy book. Eventually, I hope to add video and sound, making it easy to use for all types of learners and non-English speakers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What should be linked on this page?==
I am wary of this page getting cluttered with links, but don't like removing peoples work. But, imagine how many argueably relevant links could be beside the california contact. Because of this I urge Lars to remove the links under his name as contact for denmark. They are not really relevant to a contact page, if there is a webpage for contacting straw bale builders in denmark that would be great (what about a link to LØB?). If those pages (especially the folkecenter one) have valuable information it should be included in this wikibook, or better still a danish wikibook or wikipedia entry. Does that sound fair? --[[User:DuLithgow|DuLithgow]] 21:32, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

:The suggestions all make sense. The reason why I didn't involve LØB but the other two ones is, that I find that they are the most informative and helpfull Danish webpages on SB-construction.
But better even to have via the international wikibook a link to resources in Denmark, and then quote them thereon.
My thoughts since yesterday were apparently like yours: wikibook is good ONLY if there is not too much info. What I mean is, that the amount of info has to be organized so it is very very easy to get an overview.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The simplest types of magnets are permanent (aka hard) magnets and soft magnets.  Permanent magnets retain their magnetization after they are removed from the magnetic field that magnetizes them. Soft magnets lose their magnetization after they are removed from the magnetic field that magnetizes them.  This naming came about because in the nineteenth century, when magnetic materials first were studied seriously -- for application to electrical transformers -- it was found that iron, a softer material, was magnetically soft, and carbon steel, a harder material, was magnetically hard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==''Hay que'' y ''tener que''==
===Tener que + infinitive===
 '''Tener que + infinitive—To have to do something''' 
Simply conjugate tener, add que, and then add the infinitive of what has to be done.

====Ejemplos (Examples)====
:'''Tengo que limpiar''' mi dormitorio. &lt;br&gt;
I have to clean my room.
:Maribel '''tiene que salir''' para escuela. &lt;br&gt;
Maribel has to leave for school.

===Hay que + infinitive===
 '''Hay que+ infinitive--It is obligatory to do something'''
 This verb phrase is similar to the above.  However, you don't have to conjugate hay.

====Ejemplos====
:'''Hay que estudiar''' en la clase de ingles. &lt;br&gt;  It is necessary to study in English class. 
:'''Hay que practicar'''

===Contrasting Uses of &quot;Hay que&quot; and &quot;Tengo que&quot;===

 &quot;Hay que&quot; is used for impersonal expressions whereas &quot;Tener que&quot; always has a subject.

:Juan tiene una prueba de ingles el viernes. Él '''tiene que estudiar'''.&lt;br&gt;Juan has a quiz in English on Friday. He has to study.

:No es fácil aprender el ingles. '''Hay que estudiar''' mucho. &lt;br&gt; It isn't easy to learn English. It is necessary to study a lot.

==Ir a + infinitive==
 '''Ir a + infinitive--To be going to do something'''
This verb phrase is used to say that someone is going to do something in the future. It is often used as an alternative to the future tense.

===Ejemplos===
:Voy a viajar en México. &lt;br&gt; I am going to Vacation in Mexico OR I will vacation in Mexico. (same thing)
:Vamos a estudiar por el examen en ingles. &lt;br&gt; We are going to study for our English exam.

==Acabar de + infinitive==
Acabar + de + infinitive = to have just (verb in preterite) 

'Just' here means very recently in the past.

Por ejemplo:

Acabo de ir al cine. - I have just gone to the movies.

Acabas de hacer la tarea - You just have done the homework.

==Tener ganas de==
'''Tener:''' to have &lt;br&gt;
'''Tener ganas de:''' to want to, to feel like

Tengo ganas de ir al parque. &gt;&gt; ''I feel like going to the park.''

¿Tienes ganas de bailar? &gt;&gt; ''Do you feel like dancing?''

Tener + ganas de + infinitivo &gt;&gt; to feel like (doing) ...

Conjugate [[../Tener|tener]], add &quot;ganas de&quot; and the [[../Infinitive|infinitive]] of the action verb. 

Note: The verb &quot;ganar&quot; means to earn, to win, or to gain. Joined with the verb &quot;tener&quot; it means to feel like.

Vera! Joan cried. She stomped on the grass toward her friend, her backpack swinging from side to side on her shoulder. Vera looked over her shoulder and grinned at her friend. I'm so glad you're back from Fiji. Yeah, me too. Vera smiled. Just then Laura came striding over furiously, almost tripping on a tree root. What's with Laura? Vera whispered to Joan. Oh, she's just mad about the surprise test. Joan whispered back. Vera looked at her, awestruck. A test?! Don't you worrie. Joan said, reassuringly, waving a test paper in her hand. I've got everything under control.</text>

If you delete everything and click &quot;Save page&quot;, that is annoying, because then no one can read that page. That is how wiki works; any user can change what any other user wrote.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To whom it may concern:
As a uke beginner, I'm very interested in strumming the chords as the accompaniment for a song. However, I have no idea which chord should be properly used when the melody of the song is going on. Referring to some chords used by the musicians in some songs, I can't figure out why. In order to get harmonical result, one of my friends told me just use I, IV and V7 chords for everything.
I doubt it is a good way to strum my ukulele.
When I use C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am &amp; Bdim for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7 respectively in a key=C song, I can't distinguish whether they are fit or not.
Is it possible for you to tell me some fundamental theories on accompaniment which can be commonly used or acceptable to the songs when one is facing? Otherwise, what I have to do is only following the chords above the musical staff made by the authors or musicians, but no way to create something one likes.
Thank you a lot in advance for your kind help.
Yours sincerely,
Theo Huang

I've read the music theory book in order and when I got to this part I was confused. Maybe it's because it has a bad introduction or because there isn't something between here and the other parts of the book that needs to be there. [[User:24.110.21.111|24.110.21.111]] 18:49, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

== This page needs a new introduction. ==

I do have some experience with music, and the chord chart rules at the beginning are in very limited in use at best, and plain incorrect at worst.  There are many, many instances in which these rules are just ignored.  I suggest being more clear about where exactly these rules came from, and where they are being used.  The intro doesn't even address minor keys...

Second, the idea that you can make a complete guide to every chord formation is a bit misguided.  You can address most of the major chords and systems of forming chords, but that kind of completeness is really not realistic, given the wide variety of chords/systems that exist.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;'''What Is Graff?'''&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

What is graffiti to the eyes of the public? To many, graffiti is a defacing of public property, some words scrawled out on a brick wall, some spray paint done in about three seconds with absolutely no meaning. Most people pass by a person doing block letters in a note book. They take one look at the letters and accuse the person of being a vandal. These people don't see between the lines in the art form we know as graffiti.

What's graffiti to us?

Well, take a look at it this way. Graffiti is an art, has every right to be displayed in a museum (which, in fact, some is), and is something people from urban environments almost enjoy. It's a movement, it's a culture, it's a way of life. It's talent that flows in the form of lettering and cartooning, red and black and orange and pearlescent gold spray paint. It's design capability that flows in the form of Sharpie ink, Marks-a-lot paint, and normal pencil or pen. And what I said above about people unable to read between the lines, is that FAME means something other than what it seems. SARS means something other than just a sickness.

If you're reading to learn how to vandalize property, I suggest you find another source. If you're serious about making things beautiful, about the ART part of graffiti, about the calligraphy flow of this underdog art form, then I welcome you to my world.

Because once in, there's a big wall behind you that's about to prevent you from turning back.

      <comment>/* The Deskbar */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Unless you have never used a computer before, you are probably at least somewhat familiar with the basics of getting around a computer with the mouse and keyboard. Haiku is very much like other computer software in that it uses files and folders, but it also has a few other tricks up its sleeve which make working a little easier, provided that you know about them. 

'''Folders and Files'''

Files are documents that you -- or someone else -- make and save for later use, obviously. Folders are containers used to organize them, but you knew that already.

'''Links to Files'''

Macintosh computers call them 'aliases' and Windows calls them 'shortcuts'. Regardless of what you want to call them, Haiku allows you to make an icon which pretends to be another file when you double click on it. This is really useful on the Desktop for programs or other documents you use quite a bit.

'''Volumes'''

Something which may strike you as unfamiliar is the concept of Volumes. A volume is a disk or a section of a disk. In order for Haiku to use a disk, such as a floppy you just put in the drive or that fancy new flash drive that doubles as your keychain, you need to do something called 'mounting' it. This is merely telling Haiku that you want it to make the drive available for use. Any volumes that Haiku has available for use will appear on the Desktop. If you have lots of them, you may wish to unmount volumes which you don't use to make the others easier to find.

'''Queries'''

A technology unique to Haiku and its BeOS brethren are queries. Queries are a way of quickly finding files or folders based on what you know about them, such as what kind of file it is. You can save them and use them later, create music playlists out of them, check your e-mail with them and do many other things. They are very powerful and have been copied by MacOS X and Windows Vista. More on this later.

== The Desktop ==

The Desktop is a workspace for you to place folders, files, and links to give you quick access to them. You can also add a picture to act as the background to show your own unique personality.

== The Deskbar ==

The Deskbar is quite a lot like the Start Menu used in Windows, but it has some differences that make it stand out as being an easier way to work. The main functions of the Deskbar are allowing you to open applications and preference panels, to manage windows, as an easily accessible way of opening recently used documents and applications, to search for files and to shut down or restart your computer.

The Deskbar consists of three major parts, the '''menu''' (which is accessed by clicking the leaf), the '''status view''' (which consists of the clock and system information), and the '''window list''', which is as the name describes: a list of all your currently open applications and their windows.  Clicking on the blue leaf will open up a menu which will allow the user to select programs.

In its default position the menu is located in the top right corner, but can be moved by grabbing the dotted line  to the right of the '''status view'''  with the mouse and dragging it to the desired location. Pulling the Deskbar to the center of one of the top or bottom of the screen will give you the standard &quot;Windows&quot; look.  Pushing it towards a corner can also give you a condensed &quot;mini&quot; menu.  Configuring the Deskbar is also quite easy.  Click on the &quot;leaf&quot;, mouse over &quot;Deskbar Settings&quot; and click on &quot;Configure Leaf Menu&quot;.  From here you can add/ remove programs or groups from the Deskbar menu.  You can also change preferences like how many recent apps or documents you want listed here.

===Opening applications===

Opening an application with the deskbar is easy. Simply select the '''menu''', move the cursor down to the text reading &quot;Applications&quot; and a list of the available applications will appear, allowing you select the one you want by clicking on it. The process for opening preferences is nearly identical, the only exception being that &quot;Preferences&quot; should be selected instead of &quot;Applications&quot;.

===Managing windows===

To draw focus on a window, simply click the open application's entry in the '''window list'''. If the application has multiple windows open, you can select which one by clicking and holding the mouse button on the application's entry. This also presents you with the options of showing/hiding/closing all of that application's windows or quitting the application. Another handy feature of the '''window list''' is the ability to open files by dragging them onto an application's entry. An example of this would be opening a text file by dragging it from a Tracker window onto a running &quot;StyledEdit&quot;'s '''window list''' entry.

===Accessing recently opened documents or applications===

Accessing recently opened documents or applications is performed in much of the same fashion as opening applications or preferences. Simply select the '''menu''', select either &quot;Recent Applications&quot; or &quot;Recent Documents&quot;, then select the entry you desire.

===Searching for files===

Searching for files is simply a matter of accessing the '''menu''', selecting &quot;Find...&quot;, then in the window that appears, entering what you are looking for in the text box and clicking &quot;Search&quot;. A Tracker window will then appear with the search's results. For a more in-depth look at searching for files on Haiku, see the section &quot;Finding Files and Folders: Queries&quot;.

===Shutting down or restarting the computer===

To shut down or restart your computer in Haiku, just select either &quot;Shut down&quot; or &quot;Restart&quot; from the '''menu'''.

== The Tracker ==
Tracker is the part of Haiku which allows you to manage your files. If you are familiar with the Finder on a Macintosh computer, then you will find Tracker to be quite familiar. Anyone familiar with Windows should find no problem in using Tracker. In fact, you may find it easier to use.

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/Ellisun|Ellisun]] ([[User talk:Ellisun|talk]]) to last version by Adrignola</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">On their path to graduate, something that terrifies many medical students, is a series of practical clinical examinations (also known as OSCEs or ''vivas'') conducted in front of an examiner, having your every move assessed, with miniscule amount of time. Some medical schools have an entire day of OSCEs, which form a large part of the overall mark for the course.

Qualified doctors and other health professionals examine people all the time. ...Anyway...

This small book intends to give a guide as to what the examiner wants, the rational for doing what is done, and some quick cheatsheets, with the main steps often used in exams.

Examination varies from place to place, and profession to profession. We intend to have reasonably complete exams, but that can still be done in a short amount of time. You can edit this book, and help improve it.

We've aimed to include examination, history taking, advice giving, and various assessments, as these are the things that appear in end-of-year (and mid-year) tests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is just a quick guide to various history and examinations.

The pages are mostly quick bulleted points, designed to be used on their own when practising a particular exam station. Things that you might want to say to the examiner appear in quotation marks &quot;like this&quot;.

They should keep everything in a logical order, and minimise the amount a patient has to move around.

==History and assessment==
* [[/General medical history/]]
* [[/Psychiatric history/]]
* [[/Self-harm or suicide attempt/]]

==Examination==
* [[/Quick examination of everything/]] (useful for clerking in a patient)
* [[/Cardiovascular examination/]]
* [[/Respiratory examination/]]
* [[/Combined cardiovascular and respiratory examination/]]
* [[/Gastrointestinal examination/]]
* [[/Abdominal examination/]]
* [[/Neurological examination/]]
* [[/Musculoskeletal examination/]]

==Advice giving==
These tend to vary more from place to place. We have tried to stay general, without being to vague. Just use your common sense when using them.

I'd like to add a personal note that I think it is awsome that you are trying to help out here on Wikibooks and contribute to Wikibooks.  Please note that this is not quite like other wikis, where you simply name a page and get going by randomly linking from one topic to another.  Usually we try to write &quot;books&quot; here, where all of the &quot;pages&quot; are linked together with some sort of common naming system, where modules like [[Light year (ly)]] are often deleted due to the fact that it is hard to locate the context that it is being used.

Please also look over Wikibooks policies as mentioned in the welcome message above, and in particular I would recommend that you visit [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] for an indepth description of what sorts of things are encouraged here on this website.

We are primarily oriented toward writing textbooks and other non-fiction content that has a narritive that flows from one page to the next, with increasing details as you move on from one topic to the next.  If you are interested in helping out with building a glossary of astronomical terms, you might want to check out [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary:Astronomical terms]], that is being hosted on our sister project Wiktionary.  There are some genuine word buffs on that site which love to define different words and are also interested in technical accuracy of those terms as well.

Again, thank you for your contributions, and I hope that you do continue to participate at Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:46, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

== 1. Have the Scrapbooking Honor ==
Answers to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Scrapbooking|Scrapbooking]] Honor can be found in the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts|Arts and Crafts]] chapter of this book.

== 2. What is lignin? ==
Lignin is the natural bonding element which holds wood fibers together. It is the chemical found in paper that causes it to yellow with age.  Newsprint contains lignin—you’ll notice how brittle and yellowed a newspaper becomes after just a few days. Like acid, lignin can be removed during processing to make scrapbooking paper safe. Look for &quot;lignin-free&quot; paper.

== 3. What plastic is safe to use in Scrapbooks? ==
Try to find some made out of Polypropylene plastic, polyester or acrylic. These materials are safe for photographs and paper and will not cause any damage or degradation to them.

== 4. What plastic is not and why not? ==
Polyvinylchlorine (PVC) plastic is the type that degrades over time releasing the chlorine as a gas.  Plastics with PVC’s and PVA’s can cause photos to become yellow and become sticky over time and damage delicate scrapbook items.

== 5. Describe the value of Scrapbooking to future generations. ==
Scrapbooking allows us to share with future generations and others, what we believed, how we lived and helps keep the past alive for the future.

== 6. How do you fix a journaling error? ==
To repair a journaling error you cover the writing with stickers, use a small piece of paper like a background to cover it up, or re-write by starting over.

== 7. Complete an album of at least 24 pages of a size not less than 8 1/2 x 11 using techniques that includes the use of at least 10 of the following: ==
* '''Matting''' - A decorative border around a picture to serve as a frame or provide contrast between the picture and the frame
* '''Double Matting''' - A technique where two mats, with contrasting colors, are cut with slightly different sized opening. This allow you to see a small amount of the inner color mat as well as a larger amount of the outer mat. This create a very elegant contrast and accent for the portrait.
* '''Border Designs''' - For ideas go to http://www.4murfs.com/scrappershideaway/sharonsborders.shtml
* '''Journaling Boxes''' - A box that contains your journaling. To have an idea what it looks like go to http://www.scrapfriends.us/articles/journaling_boxes.html
* '''Colored Paper'''
* '''Printed Paper'''
* '''2 Page Layouts'''
* '''Die Cuts'''
* '''Self Designed Die Cuts'''
* '''Stickers'''
* '''Punches'''
* '''Memorabilia Pockets''' - Perfect for storing keepsakes. Acid-free, self adhesive pockets. They prevent acid transfer and help keep important memories being lost forever. 
* '''Decorative Scissors'''
* '''Templates'''
* '''Photo Cropped into a circles or ovals'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">First of all I'm very impressed by the fine quality of the material.

It seems as a figure is missing. in the presentation of the firewall mechanism.
This is right after the quoted text :   &quot;the packet flow diagram looks like :&quot;



Could the missing picture be something like the ascii-art in iptables-howto

&lt;start from iptables-howto----------------------------&gt;
5. How Packets Traverse The Filters

The kernel starts with three lists of rules; these lists are called firewall chains or just chains. The three chains are called INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD.

This is very different from how the 2.0 and 2.2 kernels worked!

For ASCII-art fans, the chains are arranged like so:

                    _____
                   /     \
 --&gt;[Routing ]---&gt;|FORWARD|-------&gt;
    [Decision]     \_____/        ^ 
         |                        |
         v                       ____  
        ___                     /    \ 
       /   \                   |OUTPUT|
      |INPUT|                   \____/ 
       \___/                      ^    
         |                        |

      <comment>/* Theory of equations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Theory of equations ==
A Fundamental subject in Mathematics,which deals with the methods of finding roots of a given mathematical expression.Suppose f(x) is a function in x and 
m is a constant in the range of the function.Now if :-
          f(x)=m 
,there are only a finite number of values of x which can satisfy the given expression.  Of course this is not true for trigonometric equations which yield an infinite number of roots but usually only the principal values of angles are taken.

== Solution to a Quadratic equation ==
Theoretically a polynomial equation of the nth degree can be resolved into n factors.Let us consider the polynomial equation:-
 &lt;math&gt;F(x)=x^n+ax^{n-1}+bx^{n-2}.................&lt;/math&gt;  where a,b are constants..Let F(x)=0 for some value of x.
let us assume F(x)=(x-m)(x-n)(x-o)(x-p)..................    where m,n are called the roots of the equation F(x).
Now if we multiply the factors we obtain:-
&lt;math&gt;F(x)=x^n-(m+n+o......)x^{n-1}+(mn+no+.........)x^{n-2}................+mnop......&lt;/math&gt;
Comparing with the polymomial,
  Sum of roots=-a
  Sum of roots taken two at a time=b
  ..............................
  ..............................
  Sum of roots taken l at a time=&lt;math&gt;(-1)^k&lt;/math&gt;(co-efficient of the (k+1)st term)
This identity was discovered by Vieta and is named after him. Hence we have n equations to find n roots.
Now consider an equation of degree 2 called the Quadratic equation.Let m,n be the roots of the equation.
Let the equation be :-
     &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0&lt;/math&gt;  where a,b,c are constants
This can also be written as:-
&lt;math&gt;x^2+\frac{bx}{a}+\frac{c}{a}=0&lt;/math&gt; dividing by a
 
From the above treatise we know that:-
 &lt;math&gt;m+n=\frac{-b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;mn=\frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
 also 
 &lt;math&gt;(m-n)^2=(m+n)^2-4mn&lt;/math&gt;
 Hence:-
 &lt;math&gt;m-n=((m+n)^2-4mn)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;m-n=( \frac{b^2}{a^2}-\frac{4c}{a})^{1/2}=\frac{(b^2-4ac)^{1/2}}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
 Solving the above simultaneous equations,we get
 &lt;math&gt;m=\frac{-b+(b^2-4ac)^{1/2}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n=\frac{-b-(b^2-4ac)^{1/2}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

== Condensed Classics ==
Would this be the correct place to discuss a place for condensed versions of classic books in all subject areas? Wikisource has full versions of public domain books, and Wikiquotes adminstrators do not appreciate plain vanilla encyclopedic information to be included in their articles. There doesn't seem to be a place for condensed classics. Some of the classics in the history of science, mathematics, religion and the other humanities could serve as a thread to connect the various existing articles in Wikipedia and as an additional supplemental resource for Wikibooks texts.

== Wikia promotion ==

I am not trying to stir up trouble.  I would just like to know what is the Wikibooks community's opinion about the following.  In 2006, Jimmy Wales stepped in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=434945&amp;oldid=419429 here to announce] that video game manuals would not be appropriate for Wikibooks.  Despite [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks/Archive_2#Wikibooks_would_not_be_a_repository_for_video_game_manuals some protest], this was apparently adopted as policy.  Since then, Wales' own commercial wiki site about simply one game -- the World of Warcraft -- has grown to be higher-ranked ([http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/wowwiki.com#trafficstats according to Alexa]) than all of Wikibooks.org put together.  Not to mention that Wikia, Inc. attracts the &quot;Gaming&quot; audience segment as the fourth most important segment to its sites ([http://www.quantcast.com/p-8bG6eLqkH6Avk#segments according to Quantcast]).  Now, I see that the current  [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks|&quot;What Wikibooks is not&quot; policy]] includes two distinct recommendations to displace content from here (Fiction/Literature and Primary research) to Wikia, Inc. sites.  Is anyone familiar with the notion of &quot;self-dealing&quot; when it comes to non-profit charity governance?  Please discuss your reaction to this evidence. -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] ([[User talk:Thekohser|talk]]) 19:52, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

:Not here, wrong place. This is the place to discuss policy, and how it came to become policy is only peripherally relevant, and especially delving into the real or imagined motives of those involved. '''Wikibooks is not a commercial activity and has no consuming interest in &quot;traffic.&quot;''' It aims to provide a place for free textbooks to be hosted, where the concern isn't how much advertisers will pay for the traffic or a site will pay for the book. Wikibooks doesn't have to host everything. The real question here is whether or not the time has come to reconsider the policy about video game guides. One person asking a question is not enough to really go into it, but I'm new at Wikibooks and I'd like to know so that I understand this place better. So, to develop my own understanding, I'll review the policy, how it came to be what it is, as a (hopefully) neutral report, and then perhaps we can look to see if consensus has changed, might be changing, or needs changing. And that's the issue. '''There is no effective authority here other than the community's consensus,''' there is no directive from anyone else that we shall or shall not host video game manuals. It is purely up to us. My review is below in collapse, and then my comments continue. I can now say that, for myself, it was well worth looking at this, I can't speak for anyone else. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 01:29, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

The redirect was already in existence at this time.

:*My conclusions: there was no consensus on the basic vision behind Wikibooks; there were, as there was with and remains with Wikipedia, two streams, one toward broad inclusion and one toward a much narrower, perhaps more &quot;respectable&quot; approach. As long as there is no basic vision, no settlement of this division, conflict will continue at some level. Fiat from above is one way of settling such a conflict, but the problem is that the Wikimedia Foundation wikis depend on a vast pool of volunteer labor, and the volunteers believe that it is the community that makes decisions, and there is no way that the Foundation board wants to carve up the goose that lays the golden egg. I was unable to determine if there was, in fact, a fiat from the Foundation. Much more recently, in the matter of the &quot;global ban&quot; of a critic of the WMF, there was an ''appearance'' of a ban, but, when it came down to brass tacks, it didn't exist. It was completely up to the local wikis.

:*The problem remains as it has long remained: how does this community make decisions? In the end, looking at this history, policy was written by one person based on the presumed agreement of one other person, and both of them seemed to assume that video games were out. There was reference to a discussion where the consensus was supposedly established, and that discussion did not show it, and it's completely unclear that they even read back into the discussion, it was just mentioned, not linked, as having happened &quot;some time back.&quot;
:*Now, what I don't know is all the ''other'' stuff that happened. However, there is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=485267&amp;oldid=471565 reference to substantial disruption], and when there are divisive battles like this on a wiki, typically one side wins by attrition with the other side remaining disgruntled. Many leave. And so, from &quot;precedent,&quot; never having actually been negotiated as a consensus, a policy is established that is sometimes in conflict with other policies, is unclear as a derivation from the basic purpose of the project, and the fundamental issues -- What *Is* Wikibooks? -- are not addressed, they are simply swept under the carpet. Which can get very lumpy. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 01:29, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

{{hidden end}}

:*So, are video game guides to be allowed? I think that's the wrong question. The right questions are '''&quot;How do we decide or confirm or ''interpret'' the fundamental vision, the organizing purpose, of Wikibooks?''' How do we make decisions about everything from fundamental policy to the myriad details that are decided from day to day? How do we resolve conflicts in a way that maximizes consensus, which maximizes efficiency, without demolishing efficiency by having to discuss everything to death? Do we just assume that it will happen by itself?&quot;
:*Hint: it won't. If it were that easy, it would have happened on Wikipedia, it would have happened here, already.
:*And, in the meantime, we need to run the wiki. So it will take time, but it may get easier if we start to realize that the problem isn't that &quot;unreasonable user,&quot; the problem is us, that we have not yet developed our own, clear, efficient, fair decision-making system that we all -- or at least most of us -- can accept, even when there are difficult questions, and that won't drive people away by presenting them with brick walls of ''&quot;Tough, that's the way it is. So what if you didn't agree to it, you can't do anything about it, too late. Go start your own wiki.&quot;'' --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 01:29, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

:: I wouldn't object to removing the reference to Academia Wikia. I believe the link to Academia Wikia predates Wikiversity's existence. There is no Wikimedia project for fictional works and Fiction Wikia is the most well known among our users, some even contribute there. StrategyWiki was started by some Wikibooks' contributors because of what Jimbo said and has a close relationship with Wikibooks because of that. As for trying to understand how the video game section came into being. Abd's research is incomplete. There has been a lot more discussion, including on people's user talk page, in the reading room, and at requests for deletion. For a long time people were undecided as to whether to allow video games or not. However the reasons that eventually came to be and for which consensus existed have nothing to do with Jimbo at all. I admit I feel uncomfortable with the exact way in which video games came to be excluded, because to me it feels like a special exemption was made for their exclusion, rather than some general rule would exclude them and other similar works. I recommend new/fresh discussion though, rather than trying to dig old history though like Abd attempted to do.

:::Thanks, Darklama. I want to make it clear that I did the research, collapsed above, for my own understanding of the policy, and if I wanted everyone to &quot;dig through the history,&quot; I'd not have collapsed that, and I'd have presented it differently, with a justification for why it was important. I understand that the development of the policy, fully considered, might require a true tome to cover. However, there is a policy issue about policies. They should be developed and documented in such a way as to be able to understand the thinking behind them, or they become arbitrary in appearance, and therefore difficult to understand and apply. The policy against video game guides is very strange, it stands out like a sore thumb. This much is clear: in what I covered, which reflected the discussion here -- this should have been the place for the critical determining discussion. I inferred a basis from one of Jimbo's comments, but that statement itself, the underlying basis, didn't become policy! The importance of this is not about blaming those who came before, it is about recognizing that certain foundational aspects have been neglected, and my concern is about how to fix that. Better late than never; the fundamental issue will continue to cause wasted labor, though it is less of a problem if there is careful attention paid to preserving content -- as was clearly your intention, Darklama --, i.e., by providing interwiki transfer where appropriate, or making sure that authors can get the wikitext so their work isn't tossed in the trash. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:41, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

::I'm probably one of the oldest Wikibookian that has remained consistently active. I had to check Jomegat since he has also been a extremely constant presence :), anyway I don't remember the discussions regarding video games guides and I certainty did not participate in it, but I can clearly remember that it has been a constant issue, that popped constantly during any deletion of that type of material and I can confirm, without any numbers backing me, that my perception has been that the removal of that type of content has reduced participation in the project in general.
::Now, I don't support the reversal of the decision but I would admit that it couldn't have been reached by consensus (as Abd has pointed out), but I have to admit that my reasons to oppose against the inclusion of the content would be as good as the ones supporting a reversal. In fact our scope as a project to me seems to be often forgotten. There is our primary goal set by the WMF, to create free content. That is the principal reason I work here. Next comes the different projects focus and to me out focus starts where Wikisource ends, as I have said many times before Wikisource should be the project we should look to in determining our practices and what we are. Wikisource does support video games guides so in practice I don't see any valid reason we shouldn't, except my personal preference, but I'm also able to see that keeping that type of content on, or even better, creating a separate project for them, would benefit the WMF, I would even see Wikibooks as supporting fictional writing as a test bed (Abd, isn't it possible to do that sort of thing in Wikiversiy as part of a course on creative writing ?) if that promoted the WMF objectives and increased donations. Wikia, Inc. and StrategyWiki seem to be for-profit project we shouldn't be shifting users there if we can keep them in a WMF project. In that spirit I would probably support broadening our scope...

::Btw I disagree with Abd seemingly distaste for the decision process, but I probably share his view on the consistency that it is applied, and our last two major issue under discussion have shown the problem we have respecting each-others. I do think that we should reexamine the decision process, especially in order to update it and make it into a policy, so to avoid unnecessary escalations when the community clearly doesn't back an action.  Regarding urgent decisions, we rarely have one, if we do fallow the existing rules and I think being conservative, as the consensus decision process makes us be is beneficial for the project.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:28, 14 September 2010 (UTC)
:::I encourage Panic not to jump to conclusions about &quot;distaste.&quot; The process was what it was, and I was simply trying to understand it. Yes, I pointed out some problems with it. There will always be problems, and a &quot;process problem&quot; doesn't mean that the conclusion of the process was defective. However, unclear policy can cause massive waste of time, or, on the other hand, loss of participation. If policy is clear and easily accessible, people won't waste time creating content that's going to be deleted, or, if they do, then we can shrug our shoulders. We should still be nice to them! But a clear policy is a clear policy. Guidelines should be written such that people who follow them can expect that their work will stand. There is a prejudice against &quot;instruction creep,&quot; but wikis were actually designed to create detailed instruction manuals! The guidelines should be as detailed as necessary to prevent endless repetition of the same discussions. They should not be taken as &quot;law,&quot; but as support for efficient participation.
:::In the other direction, if we set a policy excluding material, we will fail to encourage participation by those interested in that material. If the material is truly inappropriate, that loss may be necessary. But if it isn't inappropriate, or if it is marginal, we may be damaging our user base without necessity. Panic, above, expresses the sense that Wikibooks lost participation because of the exclusion of video game manuals. Some of this may have represented users who also worked on other areas of the project. I know that if my favorite content is excluded, I'll tend to toss out the whole effort. Now, if the project were clear from the beginning about what is in scope, I'd have made my choice from the beginning. But when it's dropped down in the middle, rather arbitrarily, based on one particular understanding of the vision of Wikibooks' mission, it can really not sit well. There was reference to serious conflict in what I found. I did not even begin to document that, but I don't wonder at it. There would be people fighting strongly, on both sides, for their own vision of Wikibooks. This is exactly where careful, patient, and documented community decision-making is needed, decision-making that maximizes consensus. I know that when this happens, and the process is clear and inclusive, i.e., one side wasn't just shut down and told to shut up, and it is obvious that everyone was heard and their arguments considered, I am far less likely to resent the result if I end up in the minority. And this is exactly what traditional deliberative process is designed to do, and even more so the twentieth century development of consensus process. Good process preserves the unity of a community even when there are disputes, and it results in better decisions. If people are arguing about A vs B, very often the best answer is C. Poor process divides and fractures and may seem to result in a victory to some, but in the end, more damage has been done than good. Good process takes time and patience. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:59, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

:::: My point is indeed about suggesting websites as similar to us as possible. I think suggested websites should also provide a means for people to collaborate too. I believe the point of this policy is to not only to deal with common cases of things that Wikibooks does not allow, but also to acknowledge that people will add works that will need a new home because they didn't read this policy and for people that do read policies to be able to make/find good recommendations that will provide an environment as similar as possible to Wikibooks where their works will be accepted. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:54, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

:::::Darklama makes an excellent point here that most people who encounter this policy (in my experience) because of an RfD, query, or some other suggestion that there work doesn't fit here.

(edit conflict with above). One step at a time. Thekohser made a series of edits, and more of them were improvements than not. Only the last edit was reverted. Part of it was fine, converting the &quot;Use Fiction Wiki&quot; instead into a statement that the alternative might be considered. I've [http://fiction.wikia.com/ Fiction Wikia] restored that]. So the question here becomes whether or not to list other alternatives, and Thekohser's suggestion is reasonable, on the face, without having investigated. He listed

*[http://storymash.com StoryMash] (using copyright)
Discussing the substance here is what we should be about, and &quot;No&quot; doesn't do that. Is there a reason to confine ourselves to listing wikia alone? It is user-friendly to point to alternatives, but, in fact, those could be on a subpage, with listings for each class, and with its own inclusion standards. We don't want to become a pile of links to web sites, for sure, but a few recommendations enjoying consensus should be fine for each category, and if we subpage this, we don't have to debate over what isn't actually a change to policy, but merely to friendly dicta. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 16:18, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

:There are 3 mentions of &quot;minor&quot; on that section (that does not only cover minors). There is a relevance in the minors distinction because of Wikijunior.

I am wondering:
is a cookbook (think O'Reilly's Perl cookbook, but simpler) about how to generate useful plots in gnuplot and python/matplotlib a &quot;book&quot;?
or is it something else that lacks a place in wikibooks (that's perfectly fine, I just want to know what is the policy for this kind of book).
Thanks in advance for any light on the subject.

: Yes, there is a place in Wikibooks for a tutorial on generating such plots. It would fit as a section of [[Python Programming/matplotlib]] or [[gnuplot]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 17:14, 19 February 2013 (UTC)

== Should Wikibooks allow essays and non-neutral POV books? ==

I think that Wikibooks should allow opinionated books, essays, political commentaries, and the like. I intend to put a formal proposal forward at [[WB:Reading room/Proposals]], but first I want to see if there is any support for this. Comments?

: Non-neutral material belongs on Wikiversity.  Wikibooks produces neutral work; that's part of the contract understood between its authors and its audience.  From what I understand (it being all before my time), that distinction from Wikibooks is (more or less) why Wikiversity was created in the first place.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 12:07, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:Certainly by normal definition a ''textbook'' would be expected to be neutral. However, Wikibooks has a number of books that don't fit the tight definition of textbook and some of these are fundamentally &quot;biased&quot;. For example, it would be hard to argue using the traditional definitions of neutral point of view that [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] is neutral. I think it is likely that a book titled &quot;The Republican Political Philosophy&quot; would survive here today, despite its bias. The key though is that the title of the book reflects its content. A book called &quot;United States Political Philosophy&quot; that only represented the Republican view wouldn't be acceptable.
:I do think there is a line that shouldn't be crossed and that is the original research line. A book about something that is a widely accepted subject with a known bias is one thing. Once it becomes an original piece of work with no supporting material available in the &quot;real world&quot; then it is out-of-scope for me. So the &quot;essay&quot; suggestion may be a step too far. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:29, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
: Wikibooks aims to help teachers, students, and schools that cannot afford the cost of traditional textbooks by providing free alternatives which are of similar quality, accuracy and reliability. Wikibooks' scope has been relaxed over the years. Some experiments to relax Wikibooks' scope have worked out and others not. What you suggest was tried before and resulted in Wikiversity at first as a subproject and then later on as an entirely separate project when the Wikibooks community rejected the continuation of that experiment within Wikibooks. What you suggest would mean duplicating the scope and mission of Wiiversity now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:35, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
:: Just a comment, but (almost) ''no one is at Wikiversity''. Also, what Wikiversity is is really not clear from going there or from its description. It appears to be the trash bin of Wikimedia, for projects no one wanted to deal with, but the were too many proponents of to get rid of completely. An &quot;Essay&quot; namespace would fix the problem of identification of what is neutral and what is not. Also, all Wikimedia projects except for Wikipedia have huge shortages of editors, so isn't it better to consolidate things? Also we are Wikibooks, not Wikitextbooks. The idea of free books is a great idea, but limiting that to text books does not make sense. The scope of Wikibooks should be expanded to include many types of book (thought obviously not fiction).

::: Wikibooks was considered the trash bin of Wikimedia prior to Wikiversity, probably because the projects Wikipedians don't want to deal with use to be dumped on Wikibooks prior to Wikiversity. An &quot;Essay&quot; namespace to identify non-neutral works is not much different from how the &quot;Wikiversity&quot; pseudo-namespace was used to identify all the non-neutral, POV, OR, and non-textbook works that use to exist on Wikibooks prior to Wikiversity becoming a separate project. I'm not convinced this would fix any problem, rather I think it would only repeat history.
::: Wikibooks went by the names &quot;Wikimedia Free Textbook Project&quot; and &quot;Wikimedia-Textbooks&quot;, and could be found at textbooks.wikipedia.org in the early days prior to getting its own domain name, because the request was for a project to host free textbooks. I don't know the history that lead to Wikibooks instead of Wikitextbooks as the project name, but I can agree the name does not necessarily make sense for its scope.
::: Some Wikimedians have suggested consolidating all the projects into Wikipedia, with the suggestion that Wikibooks be called Wikipedia-Textbooks.

It does seem plausible that ''some'' sorts of such books would merely do the same thing as Wikivoyage, and their contents should therefore be merged into Wikivoyage and removed from Wikibooks (effectively transwiki'd).

== Scholarly analysis? ==

I apologize for what I'm sure is an often addressed question, but I'm confused by the presence on this page of the following two statements:
#&quot;...primary research should be published elsewhere, such as a peer-reviewed journal, or our sister project Wikiversity.&quot;
#&quot;...other books about video games, such as scholarly analysis of video games or...&quot;
The first is addressed in another discussion on this page, but the addition of the second is confusing. &quot;Analysis&quot; is not original research? In drawing a line between textbooks and encyclopedia articles and seemingly more lax rules on verifiability, it does seem like a greater allowance for OR is created. Also, the fact that textbooks are frequently cited in scholarly works seems to point to the acknowledged presence of ''some'' original research. A textbook wouldn't be ''about'' a new theory, but authors do opine about new theories or present, for example, new pedagogical strategies. To be clear, I'm not trying to advocate a particular perspective. I'm just trying to get a better feel for the site and its possibilities.

: Just before that first passage you quote, there's an attempt to clarify somewhat.  &quot;Examples of things not allowed on Wikibooks include proposing new theories and solutions, presenting original ideas, defining new terms, and coining new words.&quot;

: Those are things that, to me, are really overtly original.  I think scholarly analysis is likely okay, unless it's inherently controversial in which case it might be either original or non-neutral, depending on how it's presented.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:13, 14 August 2013 (UTC)

::Thanks for the clarification. So it sounds like I'd be safe going by my fairly traditional (I think) concept of the kind of writing one would expect to find in a textbook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Constructivism ==

The theory of constructivism in learning is to believe that knowledge is not provided from teacher to student where it remains unaltered, but that learning is an active process of recreating and developing knowledge, and that through constructivism, emphasis is placed on the role of learning activities.
One strand of constructivism can be traced to John Dewey who emphasised the place of experience in education. Another from the work of Piaget, who demonstrated empirically that children’s minds were not empty, but actively processed the material with which they were presented, and claimed that through the process of accommodation and assimilation, people will construct new knowledge from their experiences. (Atherton, 2005)

Looking at Piaget’s descriptions of how the constructivism process works, accommodation, where a person reframes the mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences, can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning. When people act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates their expectations, they will often fail. By accommodating this new experience and reframing the way the world works, they learn from the experience of failure. Likewise, assimilation would occur when the person’s experiences is aligned with their internal representation of the world and they assimilate the new experience into an already existing framework (Wikipedia, 2006)
The theory of constructivism suggests that students construct knowledge. Constructivism as a description of human cognition is often confused with educational approaches that promote learning by doing. 

Most approaches that have grown from constructivism suggest that learning is accomplished best using a hands-on approach, and that students learn by experimentation, and not by reproducing the expected outcome. They are left to make their own inferences and discoveries and then draw their own conclusions away from the influences of recognised theory. It goes on to emphasise that learning is not an &quot;all or nothing&quot; process but that students learn new information presented to them by building upon knowledge that they already possess. It is therefore important that there is constant assessment of knowledge attained. In a learning environment teachers find that since the students build upon already existing knowledge, when called upon to retrieve new information, they may make errors known as reconstruction error. This is when gaps of our understanding are filled with logical, though incorrect, information. Teachers need to detect and try to correct these errors, though it is inevitable that some reconstruction error will continue to occur because of our innate retrieval limitations, however this also contributes to constructivism.

This module isn't a very good fit in the Communication Theory textbook. Look over the existing chapters to see the preferred format -- each chapter presents a biographical overview of a theorist or group of theorists, and the key points of their theories. This module does not follow the established convention. In addition, this module appears to present a new theory of some kind, or a plan for original research, and is inappropriate for an undergraduate-level textbook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=FRONT SUSPENSION=
The front suspension on the 240sx is a McPherson strut assembly.  It is composed of a shock leading from the chassis down to a spindle.  The spindle is then attached to the lower control arm (LCA) and the tie rods.  The LCA is attached to the Tension Compression (T/C) rods.


===Lower Control Arm===
====Replacement Bushings====
These are replacements for stock soft rubber bushings. They are usually polyurethane and are stiffer than stock units.

====Aftermarket Replacements====
These are complete replacements with pillow ball end links.  These are very important because they allow the adjustability of LCA angle.  When the car is lowered the LCA moves more horizontal in comparison to the ground increasing the possibility of bump steer.  With aftermarket LCA's you can adjust this and return the angle of the LCA back to stock. hehe

===Tension Rod===
====Replacement Bushings====
Same as replacing LCA bushings.  Tightens up the car, but doesn’t allow any more adjustment.

====Aftermarket Replacement====
This should be one of your first modifications to your car.  The McPherson strut assembly is extremely hard on this part of the suspension.  If you haven’t replaced it, it is worn out, end of story.  When braking, the car's weight shifts forward onto this bushing, causing it to be the first to wear out or fail. Aftermarket replacements are recommended because they fully replace the bushing with a pillow ball joint and allow caster adjustment.

===Tie Rods===
====Stock Replacements====
It is worth replacing with stock if you are just trying to maintain the car because they do wear out and with that you will lose steering feel, but aftermarket has its advantages as usual.

====Aftermarket Replacements====
=====Inner Tie Rods=====
The inner tie rod can be equipped with a spacer to let you have more steering lock to lock.  This is good for drifting because you can get more angle in your drift.  Also on the S13 the inner tie rods are very small and tend to bend or to break.  The S14/Z32 size is much bigger and a necessary upgrade for any real race car.  The S14/Z32 inners thread right into the stock steering rack and align with no problems.

=====Outer Tie Rods=====
The OEM outer tie rods are ball joints filled with grease.  They are great for longevity, not great for performance.  Aftermarket tie rods are pillow ball joints which help with steering feel.  They also allow bump steer adjustment which will make the car easier to control.

=REAR SUSPENSION=
The rear suspension is comprised of an excellent multi-link suspension design.  It has 4 &quot;sides,&quot; the rear upper control arm (RUCA), the forward link, the lateral (toe) link, and the rear lower control arm.  This design allows for a lot different of adjustment and control over the rear suspension movement.  Its all housed on a single &quot;floating&quot; sub frame which is bolted onto the chassis and incorporates the differential, and other suspension.  


===Lower Control Arms===
====Replacement Bushings====
Better than doing nothing.  Essentially the same as effect as doing this for the front LCA's.
====Aftermarket Replacements====
These also come with pillow ball joints.  Much stiffer than any bushing you can buy.  They also allow for roll center adjustment...

===Toe Control Arms===
====Replacement Bushings====
Tightness up the ride.  Stock units can be adjusted, but race units are much more accurate and have more range of adjustment.
====Aftermarket Replacements====
Pillow ball joints once again, add more adjustability than stock.

===Upper Control/Camber Arms===
====Replacement Bushings====
Once again better than doing nothing, but defiantly can be improved upon.  Also adjustment with this piece is very limited stock and is necessary if you plan on lowering your car.  You can slot the stock pieces to allow for more adjustment, but I don’t recommend it.
====Aftermarket Replacements====
The RUCA's are the second most important piece of linkage (next to the TC rods).  They (as usual) have pillow ball joints and allow for more adjustment.  They take a lot of stress so its important to get quality pieces.  The S13 OEM style had a full loop style that goes all the way around the shock.  The S14 OEM style RUCA's only go around the rear. Aftermarket RUCA arms can be found in either style. The half round style is more than sufficiently strong for either application and allows servicing of the shock without removal of the arm.

===Forward Link===
====Replacement Bushings====
Same as usual. Tightness up the suspension further.
====Aftermarket Replacement====
Pillow ball joints and more adjust

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Stabilizer Bars=
A sway bar (also stabilizer bar, anti-sway bar, roll bar, or anti-roll bar, ARB) is an automobile suspension device. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together through short lever arms linked by a torsion spring. A sway bar increases the suspension's roll stiffness—its resistance to roll in turns, independent of its spring rate in the vertical direction. It is usually constructed out of a U-shaped piece of steel that connects to the body at two points, and at the left and right sides of the suspension. If the left and right wheels move together, the bar just rotates about its mounting points and does not bend. If the wheels move relative to each other, the bar is forced to twist.

The bar resists the bending through its stiffness. The stiffness of an anti-roll bar is based on the fourth power of its diameter, the stiffness of the material, the inverse of the length of the lever arms (i.e., the shorter the lever arm, the stiffer the bar), the geometry of the mounting points, and the rigidity of the bar's mounting points. Some anti-roll bars, particularly those intended for use in auto racing, are adjustable, allowing their stiffness to be altered by increasing or reducing the length of the lever arms. This permits the roll stiffness to be tuned for different situations without replacing the entire bar. The stiffer the bar, the more force required to move the left and right wheels relative to each other. This increases the amount of force required to make the body roll.

In a turn, the sprung mass of the vehicle's body produces a lateral force at the Center of Mass, proportional to lateral acceleration. Because the cg is usually not on the roll axis, the lateral force creates a moment about the roll axis that tends to roll the body. (The roll axis is a line that joins the front and rear roll centers (SAEJ670e). The moment is called the roll couple.

Roll couple is resisted by the suspension roll stiffness, which is a function of the spring rate of the vehicle's springs and of the anti-roll bars, if any. The use of anti-roll bars allows designers to reduce roll without making the suspension's springs stiffer in the vertical plane, which allows improved body control with less compromise of ride quality.

One effect of body (frame) lean, for typical suspension geometry, is positive camber of the wheels on the outside of the turn and negative on the inside, which reduces their cornering grip (especially with cross ply tires).


Anti-roll bars provide two main functions:
The first function is the reduction of body lean. The reduction of body lean is dependent on the total roll stiffness of the vehicle. Increasing the total roll stiffness of a vehicle does not change the steady state total load (weight) transfer from the inside wheels to the outside wheels, it only reduces body lean. The total lateral load transfer is determined by the CG height and track width.

The other function of anti roll bars is to tune the high g / limit understeer behavior of the vehicle. The limit understeer behavior is tuned by changing the proportion of the total roll stiffness that comes from the front and rear axles. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the front will increase the proportion of the total weight transfer that the front axle reacts and decrease the proportion that the rear axle reacts. This will cause the outer front wheel to run at a higher slip angle, and the outer rear wheel to run at a lower slip angle, which is an understeer effect. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the rear axle will have the opposite effect and decrease understeer.

==Notes to be considered when selecting a swaybar upgrade==

-Stock swaybars are hollow as well as several aftermarket replacements. Testing has found the tube is the strongest shape and while maintaining a proportionate wall thickness a tubular swaybar will provide only 5% less stiffness for one made out of solid metal in the same diameter but will have a significantly lower weight, sometimes a reduction as much as 10-20lbs. This has no heavy polar impact since its so low on the chassis but will impact braking/acceleration respectively.

-Adjustability is something to weigh in consider if thats a concern for you. 

-Stock endlinks are actually very well designed but due to the age of the cars tend to have rotted bushings. Replace them with eurathane bushings from energy suspension kits, or the universal swaybar bushing kit available at local auto parts store. Note when using the universal kit the bushings must be sliced in half using a razor blade as they are twice as thick as what is needed.

- Whiteline swaybar blade type endlinks are not as well designed as the OEM supplied endlinks so that does impact the functionality vs stock links with eurathane bushings or aftermarket replacements. If using whiteline swaybars it is recommended that aftermarket replacements are taken into consideration

-Largus, Splparts.com and PDM Racing both produce a heim joint based replacement endlink solution for both stock and whiteline type bars. This will improve the performance of a swaybar by removing give/squish with bushings.

-Take into consideration front clearance when choosing large swaybars like the Largus ones, if memory recalls 28mm+ will not clear yashio factory and driftworks tension rod braces (www.rhdjapan.com and www.driftworks.com for purchase) and the Largus front sways specifically will not clear oversized oil pans (eg; greddy) for the sr20det

==Swaybar Bushings==

Energy suspension produces full bushing replacement kits for the 240sx so that all the old worn rubber bushings can be replaced with polyurethane.

Whiteline bushings are the highest quality polyurethane bushings you can purchase them from PDM racing (costs arm and a leg).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Added some formatting. this info was in the article but was not formattted:

As with a low budget the rsr-race spring 5kg Front/4kg Rear and kyb agx combo proved to provide a nice ride for the street with performance as well as not breaking the bank. the handling had little body movement and dropped it to a nice looking ride height...also to keep in mind sway bars were stock and the only aftemarket sus. parts were front and rear sway bars. so in hind-sight i would definaltly recommend a nice thick aftermarket sway bar for both front and rear if you are not willing to sacrafice ride quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook is aimed toward those who are in or new to college. The objective of this wikibook is to lift the fog of the various misunderstandings of college: Credits, courses, assignments, studying, and more. It is somewhat slanted toward U.S. students; however, many of the things listed can be applied different colleges and universities. The book should prepare the student for some worst case scenarios and help prevent the student from encountering the worst case scenarios. The various tools listed and offered can help students cut down trees, thus save time. They can help students prepare equipment to take on the camping trip and go up the mountain of enlightenment. The focus of this book is to help a student out of the forest of the darkness and into the light of knowledge and learning, for college is about learning; and it should be a great experience of learning.

----

First, obtain a bar of round steel or iron stock about 1/4&quot; in diameter. Light your forge and let it settle down, then start heating the rod about 3/4&quot; along. 

Turn on the blast, and get the iron to red heat. Upset the rod to about 3/8&quot; thick.  

Reheat, this time heating the end of the rod. Hammer the end of the bar to a flattened spread arc. Next we curl the arc around into a circular cross-section, using another bar or an anvil horn, then hammering it closed. This forms the end of the arrow head that is mated with the wooden shaft. 

The next step is to heat the rod just a little beyond the upset, and hot cut it. Using tongs, reheat this cut end, and hammer to a square section. Do not taper or draw the point, as a long thin point will tend to bend when it hits an armoured target, and will also tend to slow the impact down more before penetration is complete. 

When happy with the squareness and straightness of the head, quench rapidly in water to [[Hardening_(metallurgy)|harden]] the cutting edges and the nose, but do not quench further back than just behind the upset, as this may cause the arrow to shatter at the thinner neck on impact, rather than give slightly.

The arrowhead is then matched to a fletched shaft, and stored ready for use.

To try and talk about this would be suicide. However, let me say that there are company cages in production, and then there are custom cages. It all depends on your level of preference and your budget/goals. I will be giving the cusco cage a shot later this year, but not until everything else is done. If I do not like it, it will be removed. For space reasons, I am avoiding a cage in my plans. However, for serious track-heads, a custom cage is a no-brainer. A lot of research is required here. You need to find someone who will do a quality job the way you want it.

the goal of this book is to talk about things like this. we need to cover in-depth custom made and prefabricated roll cages. This guide is intended to be the research tool

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sukuun &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ُْسُكونْ&lt;/font&gt;==

The '''sukuun''' (absence of a vowel) is a [[w:Diacritic|diacritic]] that indicates the end of a syllable. Put another way, a consonant with a sukuun above it is not followed by a vowel. This only occurs when the consonant itself follows a vowel. The sukuun is written as a circle above the consonant. 

Using left-to-right English 'words' as examples, the word &quot;bata&quot; would be spelled &quot;b&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;t&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;; however &quot;bat&quot; would be spelled &quot;b&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;t&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;.

The only time that one consonant immediately follows another is when they are in different syllables; in which case, the first consonant would have a sukuun.

Again using English 'words' as examples, we could write &quot;vista&quot; as &quot;v&lt;sub&gt;/&lt;/sub&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;t&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;.&quot; The sukuun indicates that the &quot;s&quot; is not followed by a vowel. Otherwise, the word could have been &quot;visita&quot;, &quot;visata&quot;, or &quot;visuta&quot;.

The sukuun cannot be used to combine consonants into single sounds. For example, &quot;...s&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;t...&quot; could only be combined in such a combination as the English &quot;mister&quot; (&quot;mis-ter&quot;), not as in &quot;stair&quot;. Combinations such as &quot;stray&quot; are not possible at all in Arabic.

==Shadda &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;شَدّة&lt;/font&gt;==

The '''shadda''' is a diacritic which replaces a double-consonant, but only where the first consonant has a sukuun on it, and the second one is followed by a vowel. If the word &quot;vista&quot; above were instead &quot;vitta&quot;, then we could put a shadda over the &quot;t&quot;. If it were &quot;vitata&quot;, however, we could not.

The double-consonant doesn't work the same way as in English. In English, a doubled letter modifies the sound of the preceding vowel. For example: &quot;mated&quot; is pronounced with a long &quot;a&quot;, whereas &quot;matted&quot; is pronounced with a short &quot;a&quot;. 

In Arabic, as mentioned above, a consonant only follows another if the first one ends the previous syllable, and the second one begins the next syllable. As such, both letters are pronounced. In English, this tends to only occur when the two letters are in separate words, as in &quot;big guy&quot;.

When reading transliterations of Arabic words, any double letter should be read with a hyphen in it. So &quot;shadda&quot; is pronounced not as &quot;sha-da&quot;, but as &quot;shad-da&quot;.

===Writing the shadda===

The shadda is written as a small &quot;w&quot; shape above the letter. 

If the double-letter is followed by a [[Arabic/LearnRW/a_i_u|short vowel]], the mark for that vowel is written directly above or below the shadda (so the kasra, or &quot;i&quot; sound, should be written immediately below the shadda, not below the letter). 

If the shadda is followed by a long vowel, then just the shadda is written. 

A shadda cannot be followed by a sukuun. This is because a shadda indicates a double letter where the first letter bears a sukuun, ending the preceding syllable. In order for the second letter to have a sound, it must be followed by a vowel.

[[User:Hlasso|Hlasso]] 22:12, 30 March 2006 (UTC)In some cases, possesive pronouns are used with body parts, as in: &quot;Déjame ver tus manos&quot; -&gt; Let me see your hands; or, let me take a look at your hands. It's not uncommon to use them to refer to body parts, at least in Latin America.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =

Knowing how college works ahead of time will lead to great success. The more prepared one is for college, the more likely he or she is going to succeed.

== What is College like? ==

College is a place of confusion. If you don't have parents or siblings with a PhD or other degree, many of your decisions are going to be out in the dark. Even if you do, they may have been out of the &quot;system&quot; so long that they have forgotten how it works. When going into college the first time, being misguided often happens. Many people keep quiet about the truth of college. To keep quiet will only keep people nescient. The choices to make, actions to take, and the many habits one must break are often not known. College is place for those who want a higher education or who want to obtain a certain profession.

College can be seen as a different world in its own. For those who are academically rigorous, they may not get outside often enough. Sometimes friendships are put on hold with people to finish an assignment. To compensate for these effects of college, many join a school club.

It is often said the food around a college is not great at all. People are sometimes left with the choice of having a coffee and donut. Other times, people will have to eat pizza (which is very common) but will get sick after eating pizza everyday for a few months. If not pizza, then a very expensive meal costing way above normal could be a healthy choice. The smart choice is to make a meal yourself.

Malnutrition and antisocial behavior is common at college, despite the vision media gives it. Many scientific and sociological studies conclude that college students aren't eating properly. Malnutrition is one of the worst things for the brain when acquiring knowledge and using it.

The professors at college are not to be called teachers. There is a general misconception that professors are teachers. No; a professor is an expert in his or her field of study. Professors in many college and university institutions do not need to pass a teaching course or exam.

Professors are not teachers; however, they try to teach material. This is where college is different than high school (secondary education) in North America. In North America, teachers-to-be must pass exams and courses to become a certified teacher. In college, however, there are no exams or courses needed to teach someone. There is a prerequisite that people hold a Master's Degree or higher to &quot;teach&quot; in post-secondary education.

Many academic students frown upon this as college is a learning environment. Sadly, it is a place where people show their skills in a study, more than they learn. Sometimes, there are professors that will actually teach more than make someone do hard work. To compensate for the good and the bad, one must learn to adjust to prepare for the paradox of college.

== Choosing a School ==

=== External Links ===
* [http://www2.studentsreview.com/articles/what-is-a-good-school.php3 What is a good school?]
* [http://college-university.infodiv.com College and University Info] Lots of Free Information and Resources on College and University

== The Entrance Exam ==

The exams usually focus on your Literature and Science skills. Some tests focus on your English and Math skills. Some tests focus on foreign language skills. Either way, a person will take an entrance exam test. What a person should do is before taking the exam, learn as much as he or she can about it. Some colleges only allow a person to take the exam twice. This is why learning about the test is important. Study and review some of the math you already know for about five days.

After taking the exam, if a person doesn't do as well as he or she hoped the first time, then he or she could try again. However, some people believe the entrance exam is how colleges make their money. Students who have a high level of math understanding will often be placed down to a lesser math level. Even though the student may know the math, the exam scores may say a person must take &quot;Intermediate Algebra and Geometry&quot;. 

Some people will try to study the course material by getting a few books, studying them, and retesting. Being that the author has tried this, long ago, the author recommends you try to learn ''everything'' in the course book in 16 days. After 16 days, take the test and try to test out. If you can't, just take the course. Although, many people despise this exam system, is better to take the course and get over with it than wasting three months studying the book, taking the test, and again, not passing. Summer courses often last about one month, and if a person already knows the material, and he or she really does know the material, he or she should be able to pass the course easily. It's better to take a course and be over with it than to try and beat the system. Remember, 16 days of full devotion.

== Picking your Major and Minor ==

'''What is a major?'''

A major is the type of career you want to obtain. You are largely focusing on certain types of courses so you can get that career. The majority of courses in your course schedule are going to help you get that career.

'''What is a minor?'''

If you find out years later you don't like your major, you could switch to your minor. A minor is the type of career you want to fall back on. You are slightly focusing on certain types of courses as a fall-back career. The minority of courses in your course schedule will lead you towards that fall-back career. 

== Talking to a Counselor ==

When talking to a counselor, a person needs to know his or her long-term and short-term goals.

'''Questions to ask yourself:'''

*1. What do I want for a career?
*2. How much do I ''really'' know about the career?
*3. Have I researched the career in depth? 
*4. What type of things does a person in that career field know?
:: Psychology? Sociology? Chemistry? Physics? Biology? Other?
*5. What courses do I need to take to get that career?

Number five becomes the most important question once you understand what type of career you want. This will be one of the questions you will focus on when talking to a counselor. Write the question down to ask later.

'''More questions to ask:'''
*6. Do the courses I take here for that career--transfer to a different school?
*7. What school do I want to transfer to?
*8. What courses transfer to that school?

Oftentimes, counselors are very busy with many other people. Sometimes, they don't care to help people as much as they can. This isn't always the case, though. Counselors are not the Internet; therefore, they do not know everything that is accepted by every college and university. They try their best, but often they don't have the answers.

Before going to a counselor, a person should study what courses transfer to a college or university. Make a call to the school, go visit the school, or locate the school's website on the Internet and inquire what courses transfer. Many universities and college have a website directory that tells what courses are similar to others. If you are completely clueless to the school's website, you could go to the counselor and ask for them to help you find the information on the website.

The main concept to keep here is this:

I want a certain career. I need to take certain types of courses to get that career. If my current school does not have all of those courses, but they have a few, what courses transfer to another school? How can I be assured these courses transfer? I need proof these courses transfer.

*9. How many courses can I transfer.

Ah, the really tricky of questions. This is often a situation that many college students become annoyed with. In this wikibook I recommend someone take a few years of a modern language and mathematics. There is a grand logic to this, which I will explain in the next section.

=== Choosing Transferable Courses ===

When transferring to a different college or university, many students notice a large amount of credits/hours do not transfer.

Why is this? 

Well, simply put, colleges are like businesses: They want you to retake a course and they want to earn more money from students. Many colleges and universities would not talk about college being a business. 

Also, the teaching curriculum and standards of one school may be different than another school. In other words, the learning material in a different school may be more rigorous, complex, detailed, in depth, or etc.

Talk with one college's counsler, and get that counsler to talk about courses being transferable or not. You want courses that can transfer from one college to the next. Sometimes you will have to call someone, write to someone, or meet with someone at a different college to obtain information about credits/hours that are accepted.

=== Making a Wise Choice ===

For many careers, taking English and Mathematics to a certain extent is required. Often, if a person is going to a local college, then he or she can take Mathematics and English courses for a lower price. The first two years of college for many are filled with taking courses that don't relate to their major. The wise who want to transfer to a different college may not take those unrelated courses right away.

Some Liberal Arts (Non-fiction writing 120, Shakespeare 101, etc.) courses do not transfer as well as Mathematics and Foreign language. Many universities require someone to have at least four years of foreign language from a high school. If not that, they require someone to have at least two years of foreign language from a college. Many also like the idea of students having four years of high school Mathematics. To have four years of mathematics would mean someone has taken Calculus before he or she graduates high school. 

* 1 college semester = 1 high school year
* 4 years H.S. = 2 years college.

::College goes twice as fast as regular high school.

==== Experiences ====
One of the things I've learned in college is that a few courses exist that have a better chance than others to transfer. Taking math and language courses are the best choice for an undergraduate.

'''Modern Language:'''
* Spanish
* German
* French

:In the United States, Spanish is the most common language for college transfer.

'''Mathematics:'''
* Calculus and above

If a college were to be shrewd and not accept these courses, a person could simply test out; the nice thing about choosing this type of courses is its ease to be quickly reviewed to pass a test. The test usually will quiz someone on his or her current knowledge of the class material.

As long as someone takes a modern language and mathematics, it is likely the courses will transfer to a public university. If not, then someone could most likely test out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Introduction =

Some people ignored English while growing up; some people weren't taught correctly; and others didn't understand what was going on. Whether you fit those group of people or not, this guide is to excel your learning in the English language. However, before we hit head-on to becoming a great writer, I'm going to cover some basic steps. I can't make you a great writer in this wikibook, nor am I a &quot;great&quot; writer myself. I can, however, show you the paths to walk. I'm being semi-modest. Also, there's another wikibook working on that.

A person will not survive post-secondary education very long if he or she does not have proper usage of the English language. 

Grammar and writing are essential parts to creating a paper in an institution of higher learning. In a college or university, writing papers is a common task students must undertake. A typical college paper will be about five pages in length; and within that length, some grammar and spelling mistakes could be made. Some professors grade on grammar, while others do not. The grading of a paper depends on many factors: course level, course, paper requirements, etc. As someone goes into higher level courses, grammar becomes a concern to professors. Not only is it a concern, but being at a higher level means you are to become more of a professional. Thus, you will need to write like a professional. Some people might think this is too much trouble. Don't think learning this stuff is too much trouble. If you don't learn it, you'll be in trouble.

We've got four basic hierarchies of writing:

# '''The Philosophy of Language''': The building blocks of linguistics and more
# '''Linguistics''': The building blocks of language
# '''Grammar''': The building blocks of a language's linguistic usage
# '''Rhetoric''': The building blocks of presenting and identifying grammar, linguistics, and philosophical ideas in language.

The reason all of these should be studied is simple: They all have something to do with each other. It is suggest that a person starts from number one and goes up toward rhetoric. When people understands each rung of the ladder, they will be able to understand and analyze the way material is presented. Also, understanding each level will help a person present information. If you're new to college, you're going to be typing papers for the next two or more years. It's better to start now by understanding language. It may be difficult, but my advice is this: ''Learn faster''.

----

By the time you're done learning this stuff, you ought to be able to diagram a sentence, make corrections in Wikipedia projects, and make a coherent paragraph with style. Hopefully, you'll be a little bit more of a bibliophile. If you don't have one, you might even go out to buy a bookshelf. 

Also, by the time you're done, you ought to be a novice philosopher, linguist, grammarian, and rhetorician.
You may be thinking this is a lot of effort, and this is a lot of effort. But the more energy you direct toward a cause that will effect your writing abilities is a good thing. I wanted to create a systemized way of becoming a decent writer through this webpage. By having a pathway, you won't be wasting too much energy scrambling for information in different directions. If you still think this is too much work, then I will give you my most powerful philosophy:

Power = work/time

- Learn faster
- Work harder
- And take the efficient pathway to least resistance

= The Philosophy of Language =

I remember throughout high school that my teachers would banter about a &quot;well-rounded education&quot;; however, I don't quite remember them talking about . Some people don't teach philosophy in high school because it would give students  skills. And people don't want young students to  against those who may have critical thinking skills. In other words, philosophy enables a person to think about the way the universe, the world, its society, and the way a individuals work. As much as it would anger other philosophers to give my own definition of philosophy, I'm going to say it is the thing that enables a person to have a well-rounded education. Without a ground in philosophy, a person will never obtain a well-rounded education. Teachers and faculty have been stating things, but they haven't been explaining things.

Let's explain:

Philosophy is the groundwork for science, art, math, neuroscience, psychology, sociology, etc. You name it, you've probably got philosophy in there, somewhere. Whether its the arguable aspects of a single point in space being a circle or a questionable, metaphysical theory about the mind's energy states and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_Identity_Disorder dissociative identity disorder], you've got philosophy to argue about it and have people establish its groundwork. Although the latter may seem like a pseudo-scientific claim, it related to the philosophy of mind; and you've got philosophy that determines how language works, is represented, and is presented.

Philosophy is the foundation. If you ever have trouble understanding a topic, you could always search for the &quot;Philosophy of _____.&quot;
: The Philosophy of Psychology
: The Philosophy of Rhetoric
: The Philosophy of Education
: etc.



Yet again, I'm going to ask you to cross a bridge and walk a path designed by local villagers. Some have an idea of what makes a good pathway, but others aren't too sure. Regardless of their efforts, they tried their best to represent their ideal pathway:



Every term you ever read from these philosophy webpages is very important; however, remembering them all is daunting. Therefore, it is suggested that you look over these things at least one hour a day and try to memorize and understand them.

Also, before you go to college or if you're already there, I suggest you rent a book from your local library. You're going to be reading a lot of books in college. And you might as well learn that fact by stepping up your knowledge of language. Just about every book uses language, and the book I suggest you grab will, too. The book you grab would be about the philosophy of language. Although some people may have their own views of the way the philosophy of language works, it will establish a groundwork for you. Afterwards, you can move onto linguistics. You can, however, mix and match the hierarchal things listed in the introduction if you you're bored with one. Doing this will enable you to have a better view of how they connect to each other.

= Linguistics =

Here's a overview of linguistics: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics

Again, try to understand the terms used. You don't need to--although it would be great to--memorize all the terms right away. However, remembering the terms allows you to identify the way language is used. Identification of language is a very important skill in becoming a writer.


(This section is being worked on)

= Grammar =

Grammar can be descriptive or prescriptive. However, the kind of grammar emphasized will be of the descriptive flavor.

Because this Wikibook is slanted and written mostly in English, it will be focusing on English grammar. However, many of the same principles could be applied to foreign languages.

* [http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/ Guide to Grammar &amp; Writing]

== Obtaining Grammar Books ==
Grammar is an essential part to writing (typing) a paper. Many people go to college and notice their awful grammar. Sometimes, a person must relearn grammar and practice his or her English skills. The cheapest way to do this is to go to a local library and pick up grammar books and grammar exercise books. If your local library doesn't suit you or have the materials, you could go to a college library. An interesting thing about a college library is that you don't need to be a student to actually walk around and read the books; a college library, sometimes, offers more books than a local library. In this situation, you would walk through the library, find the book catalogue, grab some grammar books, and finally sit down somewhere to read them. For those intellectuals out there, you could look for multiple science books, take them to a desk, and start reading. 

Practicing grammar on one's own is very questionable. How does one know he or she is using correct grammar? In this situation, one of the best things to do is consult a grammar book. If one grammar book does not provide the answer you are seeking, then look in another grammar book. There are also forums online for people who are learning English. These forums often provide people who are helpful toward those learning ESL and refreshing their English skills. Whenever you write something, type something, or say something, check to see if you're using proper grammar. Grab a style usage and grammar book. Think about how you presented things. Were they correct? The way the author learned to have better English was to constantly grab for a style usage manual. If you don't have one, it is suggested that you buy one.

* Recommended Books:

# [http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel/ The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]. (A large 1500+ page book.)
::If you read that whole book, you'll understand more about grammar than most people understand; you'll probably understand more about grammar than most professors. It's expensive (Around $100 USD), but it's something to put on the shelf. Some libraries offer it on their shelves. If you can, constantly check it out and read it all the way through. (You'll save money that way.) Afterwards, rent it out to have it as a reference book on your own bookshelf. As with most books, write down all terms you don't understand; research those terms to gain a better understanding of them. When you're done with the whole book, you can flip through it as if it were a reference book. You can look in its index for &quot;commas&quot; or other thigns in relation to grammar.

= Rhetoric =

You may or may not have heard this term, but it will be a valuable term. Some people argue about the definition, and that's why many students have no clue whatsoever as to what the word means. Nonetheless, most people like to define a word by its criteria, abilities, or things that revolve around it to make it define itself. These, of course, are the many things that create definitional arguments. Regardless of the decades of controversey, I could give you my definition:

''Rhetoric is the act of presenting information and manipulating the way an audience interprets that information. The underlying principle of rhetoric would be philosophical and psychological aspects. These psychological aspects relate to a person's interpretation of the information and reaction due to cognitive influences. The philosophical aspects relate to the information being logical, sound, and valid: making sense instead of babble. Of course this could be argued, because many philosophers determine that rhetoric does not involve much Truth seeking; it doesn't seek truth but to sway an audience. However, rhetoric isn't suppose to be trick the audience into being sway, but it is to grab the audience's attention and have them pay attention to what is being said. Afterwards, it is used to influence the philosophical and psychological aspects of a person.''


* Some people could say rhetoric has a lot to do with prescriptive grammar: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescriptive_grammar
* Some people think of it as a school of thought: http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Pedagogy/Pedagogy.htm

To make up another definition off-hand, rhetoric is breaking style into bits and pieces and creating a term for each way style is presented. It is also about how style (rhetoric) is used within different contexts (rhetorical situations). Nonetheless, there seems to be an underlying principle that style is used to influence an audience. I may have done better to say I defined rhetoric's influence. It's all up for debate, but at least you've got an idea.

It's always good to know a bit about history:

# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric
# [http://web.archive.org/web/20050307155313/http://web.utk.edu/~gwynne/classical.html Classical Rhetoric]
# http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/

I'm not going to ask you to read all of Aristotle's Rhetoric. But it would be nice if you knew what it was about.
# http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~kt367198/arrhres.htm

Now you may be wondering, &quot;How's this going to help me?&quot; Well, it's going to give you a writing style and method. The style, however, will be a mix of rhetorical figures, and their usage will very depending on the way and time (kairos) you wish to present them. Rhetoric is the formal way of writing style. It seems very systematic, and it doesn't allow people to say, &quot;Writing is a natural talent!&quot;

You could, of course, be skeptical about all of this. &quot;Wouldn't that mean I'm copying a style?&quot; Heh. No. Rhetoric is about analyzing style throughout languages and learning how they are implemented. It's about style, not making a style. You make a style by changing your usage of rhetoric. The style of language has been systematically analyzed into bunches of terms, which represent items, ideas, and the way things are. ''Rhetoric is the style and method of all styles and methods.''

By using rhetorical figures in different situations, and throwing them around like spices in a dish, you'll be working toward that perfect meal that earns 5 stars on presentation and taste.

Of course, going into every detail about rhetoric would be elongating, and I don't have time to walk down the path with you, as Gandalf might have said in ''The Hobbit.'' I can, however, give you information and hope that you will stay on the path.

* [http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/silva.htm The Forest of Rhetoric]
:: This website is bookmarked by over 1000 people on [http://Del.icio.us Del.icio.us], an Internet bookmark saving website. It has a detailed discussion about rhetoric, rhetorical figures, and the way rhetoric is used. I would pay attention to the left frame of the website and follow discussed links.

However, we're going to focus on a few main parts of that website (Silva Rhetoricae):
# Content/Form
# Natural Ability or Talent (&quot;natura&quot; &quot;ingenium&quot;)
# Theory or Art (&quot;doctrina&quot; &quot;ars&quot;)
# Practice (&quot;exercitatio&quot; &quot;imitatio&quot;) 

(These were taken from this part of that website: http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Rhetorical%20Ability/ABILITY.HTM)

== Content and Form ==

You ever hear about a person analyzing a text? You ever wonder how the heck that's done correctly? Well, it takes some practice, but understanding rhetoric is a good start, mainly because rhetoric is about understanding terminology and applying it. What you'll be doing is analyzing the way people used rhetoric and identifying the style and parts of style within a text. This may seem like a very annoying task to the megalomaniac who doesn't have the time to screw around; however, it is one of the many things that build up power and enable her or him to write better. Tough luck.

This analyzation draws on theory and practice more than natural ability. I'm going to summarize natural ability as a person without apathy. A person who has the will to wield style and slice through the audience while leaving a brilliant scar of amazement and awe on it will have the ability to gain &quot;talent.&quot; Also, rhetorical pedagogy tries not to believe in natural ability.

The best thing you can do is grab a paper from a newspaper and identity rhetorical figures in it. Choose Newsweek, Times, USA Today, or some other popular magazine. You may want to grab Psychology Today or some other stylish magazine that implements witty banter/style. Your job is to identity the parts of style. Afterwards, you job is to write a paper, restate the thesis, and change the usage of rhetorical figures. Don't make it look the same; make it look different, but say the same thing using rhetoric.

The idea is to analyze the content, its style, and the form it takes. Afterwards, reword the content, and reshape the form of style. By doing this, you will gain practice and experience in rhetoric. Also, if you type up blogs or journal entries, implement rhetoric into each blog you type. You might give the appearance of a modern day Shakespeare.

=== Practicing Writing Skills ===

Many people question how to improve their writing skills. Improving writing skills takes dilligent work; however, it is not a hard thing, in terms of academic writing, to master. It is suggested that a person has an online journal or &quot;blog&quot; to write his or her thoughts. These journals/diaries can be made private. Many writers believe in using LiveJournal (LiveJournal.com) for their writings. They use this website because the website will delete any articles or writings created when the writer wishes to delete the journal. In other words, when the writer wants all of his or her writings to disappear, then they disappear. The cause for this behavior is because of copyright infringement and other legal mumbo-jumbo. In other words, the writers are paranoid that someone will steal their work. And it does happen. Of course there are tons of computer science and forensic issues at work, but they can't be done without judicial or executive request; yet most writers feel writing on a private journal is one of the most secure ways to write articles, papers, and other academic things.

As a person continues to write his or her thoughts in a journal, he or she will (usually) comes across spelling and grammar errors. Looking for these key things and correcting them is what helps establish a decent writer. Good writing comes with consistent proofreading and revision. In such a writing dilemma, a person could consult a style usage book--or he or she could use the Internet to find answers. Sometimes people will use Internet forums and talk to writers when they cannot find an remedy to a specific writing problem. Sometimes a person will not know how to type something out, such as dialogue, within an entry. One should not fall into despair when he or she cannot find an answer to his or her writing dilemma; Band-Aid remedies do exist: A person could revise his or her word, sentence, paragraph, etc. Although for the silent writer who lurks behind corners and in the basement, he or she may consider going to the local library and looking for books on dialogue. If the person wants to know more about non-fiction writing, he or she may look for a book on non-fiction writing. One of the best ways to fix a writing dilemma, such as dialogue, is to read a book on how dialogue is used.

Good writing is not something that is achieved over-night. 
:A person must first work on spelling, grammar, and understanding rhetoric.
:: Of course, if you can read 3000 pages in a 24-hour period, you may be able to become a great writer over-night.

== Style and Rhetoric ==

Although this may be a simple commentary I created in light of style and rhetoric, it may be of use to some people:

Social psychology holds this belief that there are a few ways to distract a person and persuade him or her. A person is easier to persuade when he or she is distracted; however, this distraction must not foreshadow manipulation. That's what tropes and schemes do in rhetoric. They allow a person to manipulate the psychology of the reader and distract his or her cognition.

In a kind of scenario, a reader may be enjoying prose and admiring it.
This distracts the person, and allows him or her to be persuaded more efficiently.

In other words, changing and twisting the emotions of a person changes the cognition and processing capabilities of the person. Style's objective within rhetoric is to twist and change a person's emotions, thus to change the way a person perceives an argument.

The ways in which to use tropes and schemes differ depending on the kairos. When a writer in noticing that conflict may occur when showing alternate argument, that may be the write time to inflict style and good prose in order to change the cognition of the reader. Also, certain prose at certain times could influence and lead the person to continue with the argument instead of gaining a distaste for it.

A possible usage for it is the same cognitive route that movies use: Build a person up for a climax. A person could use style to lead to the bridge, then he or she could use emotionally charged words to build a climax. Afterwards, the person could throw in a witty line with style and brings things back down to Earth.

Much of this has a lot to do with social engineer, social psychology, cognitive behavior, cognition, and psychology.

The ability of a writer to create prose could have an influence on ethos and pathos. People may perceive the writer to be an intelligent writer because of his or her ability to create stylish prose, thus building [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos ethos]. Also, the prose may have a cognitive effect on the reader, thus affecting [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos pathos]. The trick is to make the prose seem logical and reasonable. 

An analogy is a perfect example where cognition of the reader takes place. The writer must use intelligence and style when creating them. However, they must be clear to the reader and understanable. This is why many people like analogies: Analogies allow a person to grasp a concept better.

= Writing in General =
== Coherence ==

Make one sentence link to the next. Afterwards, you could use transitions to go from that sentence to this sentence. However, this sentence may not be as apparent as the last sentence. Of course, one could make an argument about that statement... Do you notice the coherence? That's why you need to start practicing coherence before you write a college paper.

Sites to view:
* http://exchanges.state.gov/forum/vols/vol40/no3/p32.htm

== Proofreading ==

Proofreading is the most important part of any paper. NEVER turn in a college paper without proofreading it more than four times. And after you do that, do it again. Proofreading can be difficult if one does not have a full comprehension of grammatical rules: That is just one problem when it comes to proofreading. This is why this part of the wikibook suggests people read through the Internet texts recommended in the previous section. When proofreading, one of the most important parts is making everything grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read.

Many people speak outloud while proofreading their paper: This is highly suggested. Sometimes, when a person is proofreading, he or she may not notice any grammar or spelling mistakes while speaking outloud. This is why a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-speech Text-To-Speech program] (TTS) is recommended. This author uses [http://www.readplease.com/ Readplease] for convenience and flexibility. By using a program such as this, a person can listen to the text version of the paper spoken aloud. Listening closely, a person can find mistakes in the paper when a word is spoken incorrectly. This is one of the many handy tools for proofreading. However, if you've proofread with a TTS method, then you will want to proofread with your eyes, a dictionary, a style manual, and a grammar book. Proofreading can be annoying, but at least you'll get a decent grade.



== My Favorite Way to Save Files ==

----
* ((Source: http://www.writingforums.com/showthread.php?t=64789))
:: Thread was created by Cyberman (Kamisama), this Wikibook's creator.
----

Although I'm not the best of writers, I have a new trick in my arsenal.

But first a story:

When I was in college last semester, I lost a lot of my work. I had it saved to the hard drive and the hard drive broke. I wasn't able to save my work in time. And I had to hustle and move very quickly to recover from this disaster. However, I somewhat gained a new trick out of it all.

I was looking for alternatives, and I know many are you thinking &quot;Use a jumpdrive.&quot; But I lost my jumpdrive; and even though those things are fun to use, they can be lost, too. After a jumpdrive is lost, then the saved data is not recoverable until one finds the jumpdrive. And floppy disks are still a hot thing among many people. Yet those can fail, too. I've seen it happen. Hell, I'm a 1990's kid. I know data loss happens. I think the major thing that set me back, however, was when my AC adapater for my laptop broke. Those things cost a lot of money. And I couldn't get ahold of a new one right away. I didn't have three weeks to wait for something to get to my mailbox. The papers were due soon.

So what was I to do from that day forward?
What could I possibly do?

And then I decided to use my computer experience and Internet knowledge. I haven't tried to do anything nifty in a while. I thought about this predicament; I didn't want it to happen again. I was getting sick of the trouble. After enough hard thinking, I came up with a solution: GMail.

Yeah, GMail is a really great tool. Matter of fact, I won't type anything in MSWord or Openoffice.org anymore. Seriously. Want to know why? Because GMail constantly saves whatever I'm writing. The best thing is that it is online. Yes, online. It's an online program that saves whatever a person is typing online. It doesn't constantly save, but it saves about every 30 seconds as long as a person keeps typing. I emphasize typing because it recognizes the fact that a person is typing and decides to save that &quot;email&quot; as a draft. Yet the writer isn't really making an email. The writer is saving everything as a draft.

Here's the procedure for those who like a layout:

#Compose a letter to yourself
#Start typing
#Keep typing
#Notice that GMail has saved your email as a draft (takes about 45 seconds after continuous typing.)
#Keep typing.
#When you're done typing, hit &quot;Save...&quot;
#Recognize that if your computer had crashed, the hard drive had broken, or some bat out of hell came from nowhere, that your GMail has saved your email. And you can access it in the drafts folder.

When a person wishes to gain access to that file, all he or she has to do is go into the drafts folder and edit the file. If someone wants that copy to be written in stone, then all one has to do is click &quot;send.&quot; Afterwards, if the person wants to do more to the file, then he or she can copy and paste the information into a new composed draft. I find it fairly nice to use. And the neat thing is that everything is time-stamped.

This is not to say that you shouldn't save another copy to a jumpdrive, floppy disk, or other storage medium. Matter of fact, I advise that you do when you're done for the day.

But the important thing here is that GMail saves something. It saves it while you type. And the file does not get destroyed. Of course, there may be circumstances when Google's corporation goes to hell and the servers crash; but I think a billion dollar company would make backups or have precautions.

For these reasons, I have been using GMail whenever I have something important to type up. It seems much better than using an FTP server. However, there are times when Google Mail is not accessible; it rarely happens. This is why saving something to a different storage medium is advised.

And if I do use Openoffice.org or MSWord, then it's for doing margin work, footnotes, spelling, and other specific word processing applications.

== Writing Workshops ==
Some colleges offer community courses or courses that do not earn college credit. All who do not fully understand grammar should take a writing workshop and improve their grammar. Grammar is of the utmost importance when writing a paper for college. Writing workshops not only help with grammar, they also help with the structure of a paper. By structure, I mean the way everything fits together in a smooth transition: this smooth transition is also known as style.

These writing workshops do cost money, but they are worth it if a person comes out with improved writing. The best thing about taking a writing workshop is that a person does not have to take a college/university course that impacts his or her GPA. Another good reason to take a writing workshop is because many English professors expect someone to already know grammar and style. Depending on one's educational background, he or she may not remember how to use a semicolon or a colon; that person may not even remember the difference between a semicolon and a colon. Albeit that many early (before 1900 A.D.) writers used colons and semicolons in a fashionable way, it is recommended that someone flip through a grammar and style book for a definite way of writing with colons and semicolons. Although the semicolon may seem to be presented in a mediocre way, at least it will be used correctly.

=== Read the Course Books Before the Semester Starts ===
Many college students have this policy after learning &quot;the system&quot; to read the course books ahead of time. Of course, this proposes many questions: 

* What am I suppose to be learning from this book?

'''Author's Answer:''' Whatever is covered in the book. Sometimes there is a lot of gibberish in college books; this gibberish is put there to elongate things that could have been defined in three sentences instead of three paragraphs. All things covered that relate to the course are important. Very little in a book is gibberish and is related to something; remember as much as you can about a book, while knowing which gibberish to ignore. Often, when reading a book with a lot of information, much of the information to remember belongs to specific people/objects, events, actions, results, locations, and problems. This &quot;thing to remember logic&quot; applies to science, social science, and literature.

* When the class starts, you can ask your professor about what is to remembered and what is not.
Most &quot;good&quot; college students come out of a course remembering about 50% of the material covered in a course book.

Here's something to remember: read as much of a/the book(s) as you can, as soon as you can.
Read a/the book(s) before the semester starts.

'''&quot;Reading before the semester starts&quot; technique:'''
Say, you have five books and one book for each course.

Read at least 10 pages from each book. When you are done with 10 pages from one book, switch to the next book; keep this 10 page revolving system going, until classes start or read a chapter and then switch books. Usually, reading one chapter from a book and switching to the next does well for covering the book(s) of each class.

By doing this, you will be able know what the book covers and what the class topic is all about.
Try to read as much of each book as you can before classes start. '''You will''' have an advantage if you read the books ahead of time.

=== Write Down What You Don't Understand ===

When a person reads a book he or she may have trouble understanding the concepts of the things presented. Often, a person wants to read a chapter, but he or she may continue to try and understand a concept before moving to the next page.

The best thing to do in this situation is to write down the concept you do not understand. After you write down what you do not understand, present what you don't understand to the professor.

Before presenting, find a way to ask about what you don't understand. Write a question about the concept in question form on a piece of paper. This way, when you talk to the professor, you can ask him or her the question about the topic you don't understand, that is on the piece of paper.

'''Example:''' 

You read a paragraph about RNA, introns, and extrons. Yet you don't understand how introns are cut out from RNA before becoming mRNA.

* ''Write down:'' introns, RNA, and extrons
* ''Make a question:'' How are introns cut out from RNA before RNA becomes mRNA?

After doing so, you may move onto the next page and hopefully understand more as you continue to read. Sometimes as a person moves on, he or she will find different material that is unrelated, so he or she can focus on that material, and later on the part he or she did not understand. With the part someone did not understand he or she would present that question to the professor.

This is a technique used to cover the rest of the chapter, and read the chapter instead of having a point in which someone becomes stuck on a page before moving on.

= Research =
== Library vs. Internet ==

It is often faster to use a library than it is to use the internet.
Being that I've been on the web a decade or more now, I've learned many interesting things.
For one, the Internet offers a lot of knowledge--a lot of diverse knowledge. Matter of fact, the Internet over the years has become so diverse, searching through the web is like looking through the garbage for something you accidentally threw away. Finding things on the Internet has become very complex these days, and many people rant about having better information to offer than the competitor.

With Internet searching skills, a person will get better at finding materials. Sometimes, people take a shortcut and go to a web forum to ask people a question or where to locate information. The truth is, searching, asking, and locating on the Internet becomes very time consuming. I’ve found that it becomes more time consuming than looking around in a library.

The library often has many resources to choose from. Learning where everything is in a library is important. The more you know about every nook and cranny in a library, the more you can prepare to find materials to do research. Professors usually want book sources when a student is doing a paper. Libraries also have a physical search engine called a librarian. This person is better than an Internet search engine, because you can describe what you need to research, what you are looking for, and ask where it is and how you can find more information.

It is often better to search through a library than through the Internet. This can be disputed, but if you start using a lot of time to research something you could have researched in the library, then maybe you might want to try using the library.

Seriously, welcome to Wikibooks.  It is awsome to have somebody contributing to Wikibooks with such original and unique content.  The [[Nissan 240SX Performance Modification]] wikibook is precisely the kind of content that we are looking for here, and we are glad that you are participating with this project.  Keep up the good work and I hope that your book is successful.

I've already been trying to catalog your Wikibook, but we are in the midst of a massive reorganization of the front end of Wikibooks at the moment.  Hopefully when the dust settles it will be a better organization to all of the content that we have here, and this book certainly deserves some prominent attention.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:20, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

This page is [[Meatball:DocumentMode|DocumentMode]] space to collect notes and material to redesign the bookshelves. There is also a '''[[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|talk page]]'''.

== Situation ==
Possible goals:
* Put '''every''' book on a bookshelf.
* Update unmaintained bookshelves.
* Find and rescue obscure bookshelves ({{bad link|Wikibooks:Biology bookshelf}}, {{bad link|Wikibooks:Physics bookshelf}}).
* Add more goals to this list.

Alternatives:
* Keep one linear list of bookshelves, as we have now.
* Group bookshelves into departments.
** The [[Main Page]] has these; we could also add them to {{bad link|Template:Bookshelves}}.
* Reduce the number of bookshelves (leaving many books on one page).
** This is possible by creating very long bookshelves, potentially of 100 books or more, divided into sections to keep everything managable.

== Departments ==
Recently the [[Main Page]] adopted departments. However there might be other ways to group bookshelves into departments.

One idea is to limit the {{bad link|Wikibooks:Annotated texts bookshelf}} to annotated texts that include the source texts.

== Centralised development stages ==
If you store the development stage &lt;tt&gt;{{msgnw:Guide to X11/Development}}&lt;/tt&gt; in [[Template:Guide to X11/Development]], then you can use [[Template:Book link]] to make a link:

* {{tl1|book link|Guide to X11}} -&gt; {{book link|Guide to X11}}
* {{tl2|book link|Guide to X11|Read me}} -&gt; {{book link|Guide to X11|Read me}}

Thus, the correct stage of the book can appear on the bookshelf, department, [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical Classification]], and user pages. Further, as the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] implements new systems like Dewey and LOC classification, the stages can also be used there.

As a limitation, there is no way to make {{tl|book link}} use {{tl|stage}} in lieu of {{tl|stage short}}, if the development template contains stage short.

[[wikt:Wiktionary:Index to templates|Wiktionary:Index to templates]] states that &quot;Templates calling other templates is strongly discouraged.&quot; However, &quot;Template:Book link&quot; calls &quot;Template:''Book''/Development&quot;, which in turn calls &quot;Template:Stage short&quot;.

=== Changing the stage ===
The following wiki markup, at the bottom of the front book page, provides some utilities including a button to change the stage.

&lt;pre&gt;
{| {{prettywidetable}}
 | {{subst:index}}
 |-
 | {{shelf|Humanities}} ||
 |}
&lt;/pre&gt;

One can also adapt it to work at a different page:

&lt;pre&gt;
{| {{prettywidetable}}
 | {{subst:index|book=Overcoming Procrastination}}
 |-
 | {{shelf|Humanities}} ||
 |}
&lt;/pre&gt;

That produces:

{| {{prettywidetable}}
 | [[Special:Prefixindex/Overcoming Procrastination/|Page index]]
 |-
 | {{shelf|Humanities}} ||
 |}

=== Template:Bookshelves at 04:09, 31 March 2006 (UTC) ===
This version simply uses a single list of bookshelves, so related bookshelves are not grouped together.

*Perhaps put &quot;Computer Science&quot; in Technology? It's not a &quot;[[w:natural science]],&quot; since computers are artificial/man-made.
*Computing and videogames and traditional games would be better in Arts and Culture, I think.
*Maybe separate &quot;athetics and physical education&quot; into a subcategory of Sports on &quot;Traditional games&quot; and &quot;physical education&quot; on &quot;Education?&quot;
*Based on their template sizes, &quot;Programming languages&quot; and &quot;Domain-specific languages&quot; look like they would go well together. (Ignore this if there is a set reason why they're separate.)
*A lot of thought should be put behind the organiztion of [[w:social sciences]] (see &quot;major fields&quot;) and [[w:humanities]]. The humanities and the society departments may be better combined into one department Business, Economics, Government, and Politics may also do better as sections of a larger shelf.
*Combine health science and medecine?
*Combine literature and annotated texts?
*A travel guides shelf seems unnecessary for only two books.
My suggestions would get rid of two departments. They seem to combine the general structure of proposal one with the naming in proposal two.--[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 21:09, 12 April 2006 (UTC) &lt;/div&gt;

:Note that Computer Science, in a pure sense, is a variation of mathmatics.  Indeed, most Computer Science departments in major universities were essentially appendages to the mathmatics departments, or were started with primarily mathmatics PhDs as there were no Computer Science PhDs at the time.  For this reason it really deserves to belong with the other mathmatics discliplines... at least things that go into the theoretical aspects of finite state machine conecepts and mathmatically proving algorithms like big '''O''' notation and similar ideas.  There really is science in Computer Science, even though most of it is engineering.  I'm certainly willing to consider other opinions on this topic, however.  General mathmatics, Computer Science, Statistics, Finite Mathmatics, Game Theory, Graph Theory, and other related topics really should belong together in some sort of broad category.  Note Game Theory is not how to play games, but mathmatical analysis of games and theories on how to make up games and how to improve them for several different goals and objectives.  I don't see a reason for a seperate Mathmatics department yet, but that is something that ''may'' happen in the future if there can be several independent mathmatical bookshelves that are eventually started.

:The seperate bookshelves for Programming Languages and Domain-specific languages is part of an even larger breakup of the Information Technology bookshelf that started over a year ago.  This was by far the largest single bookshelf on Wikibooks, and it was getting very difficult to find anything.  Please read the huge discussion on [[Wikibooks talk:Information technology bookshelf]] and there was some other talk pages involved as well.  Most of the current Computer department is from that bookshelf.

:The travel guide shelf is set up mainly because there is no other real place to put these books.  A debate over having these kinds of books on Wikibooks is reasonable, and I anticipate that if you have a full bookshelf dedicated to these book that many more will be written.  This is one area that I see some huge growth developing from.  I'm not proposing a whole department for these books either.  So much has been shunted off to Wikitravel that it is no wonder there aren't more travel books.

:Combining general literature guides like [[Introduction to Shakespeare]] and general annotated texts might be a very good idea.  I support that idea.

:As far as the recreation department, this was to have an area that is primarily focused for content that many Wikibooks users have an interest in.  And to keep everything that is &quot;fun&quot; together.  There are enough athletics guides now that I think a seperate athletics bookshelf can and should be created.  This is also looking to the future where it is anticipated that departments will take on a much larger role within Wikibooks, and all of these categories seem to fit together under common philosophies and attitudes, as well as expertise that can be shared in common between all of these types of books.  As far as a pure Physical Education textbook, it would go equally well with other athletics, education, or even health.  In this regard I think permitting a book to be on multiple bookshelves is not necessarily a bad thing, and several books are listed multiple times even now on multiple bookshelves because they are interdiscliplinary.  I think it is within reason I could put together at least a dozen Wikibooks on a seperate athletics bookshelf right now.  Again, I think this is a situation where once you have it all together in a neat package, many more will be created.  I also anticipate that other bookshelves will be created in this area, with particularly the Video games bookshelf being perhaps broken up into several bookshelves as well.

:The general philosophy I had over this layout is to anticipate the future growth of Wikibooks, based on other web content.  I was using both the current structure of Wikibooks, but also letting the organizational structure of the [http://dmoz.org/ Open Directory Project] have a bit of influence here as well.  The structure on that project has perhaps the most intensive ontological review of any classification scheme that I have ever seen, including other classification schemes like the Dewey Decimal system and the Library of Congress system.  I kid you not, the best of the best in the world have gone in and classified the ODP in at least the top categories, and they are pretty balanced top categories at that.  It is from this that I am trying to anticipate what Wikibooks will be like in the future when non-geeks start arriving here in mass... or perhaps they are here now.  I guess you are most opposed to the Recreation and Humanities departments as ones to be eliminated.  My contention is that they are going to break off anyway in the future in one way or another.  It is not easy to try and come up with the very top-level categories of any classification system.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:58, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

::Ah, I see. My main concern was balance, but, unlike you, I didn't factor in future growth in my analysis. I trust that you have that well planned for. My only concerns now are why medecine isn't part of health science and why social science is part of arts &amp; culture, when, by my understanding, it includes both Politics and Economics, which are part of a society department. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 01:32, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:::I'm trying to also think about substantial areas currently covered under the DCC (dewey decimal system) and the LOC major categories.  I think this organization deals with just about all 100 and 10 level breakdowns of the DCC, or two-letter codes of the LOC scheme.  I just added an agriculture bookshelf to deal with things like [[Beekeeping]] and [[Caring for Guinea Pigs]].  This would also include things like [[Gardening]] that would not otherwise be involved with Biology as a disclipline.

:::This brings up the other issue that categories of this nature can be listed in a couple of places.  In this case, the ag bookshelf under both science and as how-to books.  Computer Science perhaps should be listed under both Science and Technology.  We can be a little flexable here, and are not confined to physical bookshelves that have to be arranged in a strict heirarchy because of physical limitations of having to occupy a location in 3-D space.  Proposal 1 did cover this somewhat, but I failed to add it in here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:19, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== A major reorganization ==

I've put together a few thoughts here:  [[User:Robert Horning/Bookshelf Reorganization]]

I still need to work on it, but it does go through and deal with some of the content here on Wikibooks and even adds a few new bookshelves.  More needs to go into this outline, but it at least is another direction to look at.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:00, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Guide to X11}}

== Starting Programs ==
The traditional Unix method of starting a program is call it from the shell by entering its name on the command line. For example:

 $ '''emacs'''

At the beginning of the X Window System, the method to start an X11 client was essentially the same. You would always have an XTerm open, so you could enter commands to open Emacs, Netscape, and other XTerms. Of course, this meant that if you closed (or xkilled) an XTerm, you would &quot;hang up&quot; all programs started from it, thus causing them to quit and disappear suddenly. So you had to remember to leave open the XTerm from which you started the clients.

Such behaviour is the function of launching programs in the foreground, which makes it dependent on the shell/terminal window (xterm, rxvt, or some other) being open and working.

To launch multiple windowed programs independent of the shell window (that is, in the background), attach an ampersand at the end of each command:

 $ xclock &amp;

===Outside the shell===
Some window managers added a feature called the ''minicli'', for MINIature Command LIne. You choose &quot;Run Command&quot; from some menu, then type the name of a program, such as &quot;emacs&quot;. This solved the problem of having extra XTerms (or Konsoles, et cetera) open just to start some programs. However, it introduced another problem: some programs print error messages to the terminal, and you might need to retrieve the error message if you wonder why your program is crashing or not starting. The solution is to log to some file, such as &lt;tt&gt;~/.xsession-errors&lt;/tt&gt;, when [[../Starting Sessions/|starting your session]]. Most implementations of X do this automatically.

Many window managers also allow to start programs from menus. However, different window managers have different methods of configuration. There are some attempts at a solution such that you can use the same menu in different window managers. The [[Using GNOME|GNOME]] and [[Using KDE|KDE]] desktop environments currently use a common &lt;tt&gt;*.desktop&lt;/tt&gt; file format to indicate a menu item.

KDE typically provides a K menu in the lower left corner of the screen. GNOME typically provides menus like &quot;Applications&quot; in the upper left corner. Both environments can be customised. Some window managers, like [[Guide to X11/Window Managers/twm|twm]] and IceWM, let you click on the desktop background to summon the menu.

===Specifying window geometry===
In X, it's typically easy to set a program window's size and position by specifying the &lt;CODE&gt;-geometry&lt;/CODE&gt; parameter with the following value syntax &amp;mdash;
 &amp;#91;&amp;#123;WIDTH&amp;#125;&amp;#93;&amp;#91;x&amp;#123;HEIGHT&amp;#125;&amp;#93;&amp;#91;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Horizontal axis&quot;&gt;&amp;#123;+-&amp;#125;&amp;#123;XOFF&amp;#125;&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;#91;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Vertical axis&quot;&gt;&amp;#123;+-&amp;#125;&amp;#123;YOFF&amp;#125;&lt;/abbr&gt;&amp;#93;&amp;#93;
:&lt;CODE&gt;'''XOFF'''&lt;/CODE&gt; or horizontal axis handles top-to-bottom and reverse directions; &lt;CODE&gt;'''YOFF'''&lt;/CODE&gt; or vertical axis is for left-to right and reverse directions. Plus (+) and minus (-) signs before XOFF/YOFF correlate to edges of origin: '''+''' is the amount of pixels off the left/top edge; '''-''' is the number of pixels off the right/bottom edge.

Example with xeyes:
 $ xeyes -geometry 100x100-37+50 &amp;
&amp;mdash; Where xeyes opens with the size of 100x100 pixels, at 37 pixels from right&amp;ndash; and 50 pixels from top of the screen. The ampersand (&amp;amp;) frees xeyes from the terminal.

The -geometry parameter can be used both in the shell and from within the X menu system and menu systems of other windowing environments.

====Caveats====
Setting window geometry might not or won't work with programs that don't recognise the specification, such as Mozilla Firefox and Wine; Firefox uses its own command-line settings, and Wine launches more than one window with at least one of them not being native to X.

While most window managers and desktop environments support the specification, some might not.

==1. Earn the AY Cooking honor.==
The answers for the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts/Cooking|Cooking]] honor can be found in the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Household Arts|Household Arts]] section of this wikibook.

==2. Give a brief history of Dutch ovens and their role in American history.==

[[Image:Dutch_Oven_-McClures_Magazine.jpg|frame|right|Dutch oven from a photograph made for McClure's Magazine, January, 1896, Vol. VI. No. 2]]

The first Europeans coming to the Americas brought Dutch ovens with them, including Columbus, who had one listed on his manifest, and the Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth Rock.  

Dutch ovens were so highly prized in early American history, that Martha Washington has been said to have listed her Dutch ovens in her will.

Lewis and Clark brought a Dutch oven with them on their overland expedition to the Pacific Ocean. The mountain men that followed them into the west used them for cooking and for trade with the Native Americans.

Dutch ovens were also carried on the &quot;chuck wagons&quot; brought along on the cattle drives in the late 1800's.

The Dutch oven shown here was owned by Mrs. Ott, of Petersburg, Illinois.  It was featured in an article about Abraham Lincoln in [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13637 McClure's Magazine] in 1896. ''&quot;These Dutch ovens were in many cases the only cooking utensils used by the early settlers. The meat, vegetable, or bread was put into the pot, which was then placed in a bed of coals, and coals heaped on the lid.&quot;''

==3. Know the difference between a bread oven, a stew/meat oven, pot/stove top oven and a camp oven.==
*'''Bread ovens''' are four inches deep.  They are more shallow than stew/meat ovens so that the heat from the lid will be closer to the bread.
*'''Stew/meat ovens''' are five to seven inches deep.
*'''Pot/stove-top ovens''' have no legs and are used on top of a stove.
*'''Camp ovens''' have long legs so that coals may be heaped beneath them.  They also have flanged lids so that coals may be heaped on top of them.  Camp ovens are used outdoors in campfires, and sometimes indoors in a fireplace.

==4. In what way are ovens sized?==
Dutch ovens are sized by diameter, depth, or capacity:

==5. Know and demonstrate fire and Dutch oven handling safety and the proper use of equipment.==
Make sure you are dressed properly when handling Dutch ovens.  A heavy apron, leather gloves, and shoes are essential.  You should also have a fire extinguisher handy.  Keep the area free from tripping hazards, and use lid lifters and lid stands.  You will also need a shovel for moving the hot coals around.  Check with local fire officials and get any required permits before building a campfire.

==6. What types of fuels are used to cook with an oven?==
# Wood
# Charcoal
# Natural gas
# Propane
# Electricity

==7. What are the advantages of charcoal over wood as fuel?==
Charcoal briquettes are uniform in size, and are made from a single species of wood.  Because of this, they burn more evenly, and thus, they produce heat more evenly.  Wood on the other hand, comes in non-uniform sizes, and the type usually used as firewood is often of more than one species.  As a result, it does not heat as evenly as charcoal does.

==8. How do you control temperature?==
The easiest way to control the temperature of a Dutch oven is by using the right number of charcoal briquettes for the desired temperature.  In general, you should put one third of the total briquettes beneath the Dutch oven, and the remaining two-thirds on the lid.  The number of briquettes required to achieve a temperature of 325°F (160°C) is twice the pot's diameter as measured in inches (or 8/10 times its diameter as measured in centimeters).  So if you have a 12&quot; (30 cm) pot, you will need 24 briquettes.  Eight of them will go beneath the pot (one third of 24 is 8), and 16 go on the lid (two-thirds of 24 is 16).  For higher temperatures, add three more briquettes - one to the bottom, two to the lid.  Every time three briquettes are added, the temperature will increase by 25° to 30° F (14° to 16° C).

Note that these numbers are only a rule-of-thumb.  There are many other variables that can affect the temperature inside a Dutch oven, including the outside temperature, whether the oven is in the sun or shade, the amount of wind, and the amount of metal the oven is made from.  You will need to experiment with your oven to master temperature control.

==9. What do ashes do to the efficiency of the coals?==
Ash decreases the efficiency of the coals because it acts as an insulator.  It should be brushed off with a small wisk broom often when cooking.

==10. If using wood, what types are best for cooking?==
In general, hardwoods such as oak, hickory, ash, and mesquite are better than softwoods such as pine.  Be careful when using mesquite though, as it burns very hot.  Hardwoods also produce less smoke than softwoods, and softwoods are more likely to leave a creosote residue on the oven.

==11. Demonstrate how to properly season a new Dutch oven.==
New Dutch ovens are often coated with wax, and this must be removed as the first step in seasoning it.  To do this, wash the Dutch oven (and the lid!) using hot soapy water inside and out, and rinse it thoroughly, also in hot water.  Dry the oven with a towel.  Then wipe the entire oven down with cooking oil or shortening (use a high quality cooking oil such as olive oil or vegetable oil).  Be sure the coat all surfaces of the oven, inside and out, including the lid and the legs.  

The next step is to &quot;bake&quot; your Dutch oven upside-down for an hour at 350°F (175°C).  Put the lid on top of the Dutch oven's legs when doing this.  A regular kitchen oven can be used, but be warned - this will fill your house with smoke!  Open two windows - one in the kitchen, and one elsewhere.  Put a fan on the kitchen window sill to blow the air out of the kitchen.  It would be better (for the occupants of the house) to do this on an outdoor gas barbecue grill (the kind with a cover).  After one hour, turn off the heat and let the oven cool.  When it cools, it is ready to use.  Do not  cook any acidic foods (such as tomatoes) the first two or three times after seasoning the oven, as this may break down the baked-on oil coating.

==12. Demonstrate how to properly clean a Dutch oven after each use.==
To clean the Dutch oven, simply wipe it down with a clean paper towel.  If food is stuck to the oven, bring one or two cups of water to a boil in the oven and scrape the food off with a rubber spatula.  Do '''not''' use soap, metal scouring pads, or metal utensils on a cast-iron Dutch oven or you will have to re-season it!  It's OK to use soap on an aluminum Dutch oven.

==13. Demonstrate how to properly transport Dutch ovens.==
Transport your Dutch oven in a cardboard box, a wooden crate, or in a carrying case to protect it from damage.

==14. Demonstrate how to properly store a Dutch oven for a short term and long term.==
Use a paper towel to lightly coat the Dutch oven inside and out (including the legs and lid).  Lay a single paper towel flat in the bottom of the oven.  Fold a paper towel into a one-ich (2.5 cm) wide strip and place it on the rim of the Dutch oven to form a spacer so that the lid does not fit tightly.  Be sure to use a whole paper towel.  This is to allow air to circulate inside the oven and prevent the oil coating inside the oven from becoming rancid.   If the coating does become rancid, you will need to strip it and re-season it.  To strip an oven, place it upside-down in a self-cleaning kitchen oven with the lid placed on top of the legs.  Set the kitchen oven on self clean for two hours.  Do not cook food in a rancid oven, or you will end up with rancid-tasting food! Do '''not''' store the Dutch oven in a damp area.

==15. Cook one of each category using Dutch ovens:==
We include at least one recipe for each category here, but if you have a favorite, please feel free to add it.

# Combine the milk mixture with the water, mix with the whisk.
# Put the whisk aside.
# Add the flour to the liquid.  Powder your hands with flour and mix the dough with your hands, or use a dough hook at low speed for one minute.  As you mix the flour, it should just clean off the sides of the mixing bowl.  Add more water or more flour to get the dough to the right consistency.  It works best if the dough is ''just'' dry enough to handle with floured hands.  
#If using a dough hook, knead for two more minutes at the next speed level.  Otherwise, sprinkle flour the the work surface, dump the dough ball onto it and knead vigorously for five minutes. Kneading is done by folding the dough in half, flattening, rotating 90°, and repeating over and over again.
# Grease the mixing bowl with cooking spray.
# Form the dough into a large ball and return it to the mixing bowl, smooth side down.  Turn the dough ball over until all sides are coated with the cooking spray.  Leave the smooth side up.
# Cover the dough in the mixing bowl with cellophane.
# Allow dough to rise for about an hour.  It should double in size.
# Dump the dough ball onto a clean work surface, flatten, and cut in half.  
# Refrigerate one half, or bake both halves in two Dutch ovens.
# Spray the inside of the Dutch Oven and the underside of the lid with Cooking Spray.
# Place the dough ball in the Dutch Oven, smooth side up and centered.  The sides of the dough ball should not touch the sides of the oven.
# Bake at 375°F for 25 to 30 minutes.

==16. Cook with the lid only as a griddle.==
The lid can be used as a griddle if it is turned upside-down and placed on a heat source.  The advantage of this technique is that the lid is slightly bowl-shaped, so even if it is not perfectly level, whatever you are cooking (pancakes anyone?) tends to stay in the griddle instead of spilling out.

==17. Name the six different ways to cook in a Dutch oven.==
You can use a Dutch oven for frying, deep frying, baking, boiling, stewing, and roasting.

==18. What is meant by stack cooking?==
Stack cooking is the practice of stacking up to four Dutch ovens one on top of another, and cooking a different item in each one.  This conserves fuel, but one must be ''very'' careful to not overturn the stack or all of the food will be ruined.  A disadvantage of stack cooking is that if the bottom oven needs to be checked, all the ones on top of it must be moved first.

In non-stack Dutch oven cooking, it is normal to rotate the oven every 10 to 15 minutes so that the heat is evenly distributed.  However, this is not practical in stack cooking.  Instead, it suffices to simply move the coals around on each layer.

;[[../B-50 Series|B-50 Series]]
:The B-50 series of shots are variations on the B-52 shot that have warranted their own name. They are typically composed of Kahlúa, Baileys Irish Cream, and a third liqueur.

;[[../B-52|B-52]]
:[[Image:Cocktail B52.jpg|right|thumb|120px|A B-52 cocktail]]Kahlua, Baileys, Grand Marnier. The '''B-52''' is a layered shot served in a pousse-cafe glass. Variations include using half measures in a shot glass, using teaspoons of grand marnier to fill a double shot glass. Alternatively, in a rocks glass, stir and strain into ice-filled glass. Kahlua may be replaced with another coffee liqueur, Baileys with another Irish Cream and Grand Marnier with another Curaçao. See also: [[Wikipedia:B-52 shooter|''Wikipedia'']]; Cross, Robert (1996,2003). ''the classic 1000 cocktail recipes''. [http://www.foulsham.com Foulsham]. ISBN 0-572-02852-0.

;B and B
:1 measure (30&amp;nbsp;mL) brandy, 1 measure (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Benedictine. Float the Brandy on top of the Benedictine.

;Baby Guinness
:Tia Maria, topped up with Baileys. The Baileys should be poured into the Tia Maria using the back of a spoon, this slows down the pouring of the Baileys and should allow the Baileys to sit on top of the Tia Maria to look like a baby pint of Guinness.  The glass used to drink this should be a small whiskey glass or a shot/shooter glass. It is very sweet to taste which is why it is very popular among young adults.

;Bailey's Comet
:½ shot (15&amp;nbsp;mL) of Baileys Irish Cream, ½ shot (15&amp;nbsp;mL) of Goldschlager (although any thin flammable cinnamon except Hot Damn will do), splash of flammable alcohol (Bacardi 151 works well), pinch of cinnamon. Fill shot glass half way with Baileys Irish Cream. Layer on top half shot of Goldschlager. Add splash of flammable alcohol. Dim the lights, and ignite. Sprinkling cinnamon into the flame will cause sparks to appear in an otherwise dim blue flame.

;Banana Banshee
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) cream, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) banana liqueur and 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) cacao liqueur (white). Pour into an ice filled shaker. Shake and pour into a cocktail glass. Add a garnish of nutmeg powder. The drink is reputed to have been invented by Nick Castrogiovanni of Nick's Big Train Bar in New Orleans.

;Banana Daiquiri
:2 measures (60&amp;nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 measure banana liqueur (Pisang Ambon), 1 measure (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice, half a banana, crushed ice. Mix the rum, banana liqueur, lime juice, the banana and the ice in a blender. Strain into a cocktail glass.

;Bandera
:1 shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of silver tequila, 1 shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of sangrita, 1 shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of lemon juice, salt on a small dish. There is no method to mix this drink.  You should drink, one at a time, the shot of tequila, sangrita and lemon juice.  Salt is used for lowering the 'boom' of the tequila. Named after the Mexican flag.

;Bandito
:1 part Kahlúa, 3 parts ginger ale, ice. Pour Kahlúa into glass with ice. Top off with ginger ale. Tastes sweet.

;Bastille Bomb
:1 part blue curaçao, 1 part Cointreau, 1 part grenadine. The Bastille Bomb is a layered shot. First add the grenadine (the most dense of the liquids), then the curaçao, then the Cointreau (the least dense).

;Beautiful
:1 oz Hennessy® cognac, 1 oz Grand Marnier® orange liqueur.  Pour each ingredient into a brandy snifter and serve.[http://www.mixeddrinksonline.com/cocktails/539.html]

;Bee's Kiss
:2 parts light rum, 1 part honey, 1 part sour cream, crushed ice. Put the ice, rum, honey and sour cream in a blender. Blend until the mixture is smooth. Strain into a cocktail glass. Serve the cocktail without garnish.

;Belfast Bomber
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Baileys, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) cognac, fill with ice. Build over ice drink with a straw

;Bellbird
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) gold rum, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Razzmatazz (crème de cassis and chambord are acceptable substitutions), ¾ fill with cranberry juice, ¼ fill with pineapple juice. Build drink in an iced hurricane glass, roll into shaker for a few shakes, pour back into glass, garnish with a squeeze of lime and serve.

;Bellini
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) white peach purée, 5 oz (150&amp;nbsp;mL) prosecco sparkling wine. Pour peach purée then prosecco into a mixing glass filled with ice. Gently roll the shaker end over end to mix the ingredients. Do not shake as shaking will make the prosecco flat and could cause the mixing glass to explode. Strain into a champagne glass and serve. Bartender Giusepi Cipriani invented this cocktail at Harry's Bar, Venice in 1948. The drink was named after the 15th century Italian painter, Giovanni Bellini. It is reported that the pink glow of one of Bellini's painting is the inspiration to this cocktail. Originally this cocktail would only be made for four months of the year when the white peaches were in season. This was the case until Giusepi's son Arrigo began using a flash frozen peach purée. With the opening of Harry's Bar in New York City, the Bellini has been embraced throughout the western hemisphere.

;Between The Sheets
:½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) brandy, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) rum, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) triple sec, 1&amp;nbsp;oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lemon juice.

;Bitch Slammer (also B Slammer)
:1 part vodka, 3 parts sparkling wine. Mix directly in the sparkling wine bottle. Serve chilled in long champagne glasses

;[[Bartending/Cocktails/B-Juice|B-Juice]]
:A vodka based cocktail from Peachtree City, Georgia

;Black Cow
:Root beer, vanilla ice cream. Pour root beer into a (preferably chilled) glass or mug.  Top with one scoop of vanilla ice cream.

;Black Devil
:1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) tequila, 12 oz (350&amp;nbsp;mL) Coke, squeeze of lime. Build over ice in a glass.

;Black Dick
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) creme de banane, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Kahlúa. Also known as Black Banana.

;Black Forest
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) creme de cacao, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) cherry liqueur, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Kirschwasser, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) cream. Shake all ingredients together and pour into a Collins glass. Add a little more cream as a floater, then add a cherry.

;Black Martini
:⅔ oz (20&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, ⅓ oz (10&amp;nbsp;mL) black sambuca. Pour ingredients over ice. Shake gently. Strain into cocktail glass. Another cocktail called Black Martini is as follows: 4 ½ oz (130&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka (Absolut), 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) chambord raspberry liqueur, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) blue curacao, ice. Combine in shaker. Shake vigorously. Strain into cocktail glass.

;Black Russian
:2 parts vodka, 1 part kahlua, 1 part Coke (optional). Mix ingredients, stir and add ice.

;[[../Black and Tan/]]
:Stout beer (such as Guinness) and another, lighter beer (such as an ale or lager). A common technique is to fill the glass half full of the light beer, and then carefully pour the dark beer in, over an upside-down spoon, so that the two don't mix.

;[[../Black Velvet/]]
:6 oz (180&amp;nbsp;mL) cold Guinness, 6 oz (180&amp;nbsp;mL) cold dry champagne or other dry sparkling wine. A black velvet is made by filling a tall flute glass halfway full of chilled stout and floating the sparkling wine on top of the stout, with the differing densities of the liquids allowing them to remain largely in separate layers (as in a pousse-café). The effect is best achieved if it is poured over a spoon turned upside down over the top of the glass so that the liquid runs gently down the sides rather than splashing into the lower layer and mixing with it. A &quot;champagne in mourning&quot; mixture created in 1861 to commemorate German-born Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort, who died of typhoid fever at age 42. Black Velvet is also known as Bismark and Champagne Velvet. According to ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', the black velvet was the favorite drink of Otto von Bismarck, who supposedly drank it by the gallon. In Germany, the cocktail often goes by his name. A common variation is the '''poor man's black velvet''', prepared with a cider or perry bottom layer.

;Blacksmith
:1 part brandy, 1 part drambuie, 1 part Kahlúa

;Blaster Bates
:''Blaster Bates'' is a type of alcoholic fruit drink, believed to be first founded in Cheshire, England and named after local personality Blaster Bates. It is made with {{vodka|2}}, 4 oz. Orange Juice, 2 oz. Milk, 1 Banana, ¼ cup Blueberries, ¼ cup Raspberries. The ingredients are mixed in a blender for 30 seconds, then served into a Collins glass.

;Blaster Shooter (Jägerbomber)
:½ a can of Red Bull or other &quot;energy drink&quot;. 1 shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of Sprite, 7-Up or other lemon-lime soda, mixed with the Red Bull, 1 shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of Jägermeister or other liqueur, poured into a shot glass. The Blaster is taken by dropping the shot of Jägermeister into a Collins glass and drinking like a shot. The drink is popular because it causes intoxication and also allegedly lets the drinker become more alert.

;Bleeding Brain (Brain Haemorrhage)
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) peach schnapps, ¼ oz (7&amp;nbsp;mL) Baileys, dash of grenadine. Pour schnapps into a shot glass. Float Baileys over the back of a spoon. Pour a little grenadine through the Baileys until it falls into the schnapps.

;Bloody Caesar
:1oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Vodka. Celery salt the rim of the glass. Dash Worcestershire sauce, dash Tabasco, Clamato Juice
:Serve in a highball, garnish Lemon/Lime, Salt/Pepper and a celery stick. (Only Available in Canada)

;Bloody Mary
:1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, 3 oz (90&amp;nbsp;mL) tomato juice, ½ ounce (15&amp;nbsp;mL) lemon juice, 7 drops Worcestershire sauce, 3 drops Tabasco sauce, 1 pinch freshly ground pepper, 1 pinch of celery salt, ¼ teaspoon (1&amp;nbsp;cm³) freshly grated horseradish. Shake with ice. Strain into an old-fashioned glass filled with ice. Garnish with pickled asparagus sprig or slice of celery.

;Blue Hawaiian
:1 part light rum, 1 part blue curacao, 2 parts pineapple juice, 1 part cream of coconut, 1 cup (250&amp;nbsp;mL) ice, 1 cocktail cherry, 1 piece of pineapple. Shake the rum, the blue curacao, the pineapple juice and the cream of coconut with the ice. Strain into a highball glass and garnish with a cherry and a piece of pineapple.

;Blue Lagoon
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Malibu rum, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) blue curaçao, 7 oz (200&amp;nbsp;mL) lemonade. Optionally, sugar the glass rim. Shake vodka and rum with crushed ice poured into the glass. Add lemonade, then pour blue curacao down the inside of the glass for effect. Many bars will use one shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of blue curaçao, throw in some lemon bar mix, and call it a Blue Lagoon. Supposedly created in the 1960's by Andy MacElhone (son of Harry, of Harry's Bar in Paris ).[http://www.thedrinkshop.com/cocktails/detail.php?cocktail_id=65]

;Blue Blazer
:1 part boiling water, 1 part whisky, 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) powdered sugar or honey, lemon peel garnish (optional). The whisky, ignited, is poured from one mug into the mug of boiling water, back and forth until the blue flame goes out (4-6 times). It is then poured into the serving mug or Irish Coffee mug containing the honey or sugar and lemon peel. It was created by Jerry Thomas, a bartender and author, while working at the El Dorado in San Francisco.  Reportedly while making the drink, US President Ulysses S Grant was so impressed that he gave Thomas a cigar. Thomas would only make the drink if the outside temperature was 10&amp;nbsp;°C or below or if the person ordering the drink had a cold or the flu, whose symptoms the drink was to alleviate. [http://www.cocktail.com/recipes/b/BlueBlazer1940.htm] [http://cocktails.about.com/od/coffeehotcocktails/r/blueblazer.htm]

;[[../Blue Hawaiian/]]

;Blue Whale
:1 part frozen lemonade, one part blue curaçao, two parts vodka. Pour frozen lemonade into a pitcher. Add curacao and vodka. Celebrated for its potency and its festive, aqua-blue colour.

;[[../Boilermaker/]]
:1 shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of whiskey (or any other spirit), 1 pint (568&amp;nbsp;mL) of beer of your choice. A boiler maker is just a mug of beer and a shot of whiskey. Hold the shot of spirits above pint glass of beer, drop and chug.

;Bourbon County Cowboy
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) bourbon whiskey, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) light cream. In a shaker half-filled with ice cubes, combine the bourbon and cream. Shake well. Strain into a cocktail glass.

;Brandtea
:1 shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of brandy, 1 bag of black tea, sugar and milk (as needed). Prepare tea in a mug and add boiling water. Add milk and sugar as needed. Finally add the shot of brandy and stir. Try using a sweet brandy such as Metaxa.

;Brandy Alexander
1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) cognac, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) creme de cacao, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) double cream. Shake the ingredients thoroughly with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.

;[[../Brandy and Coke/]]

;Brandy Cocktail
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) brandy, ¼ tsp (1&amp;nbsp;cm³) sugar syrup, 2 dashes bitters, 1 twist of lemon peel. Stir all ingredients (except lemon peel) with ice and strain into a cocktail glass. Add the twist of lemon peel and serve.

;Brandy Punch
:1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) brandy or cognac, 0.5 oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) cointreau, 2 dashes angustura bitters.

;Brass Monkey
:Equal parts vodka, rum and orange juice. It is thus essentially a screwdriver with rum added. Pulp-free orange juice is usually desirable for reasons of palatability, though freshly squeezed juice may also yield a good brass monkey. Dark rum is also preferable, since it is the mixing of the brown rum with the orange juice that produces the distinct brass-like coloration for which this drink is named. Much of this drink's notoriety comes from the Beastie Boys' song: &quot;Monkey tastes Def when you pour it on ice. Come on y'all it's time to get nice&quot;. An alternative cocktail, often attributed to the Beastie Boys track, is essentially a variation on a mimosa.  It consists of three parts malt liquor and one part Sunny Delight.  Typically Olde English 800 or St Ides is used, and always in the forty-ounce bottle. The first quarter to third of the bottle is consumed, and then topped off with Sunny D, capped, inverted, and guzzled.

;Brave Bull
:1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) tequila, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Kahlúa. Build over ice in a rocks glass. [http://www.tequila-stuff.com/drinks/how-to-make-a-brave-bull.asp]

;[[../Bronx Cocktail|Bronx Cocktail]]
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) vermouth, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, juice of ¼ orange, 1 slice orange. Shake all ingredients (except orange slice) with ice and strain into a cocktail glass. Add the orange slice and serve. For a dry Bronx cocktail, use dry vermouth; for a Bronx golden cocktail, use half dry and half sweet, and add an egg yolk. The Bronx was supposedly invented by Johnnie Solon of the Waldorf-Astoria bar in Manhattan. 

;Buck's Fizz
:Orange juice, chilled Brut champagne, dash of grenadine. Fill a champagne glass ⅓ full of orange juice. Top with champagne and a dash of grenadine. The drink is named after London's Buck's Club where it was first served in 1921. The Buck's Fizz is the English version of the French mimosa and predates the mimosa by 3 years. Both drinks are usually served at breakfast or brunch. Although the recipe given here, with grenadine, may be the original usage, most British people will understand 'Buck's Fizz' to refer to a mixture of orange juice and champagne; i.e. it is the usual British term for what Americans would call a 'Mimosa'. Sometimes, where real Champagne is not available or cannot be afforded, a white wine is used in its place.

;Bullfrog
:12 shots vodka, 1 qt lemonade.  Shake well in a closed container, pour into an open container and stir well.[http://www.mixeddrinksonline.com/cocktails/834.html]

;Bull's Milk
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) light rum, 1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) brandy, 1 cup (240&amp;nbsp;mL) milk.

;Bullshot (also known as Crunk Juice)
:1 part vodka, 2 parts Red Bull. Pour Red Bull into vodka. Add ice (optional). Serve chilled.

;Burnt Fuselage
:1 part triple sec, 1 part cognac, and 1 part dry vermouth served over ice and garnished with lemon.

;Buttery Nipple
1 part butterscotch, 1 part Irish cream. Layer.

;Buzzed Aldrin
:The cocktail of the astronauts:  1 part Tang, 1 part vodka

==C==

;Caffè Corretto (Espresso Corretto)
:1 part grappa (or brandy), 2 parts espresso. A shot of espresso coffee &quot;corrected&quot; with a shot, usually grappa or brandy. It is widely consumed in Italy and usually taken after lunch or dinner

;[[../Caipirinha/]]
:One lime (tip: get rid of white centre), 1-2 tsp (5-10 mL) sugar (to taste), cachaça (to fill glass containing lime, sugar, and ice). Cut the lime in four pieces and crush with sugar using a wooden pestle in a whiskey tumbler or similar glass. Add cachaça, stir, and finally add crushed or grained ice, or ice in cubes. The finer the ice, the faster it cools, but also dilutes the mixture. The amount of cachaça can vary from one to two doses, depending on the size of the glass. Although not an original procedure, water may be added to dilute, but it is normally not necessary as the ice will melt. Shake vigorously. Caipirinha is a traditional Brazilian drink. If you don't have cachaça on hand, replace with a good quality clear rum (in this case, the drink is called a &quot;caipiríssima&quot;), or vodka can also be used (&quot;caipiroska&quot;). In Europe, it is fashionable to use brown sugar instead of white, giving the drink a mossy colour and an earthy, warmer feel to it. Some bartenders use simple syrup in order to minimise the mixing needed and crunchiness of sugar crystals. Some people also replace the ice cubes with chopped ice, but this causes it to melt more quickly, watering down the drink. Some health-conscious Brazilians will drink it with a sugar substitute such as aspartame. A &quot;caipifruta&quot; is prepared in the same way, replacing or complementing the lime with any other fruit (always fresh, never juices). Popular fruits include passion fruit, kiwi, lemon, pineapple and strawberry. A caipirinha should be drunk quickly, as the essential oils of the lime peel, set free while pounding the lime halves, will give an unpleasant, bitter taste

;Caipiroska
:See for Caipirinha. Cachaça is substituted by vodka.

;Caipirísima
:See for Caipirinha. Cachaça is substituted by rum.

;Careless Memory
:1 part whisky, 1 part Bacardi, 1 part dark rum, 1 part Malibu poured over ice and mixed with Coca-Cola. If the Coca-Cola is flat (as is preferable for this particular drink) the mixture is shaken before serving. The sweetness of the rums and cola combine with the coconut of the Malibu to mask the drink's true alcoholic content. Drinking two is recommended only for those with strong stomachs or a strong desire for amnesia. It is named after a song by pop group Duran Duran and has been likened to Douglas Adams's fictional drink called the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster|Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster]].

;Caribbean Sling
:1 part Gin, 1 part Rum, dash of Cointreau or Triple Sec, big squeeze of lime, big squeeze of lemon. Pour over ice in a high ball glass. Top off with club soda and garnish with marachino cherry. Created by David Ruisard in Houston in 2006. Very light but still fairly complex. Great for hot summer days. A big improvement over the syrup induced Singapore Sling.

;Carlo Sud
:½ oz Benedictine, 2 oz amber rum, 1 to 2 dashes Angostura bitters. Combine all ingredients in a shaker half-filled with ice and stir until well chilled. Strain into a cocktail glass. Run lemon twist around rim and drop into drink.

;Cast Iron Chowder
:Place a rusty nail in a double shot glass of cheap Vodka (Kamchatka or Taaka is ideal).  Remove the nail and add the Vodka to a cup of orange soda (e.g. Fanta or Sunkist)and garnish with a lime wedge.  Reputed to be a favorite drink of Mick Jagger.

:1½ parts vodka, 1 part triple sec, 1 part cranberry juice, dash of lime. Shake with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass. The Cosmopolitan was first created by Cheryl Cook in South Beach, Miami in either 1985 or 1986. Toby Cecchini is credited with changing the rose's lime cordial to fresh lime juice and standardising the triple sec as Cointreau. Common recipes include: (1) (Dale DeGroff) 1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) citron vodka, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Cointreau, ¼ oz (7&amp;nbsp;mL) fresh lime juice, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) cranberry juice.

Fill the glass with ice. Add rum. Fill with Coca-Cola. Drop in the lime squeeze. ''Jones' Bar Guide'' omits the gin and bitters, but they are said by some to greatly improve the quality of the drink. The Cuba Libre (&quot;Freedom for Cuba&quot;) was invented in Havana, Cuba around 1900. Patriots aiding Cuba during the Spanish-American War and, later, expatriates avoiding Prohibition, regularly mixed rum and Coca-Cola as a cocktail and a toast to this West Indies island. See also: [[Wikipedia:Cuba Libre|''Wikipedia'']].

;Cucaracha
:1 part Kahlúa, 1 part tequila. Pour the Kahlúa, then slowly pour in the tequila so that two distinct layers are form.  Some mixing in the middle is fine (and even desirable) but at the top it should be all tequila. Light the tequila with a lighter, and allow the blue flame to burn.  It helps to use the lighter on the side of the glass too, to warm up all of the liquid.  Works best in a tall shot glass. When the flame starts to taper off (or when you can't hold yourself back any longer, or when you think it's good and hot) suck up all of it through a straw as quickly as possible.

;[[Bartending/Cocktails/Daquiri|Daiquiri]]
:This refers to a family of cocktails. Daiquirí Natural is the basic mix, that serves as the starting point to the more complex cocktails of the family: 1.3 oz (40&amp;nbsp;mL) light-dry rum, 0.7 oz (20&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 teaspoon (5&amp;nbsp;mL) sugar, crushed ice. Mix the ingredients in a shaker and serve. Daiquiri Floridita is the most common and famous version of this cocktail, allegedly it was invented by Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, barman and owner of the Floridita in the 1950s, whom Ernest Hemingway nicknamed El grande Constante. This recipe is also known as Daiquirí Frappé:  1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) light-dry rum, the juice of 1 lime, 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) sugar, crushed ice, 10 drops of maraschino liqueur. Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the ice is finely crushed and serve iced. Strawberry Daiquiri: ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) strawberry schnapps, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) powdered sugar, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) strawberries, crushed ice. Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the ice is finely crushed and serve iced. Other versions: Papa's is the version of the cocktail that Hemingway allegedly preferred (Papa is the nickname that fishermen gave Hemingway in Cuba), is identical to the Floridita Daiquiri, it only substitutes lime juice with grapefruit juice. It is said that Hemingway drank this cocktail with no sugar and doubled the rum. Mulata is the same cocktail as the Floridita Daiquiri, but instead of light-dry rum (which is colourless) it requires aged rum, which gives the cocktail an amber colour. Other versions, which did not originate in the Floridita, are also common in bars worldwide, such as Banana daiquiri and Strawberry daiquiri.

;Danis
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) orange juice, 3 oz (90&amp;nbsp;mL) grapefruit soda or ''Squirt''. Mix vodka and orange juice, add ice, add soda.

:
A '''Dirty Vimto''' (also known as a '''dirty pint''') is an alcoholic cocktail drink popularised in 2004 which replicates the fruit extract drink [[Vimto]] with the use of [[beer]], alcopop and [[port wine]]. To a pint sized (568 mL) glass is added large (50 mL) port (usually Cockburns). The glass is filled to half way with [[Stella Artois]] and filled with WKD Blue. This unusual combination has a flavour reputed to be both delicious and remarkably similar to that of Vimto.

&quot;Atomic Vimto&quot; is made by putting half a pint (284&amp;nbsp;mL) of Stella Artois into a Pint (568&amp;nbsp;mL) glass, and adding 50&amp;nbsp;mL of Port. A shot (25&amp;nbsp;mL) of scotch is added, and topped with WKD Blue. The other option is to double the scotch, use 75&amp;nbsp;mL of port and fill the rest with WKD Blue. Other names include Cheeky Vimto.

Eggnog is a type of milk-based punch belonging to the [[Cookbook:Posset|posset]] family of drinks. It originates in Europe and its name may have originated from ''grog'' or from a small drinking cup known as a ''noggin''.  Eggnog typically consists of milk, eggs and sugar mixed together and may be served with or without added spirits. Other ingredients include spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander or allspice. Eggnog is typically served as a winter drink. Although rarely as good as &quot;homemade&quot; recipes, ready-made eggnog containing alcohol and &quot;just-add-alcohol&quot; versions are available for purchase in a variety of stores. It is sometimes added as a flavouring to food or other drinks.

* 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lemon juice (or other citrus juice)
In a shaker half-filled with ice cubes, combine gin, lemon juice and sugar. Shake well. Strain into a sour glass and garnish with the orange slice. The Gin Sour is a traditional mixed cocktail from the US which antedates Prohibition. In an 1898 book by Finley Dunne, Mr Dooley includes it in a list of great American inventions:{{ref|barzun}}
:I have seen America spread out fr'm th' Atlantic to th' Pacific... An' th' invintions,&amp;mdash;th' steam-injine an' th' printin-press an th' cotton gin an' the gin sour an' th' bicycle an' th' flying machine an' th' nickel-in-th'-slot machine an' th' Croker machine an' th' sody fountain an'&amp;mdash;crownin' wur-ruk iv our civilization&amp;mdash;th' cash raygister.

Popular during the 1940s, Kevin Starr includes it in &quot;an array of drinks (the gin sour, the whiskey sour, the gin rickey, the Tom Collins, the pink lady, the old fashioned) that now seem period pieces, evocative of another era.&quot;{{ref|starr}}

A 1917 recipe is as follows: GIN SOUR—Country Club Style{{ref|1917}} Use a large Mixing glass. Fill with Lump Ice. ½ lime juice, ½ orange juice, 2 dashes pineapple juice, ½ pony rock candy syrup, 1 jigger Burnette's Old Tom Gin. Shake well, strain into cocktail glass and serve.

=== [[../Gin and Tonic|Gin and Tonic]] ===
* 1 jigger (45&amp;nbsp;mL) gin
* tonic water to fill
* 1 lime wedge
Build as a highball. An origin legend tells that the traditional gin and tonic came about when British colonists in India, drinking a far more bitter anti-malarial tonic, mixed gin with the medicine to make it palatable. Whether or not the story is true, the tonic water used as a present-day mixer contains only a fraction of the quinine, and is sweetened. Reference: ''The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course'', Third Edition ISBN 0-312-25286-2.

=== Gin And Juice ===
* 1 part gin
* 1 part grapefruit juice
* 1.5 parts orange juice
Pour all ingredients into a shaker, shake well and pour into a highball glass filled with ice. Garnish with a slice of lime. The drink is notable for sharing a name with the 1993 Snoop Dogg song ''Gin and Juice''.

=== Glögg ===
The following is a very classic variation of Glögg:
* 1 bottle (750&amp;nbsp;mL) of red wine
* 150&amp;nbsp;mL (5 oz) of vodka
* 7 pcs of cinnamon
* 20 cloves
* ginger
* cardamom
* 200&amp;nbsp;mL (7 fl oz) of sugar
* 1 tbsp (15&amp;nbsp;mL) of vanilla sugar

Avoid using cardamom powder or cinnamon powder. Mix together the spices and pour in the vodka. Let the mixture soak for at least a day. Separate the spices from the vodka, and pour in the wine. Heat the mixture, but do not let it boil. Serve warm with raisins and almonds. Glögg is the Scandinavian version of vin chaud or mulled wine. The main ingredients are (usually red) wine, spices such as cinnamon and cloves, and optionally also stronger spirits such as vodka or even Cognac. The mixture is prepared by heating, but it is not allowed to boil in order for the alcohol not to evaporate. Glögg is generally served with raisins and almonds, and is a popular warm drink during the Christmas season. In Denmark glögg is traditionally served during the Christmas season with ''æbleskiver'' (apple dumplings) sprinkled with powdered sugar and accompanied with strawberry marmalade. Glögg recipes vary widely, and variations with sweet wines such as Madeira or spirits such as Cognac or Armagnac are also very popular. Try brandy instead of vodka for robustness. Glögg can also be made alcohol-free by using juices or by boiling the Glögg for a few minutes to evaporate the alcohol.[http://www.gretchencooks.com/recipes/582_Glogg][http://www.ling.su.se/staff/evali/glogg.htm]

Variations include using cream or vodka.

=== Green Cow ===
* 1 part Pisang Ambon liqueur
* 1 part milk
The Pisang Ambon liqueur that is used to make a green cow is green banana flavoured liqueur.  It is a sweet, bright green herb.  The name for this liqueur comes from an Indonesian Island, Ambon and Pisang means banana. This is a type of drink that is better well blended and frozen.  Serving it cold helps keeps the taste and makes the flavour last longer than served warm. It also helps keep the milk in it cold. There are many varying recipes for this drink.  For each person that tries it they develop their own taste and way of making it.  

=== Green Cow (Alternative recipe) ===
* 40&amp;nbsp;mL Absolut vodka
* 30&amp;nbsp;mL Pisang Ambon liqueur
* 20&amp;nbsp;mL milk
* fill with Sprite soda
Then mix everything and serve. Here the Absolut vodka comes from Sweden and is produced from distilled winter wheat.  One can taste a bit of dried fruit in in, when it is drank straight. It can also come in other flavours, such as Absolut Peppar or Absolut Mandarin. The best way to serve it is in a Collins cup.

;Hangman's  Blood
:This is a drink first described by Richard Hughes in his 1929 novel, ''A High Wind in Jamaica''.  According to Hughes, 
:Hangman's blood ... is compounded of rum, gin, brandy, and porter ... Innocent (merely beery) as it looks, refreshing as it tastes, it has the property of increasing rather than allaying thirst, and so once it has made a breach, soon demolishes the whole fort &lt;ref&gt;Richard Hughes, 1929 ''A High Wind in Jamaica'' page 77&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1960s novelist Anthony Burgess described its preparation as follows:
:Into a pint glass [568&amp;nbsp;mL], doubles [i.e. 50&amp;nbsp;mL measures] of the following are poured: gin, whisky, rum, port and brandy. A small bottle of stout is added and the whole topped up with champagne....It tastes very smooth, induces a somewhat metaphysical elation, and rarely leaves a hangover.

;Hanky-Panky
:1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, 1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) sweet vermouth, 2 dashes Fernet Branca. Pour all the ingredients into a Martini glass half full of ice cubes. Stir well to combine and chill. Strain into a chilled Martini glass. The Hanky-Panky cocktail was the brainchild of Ada Coleman. Her benefactor, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, a member of the D'Oyly Carte family that first produced Gilbert and Sullivan operas in London, and the family that built the Savoy Hotel. When Rupert became chairman of the Savoy in 1903, Ada was given a position at the hotel's American Bar, where she eventually became the head bartender and made cocktails for the likes of Mark Twain, the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden and Sir Charles Hawtrey. Charles Hawtrey was the man for whom &quot;Coley&quot;, as Ada Coleman was affectionately called, created the Hanky-Panky cocktail. He was an Victorian and Edwardian actor who mentored Noel Coward. Coley herself told the story behind the creation of the Hanky-Panky to England's The People newspaper in 1925: 

&quot;The late Charles Hawtrey ... was one of the best judges of cocktails that I knew. Some years ago, when he was overworking, he used to come into the bar and say, 'Coley, I am tired. Give me something with a bit of punch in it.' It was for him that I spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said, 'By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!' And Hanky-Panky it has been called ever since.&quot;

The Hanky-Panky is a variation on the sweet Martini, inasmuch as it calls for gin and sweet vermouth, but Coley's secret ingredient was Fernet Branca, a bitter Italian digestivo. By adding just a couple of dashes of this herbal elixir, she transformed the drink into a masterpiece. [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/371992/104-1140161-1419917]

;Harvey Wallbanger
:Ice cubes, 2 measures (60&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka,  2/3 measure (20&amp;nbsp;mL) Galliano, 5 measures (150&amp;nbsp;mL) orange juice, 1 slice of orange. Half-fill the shaker with ice cubes. Add the vodka and orange juice, and shake well. Strain into an ice-filled highball glass. Gently float the Galliano on top, and garnish with the orange slice. This well known tipple was one of many cocktails invented by renowned, (and two times world champion) mixologist Donato 'Duke' Antone (other notable 'Duke' creations are the Rusty Nail, The Godfather and the Flaming Caesar). This is one of many cocktails invented by 'Duke' in Los Angeles during the 1950's. According to legend, Harvey was actually a Californian surfer. After losing an important contest, he consoled himself in Duke's Blackwatch bar with one of his 'special' screwdriver cocktails, (a screwdriver with a dash of Galliano liqueur). After several drinks, he tried to leave the bar, but unfortunately kept bumping into the furniture and walls. Harvey 'the Wallbanger' became his nickname and the famous drink was named. In 2005, the American-based Food Network listed the Harvey Wallbanger cocktail as number four in its list of the top five fad foods of the 1970s.

;Henry Morgan's Grog
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) dark rum, 1 cube sugar, 3 cloves, 1 tbsp (15&amp;nbsp;mL) lemon or lime or orange juice, slice of lemon, boiling water. Place all ingredients except boiling water in an 8 oz (240&amp;nbsp;mL) mug. Stir till sugar is dissolved. Leave the spoon in the mug and pour in boiling water to fill and stir.

;Hi-Fi
:Brazilian cocktail, made popular in the 1960's, consisting of orange soda and vodka. It is quite similar to the Screwdriver, causing some confusion on its country of origin. The original recipe used a brand of soda called Crush, which is not manufactured any more, being replaced with orange Fanta.

;Horse's Neck
:A highball made with whiskey (usually rye or bourbon) and ginger ale, with a long spiral of lemon peel draped over the edge of the glass.

;[[../Hot Buttered Rum/]]
:1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) rum, 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) sugar, freshly boiled water, butter, nutmeg. Pour rum into a cup. Stir in sugar. Top up with water. Add a knob of butter and sprinkle with nutmeg. ''The Joy of Cooking'' describes this drink as one that &quot;makes you see double and feel single&quot;. Replacing the boiling water with hot cider makes a &quot;Stonewall&quot;.

;Hot Totty
:Add one shot of Jack Daniels to an 8 oz (240&amp;nbsp;mL) glass of tea (amount of tea can be raised or lowered to taste). It can be served hot or over ice.

;Hunter Thompson
:Fill a highball glass with ice cubes and then pour Wild Turkey 101 to the rim.  Favorite drink of author Hunter S. Thompson

==I==

;Invisible Man
:2 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) brandy, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) triple sec (optional), 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) orange juice, 3 oz (90&amp;nbsp;mL) ginger ale.  Add ingredients to a highball glass with ice.  Fresh squeezed orange juice is recommended for best flavor.

;[[../Irish Car Bomb/]]
:First pour a shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of an Irish Whiskey such as Jameson or Tullamore Dew into a glass, and add about a pint (568&amp;nbsp;mL) of Irish beer such as Guinness or Murphy's. Drop a shot (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of Irish Cream such as Bailey's (including the shot glass) into the glass of beer. Immediately drink the mix. The Guinness beer and Irish Cream Liqueur will curdle together as soon as they make contact.  The Irish Carbomb should be completely drunk before the drink has completely curdled.  If done correctly, an Irish Carbomb should taste chocolatey.

;[[../Irish Coffee/]]
:Strong black coffee, brown sugar, whiskey, very lightly whipped cream. Put a metal spoon in a wine glass and pour in the hot coffee. Leave about 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm space above the coffee. The spoon helps to prevent the glass cracking. Mix two teaspoons (10&amp;nbsp;mL) of sugar and the whiskey into the coffee, and remove the spoon. The amount of sugar can be suited to the drinker. Also, the more sugar in the coffee, the easier the final step is. Hold a tablespoon upside down over the glass, and slowly pour the cream over the back of the spoon onto the surface of the coffee mixture. It should float.

;Irish Rootbeer Float
:In a chilled glass mug: 1 part rootbeer (preferably a frothy, flavourful variety), 1 part Bailey's Irish Cream, 1 part vodka. The Irish rootbeer float is a relatively new invention, finding its origins in the Southwestern region of Pennsylvania. It is a creamy, sweet beverage that utilises the mild neutral flavour of vodka to excellent effect, having a deceptively high alcohol content. The mix itself is very simple and versatile. Many feel that an Irish rootbeer float can act as a better introduction to spirits than beer, which is a far more common introduction to alcoholic beverages. The recipe is not written in stone, and the ratio may be adjusted to taste without compromising the overall flavour of the beverage. The Even-more Irish Rootbeer Float is a  variation in which some, or all of the vodka is substituted with whiskey. Whilst a minor variation, it does result in a definitively different drink. The flavour is richer and more caustic and far less conducive to first-time drinkers. It does stay truer to its namesake, however. It comprises: 1 part rootbeer, 1 part Bailey's Irish Cream, 1 part whiskey (or a mixture of some part whiskey, some part vodka).

;Irish Trash Can
:Served in chilled bar glass or mug: Fill the glass ½ to ¾ full of ice. Add 1 straw.
Add 1 shot of each of the following clear wells. Vodka, Rum, Gin, Tequila ,&amp; Triple Sec.
Next drizzle in 1 shot of Blue Curaçao, covering all of the ice cubes.
Now dump one 8 oz can Red Bull energy drink upside down into the glass, allowing it to float.
Drink through the straw, and as you desire, lift the can of Red Bull to replenish the drink.

==J==
;Jade
:Cut a lime into 16 chunks and muddle well in a cocktail shaker. Fill the shaker halfway with ice. Add 3 oz. each simple syrup and vodka. Shake until very cold and serve straight up in a chilled martini glass. Garnish with a wedge of lime.

;Jager Bomb
:4 oz (120&amp;nbsp;mL) energy drink (usually Red Bull) 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of Jägermeister
take a glass filled with 4-6 oz (120-180&amp;nbsp;mL) of energy drink drop Jägermeister into glass and take quickly.

;Jäger Colada
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) Jägermeister, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) coconut milk, 4 oz (120&amp;nbsp;mL) pineapple juice, crushed ice. Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker. Shake well. Strain and serve with a pineapple garnish.

;[[Bartending/Cocktails/Jarabacoa Cocktail|Jarabacoa]]
:
A Jarabacoa is a cocktail made with spiced rum, honey, lime juice, vanilla, cinnamon, and cola. Jarabacoas are usually served in a cocktail glass or lowball.

;Jello Shot
:Jello Shots are made from flavoured gelatin dessert mix and distilled alcohol. The most commonly used liquors are rum and vodka, but almost any type is suitable. A jello shot is usually made in shot glasses, disposable paper cups, or small 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) plastic condiment containers. These condiment containers can be purchased in bulk, and come with lids to prevent alcohol evaporation. A jello shot is made just like regular gelatin desserts. Half of the total water required by the recipe is boiled, and then the mix is dissolved into the water. The remaining half of the water is replaced with liquor. Storing the alcohol in the freezer overnight helps chill and set the jello shots quicker. They take at least a couple of hours to set. [[w:Tom_Lehrer|Tom Lehrer]] claimed to have invented jello shots during his time with the Army, in the 1950's, as a way of circumventing the Military post's liquor restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;http://www.sfweekly.com/2000-04-19/news/that-was-the-wit-that-was/&quot;, Jack Boulware, San Francisco Weekly, April 19, 2000. Retrieved February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest published recipe dates from 1862, and is found in [http://books.google.com/books?id=QDUEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA22,M1 ''How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon Vivant's Companion''] by [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]]: the recipe calls for gelatin, cognac, rum, and lemon juice.&lt;ref&gt;''The Joy of Mixology'' by Gary Regan. Clarkson Potter, 2003. Pages 15-16, 150.&lt;/ref&gt;


;Jungle Breeze
:A combination of raspberry vodka and lemon lime soda.  The vodka-soda proportion is left to the discretion of the individual, but the drink should have a smooth lemon lime taste with a sweet hint of raspberry.

==K==

;Kalisto Comet
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) Baileys, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) coconut oil, 2 grams of crushed mint or peppermint, plenty of ice to top up glass. The Kalisto comet is a unique blend of vodka and Baileys drink, a slight variation is to use Tia lusso as oppose to Baileys as many find the combination of vodka and Baileys to be quite an acquired taste and can be sickly in taste for those not into Baileys too much. The ingredients of the cocktail are selected to make the drink smooth and easy on the senses with the vodka being the most potent ingredient used, the mint used is usually peppermint although an equally preferred alternative can also be spearmint to further add to the smooth taste.

;Kamikaze
:1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) triple sec, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice. Stir all the ingredients with ice. Strain into a chilled tumbler filled with ice. Garnish with a lime twist.

;Kentucky Joe
:2 ½ oz (75&amp;nbsp;mL) Maker's Mark, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Kahlúa. Pour ingredients into rocks glass. Add ice and stir. The choice of Maker's Mark in this recipe is important. Other bourbons do not work well unless they are also Wheaters. The Kentucky Joe is a slightly sweet bourbon cocktail. The bitterness of the coffee flavour offsets the sweetness of the bourbon. This cocktail was created at LeNell's Ltd, a Wine and Spirit Boutique, by Benjamin Peikes and named by owner LeNell Smothers. 

;Kir Royale
:100&amp;nbsp;mL champagne, 20&amp;nbsp;mL creme de cassis. Put creme de cassis in the champagne glass and pour the champagne in the glass. Stir until the colour is pale. Serve cold.

==L==

;Lady Finger
:1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) kirschwasser, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) cherry brandy, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lemon juice, ½ tsp (2.5&amp;nbsp;mL) superfine sugar. Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.

;Lady Killer
:30&amp;nbsp;mL gin, 15&amp;nbsp;mL Cointreau, 15&amp;nbsp;mL apricot brandy, 60&amp;nbsp;mL Maracujanektar, 60&amp;nbsp;mL Ananassaft. This is a classic cocktail created by Peter Roth, a famous barkeeper from the Kronenhalle in Zürich, Switzerland. In 1984, he won the world championship with this drink.

;Latin Manhattan
:2 measures (60&amp;nbsp;mL) each of white rum, sweet vermouth and dry vermouth. Add a splash of maraschino cherry juice and shake in a cocktail shaker and serve &quot;up&quot; (with no ice) in a Martini glass with a twist of lemon peel. When making this drink, avoid the temptation to use more rum. It makes the drink quite bitter. The balance of the three alcohols is the key.

;Lemon Drop
:1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) citrus vodka, ¾ oz (20&amp;nbsp;mL) Cointreau, 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) superfine sugar, ¾ oz (20&amp;nbsp;mL) freshly squeezed lemon juice, lemon wheel for garnish. Pour contents into a ice filled mixing glass and shake vigorously. Strain into a sugar rimmed cocktail glass garnished with a lemon wheel. Serve. Originally created at Henry Africa's Bar, San Francisco. Henry Africa's opened in 1969 and was one of the first establishments to serve cocktails that were developed and marketed specifically to females. Although the bar where it was first formulated is now closed, the Lemon Drop continues and has become a cocktail staple of westerners.

[[../Lights Out/]]

;Liquid Cocaine
:1 part Jägermeister, 1 part Goldschläger. Should be shot as soon as its poured as the 2 liquors take a couple of seconds to mix.

;[[../Liquidex/]]

;Long Island Iced Tea
:½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) tequila, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) triple sec, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) rum, 1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) sweet and sour, splash of Coke. Stir. Garnish with lemon twist. Build ingredients over a Collins glass with ice. Some bartenders give the drink a short shake, but this is optional. Some choose to mix it without tequila.  Some have nicknamed a Long Island with tequila a &quot;Texas Iced Tea&quot;.

;[[Bartending/Cocktails/Lynchburg Lemonade|Lynchburg Lemonade]]

:Named after the home town of Jack Daniels, Lynchburg, Tennessee. A Lynchburg Lemonade is a cocktail made with Jack Daniels, orange liqueur, sour mix, and any lemon-lime soda to fill. It is typically served on the rocks in a Collins glass, and garnished with a lemon or cherry.

;[[../Mai Tai|Mai Tai]]
:The Maitai is a well-known cocktail purportedly invented at the Trader Vic restaurant in Oakland, California in 1944.  Trader Vic's amicable rival, Don the Beachcomber, claimed to have created it first in 1933 at his own newly opened little bar (later a famous restaurant) in Hollywood.  The Beachcomber's recipe is far more complicated than that of the Trader's and tastes quite different. Maitai is the Tahitian word for &quot;good&quot;. The Trader Vic story of its invention is that the Trader (Victor J. Bergeron) created it one afternoon for some friends who were visiting from Tahiti.  One of them tasted it and cried out: &quot;Maitai roa!&quot; (&quot;Very good!&quot;)  Hence the name. The first three of the following Maitai recipes are provided by Trader Vic's to [http://www.kevdo.com/maitai/ The Search for the Ultimate Mai Tai] website.
:Recipe 1: The Original Trader Vic Formula - 1944: 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) of 17-year old J. Wray and Nephew Rum over shaved ice. Add juice from one fresh lime. ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Holland DeKuyper Orange Curaçao, ¼ oz (7.5&amp;nbsp;mL) Trader Vic's Rock Candy Syrup. ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) French Garnier Orgeat Syrup. Shake vigorously. Add a sprig of fresh mint. Recipe 2: &quot;Old Way&quot; Trader Vic Maitai Formula - 1997: 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Fine Jamaican rum (15 or 8 year old), 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Martinique rum (St. James), ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Orange Curaçao, ½ ounce (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Orgeat Syrup, juice from one fresh lime (about ¾ oz[20&amp;nbsp;mL]). Mix and serve as in the original formula. Recipe 3: '''Today's Trader Vic Maitai''' (This recipe is very close to what Trader Vic's restaurants apparently serve.): 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) triple sec, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Orgeat syrup, ½ tsp (2.5&amp;nbsp;mL) grenadine, maraschino cherry, pineapple. Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into an old fashioned glass over crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and serve with a straw. Recipe 4: Don the Beachcomber Maitai: This version is much closer to what Don the Beachcomber served in his restaurants.  It can be garnished with various fruits, as in the above recipe.  Falernum, which is now difficult to obtain in the United States except from a single supplier in Seattle, is a flavored Caribbean syrup with a very different taste from the Orgeat syrup used in the Maitai 1. Ingredients: 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) water, ¾ oz (20&amp;nbsp;mL) fresh lime juice, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) fresh grapefruit juice, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) sugar syrup, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) dark rum, 1½ oz (20&amp;nbsp;mL) golden rum, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Cointreau or triple sec, ¼ oz (7.5&amp;nbsp;mL) Falernum syrup, 2 dashes or scant ½ tsp Angostura bitters, 1 dash or scant ¼ tsp Pernod or other anisette-flavoured pastis. Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into a tall highball glass filled with crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and serve with a straw. Recipe 5: Pineapple Variation Maitai: 4 oz (120&amp;nbsp;mL) orange juice, 4 oz (120&amp;nbsp;mL) pineapple juice, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) dark rum, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) triple sec, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) grenadine.

;Maiden Head
:3 oz (90&amp;nbsp;mL) cherry brandy, 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) cherry 7-up, 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) cherry soda, whipped cream, a cherry. All liquids should be chilled and mixed with a stirring stick. Top the cocktail with whipped cream and a cherry. The name probably comes from fact that cherry, the theme ingredient of this cocktail, and maiden head are both slang terms for the hymen.[http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink5201.html] [http://www.webtender.com/db/drink/3478] [http://www.freedrinkrecipes.com/other-drinks-recipes/maidenhead-drink-recipe.html]

;[[../Manhattan|Manhattan]]
:There are any number of variations to this drink, but two of the more popular recipes are The Original Manhattan and The Perfect Manhattan. Classic Manhattan: 1½ shots (45&amp;nbsp;mL) bourbon (quality counts up to a point. Something like Early Times is quite adequate.)
⅓ shot (10&amp;nbsp;mL) sweet vermouth (quality really counts here and most domestics are out.) 2 shakes of bitters, 1 tbl (15&amp;nbsp;mL) cherry juice. Garnish with Cherry. Serve up in stemware or on the rocks. The Original Manhattan: 1 shot bourbon (30&amp;nbsp;mL), ¼ shot (7.5&amp;nbsp;mL) sweet vermouth, dash bitters. Stir ingredients in a large glass with ice. Strain into chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a maraschino cherry. The Perfect Manhattan: 1 shot bourbon, ¼ shot sweet vermouth, dash bitters, rinse dry vermouth. Stir whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters in a large glass with ice. Rinse chilled cocktail glass with dry vermouth (pour only a little in the glass, swirl it around and pour it out). Strain chilled ingredients into cocktail glass and garnish with a lemon twist. If someone requests it extra dry you could use no vermouth at all.

;Man Juice
:Can be made individually or in bulk, preferably the latter.
'''Bulk-''' dump half to one full bags of ice in large pot or kettle. Pour in one case of [[Natural Ice]] beer, one handle of [[vodka]], and one to one and a half gallon mixers of [[Kool-Aid]] for flavor. Stir and serve.

;[[../Margarita|Margarita]]
:[[Image:Margarita.jpg|thumb|150px|Margarita]]
See [[Bartending/Cocktails/Margarita]] for details. Common Margarita ratios: 50&amp;nbsp;% tequila, 25&amp;nbsp;% Triple Sec, 25&amp;nbsp;% fresh lime juice; 50&amp;nbsp;% tequila, double as much Triple Sec than fresh lime juice; 60&amp;nbsp;% tequila, 20&amp;nbsp;% Triple Sec, 20&amp;nbsp;% fresh lime juice; 33&amp;nbsp;% tequila, 33&amp;nbsp;% Triple Sec, 33&amp;nbsp;% fresh lime juice.

;Maria Teresa
:4 oz (120&amp;nbsp;mL) of orange juice, 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) of orange liqueur (such as Cointreau, triple sec or Grand Marnier), 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of grenadine, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) of lime juice. The preferred way to make a Maria Teresa is to combine all of the ingredients in a shaker, shake with ice, and strain into a sugar-rimmed glass. The Maria Teresa is named after a Grand Duchess of Luxembourg.

;[[../Martini|Martini]]
:1 measure (30&amp;nbsp;mL) dry vermouth, 5 measures (150&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, 2 olives. Pour a small splash of vermouth in the shaker. Add gin to the mix.  Melted ice will bring the liquid content up to 3 oz (90&amp;nbsp;mL) total. Prepare as a stirred cocktail. Mixing a Martini is a trying task, as it is difficult to measure out just enough vermouth. Harvard suggests using a metal shaker and rimming the full edge with the liquid. This means pouring in enough that the liquid coats the bottom of the shaker, but doesn't start to fill it.  A dry Martini can be made by rimming half the shaker, leaving part of the bottom untouched by vermouth; and an extra dry Martini is done by splashing a little vermoth in the shaker, swirling it around, and dumping it back out before adding the gin.

;Maude
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, ginger ale, a splash of grenadine, and a garnish of two maraschino cherries. Served on the rocks. It is named after the character played by Bea Arthur on the 1970s sitcom ''Maude'', and is found mainly in bars catering to gay men.

;Michelada
:Very popular Mexican cocktail.  Preparation differs from state to state. This recipe is in the San Luis Potosí/Cuernavaca style: 355&amp;nbsp;mL beer (any kind will do), 120&amp;nbsp;mL Clamato (Clam-Tomato cocktail; optional, but highly recommended), 1 or 2 lemons, Worcestershire Sauce, maggi juice, Black-Label Valentina Sauce (hard to get for people outside of Mexico), salt, pepper, chilled beer mug, ice. Have a beer mug chilled, then frost it with salt and lemon. Pour in about 25&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;35&amp;nbsp;mL of Valentina Sauce. Squeeze in your lemons. Add some Worcestershire sauce, then the Maggi juice. Now, salt and pepper to taste, then stir. Add your 120&amp;nbsp;mL of Clamato, then keep stirring. Finally, pour in your beer while you keep stirring. Add some ice if you like. There's no secret for mixing the best Michelada, it must suit your taste. If you want to make liter-sized Micheladas, you need to vary proportionally the quantity of ingredients shown in this table.  But then again, it must please you.  It's some sort of acquired taste. You must not replace the Valentina sauce with some other kind of sauce (say, Tabasco). It won't taste the same.

;Mickey Mouse
:More than one drink shares this name, this recipe is from [http://www.webtender.com webtender]. 3 oz (90&amp;nbsp;mL) tomato juice, 1 dash lemon juice, ½ tsp (2.5&amp;nbsp;mL) Worcestershire sauce, 2-3 drops Tabasco sauce, 1 wedge lime, ice cubes.

Place the blueberries and blackberries into a shaker, muddle them well with a pestle, add the vanilla rum and fill the shaker with ice, then shake well (up to 30 times). Afterwards, pour it through a strainer (to filter out the berry skins) into a tall ice filled glass, top it with the club soda, stir and garnish with raspberries. Mint leaves can be added for a more traditional mojito flavor and sugar for extra sweetness.

;Midnight Cowboy

Combine in a glass equal quantities of the following ingredients in this order (double shots are suggested, but other amounts are also usable): Midori, chambord, lime juice (note: not lime cordial as this is not generally bitter enough). The sweet tastes of the Midori and the chambord combine with the bitterness of the lime juice to create a unique drink.

;Mimosa
:6/10 chilled champagne, 4/10 orange juice (Simply Orange or freshly-squeezed is preferred). Pour orange juice into a champagne flute, then add champagne.

Garnish with a whole sprig of mint. Another variation, courtesy of Alton Brown: Muddle ten mint leaves and 1&amp;nbsp;½ teaspoons (7.5&amp;nbsp;mL) of superfine sugar (which can be made by pulsing sugar in a food processor) until you've got a paste.  Add a splash of seltzer water, and mix with the muddled mint. Then fill the glass about ¾ with ice. Add 2 ½ oz (75&amp;nbsp;mL) bourbon, and finish with a splash of seltzer water.  Garnish with mint, and serve.

;[[../Mojito|Mojito]]
:Mojito (pronounced ''mo-HEE-toe'') is a traditional Cuban cocktail which became quite popular in the United States during the late 1890s. For details and variations on the recipe, see ''[[Bartending/Cocktails/Mojito]]''. As an example, this is this is how they prepare Mojitos at &quot;La Bodeguita del Medio&quot;: 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) of sugar, ¼ oz (7.5&amp;nbsp;mL) fresh lime juice, 2 mint sprigs (not a forest!), crush gently, add 1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) white Cuban rum, add ice cubes, add 2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) soda water.

Fill the glass with ice cubes.  Mix everything together and top the glass with soda (club soda).

;Molotov Cocktail
:½ shot (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Vodka (cheap vodka is best, meant to burn going down), ½ shot (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Everclear (151 can be used but it would change the flavour). Fill with vodka.

;Negroni
:1 part gin, 1 part Campari, 1 part sweet vermouth. Shake the ingredients with ice. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a twist of lemon. Common substitutes include vodka for the gin, dry vermouth for the sweet, or a twist of orange instead of lemon. According to the most popular origin story, the Negroni was invented in Florence, Italy in the early 1920s. It was named after Count Camillo Negroni, the man who invented it by asking a bartender to add gin to the Americano, his favourite drink. However, the word Negroni doesn't appear in English cocktail guides before 1947, so the drink's true origins are uncertain. The Negroni is an apéritif, or pre-dinner cocktail, intended to stimulate the drinker's appetite. There is also a variant, popular in Italy, named Negroni ''sbagliato'' where the gin is substituted with spumante brut. A Negroni Malato (&quot;Sick&quot; Negroni) is a Negroni served with orange juice

[[../Nixon/]]

;Nuclear Wessel
:1 part scotch, 3 parts vodka, 1 part Jägermeister. The Wessel is a rather finicky drink to mix- The vodka and the Jägermeister should be chilled, but the scotch warmed.

[[../Octopussy/]]

;[[../Old Fashioned/]]
:A recipe with many variations, almost always featuring bourbon and sugar. Add slice of orange, tsp of sugar (5&amp;nbsp;mL) or simple syrup, maraschino cherry (without stem) and two dashes of Angostura bitters to bottom of an Old Fashioned glass. Fill glass with ice. Add 2&amp;nbsp;oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) bourbon and stir. Serve with stir or short straw. An Old Fashioned glass is similar to a bucket or tumbler. This drink is sometimes ordered as a call. On occasion Southern Comfort, Scotch, or various Rye whiskies may be desired.

;One-Balled Dictator
:1 part good champagne, 5 parts cheap liebfraumilch.  Shake the concoction very violently but for a short duration, then pour into a &quot;rocks&quot; type glass.  Before drinking, add one cinnamon ball, the type found in bags of bulk candy.  You now have a One-Balled Dictator.  A splash of Galliano liqueur added just before shaking will create a Mussolini. One-Balled Dictator is a wine cocktail drunk by World War II veterans. The name is seen by some as a little unorthodox, yet is still seen as a reasonably tasty drink. Symbolism: The combination of the milky-white liebfraumilch with the champagne will produce a very white drink, where the German very quickly overwhelms the French.  The wide-mouthed rocks glass provides breathing room for the drink, which has only one ball. Taken together, this is clearly a joke reference to Adolf Hitler, who, after the invasion of Poland, took over France in a very successful and fast way, through the &quot;lightning war&quot; or blitzkrieg, during the early years of World War II. The reference to Hitler's &quot;one ball&quot; comes from the lyrics to a crude song sung by British soldiers, to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March. Although the symbolism renders this primarily a joke recipe, the actual drink produced is unique and quite pleasant.  The fiery taste of the cinnamon gives an interesting contrast to the &quot;cooler&quot; flavour of the white wines. This drink originated in Cincinnati, Ohio in the late 1940s, concocted by veteran members of the US 82nd Airborne Division.

;One-five-one (151) proof rum
:A rum which is 75% alcohol. Quite flammable as the warnings on the bottle declare.

;Paloma
:120&amp;nbsp;mL silver (white) tequila, 240&amp;nbsp;mL grapefruit flavoured soda, a twist of lemon, salt and a small dish for frosting.  Chill a high glass. Twist some lemon juice on the mouth of the glass and turn it upside-down into a salt-filled dish to create the frosting. Add some ice. Pour the tequila first, then the grapefruit soda. Stir as needed, then decorate with a lemon rind. Alternative:  Instead of using silver tequila, you could use rested (reposado) variation. It gives a more &quot;wooden&quot; texture to the experience. Its name translates as &quot;dove&quot;.

;Punch
:Punch is a general term for any of a wide assortment of mixed drinks, either soft or alcoholic, often containing fruit or fruit juice. Punch is typically served at parties in large, wide bowls known as punchbowls. In a large number of Caribbean, Pacific or Indian Ocean countries, punch is also drunk as an aperitif before meals. The original drink was made from five different ingredients, namely arrack, sugar, lemon, water and tea. Because of this it was named ''panch'' which is the Hindi for ''five''.  This name was adopted by the sailors of the British East India Company and brought back to England, from where it was introduced into other European countries.

:In Germanic culture, punch (or ''Punsch'' in German) refers to a mixture of several fruit juices and spices, often with wine or liquor added. Punch is popular in Germany, as well as with many Germans who emigrated to America. The traditional German Christmas often includes a Feuerzangenbowle (&quot;Burnt Punch&quot; or &quot;Burning Fire Tongs Bowl&quot;).  This is a punch made from red wine, and flaming rum poured over a sugar hat, a large conical sugar cube placed on the &quot;Feuerzange&quot; which supports it above the bowl. In Korean culture, ''sujeonggwa'' is a traditional punch made from dried persimmons, cinnamon and ginger.

:Recipes: A very simple punch recipe is to add sherbet to chilled ginger ale; Summer Cup: wash and hull a large punnet of strawberries and put them in a large bowl with 100&amp;nbsp;mL of gin and 50&amp;nbsp;mL of Cointreau.  Allow them to soak for a while. Add plenty of ice, and a bottle of medium dry white sparkling wine. Top up with at least 500&amp;nbsp;mL of soda water to taste. Serve in long tall glasses with a sprig of mint. Typical alcoholic punch generally contains cask wine, Passion Pop or similar, juice, soft drink, cordial and vodka.

;Radler
:Radler', German for ''cyclist'', is a traditional mixture of beer and a soft drink, mostly carbonated and orange or lemon flavoured, in South Eastern Germany (Bavaria) and adjacent provinces. It is refreshing, and its alcohol content is low, depending on the beer's alcohol content as it is normally mixed 1:1. There is however enough alcohol to provide a momentary surplus energy which might be a clue for the word's etymology: to be the beverage of cyclists as it does not make them drunk but makes the most of the alcohol it contains.

;Ramos Gin Fizz
:2 ounces (60&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, 3 drops orange flower water, 1 egg whites, 1 teaspoon (5&amp;nbsp;mL) bar sugar, 1 ounce (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lemon juice, ½ ounce (15&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 ounce (30&amp;nbsp;mL) cream, soda water to taste. Shake very vigorously for at least one minute. Strain into a tall thin glass, or a very large old fashioned glass, and top with some soda water. Stir.

;Red Headed Slut
:Equal parts Jagermiester and Peach Schnapps ( usually ¾ OZ) and 1 oz of cranberry juice. Shaken with ice strained and served in a rocks glass. Taken as a shot. 

;Rene
:Vodka, club soda, lime. The ingredients are served over ice with a slice or wedge of lime squeezed into the drink.  The proportions may be varied to make a stronger or weaker cocktail.  It is most often made using 1 part vodka to 3 parts club soda, but if a stronger Rene is desired, use equal parts of vodka and club soda. The Rene is low in carbohydrates when compared with many other mixed drinks.  Its refreshingly light taste makes it a natural favourite during the warmer months of the year.

;Ricky Bobby [[Image:rickybobby.jpg|right|thumb|200px|rickybobby]]
:1 oz Dr. McGillicuddy's Cherry Schnapps; 3 oz Mike's Hard Lemonade - Serve in a Bomb Cup (plastic cup with center shot), or place a shotglass inside a lowball glass.  Fill the shotglass with Cherry McGillicuddy's and pour the Mike's Lemonade around it, just a little higher than the center shot so the red bleeds slightly into the drink.  If ingredients are chilled, there's no need to use a shaker.  Invented at the American Legion in Hugo, Minnesota in 2007 by Rick (Erik Robert) Anderson. The drink was named by Pete Linaman. 

;Roadrunner

Romulan Ale is somewhat popular in collegiate circles, especially among fraternities that encourage drinking of very strong alcoholic beverages at social functions. It is named after the blue-coloured Star Trek series drink Romulan Ale, from the Romulan Empire, that is illegal in Federation-controlled territory, but oft consumed by Star Fleet officers when there is a call for a lightening of mood. Different recipes call for different spirits to be mixed, but generally the strongest of rum, vodka or pure grain alcohol, and blue-coloured orange-flavoured liqueurs are used.

;Root Beer Float

;Sake Bomb
:Drop 1 shot sake into 1 glass of beer. Drink quickly. For added visual appeal, take two chopsticks, put them on top of the beer glass separate enough that the shot glass just barely sits on them. Then pound the table near the glass; the chopsticks will separate further and shot glass will fall into the beer glass.

;[[Bartending/Cocktails/Saketini|Saketini]]
:2 ½ oz (75&amp;nbsp;mL) gin or vodka, 1½ tsp (7.5&amp;nbsp;mL) sake, 1 cocktail olive. In a mixing glass half-filled with ice cubes, combine the gin or vodka with the sake. Stir well. Strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish with the olive.

;Sangria
:Liquids: 50% wine, 25% orange juice, 12.5% Sprite/7up, 12.5% ''Tango'' Tropical, 1 bottle of grapefruit liquor for every 30 litres. Solids: 1 500&amp;nbsp;g tin pineapple, 3 tins peach, 4 oranges, 3 limes, 2 lemons, 2-3 applies, half a sweet melon. It is recommend to add&amp;nbsp;750 mL of liquor for every 30 litres, some Cointreau or brandy, but when money is short then &quot;generic&quot; vodka would do. Remember, in a good sangria, there is never too much fruit. So, if in doubt, go for it. And in the end, ice is always a good idea so remember to buy it the day before and add it 10 or 15 minutes before the party starts. To prepare the sangria you'll need half a day or so, but the preparation shouldn't take more than an hour. Start by cutting all the fruits, pealing the citrics but leaving the apples skin on. Then pour all the wine in a container and all the fruits in with the wine. Add the sugar to taste (this would depend on how many fruits you had) and some cinnamon (be generous). Then leave to rest for 4-6 hours so that the wine soaks all the fruits and all the sugar dissolves well. Just before the party starts, add the rest of the liquids and ice.[http://www.alicante-spain.com/spain-tips/sangria-recipe.html]

;Sangrita
:2 cups (500&amp;nbsp;mL) freshly-squeezed orange juice, 3 tbsps (45&amp;nbsp;mL) grenadine, ¼ tsp (1&amp;nbsp;mL) chili powder (to taste), 1 cup (250&amp;nbsp;mL) tomato juice (optional), 3 tsps (15&amp;nbsp;mL) salt, 1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) tequila.

:Sangrita is a popular beverage to drink with tequila. This beverage is a tangy mixture of tomato and orange juices, usually spiked with hot chilis and lime juice. It may sound odd in flavour, but sangrita is the perfect accompaniment to good quality tequila, like an aged anejo or a good reposado. The tequila and sangrita are poured into separate shot glasses and the two are alternately sipped, not chased. First the tequila, then the chilled sangrita. Slowly, one after the other.

;Satan's Whiskers
:½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) dry vermouth, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) sweet vermouth, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) fresh-squeezed orange juice, ¼ oz (7.5&amp;nbsp;mL) Grand Marnier, 1 dash orange bitters.

;[[Bartending/Cocktails/Sazerac|Sazerac]]
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) rye whiskey (Old Overholt is the predominant brand in New Orleans, but Jim Beam and Wild Turkey also make a Rye), 1 tbsp (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Simple Syrup (granulated sugar dissolved in boiling water, thicker is better), 6 dashes of Peychaud's Bitters (there is no substitute, seriously), 6 dashes of absinthe (Herbsaint/Pernod is an acceptable substitute). Chill (or even freeze) a double old fashioned glass or tumbler. (Avoid using ice to chill the glass, because it makes the sides of the glass too watery for the Herbsaint.) Coat the inside of the glass with the Herbsaint. Roll the glass so that it doesn't puddle in the bottom. Add the rye, simple syrup and bitters with a splash of water.

:The Sazerac is one of the oldest cocktails. The original recipe was developed by Antoine Peychaud (pay-show) in his New Orleans' French Quarter apothecary, circa 1820. Peychaud's drink was then popularised at a Coffee House in the French Quarter, called the Sazerac Coffee House. One version of the history says that the proprietor of the Sazerac Coffee House, was also the importer of Sazerac de Forge et fils (Sazerac &amp; Sons) Cognac. Over time, the recipe evolved from cognac to rye whiskey. Peychaud was developing his bitters as a curative for heart burn and indigestion, and added the cognac-absinthe concoction with sugar, to make it palatable. Even today, Peychaud's bitters mixed with club soda is a bartender's quick antidote for indigestion. Bitters and lemon is also used (by bartenders) to treat hiccoughs. Sazerac™ is often considered closest to the original recipe, however it is a trade secret.

;Snowshoe
:3 parts bourbon, 1 part peppermint schnapps. Pour over ice.  The key is to only add the schnapps until there is a hint of mint flavour.  Other recipes give equal ratios of schnapps to bourbon, but the bourbon gets clobbered by the overwhelming peppermint flavour, and it tastes like bourbon-flavoured Scope.

;Southern Peach
:1 oz Southern Comfort, ½ oz. Peach Schnapps &amp; ½ oz. Amaretto

;Teknekt (or Teknert)
:Mix a half cup (125&amp;nbsp;mL) of tea with a half cup (125&amp;nbsp;mL) of moonshine and adding sugar. Sometimes the moonshine is replaced with rum. The name is probably from Scandinavia, where &quot;knert&quot; means (approximately) &quot;add a dose of moonshine&quot;.

;Tequila Manhattan
:1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) gold tequila, several dashes sweet vermouth, 1 slice of lime. The tequila and vermouth is mixed with cracked ice in a shaker or blender and strained into a chilled cocktail glass. It is garnished with the lime slice.

;Ti'Punch
:50&amp;nbsp;mL white agricultural rum, 10&amp;nbsp;mL cane syrup (cane sugar also works), ½ lime. Pour rum, then cane juice. Squeeze lime juice, then drop lime into drink. Stir. The Ti'Punch is a rum-based mixed drink that is especially popular in Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guyana and other French-speaking Caribbean states. It is usually served as an apéritif before starting a meal, both as a matter of tradition and because the drink itself is strongly alcoholic. A popular tradition is that of ''chacun prépare sa propre mort'' (roughly, each prepares his own death), where instead of serving the mixed drink, the bartender or host will simply place out the ingredients, and everyone will prepare the drink according to their own taste. Opinions differ as to whether it should be served with or without ice, but most agree that the &quot;real&quot; ti'punch should be served without ice.

;Tinto De Verano
:1 bottle (750&amp;nbsp;mL) of red wine, 500&amp;nbsp;mL of lemonade, lots of ice. Pour the wine and lemonade into a pitcher and throw in lots of ice. If you feel like a stronger drink, add a shot of rum, or a vermouth such as [[martini]]. Pour into tall glasses and garnish with a twist of lemon. Tinto de Verano is a refreshing wine based cocktail similar to sangria which is very popular in Andalucia. The name translates as ''red wine of summer'', and it is commonly drunk in summer. It is very refreshing, and is commonly served in beachside ''chiringuitos''. It is also often home-made, or indeed bought ready-bottled from supermarkets. In the Costa del Sol it is common for locals to drink tinto verano while tourists drink sangria. Notes: The wine should be full bodied, but does not need to be expensive, a cheap ''tempranillo'' will do; the lemonade used should not be too sweet or taste strongly of lemon, but rather should be as close as possible to Spanish ''gaseosa'' or ''casera'', which is carbonated water with a hint of artificial lemon flavouring and a hint of artificial sweetener. A stronger or sweeter lemonade such as Fanta, or traditional Americal lemonade will not do. If this kind of lemonade is unavailable, it can be replaced with carbonated water some sugar and a little lemon. Sprite would work, though it is not ideal, diet or lite sprite would work well. Tinto verano can be served with fruit, which makes it very similar to sangria.[http://www.meish.org/files/tinto_de_verano.php][http://www.recipezaar.com/148074][http://www.guisando.org/recetas/tintoverano.html][http://www.yanuq.com/buscador.asp?idreceta=199][http://www.patriamadre.com/content/InfoDetalle.asp?id=777]

;Tom Collins
:Cracked ice, 1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, juice of one lemon (about 1 oz [30&amp;nbsp;mL]), 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) fine sugar or sugar syrup, club soda. Garnish. Fill a Collins glass up about two-thirds with ice. Add sugar, lemon juice and gin. Stir well. Top off glass with club soda. A garnish, such as a maraschino cherry, is optional. Variations include using (unsweetened) lime juice instead of lemon juice; skipping the sugar in the above recipe, and using lemon-lime soda instead of club soda; and using &quot;Collins mixer&quot; soda (essentially slightly sweet lime soda) om place of the lime juice, sugar and club soda.

;Tombstone
:1 part barley wine, 2 parts cider. It is popular in England, especially in Gloucestershire.

;Trader Vic's Rum Fizz
:1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) light rum, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lemon juice, 2 tsp (10&amp;nbsp;mL) sugar, 1 egg, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) chilled cream soda, grated orange rind. Shake juice, sugar, egg and rum with ice.  Strain and top with cream soda.  Polish off with grated orange rind. This is a Gin Fizz (qv) made with egg yolk instead of egg white.  A Royal Fizz uses both. Give the drink its fizz with champagne instead of soda water and you've got a Diamond Fizz. And although the most popular Fizzes were anchored with gin, most any spirit can be worked into the routine.

:1&amp;nbsp;litre grain alcohol (such as Everclear), 1 quart (1 L) Gatorade (Tucker says that lemon-lime is the &quot;only true flavour&quot;), 1 can Red Bull. Each batch makes slightly more than 2&amp;nbsp;litres of the 86 proof Tucker Death Mix, similar in alcohol content to a hard liquor such as vodka or rum. It was invented and popularised by Tucker Max as a way to quickly become inebriated. Variation: A variation of the Tucker Death Mix that appears in drinksmixer.com and freedrinkrecipes.com replaces 250&amp;nbsp;mL of grain alcohol with a second can of Red Bull, substituting alcohol content for flavour and caffeine.  The volume produced is still the same but the alcoholic content is reduced to 32.4% (65 proof).  Note: drinksmixer.com has the alternative composition listed as being 59 proof, which is presumably a miscalculation. The origins of the alternative composition of TDM are not known; however, it is worth noting that since Tucker Max was the eponymous originator of the beverage, the original proportions with higher alcohol content appearing on his website should be technically considered more correct.

;'''Tupper's Top Up'''
:Shot formation in a 2 oz shot glass- 15 mL vodka, 15 mL rum, 15 mL tequila, top up with raspberry sour puss 


;Turbo Shandy
:Equal measures lager and alcoholic lemonade. The brand is not important although it is often made with Stella Artois and Smirnoff Ice.  Dangerously effective.

;Twentieth Century-Cafe Royal Cocktail book 1937
:Combine-1½ oz dry gin, ¾ oz white Lillet, ¾ oz white Creme de Cacao, ¾ oz fresh lemon juice, shake with ice and strain up into cocktail glass

==V==

;Virgin
:A &quot;virgin drink&quot; is a drink without alcohol. Virgin cocktails, or Mock-tails, are all mixers and no liquor. Some popular virgin drinks include virgin daquiris, Virgin Marys, smoothies and virgin piña coladas. Some virgin drinks are given alternative humorous nicknames, e.g. a virgin Bloody Mary may be called a Virgin Mary or a Bloody Shame.

;[[../Vodka Martini/]]
:1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, a splash of dry vermouth, 1 or 2 olives.

==W==

;Warm Blonde
:1 oz (30 mL) Southern Comfort layered over 1 oz (30 mL) amaretto in a shot glass.

;Waikiki Woo Woo
:Vodka, rum, tequila, triple sec, amaretto, orange juice, pineapple juice, cranberry juice and crushed ice.

;Walter De Camp
:40&amp;nbsp;mL bourbon, 20&amp;nbsp;mL lemon juice, 10&amp;nbsp;mL maple syrup, 2 drops Angostura, ice, slice of orange (for decoration). The drink was designed by Jasu Piasecki. It is named after a Finnish writer who writes answers to questions about partying, restaurants and celebrities in the Finnish City magazine after the writer described that &quot;It has to contain whiskey, be a short drink and taste really good.&quot;

;Wedding Belle
:⅓ dry gin, ⅓ Dubonnet, 1/6 orange juice and 1/6 cherry brandy, shaken with ice and strained into a glass.

;Whiskey Sour
:A Whiskey Sour is made with a double shot (50&amp;nbsp;mL) of whiskey (typically an American whiskey or bourbon will be used), 30&amp;nbsp;mL of lemon juice, 20&amp;nbsp;mL Gomme (a sugar syrup used in most cocktail bars), 2 dashes of Angostura bitters and a dash of egg white if required. The ingredients are then shaken and strained into a rocks (Old Fashioned) glass with cubed ice and garnished with a lemon twist. By increasing the ratio of lemon juice to Gomme one can increase the sourness of the cocktail. Too much Gomme will result in a cocktail that is too sickly and loses its original appeal - being sour. The flavour of a sour, especially a whiskey sour, has been likened to that of sour sweets that leaves the mouth watering and the tongue tingling but always wanting more.[http://www.kestonlodge.com]

;White Lady (or Delilah)
:2 oz (60&amp;nbsp;mL) gin, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lemon juice, 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) Cointreau or triple sec. Shake or stir with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass, and garnish with a lemon twist. The White Lady is also known as the Delilah, possibly because it has a sweet, delicate flavour that masks its significant alcohol content. It is essentially a Sidecar made with gin in place of brandy.

;[[../White Russian|White Russian]]
:1½ oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Kahlúa, 4 tsps (20&amp;nbsp;mL) cream or milk. Mix together in glass. Add Cream to top off glass and blend until homogeneous. A White Russian is a twist on the Black Russian with the addition of cream.

;Wiki Waki Woo
:0.5 oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, 0.5 oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) rum, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) 151-proof rum, 0.5 oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) tequila, 0.5 oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) triple sec, 1 oz amaretto, 1 oz orange juice, 1 oz pineapple juice, 1 oz cranberry juice. Combine all ingredients except the 151 with ice in a glass, put a straw in it and pour the 151 into the straw.

;Wild Berry Fizz
:Skyy Berry, Raspberry Liquor, Sour Mix, topped with Champagne, sugar rim

;Wild Tea
:1 part Wild Turkey brand bourbon, 2 parts Arizona Sweet Tea...delicious summer drink, created by JD of Hopatcong.

;Wisconsin Lunchbox
:A glass of half beer and half orange juice, with a shot of Amaretto dropped into it. It is similar to an Irish Carbomb or a Boilermaker. Like other similar such drinks, it is meant to be consumed quickly.

;Woo Woo (or Woo Woos)
:1 ¼ oz (35&amp;nbsp;mL) vodka, ½ oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) peach schnapps, 1 ¼ oz (35&amp;nbsp;mL) cranberry juice. Contents are poured in order over ice in a highball glass.  The juice content can be modified to suit the individual. The cocktail was believed to have been made famous by Aled Jones from the Chris Moyles show on BBC Radio 1. Since then, this drink has picked up a reputation for being popular within the homosexual community.

==Z==
;Zombie
:½ Orange Juice and ½ Bar Mix (lemon or lime juice) 
:½&amp;nbsp;oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) White Rum, ½&amp;nbsp;oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Amber Rum, ½&amp;nbsp;oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) Dark Rum and ½&amp;nbsp;oz(15&amp;nbsp;mL) Cherry Brandy
:garnish with an Orange and Cherry Serve in a Zombie glass (Collins).

:The Zombie is a strong cocktail made of fruit juices and rum, so named because of its perceived effects on the drinker. Scottish comedian and actor [[Billy Connolly]] commented on the concoction's potential to make one drunk from the feet up; he felt fine until he got up to go to the bathroom, whereupon he collapsed to the floor having temporarily lost the use of his legs.

:For more information on this drink see [[Bartending/Cocktails/Zombie]].

== Data Cleaning ==
'Cleaning' refers to the process of removing invalid data points from a dataset.

Many statistical analyses try to find a pattern in a data series, based on a hypothesis or assumption about the nature of the data. 'Cleaning' is the process of removing those data points which are either (a) Obviously disconnected with the effect or assumption which we are trying to isolate, due to some other factor which applies only to those particular data points.
(b) Obviously erroneous, i.e. some external error is reflected in that particular data point, either due to a mistake during data collection, reporting etc.

In the process we ignore these particular data points, and conduct our analysis on the remaining data.

'Cleaning' frequently involves human judgement to decide which points are valid and which are not, and there is a chance of valid data points caused by some effect not sufficiently accounted for in the hypothesis/assumption behind the analytical method applied.

The points to be cleaned are generally extreme outliers. 'Outliers' are those points which stand out for not following a pattern which is generally visible in the data. One way of detecting outliers is to plot the data points (if possible) and visually inspect the resultant plot for points which lie far outside the general distribution. Another way is to run the analysis on the entire dataset, and then eliminating those points which do not meet mathematical 'control limits' for variability from a trend, and then repeating the analysis on the remaining data.

Cleaning may also be done judgementally, for example in a sales forecast by ignoring historical data from an area/unit which has a tendency to misreport sales figures. To take another example, in a double blind medical test a doctor may disregard the results of a volunteer whom the doctor happens to know in a non-professional context.

'Cleaning' may also sometimes be used to refer to various other judgemental/mathematical methods of validating data and removing suspect data.

The importance of having clean and reliable data in any statistical analysis cannot be stressed enough. Often, in real-world applications the analyst may get mesmerised by the complexity or beauty of the method being applied, while the data itself may be unreliable and lead to results which suggest courses of action without a sound basis. A good statistician/researcher (personal opinion) spends 90% of his/her time on collecting and cleaning data, and developing hypothesis which cover as many external explainable factors as possible, and only 10% on the actual mathematical manipulation of the data and deriving results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'Discrete' data are data that assume certain discrete and quantized values. For example, true-false answers are discrete, because there are only two possible choices. Valve settings such as 'high/medium/low' can be considered as discrete values. As a general rule, if data can be counted in a practical manner, then they can be considered to be discrete. 

To demonstrate this, let us consider the population of the world. It is a discrete number because the number of civilians is theoretically countable. But since this is not practicable, statisticians often treat this data as continuous. That is, we think of population as within a range of numbers rather than a single point.

For the curious, the world population is 6,533,596,139 as of August 9, 2006. Please note that statisticians did not arrive at this figure by counting individual residents. They used much smaller samples of the population to estimate the whole. Going back to Chapter 1, this is a great reason to learn statistics - we need only a smaller sample of data to make intelligent descriptions of the entire population!

Discrete distributions result from plotting the frequency distribution of data which is discrete in nature.

===General Properties===
====Cumulative Distribution Function====

A discrete random variable has a cumulative distribution function that describes the probability that the random variable is below the point. The cumulative distribution must increase towards 1. Depending on the random variable, it may reach one at a finite number, or it may not. The cdf is represented by a capital F.

====Probability Mass Function====

A discrete random variable has a probability mass function that describes how likely the random variable is to be at a certain point. The probability mass function must have a total of 1, and sums to the cdf. The pmf is represented by the lowercase f.

====Special Values====

The expected value of a discrete variable is
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n_{min}}^{n_{max}} x_i f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

The expected value of any function of a discrete variable g(&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n_{min}}^{n_{max}} g(x_i)f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

The variance is equal to
&lt;math&gt;E((X-E(X))^2)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Whipped cream''' is a stable aerated form of [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], usually with [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] or other flavors added. It's traditionally produced by whipping air into heavy cream.

It's often served on top of desserts such as [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]], and strawberries. It's also used to give mousses their fluffy texture, by gently folding it into a flavoring substance such as chocolate. It can also be used as a [[Cookbook:Leavening Agent|leavening agent]] for batters.

Pre-whipped cream can be bought at grocery stores in both tubs and spray tubes.

==Ingredients:==
*1 cup(0.25 l) heavy cream (or whipping cream), cold

==Procedure==
# Chill a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes. (If using a mixer with various kinds of beaters, use the [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] attachment). This step is very important, because the cream will not rise if the mixer is warm.
# In the chilled bowl, beat heavy cream until soft peaks form. Do not overbeat.

Makes: 2 cups/0.5 l

== Tips, Notes and Variations ==
* Contrary to whipping egg whites, it's not important to make sure there's no fat in the mixture. It is important, however, to make sure that the bowl and mixers are dry.
* To sweeten the cream, about two tablespoons of sugar per cup (0.25 l) of heavy cream are appropriate.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You can sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* Check out our [[Wikibooks:Help|help]] page if you need additional help.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]
* See [[Wikibooks:Template messages|list of templates]] which can save your time
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page.

Good luck! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:03, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

==Page naming==
Can you read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]? Thanks. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:03, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

: Did you read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] like Derbeth asked? You are creating pages in the wrong place.

: On your table of contents page, you need to use a slash, like &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;'''/'''&lt;/span&gt;Chapter Name&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;'''/'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;'''/'''&lt;/span&gt;Chapter Name|Chapter Name]]&lt;/tt&gt;. On other pages, you need to write out &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow;&quot;&gt;'''/'''&lt;/span&gt;Chapter Name|Chapter Name]].

: The slash is necessary because Wikibooks contains multiple books, and we need to know the owning book of each page.

: Also, there is a '''Show preview''' button. No one is required to use it, but you might want to use it instead of &quot;Save page&quot; to preview your work. (When you use &quot;Save page&quot; a lot, it quickly fills both the history and the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]].) Thanks for contributing to Wikibooks, --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:22, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods]] ==

I want to mention that I just got through reading [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Introduction]].

Wow!

[[Image:Puchipuchi.jpg|right|200px]]
[[Image:Duct-tape Moving Van.jpg|right|130px]]
This is an excellent title for a book, and it looks like you've put quite a bit of effort into putting this whole thing together.  If you want to add a little spash to your book, you might want to check out the [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] for some images.  With over 500,000 images there, you should be able to find something that you could use.  Images can be added in the following format:  '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:&lt;image name&gt;|&lt;right or left&gt;|&lt;pixel width&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

Here are a couple of images that you can use right now.  Just hit the edit button on this page to see the image links, or click on the images themselves to find the names of the images.

BTW, that car image was from http://www.safetycenter.navy.mil/photo/archive/photo172.htm

Read the caption on that... it is funny as heck.  More of what not to do in this situation of do-it-yourself moving.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:42, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

== Redirected pages ==

There is a process here on Wikibooks to deal with redirecting pages to where you have moved content to, if there are external links pointing to Wikibooks on one page but the content really is somewhere else.

Just try not to abuse this situation.  Instead, you should try to catalog your book and see if other people are willing to help with developing this content by bringing it up in the Staff Lounge, various mailing lists for Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects, or finding similar books or Wikipedia articles and trying to content people who have helped edit that content.  Or even find other internet discussion groups that might be talking about the subject you are writing about.

The content search system is indeed broken on Wikibooks, and that is something that I'm trying to work on as a &quot;hobby&quot; project right now.  Unfortunately the plethora of pages you have just added is going to just make things worse, not better, for the current systems we have in place.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:24, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

== External links ==

I notice that most of the articles you have edited have a link to learntomove.com which is a site requiring payment for use.  Wikibooks is intended to be read as stand alone content and so this promoting of a single website looks inappropriate --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:50, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
:Afraid I agree with Herby and have removed most of the external links from this book.  Sorry. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 07:57, 8 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

{{Java Programming/Navigation|previous=Class Loading|next=Generics}}
{{Java Programming/ClassesAndObjectsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In Java you can define a class inside an other class. A class can be nested inside another class or inside a method. A class that is not nested is called a ''top-level'' class and a class defining a nested class is an ''outer'' class.

== Inner classes ==
=== Nesting a class inside a class ===
When a class is declared inside another class, the nested class' access modifier can be {{java:public}}, {{java:private}}, {{java:protected}} or &lt;code&gt;package(default)&lt;/code&gt;.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-10&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.10: OuterClass.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4-8&quot;&gt;
public class OuterClass {
   private String outerInstanceVar;

   public class InnerClass {
      public void printVars() {
         System.out.println(&quot;Print Outer Class Instance Var.:&quot; + outerInstanceVar);
      }
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The inner class has access to the enclosing class instance's variables and methods, even private ones, as seen above. This makes it very different from the nested class in C++, which are equivalent to the &quot;static&quot; inner classes, see below.

An inner object has a reference to the outer object. The nested object can only be created with a reference to the 'outer' object. See below.
{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.20: Outer class call.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3-4&quot;&gt;
public void testInner() {
    ...
    OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
    OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();  
    ...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
When in a non-static method of the outer class, you can directly use &lt;code&gt;new InnerClass()&lt;/code&gt;, since the class instance is implied to be &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;.

You can directly access the reference to the outer object from within an inner class with the syntax &lt;code&gt;OuterClass.this&lt;/code&gt;; although this is usually unnecessary because you already have access to its fields and methods.

Inner classes compile to separate &quot;.class&quot; bytecode files, with the name of the enclosing class, followed by a &quot;$&quot;, followed by the name of the inner class. So for example, the above inner class would be compiled to a file named &quot;OuterClass$InnerClass.class&quot;.

=== Static inner classes ===
An inner class can be declared ''static''. These classes are not bound to an instance of the outer defining class. A static inner class has no enclosing instance, and therefore cannot access instance variables and methods of the outer class. You do not specify an instance when creating a static inner class. This is equivalent to the inner classes in C++.

=== Nesting a class inside a method ===  
These inner classes, also called ''local classes'', cannot have access modifiers, like local variables, since the class is 'private' to the method. The inner class can be only {{java:abstract}} or {{java:final}}.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-11&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.11: OuterClass.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3-5&quot;&gt;
public class OuterClass {
   public void method() {
      class InnerClass {
 
      }
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
In addition to instance variables of the enclosing class, local classes can also access local variables of the enclosing method, but only ones that are declared &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;. This is because the local class instance might outlive the invocation of the method, and so needs its own copy of the variable. To avoid problems with having two different copies of a mutable variable with the same name in the same scope, it is required to be &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;, so it cannot be changed.

== Anonymous Classes ==
In Java, a class definition and its instantiation can be combined into a single step. By doing that the class does not require a name. Those classes are called anonymous classes. An anonymous class can be defined and instantiated in contexts where a reference can be used, and it is a nested class to an existing class. Anonymous class is a special case of a class local to a method; hence they also can access final local variables of the enclosing method.

Anonymous classes are most useful to create an instance of an interface or adapter class without needing a brand new class.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-12&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.12: ActionListener.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public interface ActionListener {
    public void actionPerformed();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{XExample|1='''Code section 4.21: Anonymous class.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
ActionListener listener = new ActionListener() {
        public void actionPerformed() {
            // Implementation of the action event
            ...
            return;
        }
    };
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
In the above example the class that implements the &lt;code&gt;ActionListener&lt;/code&gt; is '''anonymous'''. The class is defined where it is instantiated.

The above code is harder to read than if the class is explicitly defined, so why use it? If many implementations are needed for an interface, those classes are used only in one particular place, and it would be hard to come up with names for them, using an '''anonymous''' inner class makes sense.

The following example uses an anonymous inner class to implement an action listener.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-13&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.13: MyApp.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import java.awt.Button;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

class MyApp {
   Button aButton = new Button();

   MyApp() {
       aButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
               public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                   System.out.println(&quot;Hello There&quot;);
               }
           }
       );
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The following example does the same thing, but it names the class that implements the action listener.
{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-14&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 4.14: MyApp.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import java.awt.Button;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

class MyApp {
   Button aButton = new Button();

   // Nested class to implement the action listener
   class MyActionListener implements ActionListener {
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
           System.out.println(&quot;Hello There&quot;);
       }
   }
   MyApp() {
       aButton.addActionListener(new MyActionListener());
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
Using '''anonymous''' classes is especially preferable when you intend to use many different classes that each implement the same interface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Moving Day Decisions
'''''Moving Decisions'''''

==SORTING THROUGH YOUR GOODS AND ORGANIZING THEM OR DISPOSING OF UNWANTED THINGS==

Most people are packrats to some degree. Nearly everyone's home has old junk in it that should no longer be there. Of course, what is categorized, as old junk is entirely subjective to your personal opinion. Only you know what you still want or need. So you should try to decide before move day just what all you want to be transported to the new residence and what all you want to dispose of. Arrangements should be made well in advance for disposal of unwanted things. Agencies such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army can help with this but be aware that when they arrive to collect things from you they may turn down some things that you are counting on them to remove. So be sure to have alternative arrangements for disposal in place such as community garbage pickup service or dumps.

==PACKING AND BLANKET WRAPPING==

Then, once disposables have been identified, all goods that are being kept and that can be boxed should be properly and carefully boxed up and labeled. Goods that cannot be boxed should be blanket wrapped if possible to protect them. Normally, moving blankets can be obtained from truck rental facilities in advance for premove wrapping of non-vital furniture. The rest of your things will have to be moved unprotected, so just be very careful with them and try to carry some of the smaller things in your car. Small appliances such as toasters, mix masters, radios, toaster ovens, blenders, George Foreman type grills, etc. should all be carefully packed into boxes and moved as fragiles because they can be quite costly to replace. Remember, you're out to save money and each thing that you can fully preserve from damages during the move saves you repair or replacement money.

==TRUCK RENTAL==

Rent a big enough truck to move your whole load in one trip unless you are moving very nearby in which case a smaller truck with multiple trips will be fine. Carefully inspect the truck for existing body damages and note them on your rental contract. Make sure the truck body is clean inside and if you have a lift gate – thoroughly test it. Study and learn good truck driving techniques and how to safely get in and out of the truck cab and the side or back of the truck. Be aware of bad weather truck driving considerations too. Always keep a big distance interval between your truck and other traffic. Make wide swings around corners so as not to have cut off accidents and watch your height restrictions on overpasses and viaducts.

==MOVING HIGH VALUE ITEMS SUCH AS CURRENCY / COIN / STAMP COLLECTIONS, HIGH VALUE ARTWORK, EXPENSIVE SMALL STATUARY, ETC.==

Do all of this kind of moving very carefully by yourself. If anything gets broken or disappears for some reason you only want yourself to blame. Don't trust anybody else with these kinds of light, valuable items because if anything goes wrong with them, it will become a nightmare for you. Breakage or loss of these kinds of valuables can lead to accusations, outbursts of anger, loss of friendship or close relationship, police involvement, law suits, etc., etc., etc.

==PROVIDING YOUR MOVING / PACKING HELPERS WITH SNACKS, MEALS, BEVERAGES AND BATHROOM FACILITIES==

When relatives and / or friends are helping you to pack up and move your home it’s wise to make conditions for them as comfortable as possible. During working periods, just having tasty snacks and non-alcoholic drinks on hand can do that. Ordering pizzas, chicken, oriental food or other kinds of meals will also be appreciated. Remember, these folks are giving you their help and saving you the cost of employing costly packers and movers, so these relatively inexpensive, thoughtful gestures will help to make their work for you much more pleasant.

You can also let them pick their own radio stations or TV stations while they're packing your things up. Again this makes the work environment more pleasant for them. And be sure there is plenty of bathroom tissue, Kleenex and air freshening spray where it can be easily found in the bathroom so your people don't have to ask embarrassingly for it.

Never bring forth alcoholic beverages for your helpers until the day's work is completed. Alcohol makes people get prematurely tired and lazy so save it until everything to be done that day is actually finished. Then maybe go ahead and relax and unwind with a couple of drinks with them but don't let anyone who's driving get legally drunk. Any DUI's issued that evening would be a terrible downer for the recipient, for you and for any of your folks who helped out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a lack of knowledge among laymen today about good techniques for DIY (do it yourself) packing, moving, storing and trucking of household goods. People who plan to move themselves mostly consider this activity to be a simple, no-brainer, muscle-mutt kind of thing. But if they were to observe well trained professional movers efficiently and quickly doing a move or if they were to have a painful injury or a costly damage during their move, they might take a whole different view of the matter.

In order to expedite their move and avoid the grief of personal injuries and / or costly furniture damages, everyone who self-moves would benefit greatly from some solid instruction about how to properly relocate their furniture and other household goods. Knowledge and implementation of good DIY moving methods would definitely help people to save money, which is their main motivation behind their self moving, isn’t it?

When one searches around, there are only 3 or 4 books to be found anywhere on the subject of household goods packing and moving. The problem with each of these books is that they’ve been written by someone who has frequently used professional movers for their relocations. So, not being professional movers, these authors are neither experienced nor qualified to teach DIY moving techniques and they don’t! Their books only inform people about what-to-do when they relocate their homes with a mover. They don’t teach the importance of securely padding and safely lifting and carrying major furniture pieces which is information which is vital during actual DIY moving. When done correctly these techniques make the moving task easier and safer; thus preventing personal injuries and / or costly furniture damages. 

Another source for this kind of information could be the big name national moving Van Line companies. They all have internal training texts and videos for their employees which teach them good moving technique. Unfortunately, these companies have no motivation to make their teachings available to the general public because they want to be doing everyone's relocations themselves on a for-hire basis. So, for them to make their intellectual property available for DIY moving would appear to be cutting their own throats (so to speak) in the moving business. However, on the Internet if people search around they will find that many of these professional movers’ websites do give some free moving tips but these all boil down to  being merely moving checklists with some packing advice. These moving and packing tips are primarily given to draw people to the mover's website in hopes that they will contact the mover for a quote.

There are also the rental truck company websites that give free moving tips but these too are inadequate because they merely describe what-to-do, such as suggesting that people pad their furniture in order to protect it while its being moved. But they don't show exactly how to properly and snuggly do that padding so that the pads wont slip while the movers are struggling to carry that heavy furniture piece up or down stairs.

Consequently, there just doesn’t seem to be any teaching material anywhere that instructs people comprehensively about good professional packing, moving, storing and trucking techniques. And yet there is a huge potential audience all over the world for this information! the American population alone is now reported as being over 300,000,000 people, which compacts down into an audience of about 85 - 90,000,000 total family units (approximately 3.5 people per unit). Its a statistical fact that approximately 20% of this population relocates every year, which equates to 15 - 20,000,000 American family units relocating every year. Beyond this large American audience, there are also many, many millions of mobile family units worldwide that have the same need-to-know about good relocating techniques. Developing countries invariably also bring forth a big middle class that accumulates nice possessions and they too will need to occasionally relocate as time goes on. So overall there is a tremendously vast audience for this kind of instruction. 

Many of these mobile people will be doing various forms of self moving, especially if they are in the 18 to 35 year old age group who are not yet affluent enough to afford to hire a professional mover and are still young enough and strong enough to take on this daunting task themselves. These younger people could learn how to do all of their moving the easy way, through finding and utilizing this instruction here but most will probably learn it the hard way by relocating themselves untrained. And unfortunately, some of these untrained people will actually learn how difficult moving can be the extremely hard way by incurring grievous and expensive personal injuries and / or costly damages to their goods and property. These unfortunates wont end up saving any money at all by doing their own moving because of such unexpected extra expenses. Instead they will wish to God that they had just hired professional movers and spared themselves a whole lot of costly, unprofitable  bother. 

For instance, as has been done below, people will be taught how to tightly and snuggly pad an armoire and cardboard its glass (if it has any) in order to protect it during moving.

[[image:armoire1.jpg]]
[[image:armoire2.jpg]]

Snugly padding a furniture piece also makes it easier for the movers to grip and handle it while it is being moved than if its left bare. Such padding also holds the drawers in and protects the piece from scrapes, abrasions, rubs and nicks to its finish from bumping into walls and doorways while it is being carried.

This wikibook is an attempt to reach this huge global audience with this information by using wikipedia's worldwide impact.   

As an open source wikibook there is also a hope that other experienced movers and knowledgeable laymen around the world will participate by adding what they know about moving to its content so that people everywhere will become better and better informed about how to safely and efficiently accomplish their household goods moving, packing, storage and trucking.

=Piano Moving: Warnings=

'''SO YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY BY MOVING YOUR PIANO, HUH?'''

If you're going to have to move your piano over 4 low consecutive low steps at any given point in the move path - our first advice to you, the amateur piano mover wannabee is –

#DON'T DO IT!  DON'T DO IT!!  DON'T DO IT!!!  DON'T DO IT!!!!

Piano self-moving can be a very difficult and very dangerous endeavor. 

This is especially true when traversing more than 4 consecutive low steps because then you have to actually carry the piano, not just tip and lift it! Piano carrying is so dangerous a task that it could lead you right to the undertaker! So instead why don’t you please just pay a qualified professional piano mover to do it for you?

But if you will not be traversing over 4 consecutive low steps in your entire move path and / or if you still want to further investigate how to move your piano yourself, then read on. 

First of all, before we will give you our piano moving instruction on how to move a piano traversing over 4 consecutive low steps up or down at any given point in the move path – We will try to completely discourage you from attempting it!!! We feel that it is our responsibility, in consideration of your personal safety, to first make every attempt to warn you of the many difficulties and dangers involved in do it yourself piano moving. We are giving you these warnings because we're certain that you, as amateurs seeking the high calling and the glory of becoming a piano mover (?), do not fully realize the dangers to which you are about to become exposed!.

Consequently, we ask you to carefully and completely read everything on the rest of this page. Please don't skim by any of it! These warnings cover the entire necessary issues of piano moving safety in order for you to make an informed, intelligent decision on this important matter. Then, after being made aware of all of these dangers, if you're still committed to moving your own piano we will then give you plenty of great piano moving tips.

So, we now ask the question - are you absolutely certain that this task would not be better left to those trained to do it, even if they charge you a few hundred dollars? Normally, do it yourself piano moving involves a high degree of risk of injury to the crew and / or damage to the piano / property versus a very small potential for money savings compared to having a professional do it for you. We especially recommend against do-it-yourself piano moving over 4 consecutive low steps in the move path because pianos are heavy and extremely difficult to balance and carry. If you and your helpers are not constantly diligent to use proper technique every step of the way, it's very easy to have any size piano suddenly get away from you with a resulting nightmare moving day catastrophe!

If you don't entirely agree with us about the extent of the risk involved and you search the internet to seek advice from other piano movers, you will find that they'll all concur with us. Why? Just to get you to spend your money on their services? Maybe? To some degree greed might be involved in their advice to you, but we prefer to believe that they (as we) are more interested in people's welfare. All piano movers know from personal experience (as we do), the inherent dangers of piano moving.

===MUST YOU REALLY MOVE YOUR PIANO YOURSELF?===

Think about it. Are there really circumstances where there is just no other viable choice except that a do-it-yourself piano moving crew must be sought out in order for you to move your piano? Let’s look into some circumstances that entice people into do-it-yourself piano moving situations.

====1. We just can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars to move this piano!====

Maybe you can't, but before you leap ahead too fast trying to save your money by moving your piano yourself, add into your plan the terrible possibility of an unexpected severe injury! Can you afford to be off from work and go unpaid for some protracted period of time because during the piano move your back goes out, your knee gets broken, a shoulder socket is permanently disabled, or you break an arm / wrist / hand / finger or a hip / leg / ankle / foot / toe? How about if that severe injury should instead happen to a friend / relative of yours who is helping you move your piano and he is eventually forced by financial pressures to sue you, thus ruining your relationship? Then again, supposing the piano is moved without any personal injury to the movers but in the process its sound board is damaged or a big, long, deep scratch is gouged into its beautiful finish or a caster digs a big divot into your brand new hardwood floor or the deck / porch collapses from the accumulated weight of the piano and the men.

Now, compared to such bleak scenarios as these the few hundred dollars that you would have to pay to a professional piano moving company turns into a very inexpensive, excellent bargain, doesn't it? That is, if you use a qualified piano mover with a good track record who can prove to you that they have full workmen's compensation insurance for their men and full property liability coverage for each residence and for your piano.

====2. My friends and I are big strong guys. The piano's not really that big. Look I can lift one end by myself. Sure it's a little heavy, but with three or four of us it shouldn't be that hard to move.====

You and your illustrious friends might actually be able to move the piano successfully. However, without correct piano moving technique and without a good piano dolly, piano belt and a strong hump strap, you won't! When there are more than four consecutive steps along the move path you'll have to actually carry the piano. Having to actually carry the piano raises the difficulty factor of the piano move considerably! Throughout a piano carry, good balance is necessary and can only be accomplished when the whole crew is working in unison and properly utilizing their piano moving equipment. The part of piano carrying that requires skill and concentration is keeping the piano in balance (not allowing it to wobble much from left-to-right and / or from front-to-back) while actually carrying it up / down steps. Also, sometimes when moving a piano up / down stairs, a banister has been known to fail right in the middle of the move! If the movers are leaning on it at that time catastrophic things can occur!!

[[Image:donotmovethis.jpg]]

In the piano moving trade the person on the bottom holding the main part of the piano and carrying most of the weight is described as the man on &quot;heavy&quot; and he really is! During a piano carry, when a man's positioned on heavy, the blood can almost come out of his eyes. Even with the smallest piano, the weight that can be dumped onto that bottom person is immense! An unbalanced piano means that 350 - 500 lbs. minimum(!) for a small upright piano and 600 -1000 lbs. for a grand piano or a big upright, can all be mostly dumped onto the guy on heavy!  This is why mover's backs can go out so easily. Everyone on the crew can be a big strong guy, just like your friends are, but this kind of weight in an unbalanced situation is just humanly impossible for even the strongest man to handle without injury. When the weight gets to be just too much for any member of the team he will just have to let the piano go! Then, goodbye piano - hello injuries to anybody who does not get out of the way!!!

==A FEW MORE PIANO MOVING WARNINGS==
===Four Consecutive Low Steps=== 

Piano moving up or down up to 4 consecutive low steps at any given point in the move path can be accomplished by amateurs by simply using our tip and lift or lower piano moving techniques that are much easier than having to actually carry the piano. If, and only if, you and your big, strong friends carefully follow our instructions you should be able to readily move your piano up or down four consecutive low steps or less anywhere in the move path. Carrying a piano over any more steps than that is another story, however.

The important thing to notice in this video is that even though these men make it look easy, the piano is trying to wobble all over the place! Watch it again and look for that! Because they're professional piano movers they know how to keep it steady. Then watch it once again and watch for the wobbling and see how they steady it.

Actually carrying a piano forces the amateur out of the comparatively easy realm of the tip and lift / lower piano moving technique and into the most difficult and dangerous part of piano moving - actually carrying the piano. As you can see watching the video, traversing more than 4 consecutive low steps at any given point in the move path requires complicated piano carrying techniques. With large or small pianos, their extreme weight brings such great danger on a piano carry that we 99% advise against amateurs attempting to do it.

===Winding / Circular Stairs===

If any piano must go up / down winding circular stairs we will not give instruction because in our opinion this situation is just too difficult and dangerous to be attempted by amateurs. Winding / circular stairs require the piano moving services of highly skilled experienced professionals in order to avoid personal injury and / or property damage to the stairs or to the piano. There is just no easy way to move a piano up / down a winding stairway. There is no opportunity for the crew to stop and set the piano down on the steps in the middle of the winding stairway. So, the piano must be carried up / down the winding stairs without stopping which requires exact, precise top level piano moving technique combined with properly-focused brute strength! We highly recommend that only trained professionals move pianos up / down winding circular stairs! Please do not do this kind of piano move yourself!

===4-Legged Upright Pianos===

If your small upright piano has 2 legs in front and also 2 more decorative legs in the back with the case hanging between them, then we again highly recommend that only professionals be used. Untrained people cannot handle this style of piano going up / down more than just 1 step at any given point in the move path without a 99% chance of damaging the piano. The indenting of the piano's lower casing to accommodate the exposure of its decorative rear legs interferes with the normal positioning of a small upright piano on its side on the dolly which is the moving procedure used when traversing more than 1 step. As you can visualize, there is nowhere to place the dolly under this kind of piano's side without the legs of the piano overhanging and dragging the ground. If, during the entire piano move, the piano is only traversing one step at a time then it can be successfully moved on its feet on the dolly. We will train you to move this kind of piano with the dolly under its bottom instead of under its side but this only works with a maximum of one step at any given point anywhere in the move path. If you will encounter 2 or more consecutive steps the piano should instead be handled by a qualified, experienced, professional piano mover. Because of the difficulties inherent in this particular kind of piano's design we highly recommend that amateurs do not attempt to move it if there are 2 or more consecutive steps at any given point in the move path! Instead, please just pay the trained professional!

===Big uprights / Player pianos===

If the piano is a 'big upright' (over 46&quot; high weighing 500-900 lbs.) or if it is a 'big upright' with a player mechanism (increasing the overall weight of the piano by 100 to 200 lbs.), we highly recommend only moving it to / from locations with no more than four consecutive low steps at any given point in the move path. If possible take the player mechanism out of the piano before the move in order to lighten it. 'Big upright' regular and player pianos are extremely heavy and therefore very dangerous to the people doing the piano move. If more than 4 consecutive low steps at any given point in the move path must be traversed then the piano must be carried by the movers and this extreme dead weight is just beyond what any normal person can bear! Any kind of minor out of balance condition can very quickly and easily put people in the hospital and / or completely clobber the piano. In the moving industry upright pianos taller than 46&quot; are referred to as &quot;KILLER UPRIGHTS!&quot; We seriously recommend that big &quot;KILLER UPRIGHTS&quot; only be moved by professional movers, if over four consecutive low steps are going to be encountered at any given point in the move path.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You should be aware of the weight of the piano being moved before you move it. Most of the weight of any piano comes from its extremely heavy cast iron harp. Small upright pianos only weigh 300 to 400 lbs. because they have a smaller cast iron harp than big upright pianos. Big uprights run from 600 lbs. thru 800 lbs. Big old player uprights can even hit 1000 lbs. because of the heavy player mechanism. The biggest upright piano height only runs up to 60 inches, topping out in weight at 8 - 900 lbs.

The smallest grand piano starts at 54 inches long which is equivalent to a 54 inch tall upright and weighs about 5 - 600 lbs. Grands can extend out to 108 inches long for a 9' concert grand topping out at 1000-1200 lbs. Liberace's piano was an especially made - monstrous 12 foot long grand piano weighing over 1500 lbs. He had it custom made just for him because he knew that the longer the grand piano is the better the bass notes sound during play. Higher piano notes come from straight strings so their length doesn't matter much but bass notes come from wound strings so the longer the piano, the longer the bass string, the better it resonates.

Large grand pianos are quite heavy, even more so than large upright pianos. Grand pianos can weigh anywhere from 500 to 1200 lbs. Baby grand pianos are 4 foot 6 inches to 6 foot 6 inches long and they can weigh between 500 and 800 lbs. But longer grand pianos weigh much more and should always be moved by professionals because the piano dollies have about an 800 - 900 lb. weight restriction. In fact, just because of their extreme weight, big uprights over 42' high or grand pianos which are 5 1/2 feet long or longer should always be moved by professionals. Pianos smaller than that can be moved by 4 or 5 amateurs with a little bit of training as long as they do not have to traverse over 4 steps in the move path.

==PIANO CASTERS==

Pianos should not be rolled around on their casters. The casters are mainly decorative and not very functional at all. Over time, as the piano sits in one place, the casters tend to deteriorate and jam up and when you go to push the piano on them they can stick in place and then they'll gouge your hardwood floors or tear your carpeting.

Pushing a grand piano around on its leg casters puts pressure on the legs and has been known to cause a leg to break. The same is true for a small upright piano with 2 front decorative legs. Big uprights are so constructed that they can better endure being pushed around a bit on their casters but their casters tend to jam up easily. Therefore, all in all, pushing a piano around on its casters is not a very good idea. 

However, if you've checked to see that none of the casters are frozen, a few of you can lift a grand piano up a bit and move it around. Just don't push it on its legs. With a small upright a couple of you can lift its front end up a bit as you push it on its rear casters but only when its weight is not bearing down on the front legs.


==4 WHEEL PIANO DOLLY==

Besides the danger of a jam, casters do not virtually eliminate the weight of the piano as happens when it is mounted up on a 4 wheel piano dolly. So, whenever a 4 wheel piano dolly can be used to transport the piano - muscle power to move it on the part of the crew is reduced to almost nothing because a properly balanced dollied piano is almost weightless and easily overcomes inertia on level surfaces. On inclines or ramps the piano's weight is reduced considerably but what's left is expressed on the low end of the incline. The steeper the incline, the more weight that will be expressed there. Consequently, at least 3 men are needed when moving even a small upright piano because at least 2 men need to be positioned on the heavy side of the incline to handle all of the piano's expressed weight.

Below is a picture of a small upright piano properly mounted on its side on our 4-wheel dolly. Notice that no one is holding it. This is only possible because it's on flat ground and it's balanced correctly on the dolly, so it just sits there as is, without needing a steadying hand or any other support.

Below is a picture of the same piano properly mounted on its feet on the dolly. Again, no one is holding it so it just sits there because it's centered and therefore balanced on the dolly and it's on flat ground. Notice that in this centered position the dolly juts out a bit in front of the piano. This is how the dolly must be placed under the piano in order to balance the lighter weight of its keyboard as well as the heavier weight of its case.

[[Image:smallupright2.jpg]]

==DO AS MUCH OF THE PIANO MOVING AS POSSIBLE WITH AS LITTLE HUMAN EFFORT AS POSSIBLE==

The dolly is to be used as much as possible. It is simply the easiest way to move a piano around (other than the miles covered when the piano is being transported just sitting lashed to the wall of a truck). It can be used to move a piano over level ground or on inclines and ramps or for tipping it up or down to get over a curb or 1 step. The piano dolly also can be used to transport the piano on top of plywood or masonite in order to go over grass, cobblestones, gravel, sand or any other uneven or loose surface. When doing this though always use at least 4 or 5 amateurs to push it because of the inherent instability of this kind of ground.

So, once the number of people needed on your crew has been determined (this is based upon piano size and if any actual piano carrying is to be done which will be further discussed), the first thing they will have to do with an upright piano is to mount it up onto a dolly. As simple a task as this might appear to be to the uninitiated, it is really somewhat involved because you're elevating 400 - 800 lbs. onto an unstable rolling platform that can easily scoot away. So very thorough instruction in dolly mounting techniques will be given.

Below is a picture of a grand piano up on its flat side on a piano skid board centered on a piano dolly.




At first glance it doesn't look like this grand piano is exactly centered on the dolly but it is because its weight is balanced. Remember, the left part of the piano with the keyboard has very little weight compared to the cast iron harp within the rest of the piano's kidney shape. So most of the piano's weight resides from just a little left of the leg brackets to the back end of the piano. If observed with an x-ray vision perspective you'd see that the piano's heavy cast iron harp is centered on the dolly even though the piano's case is not.

Grand pianos have to be broken down (without breaking them of course), by removing their 3 legs and the lyre and mounting them on their long side onto a piano skid board, which is an involved process. But here, we don't want to get too bogged down in our discussion so we suggest you view our 5 minute grand piano moving slideshow presentation on this subject at burrowsmoving.com/resources/piano.swf. Instead, we will here go on to speak in general of all the things that must be done in order to teach you how to move your piano from its origin point to its final destination point.

==TIP, LIFT, CHEAT 1 STEP ONLY==


The way to move your upright piano over 1 step is that it should be placed on the dolly on its feet because 1 step can be easily traversed on the dolly by just using a slight tip of the piano up / down as it is being pushed along. So, starting at the place where the piano is now sitting, if there will be no more than 1 step on the move path going to / from the truck, the piano is to be lifted or tipped up and onto the piano dolly, placing it on it's feet (on its bottom) onto the dolly's padded rails as shown previously.

To do this you will use the hump strap to reach under the dolly and lift one end of the piano. This lifting force causes the piano mounted on the dolly to be welded together with the dolly as one unit. In this manner the piano is lifted over the step (as is shown in the picture below). In the moving industry this is called doing a little cheat because we cheat gravity out of one step of carrying effort without having to take the piano off of the dolly and carry it over that step and then put it back onto the dolly.


[[Image:usingcheat.jpg]]


Just using a tip of the piano on its feet on the dolly in the above shown manner will not work to cheat more than 1 consecutive step with an upright piano because the bottom edge of the piano (on the low side of the tip) will scrape the ground, potentially chipping it. Mounting the piano on its side and doing this will not work either because a two step cheat has too much angle for safe piano moving.

Grand pianos are mounted on a piano skidboard on top of the dolly as shown previously and you can also use this little cheat technique for them. But in the case of moving a grand piano, you can sometimes even use it for 2 steps if the piano skid board is sticking out in back enough to absorb and protect the grand from all of the back bottom scraping when tipped at that much of an angle.

==TIP, LIFT, LOWER TO CHEAT 2 - 4 STEPS ONLY==

In order to do bigger cheats with an upright piano (up to as many as 4 consecutive low steps or as many as 3 consecutive higher steps at any given point on your move path) a different technique must be utilized. For 2, 3, or 4 step cheats up / down the stairs, the upright piano is first placed on its side on the dolly. Then, with the bottom of the upright facing the steps, it is positioned on the dolly up to and (if possible) over the 1st step. In this position, the 1st step has been automatically cheated by the height of the dolly as the piano's bottom is butted almost up to the side of the 2nd step.


[[Image:usingcheat2steps.jpg]]


We then finish cheating the other 2 steps by tipping the upright so that its bottom is made to lean against the remaining stairs to be traversed. 

[[File:Lifting Piano.jpg]]

Notice that as the tip begins on this 3 step cheat we have so balanced the upright on the first step, so as to not to let the weak decorative leg touch the stair and break it. Then we extricated the dolly from under the bottom side of the piano and placed it between the piano and the stairs to protect the piano's bottom and to expedite the dolly remount at the top of the stairs.


[[Image:grouplift.jpg]]

Since this was an older beater upright piano just used for these pictures we did not bother to pad the first step but for any nice piano - even though wood won't normally scratch wood, that should be done to be certain to not damage the piano's bottom edge.

Next, we carefully lift the upright piano up and over the top step keeping the dolly in place.




[[Image:grouplifttwo.jpg]]




If we had just one more step to traverse we couldn't push the upright up on the dolly like was done here. Instead, we'd not use the dolly at all but instead just lay it all the way up to the top step. Then using a pad or some cardboard placed as a covering between the piano and the top step to prevent scraping abrasion to the piano's bottom edge or undercarriage, we would tip it up and push it over the top step. 

This same process is reversed coming down the stairs. It comes down the steps with its bottom facing the steps just as it went up them. The piano is dollied out to the 2 bottom men and they hold it up until its out enough to tip it down to the bottom step. Then the dolly is removed and placed on the ground under the piano. It finishes it's descent by being tipped right up onto the dolly. Again use a pad or a piece of cardboard as a buffer between the piano and the top step's edge if there are 4 steps. 

These cheating techniques are so much easier than having to get under the piano and actually carry it over these few steps.

For grand pianos a cheat can cover as many straight steps as there are. The same technique is used as with the upright piano but instead of the bottom of the piano facing the stairs, the piano skidboard faces the stairs. If the abrasion of the piano skid board  is not going to damage the edge of the steps then just slide the grand down the stairs or push it up them.

Once all the steps have been traversed using the cheat and the piano is safely standing on top of the steps, again it must be mounted onto the dolly. For upright pianos, this dolly mount and every dolly mount will depend upon the consideration of the number of consecutive stairs to be further encountered in the remaining move path. If there will be 1 step or less on the move path, put the upright piano up onto the dolly on it's feet. If there will be more than 1 step, put the upright piano up onto the dolly on it's side. For grand pianos always mount them on the piano skidboard on the dolly.

==CARRYING A PIANO OVER MORE THAN 4 CONSECUTIVE STEPS==

If there are too many consecutive steps at any given point in the move path these tip and lift - cheat techniques will not work. More than 4 low consecutive steps in the move path automatically dictates to the crew that they must carry the piano. 

Notice in the picture below that the first step has been cheated with the dolly and just 3 more steps are well covered by the piano's bottom. The 4th step that it could reach would not be covered enough for a safe cheat and in this case there is even one more step above that one so this crew will absolutely have to carry this piano in order to to traverse all the steps.


Carrying the piano up / down stairs is the most dangerous part of piano moving and this is the reason why we try to convince you to not move your piano yourself. Once the piano is being carried, even if it is only being raised or lowered 1 or 2 steps at a time, it can very easily go out of balance and get away from the crew causing terrible things to happen very, very rapidly resulting in severe injury and / or piano damage. So please pay close attention to that part of the website's instruction about actually carrying the piano. For now we will just stay general in our discussion about how-to-move your piano.

==TRUCKING A PIANO==

Dollying the piano to and lifting or carrying it over steps is repeated as many times as necessary until finally the piano can be dollied up the ramp or be lift gate loaded onto the truck. Then, once on the truck, the upright piano has to be taken off of the dolly and placed on its feet, keyboard side facing into the wall of the truck. A grand piano is taken off of its dolly and placed on its piano skidboard with the top side of the piano facing the truck's wall. Never truck a piano on the dolly because it might break loose and roll around in the truck while it's being driven causing terrible damage.

You place the piano with it's keyboard side (padded) facing the wall of the truck so that it if it gets accidentally scraped it only happens to the piano's backside which does no effective damage to the piano's finish. Its front keyboard side is protected from truck wall scraping damage by its pad. You place a grand piano with its padded top facing the wall for the same reason.

The piano needs to be securely double or triple belted to the truck wall and then it can be trucked. Drive it to a position on the street or in a parking lot as close to the destination point as possible. Remember - always first use the truck as much as possible for transport and then use the dolly for what's left of the move path, right to the set down point in the new residence, only cheating or carrying the piano when necessary.

==CONSERVING HUMAN ENERGY DURING PIANO MOVING==

In the picture below the ramp would not reach all the way up to the top of the porch so the movers had to place it one step down from the top and then use a little cheat to get the piano up and over the top step on the dolly. This is an excellent example of conserving human energy because lesser trained piano movers would have given up on using the ramp because it was too short and instead carried this piano up all of the stairs to the porch. These guys did it the easier way up on the dolly using the ramp and a little cheat.

Again let us reiterate, you always want to try to use as little human strength during a piano move as possible as they are doing here. The secret to do it yourself piano moving (or any kind of self moving for that matter) is to have plenty of people on each segment of the move so that you don't get overloaded or rushed to get the job done. You also need to have the right equipment to do the job as easily as possible. Everyone should use the piano moving equipment and good piano moving technique and should be constantly thinking of easier ways to accomplish each moving task with the minimum amount of human exertion. Always try to only make exertions when absolutely necessary because, besides exhausting people of their strength, any exertion, especially strong exertions, can lead to an unwanted injury like a hernia or a back problem. Strong exertions can also lead to damages to the piano!

Once you arrive at the destination and are safely parked, the upright piano is unbelted from the truck wall and remounted on the dolly, again on its feet or on its side depending on the aforementioned 4 consecutive low steps rule. Next, it is dollied and cheated and / or carried (as circumstances dictate) over stairs to its destination point. Then it is dismounted from the dolly, being careful not to nick or chip the piano's bottom edge or the floor, and it is set in place (sometimes into cups for the casters so as not to gouge the floor in the future). Grand pianos of course, need to be fully reassembled before they are set in place. The piano move is now completed! 

Sounds pretty simple doesn't it? It can actually occur that way for you and your crew if all of you carefully study all of our instructions and take your time and use our techniques and our piano moving equipment correctly and think! Think! Think! Also again let us remind you, before you proceed please be sure to review our sections on piano moving warnings and piano moving equipment costs.

if your system breaks down from complexity, do not add more to it.  Adding complexity to a system that malfunctions because of its complexity, only guarantees the same failure later

The soul of an engineer is not revealed through what he knows; rather it resides in how he finds what he does ''not'' know.  And as always: a true master will insist he is merely a student.

Richimoto Here, I was thinking of writing a book and found this cool WikiBooks site.  

I like computers, cars, and most forms of dance/techno/electronic music.  

I have a CAD program and some image editing apps.  I also have a 3D Modelling program, but I am new to it, so I am still learning its specifics...

==Currently==
I must apologize. whilst trying to learn my new (read LEGAL) graphics apps, i was sidetracked by a new video game, hassles at work, and my friend set me up on one of those hosting/blogging/messaging websites. dammit I am trying to learn new 3D software! the last thing i need is new password/login ID+buddies!  If I were not so persnickity on images, i could have posted some nasty doodle type .gif but you my dear reader deserve the best I can do, wich is hard to do. That is why I like doing it...(p.s.Mr. Horning is on the right track to consolodate our automotive efforts, when possible, join me in supporting him.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Minimizing the Total Cost of your Move==


You won't save money by renting the cheapest, smallest moving truck because you'll probably have some kind of unexpected cost increasing trouble with it like having to make an extra trip or having to leave some things behind because they won't fit on the truck!

You won't save money by being cheap with your free help. Provide some refreshments for your volunteer friends / relatives because otherwise they'll just want to leave early or they won't come at all. Pizzas or cold cut sandwiches are inexpensive and filling. Save alcoholic beverages until after all the moving is done and the truck is returned. 

You won't save money by rushing your moving crew because this will make them nervous and lead to damages or personal injuries. If you have free volunteer labor then why rush them?  That's not going to save you anything. Instead just relax and enjoy their company and be thankful for any help at all that you get from them even if they're slow as molasses. You can always jump in and help the slowpokes to speed up their tasks. Keep in mind the movers are professional and have a duty of care not to damage your goods. It is worth a move taking 30 minutes longer over all to have your favorite chair in one piece. 

If you're using professional movers who are charging by the hour let them work at their own pace. If you think they're moving too slowly complain to the management after the move is over and ask for a refund of some of your labor costs. Rushing a professional moving crew while they're doing your job will only backfire on you because they'll resent an amateur like yourself telling them what to do. And if they are slow then do not tip them even if they pressure you to do so. 
Make sure that they have a written guarantee of service. Insurance does not cover accidental damage, and lets face it you cant prove to an insurance company it was deliberate!

Save your complaints for management and pay by credit card only.  If they don't make things right then dispute the charge with your credit card company.  You may also complain to the Better Business Bureau and to your local State Commerce Commission and to your local State Movers and Warehouseman's Association and to any other mover's watchdog agency that you can find. You can also take the company to Small Claims Court where most judges side with the mover's customer and you'll probably get reimbursed much more than the mover wants to give you!

You will save money by renting the appropriate moving equipment to make the job easier. Rent dollies and enough pads to cover all of your furniture so you don't have costly scratch damages. And get plenty of good mover's tape for packing to securing the blanket wrappings to the furniture.

You will save money by obtaining free used boxes wherever you can but don't go insane looking for them. If you run out of time before you have enough boxes then you'll have to buy some, so start collecting them early. Bond paper boxes from your office are great for books and paper files.

You will save money using regular newspapers for packing but you will spend extra time and aggravation hand washing everything you pack in them because newsprint ink won't come off in the dishwasher. And be aware that if you wrap porous items like clay pots or lampshades or rough finish computers in them you'll never get the newsprint ink out. 

Also be aware that if your being moved by a volunteer moving crew and no one gets injured and nothing gets broken during your move they have saved you from 60% to 75% of what you would have paid a professional moving company to move you! That's where most of the cost savings occur in do it yourself moving.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Naming policy ==
Every chapter or subpage of [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods]] should start with &quot;Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/&quot; in the module name. This is to identify the owning book. Every logged-in user has a &quot;move&quot; tab (near &quot;edit this page&quot; and &quot;watch&quot;); I will move some of the pages. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:07, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

== Saran Wrap ==
Packing Materials section should state something about the use of saran wrap. It's certainly nothing new to the way companies ship and pack but I think at least in the last 5 years using saran wrap has become an increasingly popular and effective method.

== Sub-sub pages ==

I propose that the sub-pages of [[Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Packing Materials]] be merged into their parent page. They're currently really short and it's cumbersome moving between them, when all the info could fit on a single page. --[[User:Jonathan Kovaciny|Jonathan Kovaciny]] 13:44, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

== Some additional Links ==

As I was told, I am coming here to propose the addition of a link that might be beneficial. What better place to get information about moving than from moving companies themselves? Websites such as http://www.movingservices.net are full of helpful resources, and though they are also businesses, they also provide some great information.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Packing &amp; Moving Your Household Goods/Minimizing Moving Aggravation

==Minimizing your Moving Aggravation==

Moving preparation and organization are the major determining factors to achieving an efficient move with a minimal amount of aggravation. Premove planning will go a long way towards making your move is trouble-free because it will help you to foresee a lot of things well ahead of moving day. Moving organization is major when it comes to minimizing your moving aggravation. 

Hazards should be noted ahead of time. You should advise all of your moving people of any damaged or fragile furniture, weak or broken stairs, loose railings or of any other impediments which they may encounter on the move path at either location. 

If you live in a high-rise building, be sure to reserve exclusive elevator time well in advance of your move date. Make sure that another move does not coincide with yours or you'll waste a whole lot of time sharing the elevator with the other movers and in so doing, things may get mixed up. Some high-rise buildings have a loading dock designed to accommodate only one truck at a time. If your move is delayed and another mover is scheduled to use it after you, you may lose your spot to them at the loading dock and / or you may have to finish your move another day! Some building management personnel, especially in hi-rise condominiums, are stubborn and unbending on elevator time schedules. 

Parking in front of your residence should be reserved for your moving truck. Do whatever you can to reserve close-by parking for your moving truck at your originating and destination addresses. You can reserve parking spaces with your car, a friend or relative's car, or saw horses. Call your local police dept. or your alderman / city councilman to get no parking signs to put out in advance to save the close-by parking spaces for the day of your move. Police will honor these and will have violators towed away for you. Remember, your moving van cannot block the street or the alley or the police might ticket it. 

Also, if the movers have to walk half a block with your furniture to or from the truck, your move will become quite aggravating because it will take longer and cost you more and you will have greater risk of damages.

Don't forget your ladders, hoses, garden tools and toolboxes. Be absolutely certain that everything has been loaded on the truck before releasing the moving crew to the next location. It is not wise to leave a location early or to be absent from either location for very long since you may have important information in your mind that has not yet been communicated to the movers. If you were to leave early or arrive at the destination late, everything may not be done the way you had hoped it would be done.

Do a walk thru of your old residence after the moving truck has been loaded with all of its contents. Double check everywhere including all cabinets, drawers, closets, pantries, bins, under the stairs, attic, basement, garage, nooks and crannies, in the back yard or storage lockers. Make sure you have all of the hardware to any disassembled furniture pieces so that it can easily be located for reassembly. Look at all inside or outside places where small things like tools or hardware can be left sitting (including window sills and corners).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Meeting Moving Time Deadlines

==Meeting your Moving Day / Time Deadlines==

You need to set realistic deadlines for tasks such as sorting and disposal, packing and cleaning to be done before move day. Then you need to strive to keep them. This way you will be fully prepared for your ultimate time deadline of your actual move day as compared to if you procrastinate and wait until the last minute to try to get everything ready.

If people are going to help you sort, clean and pack then make a full party day out of it, giving yourself plenty of hours and help to get everything done. A full Saturday or Sunday usually works best because people are off from work and have time available. Have cleaning supplies and packing materials handy so that trips to the store are not necessary. This is a good time to use up your old cleaning supplies so that you won't have to move them on moving day. Have refreshments available for nibbling all thru the party but do not bring out alcoholic beverages until everything is done.

Confirm your moving date and time with all of your moving personnel one or two weeks in advance. Plan to have an early breakfast at a nearby restaurant that you pay for on your day of move. Here, in a nice, friendly, casual environment you can relax, pull your thoughts together and advise each person of potential problems, elevator times, and special needs such as last minute packing, handyman work, etc before starting the job. They can also give you advice and you should listen carefully to all that is discussed because many minds can improve your plans.

If possible plan for a second day to finish the move out of your old residence because you may need extra time to finish everything and to cleanup at either location. But if your move must all be done in one day, when you confirm their planned participation alert them to please stay until the very end.

Try to get way more than enough people to commit to you to help you with your move. Make a hard job easy! On moving day things will get done very rapidly and easily if more than enough people are helping. One of the managers at Burrows Moving Company had to move his 5-room apartment from a high third floor to his new residence on a second floor. He used 8 men instead of the usual 4 or 5 that most people would use on a move this size. The job was entirely finished in only 4 hours instead of 7 or 8 hours and then the movers were still pretty fresh and not all worn out. So, when they were done they all went out and got some beer and pizza and spent the rest of the afternoon watching the football games!

And please be aware that some committed people will not make it on moving day for one reason or another, so by having more than enough people precommitted, when this happens you'll end up with at least just enough to do the job.

      <text xml:space="preserve">MINIMIZING YOUR TIME SPENT ON THE MOVING TASK

Generally speaking there are all kinds of moving checklists to be found on the Internet. Most of these are concerned with finding a new residence, transferring bank accounts, notifying the post office of change of address, transferring schools for children, etc. These are very important and necessary things for you to plan for and do but they are not included here for now. We will be updating this section with that information in the near future but for now just do a Google search on the term &quot;moving checklists&quot; and you'll find plenty of them. We have elected to limit our moving checklist here to just tasks necessary for the transport of your household goods.

Some of the following entries may even be too much formal planning for a small move but these are still steps that will need to be taken. 

The limited moving checklist categories that we suggest you make are;

# Setting Date of Move

# Setting Packing Date(s)

# Setting Disposal Date

# Establishing a List of Helpers and Dates that they will Help

# Who will Obtain Inexpensive Moving Materials 

# Each Room - Sorting / Disposing / Packing Plan

# Researching and Date of Scheduling Handymen / Technicians 

# Premove Planning for Furniture Disassembly / Reassembly / Padding

# Researching to Find and Reserve the Right Rental Truck 

# Furniture Placement Planning for Destination



Sorting out household goods and disposing of unnecessary things and carefully packing or wrapping the things you are keeping, in advance of move day, expedites your move. 

You can usually take your sweet time unpacking many things when you are done with the move.

==SAFETY OF ARTICLES BEING RELOCATED==

Generally speaking, prior to being carried or dollied out of your residence, most household goods should be blanket wrapped or boxed up in order to prevent damages to them while they are being transported.

All goods that can be packed in boxes should each be thoroughly bubble wrapped or paper wrapped in such a manner that they won't clank or roll around loose inside the box. If bubble wrap is unavailable wrap items in paper and use crushed paper all around the box and in between each item for further protection. Actually, bunched up paper is the best cushioning for boxed goods, even better than bubble wrap because the bubbles can break within the bubble wrap, especially along the edges of things so it can lose its cushioning property.

As the box is being filled, the things inside should be further protected with additional bubble wrap or bunched up paper on the bottom, on the sides and on the top of the box. Then close and well seal the box with tape. Don't just slide the four flaps on the top and bottom together because they can come loose as it's being handled and breakables can fall out of the box. Instead, again not sliding the flaps together but just closing them, always use at least 3 runs of tape to seal each end of the box. Run the tape from the middle of the side of the box up and over or down and under it and down / up the other side finishing by overlapping the top and bottom tape ends in the middle of the side of the box so that they won't come loose. Run your hand over all of this taping to make sure that it is stuck tightly to the box sealing it well. 

All furniture should be completely and snugly blanket wrapped top and bottom. This protects the furnishing from scuffing, scratching or scraping. Moving pads can be rented with your truck from the truck rental facility.

Any thing that cannot be padded for protection like bicycles, long floor lamps, rolled up big rugs, etc. should be very carefully carried and loaded somewhere in the truck where nothing will damage it or else put it into someone's car. The key consideration when relocating your home, after the mover's safety of course, is to do the move without damages to your goods or furnishings.

==MOVERS SAFETY==

The very most important consideration for your moving task is Mover's Safety. The following are just a few moving safety tips to protect your moving helpers…. ok??

Always wear good waterproof shoes with firm slip resistant soles.

Make sure your path is clear and well lighted before carrying a load.

If possible, know where to put down a load before you even lift the load up.

Everyone watch for and signal others of uneven surfaces which could cause tripping and / or stumbling or could cause a load to dump from a dolly. 

Never hurry when carrying a load. Take your time and if the load's heavy, set it down periodically and rest. Your strength will last longer with occasional rests. 

When carrying big furniture using 2-3-4 men be sure you can hear one another and that you all speak the same language. Use simple, short commands that can be yelled to one another when visibility is restricted like pick and set and go and stop and backup! 

Organize your work area to eliminate unnecessary redundant lifting or moving.

If walking over snow or ice or water or over a padded glossy hardwood floor take extra care to stay balanced and to not slip.

Keep children &amp; pets out of the moving area.

Remember, we cannot emphasize it enough; Mover's Safety is the very most important consideration when moving yourself!!!

      <text xml:space="preserve">High Value Items - Currency / Coin / Stamp Collections, Artwork, Statuary.

Do all moving of high value items very carefully and privately by yourself. If anything gets broken or disappears for some reason you only want yourself to blame. Don't trust anybody else with these kinds of light, extremely valuable items because if anything goes wrong regarding them during your move, it will become a nightmare for all of you. Breakage or loss of these kinds of valuables can lead to accusations, outbursts of anger, loss of friendship or close relationship, police involvement, law suits, etc., etc., etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Parking

Parking near your residence should be easily accessible for your truck. Do whatever you can to reserve adequate parking for your moving truck. Reserve spaces with your car, a friend's car, or saw horses. See your alderman or the police department to get no parking signs to save the spaces for the day of your move. Remember the moving van cannot block the street. Also, if your moving people have to walk half a block with your furniture because they could not block a street or an alley then the move will take a lot longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pets, Children and Elderly==

Pets and small children or the elderly (who are no longer competent) should  be present when the move occurs and be sure your moving people are advised that you have pets so that any with allergies can medicate beforehand. Take precautions so that your animals do not escape. Small children and the elderly although useless in many respects; should be allowed to help in their own ways. For example, a small child putting a small box of their own clothing on the moving van.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Disassembly== 

When necessary remove mirrors from dressers or walls and pack them. Place them upright against a wall out of the way so that they don’t get broken. Remove air conditioners from windows. 

Disassemble items that need to be taken apart and carefully save any hardware involved. Sometimes lost hardware is virtually impossible to replace. Put hardware in a baggie and if it goes with a desk or dresser; tape it inside the drawer where it can be found later. If it goes with a bed, tie the baggie to the bed rails.

Currently I plan to fill out the outline thus far, and as I go, I will discover where slots are needed in the outline, and where more specific information will be needed.  I will try to establish appropriate cross-reference linking, and the graphics are on the way.  I forgot how much bla bla is involved in cars... ;)

I do not agree that it is a good idea to merge with automotive repair.
It is quite different topics, where cross references may be a better idea.
[[User:LarsPensjo|LarsPensjo]] 08:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

I also do not agree that this should be merged. I have added some basic history on the main page which I will continue when I get a chance. Hopefully, some edits will begin again because automotive systems information and history is plentiful but scattered. [[User:F75.gx1r|F75.gx1r]] 10:52, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

IMO should not be merged. Auto systems will cover a lot of details that will not be relevant to auto repair. Software for example.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hazards==

Hazards should be noted ahead of time. You should advise your moving people of damaged or very fragile furniture, weak or broken stairs, or impediments that may affect the move so that they can take extra care when around them.
==Liquids==
Cleaning supplies, oils, liquid foods, paint and solvent containers should all be checked for a tight seal if you'd rather save and move them. In that case box them up, stuffing the boxes with a lot of bunched up paper, towels or cloths to absorb any drippage or spillage that might still occur. One good idea is to put one heavy-duty plastic trash bag into a second one and then line the box with this double layer to hold in any liquids that might spill. Bottles and cans of liquids should be stood upright in the box using packing paper bunched up between some to hold them upright. Never put ammonia and bleach bottles in the same box because the combination of those 2 particular household chemicals has been known to cause explosions! Place any boxes of liquids on the floor of the truck, not up in the load where spillage could damage your household goods underneath.
==Alcoholic Beverages==
It is against the law to transport alcoholic beverage containers that have already been opened in any motor vehicle - even locked in the back of a truck - so definitely dispose of them!

==Elevator Buildings==

If you live in a hi-rise building have enough people to get done soon enough to meet your reserved elevator time. Also make sure that another move does not coincide on the same day and time as yours. Some high-rise buildings have loading docks designed to accommodate only one truck at a time. If the move is delayed due to no fault of your own, you may still have to pay the waiting time for the dock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Proper Carrying and Lifting

==Lifting and Carrying==

Lift heavy items primarily with your legs. Squat directly in front of the load, pull it in tight to you and lift it with your legs, not your back. Set it back down the same way. If you must turn while carrying the load, then turn your whole body with your legs, don't swivel yourself at the waist. This simple moving tip can help you to avoid severe back injury while moving.

End tip big furniture pieces like sofas and armoires in order for the movers on both ends to get a good grip on the piece. When carrying the piece always be prepared to quickly set it down in case one or the other of the helpers is losing his grip or the piece is just too heavy for him to carry.

Use Teflon furniture glides such as Moving Men cups placed under big appliances and the legs of big furniture pieces in order to slide them around without damaging the floors. If you don’t have any glides then place a pad under the piece with enough hanging out to grip and pull the piece on it so the floor won’t get scratched.

If you can obtain some kind of a long, strong strap like a mover’s humpstrap do so. Then when you are carrying a large furniture piece up or down the stairs you can use it strung under the bottom of the piece to lift it without having to bend over to do so. The person on the top end of the carry uses it to hold the furniture piece so that he can stay upright all through the carry.

==Blanket Wrapping Furniture==

Blanket wrap all furniture, tables and chairs prior to moving them from your residence in order to fully protect them during the entire moving process. Don’t remove the pads until the furniture piece is to be put in place in the new residence. Secure the pads over the top and down all the 4 sides and even under the bottom of the furniture piece. This way it is fully protected no matter how you carry it or which way you set it down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Packing &amp; Moving Household Goods/Last Minute Issues

==Last Minute Considerations==

Get your ladders, hoses, and toolbox. Be absolutely certain that everything has been loaded onto the truck before releasing the moving crew to the next location. It is not wise to leave the originating location early or to be absent from either location for very long since you may have important information not yet communicated to your moving people. If you were to leave, everything may not be done as you had hoped it would be.

Walk Through

After the truck has been loaded with your residence’s contents, everyone should do a walk through to check for missed things. Double-check all cabinets, drawers, closets, pantries, bins, nooks, crannies, stairways, attic, basement, garage, or storage lockers. Make sure you have all hardware to disassembled pieces so that it can easily be located. Look at all inside or outside places where things can be left sitting (including window sills).

Hi I found your wikibook, and just want to let you know that I added to the engineering bookshelf in a new category Automotive.  I found some other titles that I have put in there also.  I think we may be able to get quite a section going...  good luck with your work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Start Packing Early==
Don't save all your packing for the last day! This is one of our major packing and moving tips! Begin packing items that are not normally needed well in advance because packing gets more and more tiresome over time. So it is wise to jump-start the packing endeavor as much as possible while you are enthused about it.

Basically, use common sense when packing. Pack heavier things like books and canned goods in smaller boxes, and pack lighter things in progressively larger boxes. Never make a box heavier than the lady of the house can handle, since she may be the one who ends up moving it around before or after the move. A book box full of books or records or paperwork will weigh approximately 40 to 50 lbs. This is quite heavy so don’t make bigger boxes heavier than that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Packing Table==
Set up a worktable or cover your kitchen or dining room table so that you can do the majority of your packing on it in the upright position. Bending and stooping to pack will wear you out quickly and cause muscle aches. Keep this work area as open as possible to make the packing task easier for you.

Stack each packed box against a wall out of the way after it is sealed shut to await moving day. Keep clear, unobstructed paths in your residence to prevent the possibility of tripping.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Packing Materials==
The moving industry has standard sized boxes that are best to use during your move if you can get them from a local mover or moving supply house. These include wardrobes (comes with a bar across the top to hang clothes on), dish packs (for dishes!), large, medium and book cartons (small).  There are also mirror/picture cartons for mirrors, pictures, glass table tops and other fragile, large, flat objects and matress cartons for matresses.  Don't forget that someone has to pick the box up after you pack it - don't load heavy objects in a large carton.  You may also want to use bond paper boxes from your workplace, which are good for holding books and other small heavy items. All staples in top and bottom box flaps (not the staples on one side of the box that hold it together) of other kinds of boxes should be removed so as to safeguard surfaces such as wood floors, counter tops, and furniture where cartons may be stacked prior to pickup and after delivery.

Packer’s tape is best for sealing your boxes shut but be sure to get a good grade of it because cheaper grades tend to break unexpectedly.  Make sure the bottom of the box it well taped.

Use bunched up clean paper or bubble wrap to pack your fragiles. Bunched up paper is considered the best of all wrappings for cushioning as opposed to hard to handle peanuts that can shift around in the box or bubble wrap that loses its cushioning power if some of the bubbles break.

Plastic wrap is great for keeping lids on things or keeping furniture drawers or doors shut without using tape and leaving its hard to remove residue on the finish. File cabinets and big plastic storage bins are good candidates for this treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Beware of Newspaper Print==
Newspaper print residue must be hand washed off of all things it touches; dishwasher washing will not take it off. Also, print residue can ruin porous items like clay pots or lampshades or items with a rough finish like computer equipment. Packer’s paper is newspaper without print. It can be purchased most economically at a mover’s supply warehouse and movers will also sell it to you.

One possible solution is to use clothing to wrap, protect and cover fragile items.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Box Taping==
Do not interlock box flaps together - always tape bottoms and tops with at least three strips of tape and at least halfway up or down the sides of the box for strength. Remember that taping reinforces the strength of the box, and yet can be easily cut with a blade later when unpacking. So use plenty of tape to secure your boxes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Box Marking==
Simplify parcel marking by making your information 100% visible.  I wrote patents on this topic... US Patent 6090027 which marks a corner on three sides... with ink making it visible 21/24 viewings.  And then US Patent 
6598783 which connects any two corners with ink... with ink making it visible
24/24 times... as a dice may rotate. www.BoxRudders.com for live 3DModels
that rotate online. Acrobat documents online show proof of views...
This works on flat parcels and objects as well. 

Mark the top and sides of all cartons by writing on the tape after the box is sealed shut. Describe contents and destination location (such as bedroom, kitchen, or basement). Have the writing on the box facing up to indicate which side of the box is up and which is down so that your movers don’t turn the box upside down during moving. 

Marking boxes well will make identifying where things are in them easier when they are stacked on top of each other or in their new location. If the box is being reused, then using fresh tape over marked tape eliminates old markings. Some packers like to use color-coding such as colored tape wrapped once around the box or colored stickers pasted on the box to identify in what room at the destination to put the box.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lifting ==

Lift heavy items primarily with your legs. Squat directly in front of the load, pull it in tight to you and lift it with your legs, not your back. Set it back down the same way. If you must turn while carrying the load, then turn your whole body with your legs, don't swivel yourself at the waist. This simple moving tip can help you to avoid severe back injury while packing or moving.

Thoroughly wrap fragile items individually with packer’s paper, bubble wrap or foam wrap depending on the item. Use plenty of paper to line the top, bottom and side of each box for fragiles. Add cardboard to further cushion your fragiles. Never be afraid to use plenty of paper when packing expensive fragiles. Even if you feel like you're wasting money on paper - you're not because buying paper is a lot cheaper than fixing or replacing a broken expensive fragile item.  Small fragile items may be wrapped and set into large, less fragile items for additional protection.

Utilize empty Tupperware or kitchen plastic containers to protect some of your smaller fragiles from shock. Paper wrap the fragile item and put it into the plastic container, seal its lid shut and put the container into a box with other fragiles. Well sealed small plastic containers make excellent double protectors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Small Items ==

Special care must be taken with small items so as not to lose them within the packing materials in a box. Taping over their wrapping is a good technique to highlight a small item (like the top of a sugar bowl) as not being merely a piece of  bunched up paper (use brightly colored tape if available). Also, you could tape several of those small packets together into one bigger, heavier package that will stand out in the wrappings.

Wrap loose, small things such as silverware in bundles. Don't leave them loose in the box to clank around.

Glassware and china should be wrapped with enough paper so as not to clatter within the box. You can also wrap glassware in small bubble wrap. Use plenty of paper to line the top, bottom and side of each box. Glasses should also be individually wrapped and packed standing up; they're stronger when standing than if laid on their side. Place in boxes marked fragile and stack all fragile boxes together for the movers.
Make sure that you have overflow the box with paper and now you have to use some force to seal the box. This is to insure that items would not move around during transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Plates ==

Plates should each be separated with disposable plastic or paper plates and wrapped in bundles of 4 to 6. Then stand the bundles on their side in a box with a cloud of soft stuff underneath- NEVER lay plate bundles flat; all the weight would be on the bottom plate, and if the box is set down too strongly - the bottom plate could break!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Oil Paintings ==

Each oil painting should be covered over with a non-acidic clear plastic wrap and then bubble wrapped or wrapped in a paper pad, or foam wrap, and then placed in a picture box or a flattened out box, taping the ends shut once it's inside. Bubble wrap can leave impressions of the bubbles on oil paintings so be sure to use the non-acidic clear plastic wrap over the oil so that this doesn't happen.  

Another option is to cover the oil painting with '''glassine'''.  This is like wax paper, except a LOT larger.  It is non-acidic.  And it is available from most moving companies.  When loading the packed Oil Paintings into a truck, keep them on their edge, do NOT lay flat, and keep closer to the floor rather than the roof where the temperatures are a lot hotter.--[[User:Get-moving|Get-moving]] ([[User talk:Get-moving|talk]]) 23:51, 15 August 2008 (UTC)

''(Someone who knows, please fix the above inconsistency: it first says &quot;non-acidic clear plastic wrap&quot;, then later it says &quot;acidic clear wrap&quot; - which is it?)''

Each of these should be individually wrapped in blankets and then packed in picture cartons or in flattened out cartons big enough to hold them with plenty of cushion on the ends and taped shut.

Each of these should be placed in separate boxes with only one lamp or shade to a box, wrapped in clean white paper. Do not use newspaper with print or it will permanently mark the shades. Be sure the inside of each lampshade box is clean so that the shade does not pick up dirt.

These should be used for holding special things because they are so easily identifiable in the clutter of move day. Things like winter / summer clothing or linens / sweaters are things that could be packed into them. Don't put CD's that could be shattered or heavy books into them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dispose of all Open Liquids ==
 
Cleaning supplies, oils, liquid foods, paint and solvent containers should all be checked for a tight seal if you'd rather save and move them. In that case box them up, stuffing the boxes with a lot of bunched up paper, towels or cloths to absorb any drippage or spillage that might still occur. One good idea is to put one heavy-duty plastic trash bag into a second one and then line the box with this double layer to hold in any spilled liquids. Bottles and cans of liquids should be stood upright in the box using packing paper bunched up between some to hold them upright. Never put ammonia and bleach bottles in the same box because the combination of those 2 particular household chemicals has been known to cause explosions! Place any boxes of liquids on the floor of the truck, not up in the load where spillage could damage your household goods.

'''Cochinita pibil''' (also '''puerco pibil''') is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] slow-roasted pork dish from the Yucatán.

This version of the dish was adapted from [[Wikipedia:Robert Rodríguez|Robert Rodríguez]]'s DVD extras on ''[[Wikipedia:Once Upon a Time in Mexico|Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]''.  

==Ingredients==

* 5 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|Tbsps.]] (75 ml) [[cookbook:annatto|annatto]] seeds
* 2 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|tsps.]] (10 ml) [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]] seeds
* 1 Tbsp. (15 ml) [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]]
* 8 [[Cookbook:allspice|allspice]] berries
* ½ tsp. (8 ml) whole [[Cookbook:clove|cloves]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:chile peppers|habanero chile]]s (or milder chile)
* ½ [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] (120 ml) [[Cookbook:orange |orange]] juice
* ½ cup (120 ml) white [[Cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]]
* 2 Tbsps. (30 ml) [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 8 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* juice of 5 [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]]s
* splash of [[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Tequila|tequila]]
* 5 pounds (2.3 kg) [[Cookbook:pork|pork]] butt
* [[Cookbook:Banana|banana]] leaves and/or heavy-duty [[Cookbook:Aluminum Foil|aluminum foil]]
* white or Spanish [[Cookbook:rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:taco|taco]] shells, or [[Cookbook:tortilla|tortilla]]s for serving

== Procedure ==

# Place the annatto, cumin, peppercorns, allspice, and cloves in a spice grinder and process to a '''fine''' powder.  (You can use an electric coffee grinder for the spices, but it will not be suitable for coffee afterwards.)
# Remove the seeds and veins from the habanero chiles and chop coarsely. (If you want a hotter dish, leave some of the veins and seeds in.  If you want a milder dish, substitute a milder chile.)
# Process the orange juice, vinegar, chiles, salt, garlic, and the powder you made in step 1 in a [[Cookbook:blender|blender]] or [[Cookbook:food processor|food processor]] until liquefied. Add the lemon juice and tequila.
# Cut the pork into 2 inch (5 cm) chunks.  Leave the fat on the meat, to keep the pork moist while roasting; you can remove it after cooking if you wish. Place in a large, self-sealing plastic bag with the [[Cookbook:marination|marinade]]. Seal bag and turn to evenly coat the meat. Refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours, turning occasionally.
# Heat oven to 325° F (160° C).  Dump the meat and the marinade in a roasting pan lined with banana leaves or foil, making sure to wrap tightly so no steam escapes.  If using banana leaves, an outer wrapping with foil will help seal in the steam.  [[Cookbook:Roast|Roast]] for 4 hours. Open packet carefully; the meat should shred easily with a fork.
# Serve over rice, or shred and serve with taco shells or tortillas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The family is the basic unit of society and is important to both individuals and communities. The world is rapidly changing, making today's society much more complex than ever before. As Scouts earn this merit badge, they will realize why it is important to know more about family life and how to strengthen their families.

Requirements

1. Prepare an outline on what a family is and discuss this with your merit badge counselor. Tell why families are important to individuals and to society. Discuss how the actions of one member can affect other members.

2. List several reasons why you are important to your family and discuss this with your parents or guardians and with your merit badge counselor.

3. Prepare a list of your regular home duties or chores (at least five) and do them for 90 days. Keep a record of how often you do each of them.

4. With the approval of your parents or guardians and your merit badge counselor, decide on and carry out a project that you would do around the home that would benefit your family. Submit a report to your merit badge counselor outlining how the project benefited your family.

5. Plan and carry out a project that involves the participation of your family. After completing the project, discuss the following with your merit badge counselor:
a. The objective or goal of the project
b. How individual members of your family participated
c. The results of the project

6.Do the following:
a. Discuss with your merit badge counselor how to plan and carry out a family meeting.
b. After this discussion, plan and carry out a family meeting to include the following subjects:
1. Avoiding substance abuse, including tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, all of which negatively affect your health and well-being
2. Understanding the growing-up process and how the body changes, and making responsible decisions dealing with sex
3. Personal and family finances
4. A crisis situation within your family
5. The effect of technology on your family
6. Good etiquette and manners
Discussion of each of these subjects will very likely carry over to more than one family meeting.

7.Discuss the following with your counselor:
a. Your understanding of what makes an effective father and why, and your thoughts on the father's role in the family
b. Your understanding of the responsibilities of a parent

'''Comments:''' 

*The German book is a great book to vote for. Even though it isn't complete, it is very well designed. And it has done many firsts, like it was the first to have a title, which is &quot;Äußern!&quot;, just for example. Also when it's ''first'' cover page was successfully made, many of the language books mimicked it. This is one of the oldest language books, and deserves to be showcased. --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 23:06, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

*Jwbaten3 created lots of minor edits to own usertalk page to meet 20 edit criteria (which is against the spirit of the voting rules). Therefore I feel this vote should be ignored, --[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:31, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
:Yes, I agree. --[[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 00:29, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

*This is an excellent language book. --[[User:Nov ialiste|Novialiste]] 12:32, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Structure==

Multinational corporations may be structured in a number of ways. 

===Pyramid===

In a '''pyramid''' structure, one parent company controls a number of subsidiary companies, each of which specializes in a particular type of business or a particular region of the world. Most MNCs headquartered in the US and Europe are organized around a pyramid structure.

Some pyramids may have more than one company at the top. Shell and Unilever are two well-known examples: both have two parent companies, one in the UK and one in the Netherlands.

===Consortium===

A '''consortium''' is a group of independent companies who collaborate on major business projects. One well-known consortium is Airbus Industrie, which existed for many years as a consortium of four European aerospace companies before it was incorporated as a French company in 2001.

===Keiretsu===

The '''keiretsu''' structure originated in Japan and is still unique to Japanese MNCs. In a keiretsu, a number of nominally independent companies coordinate operations, and exercise control over each other through extensive '''cross-shareholding'''. During the Cold War era, major keiretsu such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo were organized around major commercial banks; today, this system has weakened somewhat.

==Unitary nature==

Most multinationals are treated as a single company for accounting purposes, but each company is treated separately for tax purposes.

==Domicile==

Corporations have a form of &quot;citizenship,&quot; in that they are formed and headquartered in a particular state. This concept is called '''domicile'''. A company's internal affairs are generally governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is domiciled.

In the United States, as in the Netherlands, domicile is based upon the state in which the company is incorporated. Most large companies are incorporated in the state of Delaware, but headquartered in New York or another location; their domicile is considered to be Delaware even if they engage in no business there.

In large parts of Europe, but excluding the Netherlands and other countries, domicile is based upon the company's place of management (called ''siège'' in French and ''Sitz'' in German). A company may be managed in a different location from its principal place of business, and still keep domicile in the place of management; see ''Centros v. Erhvervs-og Selkabsstyrelsen'', [1999] ECR 1-1459.

Domicile generally determines which laws will apply to the internal affairs of a company. In the U.S. Supreme Court case of ''Sumitomo Shoji v. Avagliano'', 457 U.S. 176 (1982), a New York-domiciled subsidiary of a Japanese company was found to be a New York company; it was therefore subject to U.S. discrimination laws, not to contrary treaty provisions that applied to Japanese companies doing business in the U.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cooling systems remove heat from the engine using the properties of heat transfer.  Modern cars use liquid cooling systems.  These use a fluid circulated within the engine, that is then pumped out of the engine into a radiator, where the heat is released.  Less common is the air cooled engine.  These engines are common in non automotive applications, and have been used successfully in cars.  Air cooled engines use airflow over the surface of the engine to remove excess heat.  Automotive applications generally include a fan to force air over the engine.

In a liquid cooled engine, the liquid coolant is a mixture of distilled water and antifreeze, of which the base ingredient is methyl alcohol.  The fluid is pumped through channels that are manufactured into the engine block.  The fluid draws heat out of the engine and flows into the radiator to be cooled.  The radiator is a set of pipes with thousands of thin metal fins mounted them.  The fins conduct the heat out of the liquid which is cooled enough to be cycled back into the engine to repeat the process.  The radiator has a fan that blows outside air against the fins.  This increases the amount of air that flows over the cooling fins of the radiator and allow for more heat to be removed from the liquid coolant.

Since combustion engines operate better at a higher temperature, a device called a 'thermostat' is designed into the cooling system of modern engines to help them warm up more quickly.  A thermostat is a small valve in the cooling system which is closed when the engine is cold.  This blocks the coolant from flowing into the radiator and allows it to heat up at a quicker pace.  As the coolant reaches the desired temperature, wax in the thermostat melts and pressurizes which forces the valve open.  The coolant is now able to flow into the radiator ensuring that the engine temperature stays constant and does not overheat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Engines deliver different power and torque levels at different speeds, range of driving speeds varies greatly.  An engine turning at a very low speed needs gear reduction to move a car from a stop.  However, the vehicle speed would be limited by the engine's top speed.  The transmission allows the vehicle to operate over a larger speed range, while keeping the engine speed within operating range.

In most automobiles, engine power depends solely on the accelerator position. Different conditions demand different power requirements. While starting, for example, one needs some amount of power to overcome the static rolling resistance. However, very little power is required while cruising at constant speeds.

It is up to the driver to make maximum use of the power made available by pressing the accelerator pedal. This he does by assessing the driving conditions regarding torque and speed requirements. Taking the case of starting the vehicle, since a large amount of torque is required, the engine power(engine torque*engine rpm)is reconditioned by the transmission to the wheel power (wheel torque*wheel rpm). In this case, the high engine rpm is sacrificed for a high wheel torque by the transmission (first gear). Thus, the driver directs the power developed by the engine to produce more torque after assessing the driving condition. He aptly selects the first gear as it provides the highest reduction of engine rpm. Conversely, while moving on a smooth road at a high speed, there is very little rolling resistance (lower coefficient of kinetic friction) and hence very little torque requirement. Hence the engine torque is magnified only by the final drive (differential/transaxle) while retaining most of the engine's high speed. Again, it was made possible by the driver who shifted to a higher gear after assessing the driving conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The differential is a device that splits power between 2 wheels.  As a car drives straight, its wheels will travel the same distance and rotate at the same speed.  When a car turns, the outside wheels will follow a longer path around the curve.  If the inside and outside wheels were connected by a ''mechanically'' solid axle, they would force each other to rotate at the same speed.  The speed difference between the wheels on the shorter, inside path and the wheels on the longer, outside path would result in tire wear, poor handling, and if the traction of the tires were too great, the axle itself could be damaged.

Automobiles can have several types of differentials; Open, Limited-Slip, and Locking. An open differential lets either wheel spin at any speed traction allows. The majority of cars on the road have this kind of differential.  A limited slip differential has either viscous liquid or small clutch packs to allow power to go to the wheel with traction while the other wheel is spinning without traction.  This type of differential is mostly seen on sports cars.  A locking differential uses a mechanical connection to lock or unlock both wheels.  The only usual application for this is off-roading in trucks or SUVs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Within the drive train, power is transmitted as rotation, usually along driveshafts.  For various reasons relating to suspension and dynamic loads on the drive train, one end of a drive shaft will move out of line with the other end.  Universal Joints and Constant Velocity Joints (CV Joint) are components that allow a drive shaft to pivot, while still turning, allowing the drive shaft to essentially flex.  A universal joint is an arrangement of 2 yokes and a &quot;spider&quot;  when assembled, the joint can flex but any twist placed on one side will be transmitted to the other side.  Because of its assembly, a universal joint does not transmit torque smoothly, and must be used with another universal joint to even out. 

A constant velocity joint uses a center member, an arrangement of ball bearings and an outer cage.  A CV Joint serves the same purpose as a universal joint, but it has the ability to smoothly transmit rotation, throughout its range.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Automotive systems''' today are a vital part of life all over the world, either by helping to produce, harvest and move food to distribution centers, by moving workers into the economic machine, or simply improving the quality of life by extending the range of movement of populations. To better understand the automotive system in special the common automobile, we can better understand physics, mechanics, chemistry, and how they apply in our lives.

== Considering a car as a complete system ==
The Car.  An entire system in its own right.  The many uses of the automobile have given rise to many forms.  The many makers of cars have each added their own style to these forms.  Even car owners have done much to make even more variations.  Form follows function, and the functions required of a car determine the design parameters and constraints on the car as a whole and every single part of its construction.  Although many different cars have been created to do many different things, and some cars have been created to do many things themselves, across the wide diversity of car uses, shapes, and sizes, most of them have evolved into having very similar systems making up their construction.  Imagine a Formula 1 race car parked next to a new Sport Utility Vehicle.  The differences are immediately and strikingly obvious.  Under the skin, deep within the arrangement of interconnected parts, the 2 vehicles still have quite a lot in common.  Even specific systems such as the suspension, are dramatically different in appearance and construction, yet each performs the same functions on both vehicles. Both cars use a reciprocating combustion engine. They both feature hydraulically operated braking systems.  

This book serves to explain the most common systems, and hopefully explore some of the rare and even odd systems that have been used, as well as diving into the new systems that are now arriving and are on the way.  This book's objective is to present the forces and considerations at play behind the design and functionality of the parts of the system, and the interplay of each system with the others.  Often it will be seen that a part of one system will have an equal role in yet another.

== Engine ==

===Introduction to the Engine===
The engine is the most important part of any car, without an engine there will be no car.

The modern automotive engine is quite a system in itself.  Rather complicated in its entirety, it can also be broken down into a set of subsystems.

Before any discussion of the engine subsystems can begin, an understanding of the engine as a whole must be made.  In our conventional sense, an automotive engine converts the chemical energy in gasoline into mechanical energy of moving a vehicle down the street.  Gasoline is ''burned'' in the engine.  In a process known as combustion, the atoms of the gasoline molecule are combined with atoms of the air molecule, and the result is new compounds and extra energy.  The extra energy is used to propel the car.  

This is an important consideration, because so many of the involved factors are based on the chemical reaction of gasoline + air.

At this time it is important to point out the difference between a ''motor'' and an ''engine''.

A motor ''uses'' energy.  An engine ''converts'' energy.  As a prime example of the difference, let us consider steam.  A steam locomotive would be a steam ''engine''.  The locomotive burns coal or wood, and thereby converts the chemical energy of the fuel into heat.  The heat turns water into steam, the pressure of the steam turns the drive wheels.  However, a steam turbine would be a steam ''motor''.  The steam pressure is created in an external process.  High pressure steam flows into the turbine, creating the mechanical energy.

This brings us to ''internal'' combustion engine.  In the case of the steam locomotive, the combustion takes place in a ''burner'' and the heat from the burner is applied to a boiler.  Steam exits the boiler and enters the mechanisms to turn the wheels, be it a turbine or reciprocating assembly.  This could be called an external combustion engine, because the reaction of fuel and air takes place in the burner, and the conversion to mechanical energy takes place in the drive mechanism.  In the internal combustion engine, the pressure from the combustion itself operates the mechanical parts that create motion.  

Among internal combustion engines, there are several varieties.  Different types of fuel have been successfully used.  Most modern cars burn either diesel fuel or gasoline.    There are also different methods to create motion from the combustion process.  Gas turbines and rotary engines have been used in automobiles, along with the prevalent reciprocating engine.  The reciprocating engine currently exists in two forms; 2-stroke (or 2-cycle) and 4-stroke (or 4-cycle).  These names refer to the length of the combustion cycle within the combustion chamber.  In a 2-stroke engine, the piston will move down (1) during the power/intake stroke, then up (2) during the exhaust/compression stroke. This 2-stroke cycle repeats while the engine is running.

In the 4-stroke engine, the piston moves down (1) for an intake stroke, then up (2) for a compression stroke.  The piston then moves down again (3) forced by the power of combustion, during the power stroke. Finally, the piston moves up (4) in the exhaust stroke.  At this point the 4 stroke cycle repeats while the engine is running.

Some history may be useful here in getting us to a useful understanding of the ICE as we know it today, however. The first known &quot;atmospheric engine&quot; (this term will be explained shortly) was created by Christian Huygen in the 1670's for King Louis XIV. The purpose of this &quot;external combustion engine&quot; was to carry water up a certain altitude from the Seine River to the Palace of Versailles's central pond, in Versailles, France. Although it never actually performed work, this prototype is crucial to ICE development.

The two terms which define his invention are &quot;external combustion&quot; and &quot;atmospheric;&quot; external combustion means that the fuel-energy conversion was occurring outside of the work-producing chamber and atmospheric means that the piston in this engine was exposed to atmospheric pressure. To put these in context, imagine a massive cylinder with a vertical piston and 3 main ports; 2 of these ports are horizontally extending through the chamber wall, separated by some vertical distance, with the third port being at the chamber bottom. The piston itself is attached at the open chamber top by a pulley to some arbitrarily-set device, with the back face of the piston exposed to atmospheric air pressure. 

In this system, a body of water was boiled outside the main chamber (external combustion) and the steam was carried into the main chamber via the lower horizontal port, which would build cylinder pressure and force the piston vertically up until the higher horizontal port was reached. The steam pressure would then dump out into open atmosphere, the atmospheric pressure at the piston-back would force it down, excess water from cooling and condensation would exit out the bottom vertical port, and the pulley-attached device would have some usable working stroke (such as a water carrier from the river Seine up to the Palace of Versailles).

In the next ~90 years, several small but important events would occur. Huygen's associate Dennis Papin actually makes the atmospheric engine work. The Englishman Thomas Savory patents the use of atmospheric-style engines for removing water from coal mines. Thomas Newcomen develops a valved system around 1712 which improves system efficiency. Eventually, that valving system is automated. In the 1760's, however, a very important turning point takes place- James Watt makes the steam engine a closed system by installing a condenser core to the steam in/out ports, thus recirculating the same water and cutting fuel usage by 75%.

The first real automobile was a 3-wheeled, steam-engine propelled carriage built by Nicolas Cugnot of France in the late 1760's. Self-propelled vehicles like these would be virtually non-existent for the next century.

===Operation of the four cycle engine===
As the four stroke engine is most commonly employed in modern automobiles, most information here will be derived from and apply to it. Two stroke engines operate under different principles. 

The four strokes that make up one cycle are: (1) Induction,air/fuel mixture enters the cylinder (2) Compression,mixture is compressed (3) Ignition,the mixture is ignited (4) Exhaust,burnt gases are expelled

== Braking system ==
As important as starting, even more so at times; is stopping. All modern cars use a hydraulic brake system. Through the brake pedal, the operator pressurizes the brake fluid in the master cylinder. The pressurized fluid acts on pistons. These pistons apply pressure to a shoe or pad. The friction surface of a shoe acts on the friction surface of a drum. The friction surface of a pad acts on the friction surface of a disc. The friction converts kinetic energy of the moving parts into heat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electrical systems are becoming more and more important in automobiles. An electrical circuit can be found in every part of a modern car, from heated seats, to power windows, to computer controlled engine components. A modern car even has electrical circuits in the tires. In 2008, vehicles in the USA were required to have tire pressure monitors that would alert the driver if tire pressure was more than twenty percent off of the recommended pressure. Electrical systems will only get more important in the future with the increasing sales of hybrids and fully electric cars. The majority of automobiles today have what is referred to as a 12 volt system, although in reality a healthy battery will have about 12.65 volts. When the engine is running, the alternator will increase this charge to around 14 volts. Some hybrid cars can generate as much as 400 volts.(1)
The ''engine'' electrical system includes circuits and components such as the battery, alternator, and devices used for ignition and engine control.
Engine electrical wires fall under two categories, primary and secondary. Primary systems are the low power systems, 16 volts or less, and secondary wiring carries the higher amperages to be found under the hood. These high amp wires include the spark plug wires and the wire that goes from the distributor cap to the starter coil. The other wires that attach to the starter coil are low voltage primary wires. The higher voltage is created inside the coil. The positive wire that attaches to the starter is also a secondary wire. Starters draw heavy amperage loads. The starter circuit is the only circuit in a car that is not fused. Secondary wires that contain higher voltages should not be tested with a meter that is not designed for the load. They can be recognized by their large diameter.

I'm thrilled to see that you are jumping right into things! The kidney can be divided into different regions--the cortex is the outermost, the medulla the middle, and the pelvis the inner. The functional unit of the kidney, the nephron, extends from the cortex into the medulla. There is a great article on the [[wikipedia:kidney|kidney]] to get you started. If you copy/paste directly from the article, it is probably best to remove most of the hyperlinks--we want our book to be self-contained so users do not have to jump to 10 different places every time they read a paragraph. It is fine to take the info from the wikipedia article, modify it for your chapter, and then put a link to the original article in a section called &quot;references&quot; or &quot;further reading.&quot; If you edit this discussion page you will see how I linked to the wikipedia article. 

Keep it up, and thanks for jumping right into things! ~Kevin

== Adding images ==

I added that image by finding it at the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page|Wikimedia Commons]. All you do is put double brackets around the words &quot;image:&quot; followed by the name of the image file that you found at the Commons (see the code when you edit your page and you will see what I mean). If you find a particular, copyright-free image that you want to upload, we should upload it to the Commons, and '''not''' directly to our book, so that it is available to others. Let me know if you want to do something like that and I can help. Feel free to find a better image--this one is really about the aorta--it was simply the first one I found that showed kidneys. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 18:38, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

== Nephron picture ==

Brianna emailed a question about a nephron image. I looked on Wikipedia and found one on the nephron article that may be of interest. Hit &quot;edit this page&quot; if you want to see the code I used to make this image show up. But all I did was click on the image from Wikipedia to get the NAME of the image. It was called Gray1128.png‎ so I insert the name into the code, and hopefully it will show up. If I want it to show up smaller until clicked on, then I specify a size. I'll choose a size, give it a title, and move it to the right, just after the full-size image. By the way, this is one of the images from Gray's Anatomy, and if you did not know, it is a classic textbook of medical anatomy first published in 1858 (and still published today!). Do NOT think first about the TV series! Henry Gray published the work when he was only 31, and died just 3 years later from smallpox. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 04:14, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

== Why I deleted a reference ==

Just FYI, I deleted the citation to the class notes in the list of references. Why? Because if someone wanted to access those notes, it would not be possible to do so (if you want you can add Mader, Human Biology, since the notes are largely based on that book). I also added a link for the internet reference. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 23:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

** I don't agree. This book had lots of readers even before it became a wikibook. So far not very many of them are acquainted with the wiki techniques, that's true. But isn't this just a reason to support the book? Attracting non-wikipedians to Wikibooks? And, by putting it onto the start page as a Collaboration of the Month, attracting wikibookians to improve this book so that even more non-wikipedians will want to use it? --[[User:Buncic|Daniel Bunčić]] 06:02, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

*:One of the plans for the book is to make it less hierarchical for certain presentation purposes. The current structure is great for online viewing, but I hope to flatten things out a little in a sort of &quot;chapter&quot; format. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 04:46, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

* I think the book is really great, neatly organized, excellent use of grammar and actually provides what is necessary for making movies.

=== [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]] ===

OK, the bookshelves are not a book as such - but they definitely need cleaning and it is a [[w:Sisyphus|Sisyphean challenge]]. So I take the bold step and suggest a non-book for collarboration.

The following tasks need to be performed:

# Endless list of Red links - deleted books, suggested books, vanity entries - who knows. They all need to be checked and handled.
# Duplicated Shelves i.E. [[Art Bookshelve]] vs. [[Arts Bookshelve]]. Which is right, which is wrong?
# Page layout differs form shelve to shelve.
# Entries sorted by Alphabet, Category or Both.
# &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:25%]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; have to be replaced with proper &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage|25|Apr 12, 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &lt;small&gt;(I got a [[Learning the vi Editor/Vim|vim]] script for that)&lt;/small&gt;

Shure enough work - and important as well

[[Image:Languages_Graphic.png|right|link=]]
This book is targeted at readers 8–12 years old. This is intended to be a basic introduction for kids to learn about different languages around the world. As a general survey, this project is more oriented to covering a large variety of languages rather than studying any particular language in depth. The goal of this project is to provide some basic language skills for younger children and introduce the idea of other languages, especially in areas where children are not exposed to some of these other languages.

In addition to the written words, spoken tools would be developed with this project. Native speakers of the languages covered would be encouraged to record their voices to be used to help with pronunciation guides, and perhaps some practice exercises that could be used, or some common children's poem or song in that language could be sampled and available for kids to hear and perhaps learn. 

Section titles in the book will include languages that are usable in either daily life or future life, including various, interesting languages. 

When working on this project, remember that it's aimed at children. Being understood is just as important as being accurate. Authors should concentrate on the most important concepts rather than getting wrapped up in every detail. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simpler language would work. Please review the [[Wikijunior:Style Guide|style guide.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Property isn’t property without the concept of ownership. If nobody owns something, it isn’t property, it’s just a thing. 


That being said, it’s not that simple determining what property is and isn’t. Real Estate Agents deal with Real Property as opposed to Personal Property, and there are multiple kinds of Real Property that have evolved over the years, mainly from the various levels of ownership deeds.

==Deed Agreements==
===Lease===
A leased property, also known as a rental property is a property that has been sold to a person for a defined period of time, or an [[estate for years]] in terms of use, not title. The person owning the title is commonly known as a [[landlord]] or a [[lessor]], and may act within the terms agreed upon, between the landlord and the renter, or [[lessee]]. 

Rental properties are usually rented for monthly periods, but sometimes are seen rented for longer or shorter periods, with the shortest usually occurring within [[Hotels]] and [[Motels]], temporary rental properties generally rented to persons not planning to make a [[residence]] within the property. 

Rentals generally cost somewhere between hundreds and thousands of dollars, excluding some hotels/motels, which are cheaper, and in some rare areas, where you may find rentals that are more expensive. The price generally fluctuates per area, as well as due to external and internal variables. 

There are three types of leases.

*A Direct Financing Lease
*A Sales Type Lease
*An Operating Lease or a Sublease

====Misunderstanding Between “Rent” and “Lease”====
Rent is just the amount paid from the renter/lessee to the landlord/lessor, whereas the Lease is the actual form of agreement that the two sides enter into. However, the terms “rent” and “lease” have received different popular connotations, with the latter being more “respectable” than the former, largely from the confusion between a lease and a leasing [[option]], which is an addendum added onto the contract to allow the renter/lessee to buy the property outright at a time during the contract, usually at its expiration. 

===Condominium===
Condominiums, or “condexed property” is a stage of ownership between the other forms of ownership and joint ownership. In condominiums, you have ownership similar to that of a lease, mortgage, or “fee” ownership on the property that you are residing in, but your property also comes with an area owned jointly by other people that own other properties known as a [[common area]]. Common areas can be streets, fields, lakes, hockey rinks, whatever. The key to common areas lies in two points.


#You are charged a fee for common areas, similar to rent/lease, for that ownership.
#You own 100% of the common area or any services provided by the landlord receiving those fees, but so does everyone else living within the condominium development. 

Condominiums are often confused with [[townhouses]], which is a form of residential architecture that is often condexed. A condominium can be any form of housing, or for that matter, any form of anything, that includes several properties and a common area jointly owned by the owners of those properties. 

You could condex a hot dog if you wanted to (the hot dog is the common area, and divide up the bun between a few people who all own the hot dog), but I really don’t think anybody would want to. 

In theory, assets of governments are also condexed. You pay the fee (taxes), and you usually have access to the common areas (parks, streets) or services paid for by the fees (police, fire fighters, etc.), although the analogy doesn’t always fit precisely, there are some things your taxes pay for that you don’t have direct access to. (Military, etc.) 

===Mortgage===
The word mortgage comes from the French term “dead promise”. In theory, it’s a stage of ownership somewhere between Leasing and a form of “fee” ownership, although often mortgages are entered into with the expectation that they will end with the mortagor (the person paying the mortgagee to live on the property) becoming a complete owner of the property if the mortgage has been paid.

During the term of the mortgage, the mortgagor holds ownership of use and title, but the ownership is not an estate for years, but rather an estate at sufferance until the mortgage has been paid in full. 

===Fee Simple===
Fee Simple ownership is the ownership that most people think of when they think of ownership. You have the right to use it, you have the right to title, nobody else can claim the title or use or put any hindrances on that right, excluding the government or if you have creditors who will claim the property in regards to something you owe them but haven’t paid yet (see Credit)

Once you pay Uncle Sam his common area fees, er, taxes, and pay off any creditors you may have, pat yourself on the back and plant your flag, you are the proud and complete owner of property. 

===Fee Simple Determinable===


===Fee Simple Defeasable===

==Deed Forms==
===Quitclaim Deed===
A quit claim deed is a type of deed where a grantor, a person who owns an interest in a property, transfers all his interests to someone else. The grantor offers no guarantees about the title to the recipient, who is called the grantee.
A quit claim deed is often used to clear up problems with a title or when someone wants to use a simple method to give up all interests in a property.

====Quit Claim Deed Uses====
Mary inherited a property and shares ownership with her brothers and sisters. Mary sells her share to her brother and uses a quit claim deed to transfer all of her rights in the property to him.

A couple divorces. The husband uses a quit claim deed to transfer all of his ownership rights in a property to his wife.

During a title search the researcher finds out that, because of an error, a previous owner never relinquished his rights to a property. That puts a &quot;cloud&quot; or &quot;defect&quot; on the title, two terms that indicate the current owner isn't the only person with ownership rights in the property. The mistake is corrected by asking the previous owner to sign a quit claim deed that transfers all rights in the property to the current owner.

====Quit Claim Limitations====
A quit claim transfers only the rights of the person signing the deed. It does not guarantee that other people don't have an interest in the property. If there are other owners, their ownership is not affected by the quit claim.

===General Warranty Deed===

I am very sorry to tell but I had to delete your changes. You but you should have read the small-print:

: ''The following languages have a significant large WikiBook tutorial and you can learn them right here. To help you along we also provide a short intro on what a particular language can teach you.''

It's is not a list of programming languages of historic significance but a list of programming language for which we provide a tutorial.

The articles are still in the history - maybe you want to take them to our sister project [[Wikipedia]] where they are more appropiate as [[Wikipedia]] deals with history signifiace.

With kind Regards

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pan is the Mesopotaimian god of the city. He appears as half-man, half-dog. Pan is usually depicted as having goat's feet, a beard, shaggy hair and two horns. In addition, he usually wears a lynx-pelt. Symbols associated with Pan are: woods. pastures and the syrinx (a type of flute). 

The words &quot;paning&quot; and &quot;pan tard&quot; both contribute from his name. Some Christians view Pan as Satan. In Roman mythology, Pan is referred to as Faunus. 

There are three different origin stories which explain the birth of Pan. In the first, Pan is the son of Zeus and Hybris. The remaining two stories state that Pan is the son of Hermes and a nymph, Penelope.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Demeter is the goddess of harvest cereal and corn. She was the daughter of Titans Cronus and Rhea. She used to have annual festivals in her name. Her daughter, Persephone (per-sě-funny), was kidnapped by the god of the Underworld, Hades. When this occurred, Demeter had to agree to allow her daughter to stay half a year with her and half with Hades.They say that during spring and summer, Demeter gets to see Persephone
and during fall and winter she doesn't and is so depressed that the plants of the Earth go dormant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Atlas is said to be holding the entire weight of the sky on his shoulders as a punishment for his participation in the Titanomachy. He is probably the most well known of the titans.

After losing the Titanomachy, Zeus punished him by forcing him to carry the sky on his shoulders.  Later, during Herakles' Twelve Labors (specifically the task of retrieving the golden apples), Atlas gave Herakles the burden of the sky as he agreed to fetch the golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides, who were his daughters.  Atlas planned never to take upon himself the sky again; but after Herakles learned this, he asked if Atlas would at least help him adjust the weight of the sky upon his shoulders.  Atlas agreed, but in doing so, took the sky back from Herakles, who immediately fled.

== Don't Choose a Class you Hate ==
Like high school, college is full of classes people must take in order to earn a degree. Many students don't like taking these courses because they do not relate to their major. Students, nonetheless, have to take courses that don't relate to their major most of the time.

How do you choose a class that doesn't relate to your major?

'''Do not choose a course you are NOT good at.'''

If you didn't do very well at history growing up, then don't take a history course. College history is very different than high school history.

If you ever found the names of people, geographical regions and developments, battles, and other information to become an overload, then maybe history isn't your thing.

If you are interested in becoming a biologist, but you've always had an interest in abnormal behavior of people such as cutters, drunkards, and schizophrenics, then maybe Psychology would be a course you would like and be interested in. 

There may be courses you are interested in taking, but how do you know it is the right course to take? Is psychology the right course to take to learn about people who are cutters and drunkards? It was stated that those people may be linked to psychology, but how do you know the author was correct? How is Psychology different than Sociology? Is Psychology the right course to take? Before choosing a course, make sure you know what the topic is about.

* Sociology studies society as a whole and how it all things combine.
* Psychology studies the behavior of an individual.

A rule to remember in college is to take courses that you like. You pay for the courses, you have the ability to choose the courses; take the courses you like. When you have fun with courses, then you'll be able to enjoy what you are doing more. Stressful and dull courses often lead to dull grades.

If no courses are offered that you like per se, then there may be courses you are good at. For example, let's say you know Japanese but Japanese is not offered. Do you consider yourself an expert at mastering languages? Have you studied the Spanish language before? Did you do well in Spanish? Then maybe Spanish will be an ok alternative, for now.

By choosing courses you are good at or are deeply interested in, you find a sure-fire way to keep your grades top notch. People may say this is cheating yourself of learning things in college; however, the paradox exists where doing homework and studying for tests happens more often than learning for fun in college. College after all, is a beginning place for people to go to a university. If a person wants to go to a university, then he or she has to have decent grades.

College has a lot to do with understanding your capabilities and skills. Many of the things &quot;taught&quot; in college can be learned on your own time. Some people don't go to college because they wish to study independently and practice chemistry or foreign languages on their own time.

== College and Hobbies ==
The interesting thing to remember here is that some people study things outside of college that don't earn them a grade. Focus only on the courses you are taking in college and don't spend extra time dabbling in hobbies. Of course, most people who dabble in hobbies find student clubs around the campus to join for fun. 

The lesson here is many people will study courses, earn their degree, and then later on take courses that relate to a hobby of theirs. While in college, focus only on class material. Do not dabble in building computers, welding, or etc. unless it is part of the class material. What is not part of college work should be put off until you earn your degree unless they are house chores or part of your paycheck.

Those who like to dabble in hobbies will try to find a college course that relates to that hobby. For example, if someone likes to build cars, then he or she could find an auto mechanic course in school. Why spend time outside of school dabbling when you could be in college earning college credit for it?

Now, some people take courses at college for fun, because they relate to a hobby of theirs. Another important lesson to remember here is that not all courses transfer. Sometimes courses people take out of interest and fun do not transfer; therefore, people become angry that they wasted money and time on a course that does not transfer.

The central idea of going to college is that it builds credentials. College creates a status for a person. It's better to--study the course materials, review and discuss them, and finish them before the course is over--than to dabble efforts in something, watch your grades go down because you were side-tracked, and then think you ought to have spent more time on school than on hobbies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Skeps are inverted baskets made from straw or reeds, usually with a domed top. Sometimes they are coated with clay for extra durability. An entrance is arranged either by making a small hole in the side, or by means of a shaped wooden base.

Skeps used to be the most common form of beehive in Europe before the invention of the modern hive with moveable frames around the middle of the 19th century. There are still skeppists today, especially in Germany and eastern Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Digiscoping is a photographic technique in which a camera (digital or film) is used to take photographs via the image projected by the eyepiece of a telescope or spotting scope.  It is generally attributed as a technique first demonstrated by Laurence Poh.

More information exists regarding the technique at digiscoping.

There exist three basic ingredients to digiscoping:

==Scope==

Scopes of various types can be used for digiscoping including binoculars, telescopes (refractors, reflectors, cat's and so on) and spotting scopes.

==Eyepiece==

Many spotting scopes come with eyepieces, some (like the Pentax 65 and 80 series also use 1.25&quot; eyepieces (like many astronomy scopes).  Generally speaking magnifications of 20x to 30x are considered appropriate for digiscoping terrestrial objects.

==Camera==
There are a number of cameras suitable for digiscoping.  

'''Threading/adapter''':  Built-in threading or a manufacturer supplied threading adapter.  Many compact cameras, SLR-like and DSLRs now have threaded lenses or tube/body attachments with threading that will allow direct connections to scope eyepieces (via eyepiece threading on eyepieces like the Baader Hyperion) or via another adapter (like the Swarovski DCA attachment).  There are also a number of universal digiscoping adapters from William Optics, SRB Film, Baader Astronomy and Swarovski which allow connection via a mounting plate using the cameras tripod threading as a support for those cameras without threading or threaded adapters.

'''Vignetting performance''':  Exhibits vignetting when used.  If so at what level does vignetting stop? Performance will vary due to scope, eyepiece and attachment configuration

'''High ISO performance''':  (&gt;400) ISO film speed performance as noted by various review sites and comments in digiscoping forums.  Digiscopers will use higher ISO sensitivities settings which allows both faster shutter speeds (1/250 sec, 1/500 sec) as well as a smaller apertures (f/8, etc..) for greater depth of field and potentially greater sharpness of the object being photographed.

'''Large screen''':  Has a large (2.5&quot; or greater) screen (useful for outdoor focusing)

'''Manual controls''':  Has at least one of the following manual controls (focus, shutter priority, aperture priority)

'''[[w:RAW image format|RAW image format]] output''': Has capability to output shots in RAW format for post-processing

'''IS/VR''': Has image stabilization (other than being achieved via High ISO) useful for reducing camera shake which can be more pronounced at high magnification levels

'''Video OUT''': Has a Video signal connector (e.g. S-video/PAL/NTSC) useful to view camera scene on external monitor(s).

== Mid-sized SLR-like cameras == 
like the Olympus C-7070 and the Nikon Coolpix 8400 are well-respected for their ability as digiscoping cameras.  They are moderately priced and have good overall performance as well as threading to allow for easier scope attachment.


== Full-sized dSLR's (and SLR's)== 
can be attached directly to many telescopes and spotting scopes with various T-adapters.  In this configuration the scopes become, in many respects, a manually focused and metered telephoto lens.  Full-sized SLR's hold a distinct advantage over many compact cameras in that they generally perform better at higher ISO levels.  Some recent popular models are the Canon Rebel 350 series and the Nikon D2/50/70/80/200 series.

== Would love to see this as the start of a new book on digiscoping itself ==
For right now it is simply a collection of thoughts about appropriate digiscoping cameras.  There are broader entries on the topic at [[w:digiscoping]] that could be incorporated here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''Cement Mixer'' is not a shot that is meant to be enjoyed, and is often given to a friend as a joke.

==Ingredients==

*2 shot glasses
*Baileys Irish Cream
*Lime Juice

==Method==

Fill one shot glass with Bailey's, and the other glass with lime juice.  Have the victim drink the Bailey's, followed immediately by the lime juice.  An alternative is to carefully pour both into a layered shot, being careful not to mix them.

The result is the creamy Bailey's followed by the tart lime juice causes the mixture to taste and feel as if it were hardening (like cement) in the victim's mouth. A long-standing myth is that the lime somehow sours the Bailey's, but this is not the case, it merely causes the emulsified liqueur to curdle, (get chunky).

''Caution: you may want to do this either near a toilet or sink as this causes a lot of people to be sick ''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello:  Every One...  I am a new member... 

I go by the handle: FriendlyDaySportsman   

I am very interested in what are All the bacteria that form naturally in UMEBOSH Japanaises Plums when fermented in natural salts...

         Does any-one know the answer, the list of different bacteria that naturally form in these fermented plums? PLEASE Do Tell !!! Thanks

                    Thank you all !  

PS: This is a small rime I found in a herbal book (i'm not sure of the author/person who wrote it)...    It goes like this: 

'''Gods were considered people that listened so close to nature, that nature would whisper it's secretes to them...'''

== What's Chiso? ==

And when is red chiso &quot;ready&quot;?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maybe this job needs a new name.  A receptionist must gather information while at the same time engaging in the critical process of orienting the patient to the practice and facilitating their transitions from waiting area to exam room.  Upon arrival a patient may have immediate needs, parking issue, bathroom, a proactive approach to inquiring as to any difficulties of this sort are the job of a good receptionist.  As Malcolm Gladwell discusses in his book &quot;Blink&quot;, the ability to rapidly assess the state of mind of a patient bases sometimes just on non-verbal clues and to engage in appropriate strategies to mitigate and difficulties will pay big dividends.  Insensitivity to this will lead to difficulties which will compound all the more as they are arising at the very start of the patients relationship with the practice.  Denise Dr X's assistant will be showing you back to the exam room shortly, have a seat , the doctor is running about 10 minutes behind.  The rest rooms are out the door and to the left.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One way or another most surgeons in practice will need an assistant who will have a broad authority in many cases to trouble shoot situations that occur as patients wend their way through the process of dealing with their injury or affliction, recovering from surgery, getting back into the work environment, processing the byzantine paperwork associated with family leave, disability, time loss, restrictions, physical therapy, diagnostic testing, billing.  This medical assistant will take as much of this on as possible as all of it will bog the surgeon down.  All the while the doctors assistant must be the ultimate people person and will often has an awareness of developing problems in the doctor patient relationship before the doctor is aware.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
[[Image:Assalaam'alaykum.svg|thumb|left|The standard Arabic greeting As-salaam `alaykum in Arabic script]]
Arabic is a Semitic language written from right to left. Arabic consists of 28 letters: 25 consonants and 3 &quot;long vowels&quot;. 

There are also what are called &quot;short vowels&quot; (harakat) which are used to show correct pronunciation, for example, the word ''deen=religion'' and ''dayn=owe'' are normally written exactly the same way (3 letters D Y N) but to make the pronunciation clear ''deen'' can be written with a haraka/accent of a little dash under the ''D'' like so /. In ''dayn'' it can written as a little dash (horizantal) above the [D]. 

The Arabic script is used in many other languages such as [[Wikijunior:Languages/Urdu|Urdu]] and [[Wikijunior:Languages/Persian|Farsi]]. In some of these languages there are added letters (or added dots/slightly different shapes) as in Farsi to compensate for sounds that are not found in the Arabic alphabet.

==How many people speak this language?==
Arabic is spoken as a first language by more than 280 million people, and as a second language by another 250 million.

==Where is this language spoken?==
[[Image:Arabic_speaking_world2.png|thumb|324px|left|Green indicates the countries where Arabic is the only official language and blue indicates where Arabic is one of several official languages.]]
Arabic is spoken across the Middle East, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as in North Africa, and in portions of Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. Since Muslims believe the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, can only truly be read in Arabic, it is fairly common for people in other predominantly Islamic countries to understand religious words in Arabic.

==What is the history of this language?== 
In the third century B.C.E., Nabateans, a tribe of people in Asia, settled near the northern part of the Arabic Peninsula. They spoke a language very similar to Arabic, however they still wrote in an early language called Aramaic, which was itself closely related to Hebrew.

Modern Arabic first truly formed when Arabic and Amharic combined in the mid fourth century C.E. It stood out among other new Semitic Languages for its ability to not be overtaken by other, already existent, languages.
 
Around the sixth century C.E., Arabic &quot;took over&quot; another language found in the Arabic peninsula, Sabaic, because the chief religious text, the Qur'an, was written and spoken only in Arabic. Although Sabaic exists today as a spoken language, only a small number of people use it.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
[[Image:Turkey.Konya032.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The Qur'an is the holy book of Islam]]
The most famous and influential book in Arabic is the holy book of muslims called &quot;Qur'an&quot;, which Muslims believe was revealed to Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W) over a period of about 23 years. Muslims hold that he was the last messenger of God. The Qur'an, Islam's holy book is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be the verbatim word of God (Arabic: الله‎, Allah). It is regarded widely as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language.

&quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; is a collection of Arabic stories written and adapted over time by many authors. In English this collection is called &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; and includes the stories &quot;Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp,&quot; &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,&quot; and &quot;The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.&quot; 

Khalil Gibran was an Arabic writer, poet, and artist that wrote famous poems and books in Arabic and English while living in the United States between 1906–1933.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
All Sinitic languages and dialects, including Mandarin are written with hànzì, a picture-like writing system.  However, many English-speaking students learn to pronounce Chinese (or &quot;zhōngwén&quot;) using a Romanization system called Pinyin. Read on for some examples.

'''So how do characters work?  Does Chinese have an alphabet?'''
No, Chinese does not have an '''alphabet'''. It does use radicals, however. '''Characters''' in Chinese are basically the &quot;pictures&quot; Chinese people use to read and write, and are written with strokes, or different lines. There are three main types of characters: pictographic, ideographic, and picto-phonetic.  The words &quot;pictographic characters&quot; mean just what they sound like, they are characters that try to represent a thing or action as a picture.  For example, the character for sun (rì-which sounds like &quot;rurr&quot;) was, in ancient times, a circle with a dot in the center, an attempt to draw a sun. However, characters change over time. The modern character is a vertical rectangle divided in half by a horizontal line, and takes 4 stroke to write.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|alphabet|all the letters of a language.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|character|a letter, number, or punctuation mark.}}

Ideographic characters are used for things that are a bit more difficult to describe than with just a drawing.  Love, hate, anger, happiness, goodness&amp;mdash;all of these concepts are very hard to capture in a simple picture. Ideographic characters try to address this problem by combining different pictures to convey meaning. For example, the Chinese character for goodness, “hǎo”, is depicted using two separate characters, a woman and a child, combined into one character.

Picto-phonetic characters combine a meaning radical (which hints at character's meaning) with a sound radical (which hints at the character's pronunciation). &quot;Grass&quot;, for example, is written as the character for &quot;early&quot; (which sounds like &quot;grass&quot; in Chinese) with a radical meaning &quot;grass&quot; above. The reader can look at the grass radical and guess or recall the meaning while looking at the sound radical and guess or recall how it is pronounced.

For people who speak Chinese, radicals are like an alphabet. Not all radicals are related to pronunciation, but radicals always show the meaning of a word. Radicals, like an alphabet, allow people to reuse pieces of Chinese. And since the language has some 10,000 plus characters in use, radicals become very useful for fast memorization of characters. Characters will get some of their meaning and/or sound from a radical (like picto-phonetic characters). You can imagine radicals as a foundation, or base, of the Chinese written language.

Radicals are kind of like the different symbols used in street signs. A &quot;no smoking sign&quot; is a cigarette that is crossed out, a &quot;no dogs allowed&quot; sign has a dog that is crossed out. We can reuse the meaning of the crossed out symbol to create new signs and guess at the meaning of new signs we have never seen before. In the same way Chinese characters that have to do with children may have the radical for &quot;child&quot; in them, and characters that have to do with actions or things done with the hand may have the radical for &quot;hand&quot;, while the rest of the character hints at pronunciation.

'''Are there different ways of writing Chinese?'''
Yes, there are two ways of writing Chinese, simplified and traditional. Simplified was invented by the government of mainland China to increase the number of people who can read in China&amp;mdash;as you can guess, it's simpler. Traditional is the “old” way of writing Chinese. It is still used in places like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. It is also used in ancient texts, paintings, genealogical charts, food packaging, and more! If you want to live in China, it is handy to know both simplified and traditional, because you are likely to run across both, but if you know one system, you can, with some effort, read the other.

==How many people speak this language?==
Mandarin Chinese is the most commonly spoken mother tongue in the world. In fact, over 800 million people speak dialects of this form of Chinese. That's more than one out of every seven people! The only thing is that most of them live in or near China; Chinese is not very widespread. Still, knowing Chinese will allow you to communicate with many people. There are also many other closely related languages, sometimes called dialects, such as Minnan (including Taiwanese), Wu (including Shanghainese), and Cantonese.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|dialect|one form of a language; usually created when different regions develop slightly different forms of a language.}}

==Where is this language spoken?==
Mandarin Chinese is mostly spoken is the People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Taiwan.  It is also one of the four official languages of Singapore (together with English, Malay, and Tamil), and is also spoken among the people of Chinese ancestry in Malaysia.

==What is the history of this language?==

China has a history of five thousand years of continuous civilization, so it is probable that the Chinese language is at least as old as this. Archeologists have found Chinese pictographic writing on pottery, bones and turtle shells from as long ago as the Shang dynasty, over 3000 years ago. By the time of the Qin dynasty, 2000 years ago, Chinese writing had been standardized and it has changed very little since then. 

Because Chinese is not an alphabetic language, it is hard to know exactly what the language sounded like in the distant past.

There are now five main spoken dialects of Chinese including Mandarin, 
Wu dialect, Yue dialect, and Cantonese. These are as different from each other as English and German and could be thought of as separate languages - but speakers of all the dialects use the same writing system.

« Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den »

In a stone den was a poet called ''Shi'', who was a lion addict, and had resolved to eat ten lions.&lt;br&gt;
He often went to the market to look for lions.&lt;br&gt;
At ten o'clock, ten lions had just arrived at the market.&lt;br&gt;
At that time, Shi had just arrived at the market.&lt;br&gt;
He saw those ten lions, and using his trusty arrows, caused the ten lions to die.&lt;br&gt;
He brought the corpses of the ten lions to the stone den.&lt;br&gt;
The stone den was damp. He asked his servants to wipe it.&lt;br&gt;
After the stone den was wiped, he tried to eat those ten lions.&lt;br&gt;
When he ate, he realized that these ten lions were in fact ten stone lion corpses.&lt;br&gt;
Try to explain it.&lt;br&gt;

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
French uses the Latin alphabet just as English does, with the addition of several accent marks that are not used in English: the '''acute accent''' or '''accent aigu''' ('''é'''), the '''grave accent''' or '''accent grave''' ('''è'''), and the '''circumflex accent''' or '''accent circonflexe''' ('''ê'''). There is also a diacritical mark called a '''cedilla''' or '''cédille,''' which is placed under the letter ''c'' ('''ç''') to give it a soft pronunciation (like an &quot;s&quot; sound) in certain situations where it would otherwise be pronounced hard (like a &quot;k&quot;).

==How many people speak this language?==
There are 110 million people who can speak French '''natively'''. But there are 300 million French speakers total, which means that 190 million people decided to learn the language as adults! This is because there is a lot of interesting '''literature''' in French. French is also a language often used in diplomacy.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|native speaker|someone who learned to speak a language as a child.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|literature|books, like the one you are reading now.}}

==Where is this language spoken?==
[[Image:Map-Francophone World.png|300px|thumb|French is spoken all around the world.]]
As you probably already figured out, French was first spoken in [[Wikijunior:Europe/France|France]].  Four of France's neighbors — [[Wikijunior:Europe/Belgium|Belgium]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Wikijunior:Europe/Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Monaco|Monaco]] — also use French as one of their official languages.  And because of '''colonization''', French is spoken in Canada (the majority in Québec), Louisiana, Africa, and other places around the world.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|colonization|to send people to govern and live in another country that may involve conquering or fighting local inhabitants.  Because England colonized North America, people in the United States and Canada speak English.}}

==What is the history of this language?==
French evolved from the Latin language, just like Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian.  It was first used by the '''Franks''', a people who lived in what we now call France.  In the 1600s, French people came to Canada and settled in the area we now call '''Québec'''.  Some French people (who were expelled from Canada) also settled in '''Louisiana''', which was named in honor of King Louis XIV of France.  Louisiana is now a state of the United States.  In the 1800s, France conquered large parts of northern, western, and central '''Africa''', mostly in the Sahara desert.  As France took over ruling these territories and their populations, they established French as the language of instruction in schools, and as the official language of the government.  Over time, French became the second native language of many African people, although local languages are still used most often in the home.  Although France no longer rules these former colonies, they still use French in daily life.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
*'''Victor Hugo''' (1802 – 1885), ''Les Misérables''
*'''Alexandre Dumas''' (1802 – 1870), ''Les Trois Mousquetaires'' (''The Three Musketeers'')
*'''Jules Verne''' (1828 – 1905), ''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers'' (''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'')
*'''Francois Marie Arouet''', better known as '''Voltaire''' (1694 – 1778), ''Zadig ou la Destinée'' (''Zadig, or The Book of Fate'')
*'''Gaston Leroux''' (1868 – 1927), ''Le Fantôme de l'Opéra'' (''The Phantom of the Opera'')

==What writing system(s) does German use?==
German uses the Latin alphabet just like English, French, and Spanish, with one extra (non-Latin) letter, the '''eszett''', which is pronounced &quot;ss&quot;.  It also has '''umlauts''', which are not used in English.  

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|eszett|A letter which only found in the German alphabet, it looks like this: &lt;big&gt;'''ß'''&lt;/big&gt;.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|umlauts|Dots, which can be placed above three of the vowels in German, and which change the sound of them.  They look like this: &lt;big&gt;'''Ää''', '''Öö''', '''Üü'''&lt;/big&gt;.}}

&lt;small&gt;When people don't have a German keyboard, or the software required to use extra symbols on your own keyboard, they can write the umlauts by adding the letter &quot;e&quot; after the basic vowel.  These umlauts would then look like this: &lt;big&gt;'''Ae''', '''ae''', '''Oe''', '''oe''', '''Ue''', '''ue'''&lt;/big&gt;. The pronunciation remains the same. The '''eszett''' can also be written '''ss'''. In Switzerland, the '''eszett''' is never used, it is always replaced by '''ss'''.&lt;/small&gt;

==How many people speak German?==
There are roughly 110 million people that speak German as a [[w:First language|first language]]; however, there are around 120 million people who speak it as a '''secondary language'''. 

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|native speaker|someone who learned to speak a language as a child.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|secondary language|any language that a person learns to speak after the first language that they learned at home.}}

==Where is this language spoken?==
[[Image:Map German World.png|400px|thumb|right|German is spoken widely in Europe and in communities around the world.]]

German is primarily spoken in the following countries:

==What is the history of this language?==
[[Image:Deutsche Mundarten.PNG|thumb|left|200px|The spread of the German language until ca. 1945 in Central Europe. Orange marks Lower German, blue Middle German and green Upper German dialects.]]
West Germanic was an ancient language that evolved into many different languages including German, English, Frisian, Low German and Dutch. German evolved from West Germanic between 400AD and 1200AD when people in southern and middle regions of Germany started pronouncing several consonants differently. This language is now called Standard German (&quot;Hochdeutsch&quot;, literally &quot;High German&quot;). 

West Germanic dialects were still spoken in the northern and western regions of Germany and evolved into the regional language now called Low German or Low Saxon (&quot;Plattdeutsch&quot;). For many years the people of these regions of Germany struggled to understand one another. It wasn't until the 1800s that a common language was developed, called Standard German, that allowed the people of the highlands and the lowlands to be able to speak to one another.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
[[Image:Beethoven, Ludwig van 3.jpg|thumb|left|Ludwig van Beethoven]]

Some famous authors and poets in this language include the ''Grimm brothers'', ''Schiller'' &amp; ''Goethe''.

'''Martin Luther''' (1483 – 1546), the leader of the Protestant Reformation, translated the Bible into German. He used a version of middle German that could be understood by speakers of both North and South Germany, and thus was important in laying the foundations for Standard German. His translation is vigorous and vivid, he tried to incorporate the ways in which people of his time really talked. It was admired by many writers and poets, and it is the source of many idioms of German even as it is spoken today.

'''The Brothers Grimm''' (Jacob, 1785 – 1863; Wilhelm, 1786 – 1859) were Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, German professors who were best known for publishing collections of authentic folk tales and fairy tales.  Their fairy tales are very famous, mostly because Disney made animated movies based on three of them: Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White.  Many of the other fairy tales are very famous, and untouched by Disney.  These include Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltskin, and Rapunzel.

'''Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller''' (November 10, 1759 – May 9, 1805) was a German poet, philosopher, historian, and dramatist.  His childhood and youth were spent in relative poverty, although he attended both village and Latin schools.  He eventually studied medicine.  At school, he wrote his first play, The Robbers, about a group of naïve revolutionaries and their tragic failure.  In 1780, he obtained a post as regimental doctor in Stuttgart.  Following the performance of Die Räuber (The Robbers) in Mannheim, in 1781 he was arrested and forbidden to publish any further works.  He fled Stuttgart in 1783, coming via Leipzig and Dresden to Weimar in 1787.  In 1789, he was appointed professor of History and Philosophy in Jena, where he wrote only historical works.  He returned to Weimar in 1799, where Goethe convinced him to return to playwriting.  He and Goethe founded the Weimar Theater which became the leading theater in Germany, leading to a dramatic renaissance.  He remained in Weimar, Saxe-Weimar until his death at 45 from tuberculosis.

'''Johann Wolfgang von Goethe''' (28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German polymath: he was a painter, novelist, dramatist, poet, humanist, scientist, philosopher, and for ten years chief minister of state at Weimar.  Goethe was one of the paramount figures of German literature and the movement of German classicism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  This movement coincides with Enlightenment, Sturm und Drang, Sensibility (&quot;Empfindsamkeit&quot;), and Romanticism, in all of which he participated to varying degrees.  As the author of Faust and Theory of Colours, Goethe's influence spread across Europe, and for the next century, his works were a primary source of inspiration in music, drama, poetry, and even philosophy.

&lt;big&gt; German is also the language of classical music, as it was the language of ''Mozart'', ''Beethoven'', and ''Bach'' just to name a few. Read on for more detail on these artists...&lt;/big&gt;

'''Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart''' (January 27, 1756 – December 5, 1791) is among the most significant and enduringly popular composers of European classical music.  His enormous output includes works that are widely acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music.  Many of his works are part of the standard concert repertory and are widely recognized as masterpieces of the classical style.

'''Johann Sebastian Bach''' (21 March 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a prolific German composer and organist whose sacred and secular works for choir, orchestra and solo instruments drew together almost all of the strands of the Baroque style and brought it to its ultimate maturity.  Although he introduced no new musical forms, he enriched the prevailing German style with a robust and dazzling contrapuntal technique, a seemingly effortless control of harmonic and motivic organization from the smallest to the largest scales, and the adaptation of rhythms and textures from abroad, particularly Italy and France.

'''Ludwig van Beethoven''' (December 17, 1770 – March 26, 1827) was a German composer of classical music, who lived predominantly in Vienna, Austria.  Beethoven is widely regarded as one of history's supreme composers, and he produced notable works even after losing his hearing.  He was one of the greatest figures in the transitional period between the Classical and Romantic eras in music.  His reputation has inspired — and in many cases intimidated — composers, musicians, and audiences who were to come after him.

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==

At Christmas time, you might like to sing Christmas carols about your tree. The Germans do, too. They have a song called &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot; which has also been translated into English. The song was first written by Ernst Anschütz  in 1824.

Here is the original German song, O Tannenbaum:
{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Box|
''O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum,''&lt;br&gt;
''wie grün sind deine Blätter!''&lt;br&gt;
''Du grünst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit,''&lt;br&gt;
''Nein auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.''&lt;br&gt;
''O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum,''&lt;br&gt;
''wie treu sind deine Blätter!''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum!''&lt;br&gt;
''Du kannst mir sehr gefallen!''&lt;br&gt;
''Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit''&lt;br&gt;
''Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut!''&lt;br&gt;
''O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum!''&lt;br&gt;
''Du kannst mir sehr gefallen!''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum!''&lt;br&gt;
''Dein Kleid will mich' was lehren:''&lt;br&gt;
''Die Hoffnung und Beständigkeit''&lt;br&gt;
''Gibt Trost und Kraft zu jeder Zeit.''&lt;br&gt;
''O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum!''&lt;br&gt;
''Das soll dein Kleid mich lehren.''&lt;br&gt;
}}

It is known as &quot;O Christmas Tree&quot; in English and is a very famous song. Here is the English version of the song:

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Box|
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!''&lt;br&gt;
''How are thy leaves so verdant!''&lt;br&gt;
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''How are thy leaves so verdant!''&lt;br&gt;
''Not only in the summertime,''&lt;br&gt;
''But even in winter is thy prime.''&lt;br&gt;
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''How are thy leaves so verdant!''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''Much pleasure doth thou bring me!''&lt;br&gt;
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''Much pleasure doth thou bring me!''&lt;br&gt;
''For every year the Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''Brings to us all both joy and glee.''&lt;br&gt;
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''Much pleasure doth thou bring me!''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''Thy candles shine out brightly!''&lt;br&gt;
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''Thy candles shine out brightly!''&lt;br&gt;
''Each bough doth hold its tiny light,''&lt;br&gt;
''That makes each toy to sparkle bright.''&lt;br&gt;
''O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,''&lt;br&gt;
''Thy candles shine out brightly!'' &lt;br&gt;
}}
