Hi Cyndi,

About Editing Wikitext; I note with surprise that somebody has contributed to the edits - I was beginning to think that I was the only one who could access it.

Perhaps you could advise on this point: After many mixed efforts at deciding whether to use 'which' or 'that' for the material, I must confess that I have changed the whole series of pages to 'that'. I hope that this is a correct form, since I notice that there have been some changes back to 'which'? A seemingly trivial point, but if it is inappropriate there are lots of other pages to do. What is the best choice for this type of material?

Another point; are all english speakers using the 'en' version of Wikibooks or is it the intention for strictly american english? Armchair (talk) 16:40, 8 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Object Oriented Programming ==
The purpose of an object oriented design is to allow the components to be as modular as possible.  In particular, when a new object type is created, it is expected that it should work without problem when placed in a different environment or new programming project.  The result of this is a reduced time spent in redevelopment. 

JavaScript uses objects to represent complex data types.  Some objects are created manually, while others are built-in to the language itself, like the &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; object. Objects are small structures of data with their own fields and functions to access or modify these fields.  A benefit of objects is that they use a &quot;black box&quot; approach where the internal variables are protected from most forms of outside interference.  This helps to prevent them from being altered by program code ''outside'' of the function or object, which provides a better integrity for the data itself.

Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript does not provide implicit protection levels on members of an object.  In particular, JavaScript uses a prototypical form of Objects, which can still inherit from parent classes, but is not a pure form of an object oriented language.  However, most design patterns can still apply within the language as long as there is no attempt to directly access the object's internal state (for example, using an object's methods.)

As with many other programming languages, objects in JavaScript have their fields and functions referenced by the dot ('''.''') between the object and field name.

== The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; operator ==

The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; operator creates a new instance of an object.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
item = new Object();
&lt;/source&gt;

== Object methods and fields ==

In JavaScript, objects are free form - they can be modified at run time to instantly create a new object or to create new fields or functions.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
money = new Object();
money.quarters = 10;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Object Literals ==
Objects can also be created using the object literal notation.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
money = {
    'quarters': 10
};
&lt;/source&gt;

As shown below, you can create a function for an object in the same manner.

== The &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; keyword ==

The &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; keyword is used as a reference to an object for which a method was called.

&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
money = {
    'quarters': 10,
    'addQuarters': function(amount) {
        this.quarters += amount;
    }
};
money.addQuarters(10);
&lt;/source&gt;

The total number of quarters would now be twenty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|JavaScript|Object Oriented Programming|Inheritance}}

== Constructor ==

The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; operator creates a new object based on a constructor and a prototype.  

The constructor is a function matching the name of the object, and, when called by the new operator, has the keyword &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; assigned to the newly created instance of the object.  The constructor can then assign any initial variables as required.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
function CoinObject()
{
    this.value = 0; 
}
slug = new CoinObject();  // Creates a &quot;slug&quot; - a valueless coin (slug.value = 0).
&lt;/source&gt;

The constructor can accept parameters - however, it is not possible to overload the constructors by having multiple functions with a different number of parameters.

== Prototypes ==

A prototype for an object is the set of auto-created fields and methods. It cannot operate by itself, and relies on an existing constructor.

When the object is created, the fields initialized in the prototype are copied to the newly created object. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
function CoinObject()
{
    this.value = 0; 
}
CoinObject.prototype.diameter = 1;
slug = new CoinObject();  // A valueless coin (slug.value = 0), with diameter of 1 (slug.diameter = 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

Since the prototype of an object behaves as an object, you can use this to create inheritance.

== Dynamically extending objects ==

Objects within JavaScript are fully dynamic, and fields within an object can instantly be created if they do not already exist.  If, for example, you discover that you now need to keep track of the thickness in the coin example, you can simply add the new field to the prototype.

Changing the prototype of an object allows existing instances of the object to gain access to that change.

When a property value has been assigned on a new object, that property takes precedence over the prototype property from its ancestor. If you delete the property from the new object, the chain of inheritance takes you back to the property from the parent object.

To demonstrate, an Animal constructor is used to create an object, a dog called Spot. After that creation, the constructor has a gender property added to it. That gender property is also accessible from the object for Spot.

The gender property can be updated, and if the gender property is deleted from the dog object, it will retrieve the desired property from its ancestor instead, the Animal constructor.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function Animal (type, name) {
    this.type = type || 'No type';
    this.name = name  || 'No name';
}
var dog = new Animal('dog', 'Spot');

// Add gender to the Animal object
Animal.prototype.gender = 'unspecified';
// dog.gender is 'unspecified'

dog.gender = 'male';
// dog.gender is 'male';

delete(dog.gender);
// dog.gender is once again, 'unspecified'
&lt;/source&gt;

::I've blocked the 3 accounts that were involved, and reverted all the page moves (so far). I'm going to delete all the obscene redirect pages that were created. The [[Human Physiology]] book got hit pretty hard by this wave of vandalism, so if you could just go check that all the pages and talk pages in that book aren't redirecting out into space, I would appreciate it.

== Chemical Synthesis VfD ==

I just wanted to reiterate a few points from the VfD discussion. I don't think that your book is poorly written, and I certainly don't think you are a bad contributor. Every logical part of me is saying that kids shouldnt be buying acetone at walmart and mixing up TATP in their basements. The way the text is written now, I worry that's the kind of activity that we are encouraging: amateurs and children, at home, boiling hydrogen peroxide on the stove. All I want is to see this material directed at a better target audience, so that we aren't encouraging joe-schmoe at home to try this proceedure himself. I hope you didn't take any of my comments too personally. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:16, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

: Thanks for letting me know. I never thought your comments harsh or unfair. I recognise your viewpoint and motives as sincere and well intended.
: We seem to differ, not so much on the ends, but on the means. I agree that kids shouldn't be mixing explosives in their basements. I disagree, however, that it is our place to ensure that. My mother tounge, Icelandic, has a word, óviti, which literally means un-knower and is used for young children who can't take care of themselves due to their limited mental ability (you keep detergents away from them &amp;mdash; those mentally retarded can also be óviti). Basically someone who needs you to think for them.
: I see the question being whether it is our task to think for un-knowers. This should be discussed and made a policy.
: Just to state it, my oppinion is that it should be left to their parents to deceide which rules to instill in their children. Some parents will fail at their task. Some children may not have learnt to understand the dangers expressed on the synthesis pages even before you put up disclamers. I don't think this is a reason enough for us to padd every sharp corner. Not either that I want to lay broken bottles everywhere.
: There are many faces underlying my motivation. Once we've got the voting stuff sorted out, we should put up something on censoring. At that point, I'll try to make a detailed point based on theory and application. If you'd like to engage in a warm-up discussion/debate, I'd be glad to do so.
: Again, thanks for the note. I sincerely appreciate the polite gesture. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:33, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Spelling ==

Sorry about the spelling. Old habits are hard to break, and I find when I am typing quickly, I tend to spell certain words in the same, incorrect way over and over again. One day, when I get around to writing my &quot;spell check bot&quot; (if ever), hopefully I won't have that problem as much. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== PDF for relativity - thanks ==

Thanks for fixing this so quickly! [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:21, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

: You're welcome! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:49, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== Vfd, [[Template:Danger]] ==

I created the template {{tl|Danger}} as a risk warning that you can use on any page that contains dangerous information (like everything that involves making explosives).

We are discussing GFDL and wikibooks and book communities, rights and what nots in &quot;[[:User_talk:Panic2k4#call_for_comment|Call for comments]]&quot; a future policy could and probably should emerge from that discussion in not only to clarify things to all users.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[WB:PAG]] ==

I agree with your proposal that the guideline/policy categories should be merged. A few months back, wikibooks didn't have any guideline categories at all, and I had to create them along with the necessary templates. It seems I didn't do the most efficient job at it. 

Definately make that change, I dont have time today to help out with it, but i should be around later tonight briefly, and much of the morning tomorrow to help out with it. Not that you need alot of help to do this, but it's polite to offer. :) --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:29, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[WB:RFA]] ==

I have nominated you for adminship, at [[WB:RFA]]. If you accept (and I hope you do), the community will vote on the measure. Pending concensus, you could be made into a sysop here. I have nominated you because you are very helpful, and you are active in the realm of policy. Your request to have an admin alter the text of certain protected policies has demonstrated to me that you have a particular need for adminship tools. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:23, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

I would like to move this one to [[Wikibooks:Obscenity]] (changing the words in the text as well), and then move this one to {{tl|policy}} ASAP.

:''Replied on [[Wikibooks talk:Profanity#Not use profanity?]]'' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:50, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

I just wanted to send you a quick message, and see if you have come to some kind of conclusion on this matter? Since you and I are the only ones talking about this policy, I think once we can reach agreement, we can move this to {{tl|policy}}. I think we both can agree that wikibooks ''does need some kind of policy on inappropriate language'', and I would like to see one implemented sooner rather then later. 
To recap: I am against using the word ''offensive'', but I would be willing to change to the word ''obscene'' (or even a combination of &quot;offensive/profane/obscene&quot; in the text, so long as &quot;offensive&quot; is clearly defined). If &quot;obscene&quot; is alright with you, I think we should move forward with it. I would like to point out that wikipedia does use the word [[w:Wikipedia:Profanity|Profanity]] in their policy on the matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

: Sorry, I went off wiki for a bit. I'm currently semi-travelling and the next leap is coming up I'll probably be away again for a week at the beginning of November.
: I'll concede on &quot;offensive&quot; but haven't settled on &quot;profane&quot;/&quot;obscene&quot;.

You may wish to take a look at [[User:Darklama/Templates/lastedit]] and [[User:Darklama/Templates/lastedit/test]]. lastedit is the bases for any countdown templates. [[User:Darklama/Templates/query]] makes use of it and you can see that it works because [[User:Darklama/Templates/query/test]] shows up in SD, which took it 7 days to do. My testing phase to see if the month bit of it work properly is hopefully almost over, lastedit counts by days, weeks or months and its almost been a month now. As you can probably guess by its name lastedit counts from the last time a page was edited rather then the time someone added the template. SB_Johnny seems to prefer it that way, because its more forgiving. Counting from when the template was added is also possible, using subst, you would need to do a double subst using some tricks to make the subst within the template not happen until the second subst is used with its inclusion on a page. From what I've seen this is done by using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;includeonly&gt;subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;VARIABLE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; inside the template and then using subst on the template.

: Yes, I'd found the &quot;''includeonly subst magic''&quot; on Meta, but didn't find out until after trying it that the template needed to be subst-ed.

:: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; doesn't like numbers as big as whats in the timestamps for some reason, thats what my first attempt to give it a go involved. Since that didn't work, I used the individual units instead. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

Another idea that I will probably try to do because of a template that SB_Johnny pointed out to me (that really didn't do as one hoped for), is a generic template that takes a number and determens if that number of days has passed. So that some templates don't require a fixed timeframe in which to be triggered. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:34, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the cleaning today - as (almost) the only RC patroller I get to see (&amp; review) most stuff and to have some action is great.  I noticed you were on the deletion policy talk page too.  It may be that you see some things more my way than others.  For me VfD is a process that needs completing not just starting.  It doesn't worry me to &quot;close&quot; the obvious debates (after all if anyone disagrees they can say so).  I do not want WB to be too like WP but they close the debate in a rather more determined fashion with a border and background colour to the section - any views? It would make it look more &quot;closed&quot; if it's going to sit there for a week (or so) until someone deletes it (or can/should it be arc'd quicker?). I may just try it next time and see what anyone says. Scuse the ramble!

== Templates, categories &amp; time ==

(cross posted to Swift &amp; Darklama as it follows yesterday's chat and I'm not sure who is watching who.  Whoever answers first gets to decide where the chat takes place!)

Continuing to think about this.  I am a real believer that categories should be correctly cat'd in an alpha fashion (not book name) - usually.  However for maintenance type stuff time seems more interesting/important (and seems to be the case for some of this on WP)?  For example I marked a few copyvios about a month ago - '''if''' they are copyvios they should be gone by now.  Equally following threads on RC I found a couple of pages that were marked for &quot;cleanup&quot; a year ago.  The problem is that you would only find out by going to the page.  Worth working on? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:13, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

Could you just confirm that you are happy with Ewen's comments at the bottom of this debate.

== VfD organisation ==

Just to repeat it I do agree with you about the need to change the method here.  I've just found that a number of VfD were not closed properly earlier this year and they still have tags on.  Trying to find the arc is a nightmare but is what I shall do next (I don't think one was even listed properly!).  Anyway I guess it might be best just to change the system - discussions on doing things here seem to end up in long grass quite often - let me know if I can help? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:16, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

: I'm just catching up on the past week and will then hopefully start looking into this. Basically not a lot needs to be done. As I mentioned on the VfD, we should start archiving to sub-pages and then introduce methods to sub-page-fying current VfDs.

== Welcome Usage ==

Why the changes? Some people were having trouble understanding when to use it and I thought it was helpful to include. I also don't see the need for subst for welcome. If the template is changed in the future, I think users who have it on their page will benifit from it reflecting that change rather then staying fixed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:54, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

: Oh, sorry. I was just writing you a message.
: I didn't think I cut anything out of the actual meat of the text. I apologise if I did. My intent was to make the general outline quick and to the point.
: I don't see the need for the welcome template contents to be updated as users generally don't need it once they learn how to use Wikibooks and where to find information.
: Some interesting information is available at [[w:Wikipedia:Template_substitution]] (I'm not imposing WP practice on WB, but drawing on the vast WP knowledge for use here).
: It was asked on [[Template talk:Welcome]] why the template wasn't being substituted and at the time no-one argued that it shouldn't be. I'm all for discussing wheter it should.

:: I was trying to keep the when to use it as short as possible, but felt it needed to be clear that its a judgement call and to give a brief example. I prefer quick and to the point myself, so I can appreciate that, but not if its at the cost of information. Some users may find it useful as a handy reference to keep around to click on whenever they forget something. Having it all in one place, allows users to goto their talk page and click the link they want when they need it rather then seeking it out and they don't have to worry about keeping it up to date. It also allows welcomers to see whose recently been welcomed at a glance through the &quot;what links here&quot; link. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:41, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

::: OK, I personally prefer the principle-approach rather than the example one (the &quot;some seasoned&quot; and &quot;while other&quot; annoys my particularly) but will agree that users may find it more appealing.
::: &quot;''Some users may find it useful as a handy reference to keep around''&quot;. True, but my feeling is that they more often put up such links on their user pages. the links they find useful on their user pages. It would be difficult to gauge the actual attitude of new users since they don't seem to frequent the Staff Lounge. If you actually know something or have a good idea about what users want that would be great to know. I myself have nothing concrete to offer. &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt;
::: Those who don't frequent Wikibooks and might not bother creating their own set of useful links, a radical changing of the template (not unlikely if they are gone long) might be confusing.
::: &quot;''It also allows welcomers to see whose recently been welcomed''&quot;. Why would one want to? &lt;del&gt;This could also be easily done with categories.&lt;/del&gt; --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 23:18, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
:::: Regarding categories: no they of course don't allow time ordering yet. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 23:19, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: I have nothing concrete to offer as far as what users might find helpful or unhelpful either. Those who don't frequent Wikibooks might be caught offguard by any changes in policies or practises that are reflected in the welcome template, but which don't show up for them because of the use of subst. Infrequent users have more to be confused about than a sudden change in the welcome message. A category would probably be better actually then relying on &quot;what links here&quot;. I wasn't talking about sorting by time, by recently welcomed I meant by comparing the &quot;what links here&quot; list with the new user log. &quot;Why would one want to?&quot; To find out what users need to be welcomed I'd imagine.
::::: I read WP:TS to try to see what advantages might be mentioned for using subst in these sort of cases, since at least half my reasoning is due to lack of seeing any advantages to using subst for this. I didn't agree with reasons like &quot;Lots of links&quot;, &quot;might be deleted in the future&quot;, etc. There are no tricks being used in the template that require the use of subst. So I think &quot;why bother?&quot; and focus on the possible advantages to not doing so, including the smaller ones like &quot;less typing&quot; and &quot;less to delete later&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:09, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

== More VfD organising stuff ==

OK - I can see what you are doing and it looks fine.  I'll try one or two myself (how did you get the edit summary so good?), don't worry about deleting, as long as I get my admin rights soon I'll need something to practice on!  So filing away is fine - the problem then is retrieval.  To me we need some kind of cat/index by time (just year?) and then an alpha cat (using SUBPAGENAME)?  Don't worry about actually doing the pages (set the cat up maybe or give me a clue) - so long as I can get a page with the pages on I'll do a run with AWB which will be far more efficient - but what did you have in mind?

== Template (mis)use ==

Hi Swift,

I didn't know I there was a better way to include content on multiple pages other than with templates.  Thanks for the tip.  I thought I had seen something on doing that a long time ago, but when I needed it, I couldn't find the info on how to do it.  And I ''did'' do a pretty thorough search! I finally mistakenly concluded that I must have been thinking about templates, so I went with that.  I have probably fifty such templates that I used for first aid and camping too.  Luckily, I prefixed them all with &quot;Ay&quot; when I created them, so maybe that will make them easier for me to find (though some of them should remain templates as they take arguments and are used throughout my book).  I think what you are suggesting is that I should make them &quot;regular&quot; pages, and then include them in all the place they are used.  Thanks again.

:I'd agree - I was going to suggest one or two of those in VfD for the scrapbook --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== Speedy ==

Fair comment - I kind of expected someone to pull me up on it.  There was &quot;effectively&quot; no content would be my view and I see a sense in which it could have been speedy'd anyway.  Other side of the coin - I just rescued Arran from speedy.  I'd prefer VfD to focus on ones that are real judgment ones that to have the page cluttered so anyone passing might find it less easy to read.  I'll happily get it out of the bin if you feel strongly about it - let me know --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:04, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== How to install h3knix ==

I found that by accident while searching for typoes on wikipedia, and transwikied it to wikibooks. I know nothing about the distribution. I nominated that page for deletion in January but it was kept. I'd be inclined to vote delete for now assuming the distribution doesn't exist anymore.

== I-POD NANO ==

Thanks for the note.  The rendering seems to be OK now.  Your reference to what s meant by &quot;fixed&quot; seems to be what I had in mind.  That block of text, with &quot;Mumfum&quot; appearing at the top was staying in one place even as I scrolled through the page to get to the completely unrelated matter that interested me.  But for this I would never have touched it.  It could very well be that the problem arose from the vandalism which was reversed, but had not yet had the linkages in the servers caught up.  No real harm done. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 06:11, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== Great job! ==

[[Earning the Family Life merit badge]] is on its way to be a great module. Thanks for contributing to this module and Wikibooks. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 12:47, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

: Thanks for the complement, but how this module is progressing is debatable. All I did was wikify. It is still just a copied list without any annotation and needs to find a home somewhere at [[Scouting]] &amp;mdash; which, incidentally, is terrbly organized. &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt; --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:36, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== Answer from es:wikibooks ==

Hello Swift,

''Nanas de la cebolla'' by [[:w:en:Miguel Hernández|Miguel Hernández]] might be in Wikisource, but I believe that his works are '''not''' in the public domain.

The template for speedy deletion in es:wikibooks is [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Plantilla:Borrar]. There is a list of templates for this issues here: [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Categor%C3%ADa:Wikilibros:Plantillas_de_mantenimiento]

Regards,
--[[User:Álvaro M|Álvaro M]] 14:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:PD: Please answer (if you want / need to do that) in es:wikibooks community portal, [[w:ca:Usuari Discussió:Álvaro M]] or in my inbox :-) Thanks --[[User:Álvaro M|Álvaro M]] 14:30, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== Citing wikipedia origins of wikibook material ==

(I think you've dealt with such issues in the past) How does one cite an article in wikipedia as the original source of a wikibook page? Is there a standard protocol, is there a good example to follow or should I just make something up? (I'll watch this page fr your reply - thanks for your time and expertise).

== [[Wikibooks:Profanity]] ==

I just wanted to give you a final heads-up, I'm going to make this page an official policy now. The discussion has stagnated, and besides your objection on the vocabulary used, there is no opposition to the wording. If we want to change the word &quot;profanity&quot; to something else in the future, we certainly can, but if we don't want to change the wording, at least we have some kind of policy on the books concerning this type of content. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:44, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

In regard to [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Panic2k4#Comments_by_User:Swift your comments] and my unresolved dispute with darklama, I have posted some definitions that I would like your input on please see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Ownership#GFDL_and_Authorship GFDL and Authorship] on the WB:OWN discussion page, the concept of authors vs contributors, txs. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:44, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

Feel free to change or evolve your comments on my talk page on those subjects also. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:29, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

: Sorry for not responding, Panic. [[WB:OWN]] and [[WB:WIW]]/[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|Unstable]] have been undergoing massive discussion and, due to lack of time to commit to this, I've stayed out &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt;. I'll try to have a look today (GMT), but cannot guarantee anything. If you would like me to look at anything in particular, let me know and I'd be more likely to find time to squeeze it in. Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Well I'll restrain myself in providing you a filter to the discussion :), I could be accused in being partial to my cause, humm, if you are using firefox get Context Highlight ( http://www.cusser.net/extensions/contexthighlight/ ) and mark the relevant words (author and contributor) and select the ones with have more hits for reading... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 08:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Culling on a talk page? ==

I saw that you removed some discussion on [[Talk:Star Trek Starships]].  While I agree with your sentiment, removing something like the comment made there as if it was never put on there in the first place, when clearly you aren't the person who made the comment, just smacks as almost a vandal attack.

This is also something that is likely to drive away new contributors to Wikibooks.

Please be careful and try to consider that the suggestion to make a coffee table book was something made in good faith.  At least try to explain why it might be a bad idea, instead of treating the user like they never existed in the first place.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

: Could you please [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Star_Trek_Starships&amp;diff=706780&amp;oldid=706569 look again]. I only added a header, an {{tl|unsigned2}} and replied to the comment. Thanks for the concern and bringing this to my attention, though. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::I'm sorry about that.  Something must have happened when I was looking at it.... I really don't know what happened here.  I swear that I saw the content without the contribution by the anonymous user, which is why I rolled back your &quot;contribution&quot;.  Maybe I'm getting very old here and starting to see things by spending far too much time on Wikibooks......  Really, I am very sorry about this.  I thought you had deleted the remark, and I swear my browser didn't display your reply, although the official history doesn't seem to show that.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:36, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::: No problem. Thanks for re-rolling back. And I really do mean that I appreciate your actions and that you brought it to my attention. It is good to know that we aren't allowed to get away with what you saw happen. Cheers, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Sorry to intrude, but I saw the same thing it seems [[User:Swift]] edit took a bit of time to become active, I saw it also as a simple discard of an non signed post about a image book, I thought that [[User:Swift]] had  simply deleted the post as &quot;nonsense&quot;, I noticed [[User:Robert Horning]] post about the problem wile I was posting the other message here, it was a not a very small interval. No one seems to be at fault it was only a infrastructural problem :). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:19, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

==About==
Lighting is one of the easiest areas to analyze in terms of energy efficiency. However, it is often one of the most overlooked areas too.
Types of Lighting
Please goto the subpage for more info: Types of Bulbs

==Energy Audit Procedure==
===Before the Audit===
Before you leave to go on the audit there are some things you need to take care of.

   1. Make sure that you have a &quot;Lighting Inventory Sheet&quot;
   2. Make sure that the light sensor in the tool crib is ready to go (Batteries work)
   3. Read the Walk through Checklist Lighting section

==Data Collection==
Every plant has lights and it will be your job to collect the necessary data to write a report.  Here are the basic things to look for and collect.

   1. Have a plant worker walk you around the plant and help you fill out the &quot;Lighting Inventory Sheet&quot;
   2. Have the plant worker help you make estimates as to how long the lights are on
   3. If you are not sure what types of lights you are looking at do one of the following
         1. Ask the worker
         2. If they don't know ask to see the storage room were spares are kept and use data off them
         3. If all else fails take a guess (Use the color table in the walk through to guess type)
   4. Make sure to take note of lighting on in low use areas (Warehouses, sheds, bathrooms)

==Data Entry==
Use the lighting inventory excel sheet at the bottom of the page to enter all the data you have collected from the plant visit.

   1. Rename sheet (&quot;Lighting Inv &amp; Rec ###.xls&quot;) and replace the ### with report number
   2. Once all the data is entered in the inventory tab you can use the tabs at the bottom of the sheet(Fix 1) to calculate savings.
   3. Choose which type of recommendation you would like to implement located at the top of the page. Once you have entered the fixture information, including code, quantity and hours of operation, the rest of the information will fill itself in. The fixture codes are available on the tab titled 'Fixtures'. Using the information from your inventory, you should be able to find the code easily. The most important information the spreadsheet calculates is the savings column.  The values here give you an idea of how worthwhile your AR is.
   4. Once you have filled out all of the (Fix #) sheets, click the Summary tab. The Summary tab adds up all of the individual sheets demand, energy, materials and labor savings.  This table will be very useful when writing your AR.

==Editing the Lighting Workbook==
To enter a new fixture into the lighting workbook you will need to enter the information on the fixture into the fixture worksheet.

   1. Create a unique code for the new fixture and its ballasts and/or lamps (if not already in the Ballast/lamp worksheets)
   2. Fill out any Ballast/lamp information
   3. Copy the Ballast/Lamp codes into the appropriate boxes on the Fixture worksheet.
   4. To get watts/Lamp use the code  VLOOKUP($I126,Lamps!$A$4:$G$79,4,FALSE) and change 126 to the row your entry is in and 79 to whatever row the corresponding lamp is in.
   5. Enter all other Fixture information
   6. To get the inventory to recognize the Fixture code you need to go to the Formulas tab and Select Name Manager.  This will bring up a box with a list of Names, scroll down until you find Fixture table then change the scope to include your new entry.
   7. To get the Recommendations to recognize the lamps/ballasts you need to do the same as above for Lamps Table and Ballasts Table.

==Report Writing==
In order to start your AR, first follow the general instructions under the 'Starting an AR Write-up' section.  Now that you have a basic outline of your AR, you can begin. Old AR's are the most important resource when writing. Most reports have a lighting AR, and it is highly likely that you will be able to find one very similar to what you're working on. You can use the old AR as an outline, that when filled in with your information and edited to your specifications, will work as a good draft. Make sure your Calculation Methodology is as concise as possible and very easy to follow. That way, the client can easily replicate your calculations with other data if needed. Add subheadings when dealing with multiple savings/implementation costs.  After your calculation methodology is finished, copy all of the (Fix #) sheets from Excel into the end of the section. Make sure your Persuasive is concise and includes a picture related to your AR.
Appendix Writing
The lighting appendix is similar in all reports.  It includes important definitions for the client to easily follow the report followed by the lighting inventory you created in the excel spreadsheet.  An example of definitions is attached at the bottom of this web page.

==Past Energy Savings Opportunities==
* 542 - AR &quot;Upgrade 400W Metal Halides T5 High Output&quot;
* 543 - AR &quot;Upgrade Lighting and add Motion Sensors&quot;

==Tutorials==
* Include 'How Tos' on software (i.e. MotorMaster, system specific stuff), uploaded spreadsheets, etc. Using CamStudio would be good for this

Hi, I saw you had the black squares, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Blender_3D%3A_Noob_to_Pro%2FDie_Another_Way&amp;diff=1419490&amp;oldid=1419470 I had them too]. Just press TAB twice and they are gone (display problem).

                                Have you ever had a bad feeling about something, like a 
                               bird or a cat or a tree? Mabye a person? A place? It's
                                because your aura is broken by the evilforce or presence.
                               If that question appealed to you read on to find out what

      <comment>Shadow people</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Shadow people ==

Shadow people (also known as shadow men or shadow beings) are a supernatural phenomenon reported by some individuals. Most accounts of shadow people describe them as black humanoid silhouettes, lacking mouths or eyes, although they are sometimes reported to have red or yellow eyes. They are generally described as lacking mass, although their specific nature varies from two-dimensional (like a shadow) to vaporous or distorted. Their movement is often reported as being very quick and disjointed, or &quot;jiggly&quot;, in the sense that they first may move slowly like a fluid (similar to jello rather than water), then rapidly &quot;hop&quot; to another part of a witness' surroundings. Some witnesses describe this movement as though the shadow entities they have seen &quot;danced&quot; from one wall to the next. 

Observers of shadow people most commonly report that the forms appear at the edge of their field of vision, and that they disintegrate or move into walls when noticed, usually within a split second. However, many also report shadow people appearing in the center of their vision, appearing very close to them, or remaining for several seconds before disappearing. Some individuals have described being menaced, chased, or (more rarely) attacked or raped by shadow people. 

Sightings of shadow people have been reported all over the world. They are a recurring topic of the late-night talk radio show Coast-to-Coast AM. The former host of the show, Art Bell, seemingly resurrected the term &quot;shadow people.&quot; The term appeared as early as September 21, 1953 as the title of a radio drama that was broadcast on Chicago's WGN-AM &quot;Hall of Fantasy&quot;* series. However, reports of beings fitting the description of shadow people have been recorded for centuries in literature. For example, in 1887, celebrated French author Guy de Maupassant pennned the story &quot;Le Horla&quot; (&quot;The Horla&quot;) about shadowy beings who live on milk and water, bedevil human minds, and stalk the unwary.

 
Types 
Category 1 
This category falls into drugs use, seizures, and other mental issues. This category covers a very vast description and is known to have descriptions that may or may not match what others describe in category 2 and 3. Category 1 actually may not be considered shadow people at all due to the non consistancy in the descriptions. 

Category 2 
This category falls more into the ghost and spirit category. The descriptions in this category are as follows: non human shaped shadows or masses of human shaped shadow people in one place, insect shadows, animal shadow people, and women shadow people. These are mostly see thru shadows. Category 2 shadow people tend to be drawn more to a location than a person. It is common for this category to actually try and not become seen. Light may affect this group. 

Category 3 
This category does not fall into the ghost or Spirit category. This category has only 2 types of shadow people, One tall shadow man and several small hooded &quot;twin&quot; style shadow people. These are usually seen non see thru however they may be see thru. This category is more drawn to a person rather than a place, this category may actually be drawn to a certain spirit or ghost as well as humans. This category tends to not care about being seen. Light has no effect on this group. 







Shadow people versus ghosts
Alleged eyewitness accounts of shadow people differ from those of ghosts in many respects. Ghosts are said to be the disembodied spirits of people and are usually said by alleged eyewitnesses to take on the appearance of people, orbs, or mist when seen. 

While ghosts are often said to resemble actual people, accounts of shadow beings generally do not. Although accounts describe shadow beings as having humanlike form, they are generally not described as resembling actual individuals (living or deceased or deive). The cause of shadow people or shadow beings is also not generally attributed to be haunting by ghosts. 

Since accounts of ghosts and shadow people are anecdotal and have not been scientifically verified, such differences are not conclusive. 

Eyewitness accounts
Alleged eyewitness reports of these beings are often similar. In these accounts there are almost always the same forms: a blob-like cluster that sometimes has tendrils, a child-sized being, sometimes with a hood, a tall willowy figure with a jack-o'-lantern-sized head, and a tall figure with a hat. In these accounts, the figures typically follow a progression from the ambiguous blob and finally the tall man, meaning that over time they take on more human appearance. Much less frequently red glowing eyes are reported. Some witnesses also claim to have been attacked, resulting in scratches, bruises, or burns. 

The more consistent accounts typically describe a feeling of dread associated with the presence of these phenomena, and animals are said to react to the phenomena with fear and hostility. Shadow Beings are said to move extremely fast and travel through solid matter. They typically are said to have no discernable features such as mouths, noses, or eyes. Their forms are usually described as somewhat skeletal or thin. Direct visual contact is rarely reported by alleged eyewitnesses with shadow people; they are said to usually disappear before they can be seen clearly, and are seen &quot;in the corner of one's eye.&quot; These beings are said to often appear in mirrors. 




Shadow People In General
Heidi Hollis, researcher on Shadow People, has come up with some very generalized information on Shadow People. She has appeared on Coast To Coast AM several times. Taken from coasttocoastam.com: 

Shadow people have been around since the beginning of time and are a dark influence upon society, she said. They also relate to negative alien entities such as the Reptilians and Greys (alien species), and may in fact be part of the same overall phenomena, she added. 

Typically, shadow beings don't like to be spotted but they are sometimes discovered by a person who wakes up to find them trying to choke or suffocate them, noted Hollis, who presented several methods for decreasing or eliminating incidents with them: 

Learn to let go of your fear. 
Stand your ground and deny them access to your person. 
Focus on positive thoughts. 
Use the name of Jesus to repel them. 
Keep a light on or envision light surrounding you. 
Bless your room with bottled spring water. 
A type of shadow being referred to as the &quot;Hat Man&quot; is actually more akin to the devil or a demon, Hollis revealed. He is often seen wearing a fedora hat, trench coat and three-piece suit, and might appear more solid than other shadow entities. She suggested that these very negative beings are seeking to increase their numbers by recruiting an army of people to the dark side. 

Explanations
Several explanations have been proposed for the appearance of shadow people. 

Paranormal explanations
Some explanations for shadow people come from the fields of parapsychology, metaphysics, cryptozoology, and demonology, and are considered by many to be pseudoscience. Other explanations make no scientific pretense whatever, and lie more within the realm of religion and the occult. 

One of the more creative theories is that shadow beings are manifest thought forms (known in occult circles as egregores or tulpas), meaning that they are either collections of negative psychic energy from areas where traumatic events have taken place and evil people frequent, or have been intentionally created for some nefarious purpose. The negative psychic energy begins to manifest and takes on form and motive, thriving on fear and negative emotions for sustenance (astral vampires). 
Shadow beings have also been described as forms of ghosts, demons, inter-dimensional beings, and extraterrestrial lifes. One of the more popular explanations seems to be that they are some sort of other-dimensional beings whose dimension of origin occasionally overlaps with ours, which is said to explain their ethereal appearance and fleeting nature. 
Many who attach religious significance to the phenomena apply more credit to the demonic explanation. This is due to the phenomena usually being witnessed in places said to have a stigma of great negative energy. Such places include &quot;haunted locations&quot; or places where extreme emotional or physical abuse have transpired and feelings of fear, dread, and hatred somehow linger in the atmosphere beyond the temporal passing of sad events. Some however have made a connection between the black smoke apperance of this phenomena and the Jinn of Islamic belief. The Jinn are described as normally being invisible to humans and when seen having the apperance of Black smoke, making them very simular in apperance to the phenomena of shadow people. 
In Native American Cherokee mythology there is an evil witch known as the Raven Mocker that takes the form of a spectral bird and shifts into a humanoid, shadow-like phantom. These beings are said to steal the souls of the ill or dying. Such creatures are alleged to fear the shaman or medicine man and so do not enter a home where one resides. A medicine man was sought to watch over the infirm and also to watch over the bodies of the recently deceased, as according to myth once the body was buried the Raven Mocker could not steal the soul. 
A much less held view is that shadow people play a guardian angel role, protecting the individual from, or more accurately warning them of, impending danger; similar to the mothman. 
Some witnesses reported that they have seen hooded figures much like shadow people, blinking barely. This could explain some shadow people accounts of people seeing standing or hovering shapes. 
Non-paranormal explanations
Eyewitness accounts of shadow people are neither hoaxes nor actual paranormal experiences, but rather hallucinations or delusions. 

Hypnogogia (waking sleep) is an accepted state of semiconsciousness in which a person can be thinking clearly and yet perceiving images that are being dreamed. This state is often used to explain apparently paranormal experiences. 
Scientists have theorized that under the right conditions erratic electromagnetic field behavior can interfere with the electrical impulses or firing synapses of the human mind, thus influencing people subjected to such environments over time to believe that they are hearing or seeing ghosts, aliens, or perhaps shadow people. Such environments include old buildings with substandard wiring, power plants, and areas with naturally occurring strong magnetic fields. 
Drug induced hallucinations, such as those experienced by habitual heroin users, are known to reflect experiences similar to this phenomena. However, many witnesses do not use narcotics so the majority of accounts cannot be linked to this explanation. Individuals who recreationally use or overdose on diphenhydramine products such as Benadryl, or plants such as Datura, often report seeing shadow creatures and people, but more commonly, the amobea-like entities that usually prelude the appearance of shadow people . These celluar entities are said to be often incredibly detailed beings (complete with vacuoles,plasmodium, and mitochondria , etc.) 
The brain is also wired to perceive faces and other human characteristics in random patterns, called Pareidolia. 
The similarities between eyewitness accounts of shadow people remains difficult to explain scientifically. In particular the tall gingerbread-like man with a hat that is reported as often by 4-year-old children as with adults. The similarities may, however, simply reflect common archetypes</text>

===Foraging===
Original Affluent Society: I added a Wikipedia link for the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, as well as capitalized an S. --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:31, 9 March 2009 (UTC) [[Abmort]]

I edited some grammar stuff in the reciprocity section --[[User:Chandler5416|Chandler5416]]

I reworded a sentence about 90% of the people in the US used foraging in the past. It didn't make sense how the person worded it so i rewrote it. --[[User:Maurer7597|Maurer7597]] ([[User talk:Maurer7597|talk]]) 04:26, 9 March 2009 (UTC) [[maurer7597]] Melissa Maurer

I just added some more information about the Ache under the foraging section. I went into more detail about how the hunter never eats his own catch, and his family always receives the same amount of meat as the rest of the tribe - i pretty much just stressed the importance of cooperation and sharing in their tribe. --[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:35, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607

I refined the writing of this section on foraging cultures a bit to make the information flow smoother .  I also fixed some grammatical errors and changed some of the content into the third person point of view to maintain the objectivity of the writing.

I added the picture of the Hadza people to show an example of foraging people. [[carr7805]]

I changed &quot;the foraging people&quot; to &quot;foragers.&quot; - [[egoronkin]]

I found and fixed a few more spelling/grammatical errors. --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 00:15, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
 

Thanks for the changes and edits! I appreciate the input. What you guys added fits in well with what I was trying to convey and enhances this section!

==Consumption==
I took out up in the first sentence and added an &quot;s&quot; to good...better flow...
&quot;consumption is defined as the use of material goods necessary for human survival- for example by eating food or wearing clothing&quot;  I edited this sentence
[[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]]

In this whole section I fixed grammatical errors, and now the whole section reads more smoothly. I also took out the parts about economists not caring about consuption, since our speding and consumption is what drives are economy, they do study it and care about it. Plus it brings back the focus of anthropologists roles.
[[User:Muellep3|Muellep3]]

====Why do people consume what they do?====

I fixed a few spelling errors, as well as added &quot;they utilize THE PHYSICAL WORLD&quot; instead of &quot;...they utilize THEY&quot;. I also added a wikipedia link to the cultural ecology page. --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:25, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Abmort

===Ecology and consumption===
I changed the subheading to &quot;ecology and consumption&quot; so that the topic of ecology would be immediately relevant to readers that are looking for information on consumption. I realize consumption was related to the ecology in the later paragraphs, but a change in the title might serve well.[[User:Strebep6463|Strebep6463]] ([[User talk:Strebep6463|talk]]) 18:34, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to wikipedia for the word ecology. I feel like it would be more helpful to post a direct link to it rather than just having it bolded. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:48, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I addressed the fact that America is the world's largest consumer. [[User:Marissafederspiel|Marissafederspiel]]

I made a few grammatical changes to the Ecology and Consumption section to give more clarity and fluency in reading.  [[User:cayab|Cayab]]

12. Consumption (found near the bottom of the page):
Added two Wikipedia links, one for Consumption and another for America. --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:25, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Abmort

==Cultivation==
the horticulture section should talk about slash and burning as well as that it differs from agriculture in the fact that its a 
smaller scale and also produces a larger variety of crops. knight9366 ([[User talk: knight9366|talk]]) 15: 04 1 march

I'll take the other two modes of production, please. (Non industrial and alienation)--[[User:Flintp3360|Flintp3360]] ([[User talk:Flintp3360|talk]]) 05:36, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link for the horticulture section becasue every other section had one. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:07, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the agriculture section by deleting excess words --[[User:Chandler5416|Chandler5416]]

I moved the picture in the agriculture section to the second paragraph, since thats what it goes along with. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:43, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to land ownership in the agriculture section because land ownership is a big part of agriculture so I thought that it should be a link as well! Great write up about agriculture though! [[User:Lalondk|Lalondk]] ([[User talk:Lalondk|talk]]) 19:58, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

Oh, good idea. Land ownership is definitely a huge aspect of this topic so that link will help people get a little more information on what exactly is involved in the ownership and land rights, etc. Thanks for the change! [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:14, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
===Grameen Bank===
I created this topic a couple of days ago. I know someone said they would do the Grameen Bank, I am sorry I did not sign the topic after I created it. You are more than welcome to make any additions to this topic, there is quite a lot of really impressive information about this banking system and could easily use some more detail. Also, to make note, I forgot to change the summary when making my edits, I hope that is not to big of a problem, I will try and remember to do that from now on.

I discussed Kiva to use as an illustration of a company that features microcredit. I am involved in this and am able to speak of the benefits after having read and taken part of their program. [[User:MarissaFederspiel]]

Also, I created links from my Kiva paragraph to other sites, further explaining my concepts. [[User:MarissaFederspiel]]

I moved the image of &quot;Nobel Laureate, Muhammad Yunus, the bank's founder&quot; to the left to take away the space in the section and help make the section look more put together. [allumbt]

===Modes of Exchange===

Foraging: I made a few fixes in spelling and punctuation. Also, I restructured a couple sentences to allow for easier understanding. --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:17, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Abmort

Yanamo:  I edited &quot;native America&quot; to &quot;South America&quot; --[[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]]

Yanamo: I made minor punctuation and spelling fixes such as changing &quot;matieral&quot; to &quot;material&quot; --[[User:Abmort|Abmort]] ([[User talk:Abmort|talk]]) 23:13, 9 March 2009 (UTC)Abmort

Market Exchange: I just edited what I had previously submitted to make it flow better. I also added a few new things, like the other wiki link. 

I also noticed that someone had added redistribution and reciprocity, so i defined both of them when talking about market exchange to help relate the two to market exchange. I also showed how these are related to market exchange in my ethnographic example

Market Exchange: I just added information for the market exchange mode of exchange. Someone also added writing for the redistribution mode of exchange, so the only mode left that needs to be covered is reciprocity --[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:29, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607

For my example of market exchange I just said the United States, but didnt go into much detail about it. You can add any additional examples, or go into more depth about how the U.S. is an example of market exchange if you want. --[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:46, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607 

i also added a link to Karl Polanyi in my writing (market exchange). I thought this would be helpful since many people probably dont know who he is, and he is very important to the &quot;modes of exchange&quot; section, considering he proposed the three modes of exchange that we're talking about here....feel free to add any other links or additional information. --[[User:Norton3607|Norton3607]] ([[User talk:Norton3607|talk]]) 00:41, 5 March 2009 (UTC)norton3607

Someone rearranged my paragraphs and moved my link. It made the page look much more concise to the reader. Thank you.

Market Exchange: I revised the paragraphs, fixed some typo errors, moved some words around, added some HTML markup to make the citations neater, and in general just made the whole thing flow better. --[[User:ZacharyShaffer|ZacharyShaffer]] ([[User talk:ZacharyShaffer|talk]]) 04:03, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I Just took out Melissa's name from the beginning of Redistribution

I added Agriculture as a tab under Modes of Production. [[User:Marissafederspiel]]

==Modes of Production==
I took out a comma that didn't need to be in the first couple sentences. [[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]] 

Also added a wikipedia link for &quot;mode of production&quot; [[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]] 

I edited some of what some one already had,and I added some photos from wikipedia. If anyone wants to add anything else please feel free/ [[User:Luna6045|Luna6045]] ([[User talk:Luna6045|talk]]) 04:45, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

I just made the section flow better.

===Distribution, Exchange===
I edited my paragraphs about redistribution and reciprocity so that they would flow better when other people are reading them. I also added some content to redistribution and to the ethnographic example on redistribution! [[User:Lalondk|Lalondk]] ([[User talk:Lalondk|talk]]) 04:05, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to both redistribution and reciprocity. I think this gives the reader an alternative in case they want to know a little more about these two topics. Good paragraphs though, very well written and well thought out. Flows smoothly. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 20:20, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I also bolded the three different types of reciporcities that you mentioned in your second section. This kind of makes it more clear to the reader what the main types are and where they are located. Gives it an overall better look. [[User:CareyD173|CareyD173]] ([[User talk:CareyD173|talk]]) 23:00, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I definitely think that those corrections add to the section on reciprocity and redistribution! Thanks for the feedback! [[User:Lalondk|Lalondk]] ([[User talk:Lalondk|talk]]) 23:20, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

===Horticulture===
I changed &quot;Kids have a more active role in this society than others because they weed and plant seeds&quot; to &quot;Children have an important role in a horticultural society because they weed and plant seeds, for example&quot; because children historically have had active roles in some agricultural (and even industrial — think of child labor) societies as well, and it'd be hard to quantify such a thing. [[User:Strebep6463|Strebep6463]] ([[User talk:Strebep6463|talk]]) 22:24, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I simply removed a y from the word the in front of &quot;work is distributed&quot;....Whitcomb5739

===Pastoralism===
You stated that &quot;they often struggle with land rights&quot; and I took that out because you addressed later in the paragraph how there are no formal land rights, rather land is shared with family or certain groups.  I thought the struggle with land rights made it sound as if they had had conflict from this method.  And I do not believe they do.

I added an ehthnographic example about the Masaai people to this section [[User:White9354|White9354]] ([[User talk:White9354|talk]]) 23:22, 9 March 2009 (UTC)white9354

===Industrialism===
I cleaned up a few awkwardly phrased sentences, added a Wiki link to Industry and fixed some formatting and typos.  [[User:Rosen1347]]
I'm not really sure that industrialism helps to spread culture, but i think i understand what you're trying to say, syntax is still a little strange [[user;narkewicz]]

===Post-Industrial/Information===
Edited sentence structure from &quot;Such economic transitions&quot;.. to &quot;economic transitions such as...&quot;
[[User:Ekholm5421|Ekholm5421]]

===Means of Production===
I added some links to wikipedia for some key terms and deleeted a word that occurred twice in a sentence.  [[User:JoelSheppard]]

I added a link to the potlatch section to highlight the main point.  [[User:cayab|cayab]]</text>

}}

The '''4013''' contains two independent D-type flip-flops with asynchronous set/reset inputs. Whenever the set or reset pins go high, the appropriate output is expressed immediately on the outputs. When set and reset are low, the output shows the data at the input at the time of the last low-to-high clock transistion. This is then held until the next transistion.

For more information on D-type flip-flops, refer to [[Practical Electronics/Flip-flops|this module]].

&lt;big&gt;'''Hypothyroidism'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Head &amp; Neck Cancer==
*'''U of Florida; 2005''' PMID 15923797 -- &quot;Thyroid function should be monitored following radiotherapy to the low neck.&quot; (Garcia-Serra A, Amdur RJ, Morris CG, Mazzaferri E, Mendenhall WM. Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Jun;28(3):255-8.)
**Retrospective. 504 patients whose RT fields included the thyroid gland and defined as TSH &gt;= 4.5 mIU/L.
**Outcome: 5-year hypothyroidism all patients 22% (42% in those patients with documented post-treatment TSH levels), 10-year 49% of all patients (74% in those patients with documented post-treatment TSH)
**Recommendations: Check Serum TSH q6 months for the first 5 years and yearly thereafter.

*'''Cleveland Clinic; 2001''' PMID 11753963 -- &quot;Hypothyroidism: a frequent event after radiotherapy and after radiotherapy with chemotherapy for patients with head and neck carcinoma.&quot; (Mercado G, Cancer. 2001 Dec 1;92(11):2892-7.)
**Retrospective. 143 patients, H&amp;N cancer, RT or chemo-RT. TSH measured regularly. Median F/U 4.4 years
**Outcome: 5-year hypothyroidism 48%, 8-year 67%. Median time-to-development 1.4 years
**Conclusion: Incidence of hypothyroidism higher than generally reported

==Breast Cancer==
*'''MD Anderson; 2008''' PMID 18213620 -- &quot;Risk of hypothyroidism in older breast cancer patients treated with radiation.&quot; (Smith GL, Cancer. 2008 Mar 15;112(6):1371-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23307.)
**SEER analysis, 1992-2002. Stage 0-III breast cancer and cancer-free controls
**Outcome: 5-year incidence of hypothyroidism 14% identical among non-irradiated, irradiated with N0, and irradiated with 4+ LN. After adjustment for sociodemographic/clinical characteristics, no difference between irradiated N0 and irradiated 4+ LN (HR 1.04) but both groups significantly higher than non-irradiated patients (HR 1.21, SS)
**Conclusion: Development of hypothyroidism common in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation; SCV irradiation doesn't appear to amplify risks</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:32, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

'''Before''' you go ahead and publish Question Writer Tracker you must set up your Tracker account.  Details on how to do this are shown in [[Question Writer 3 Manual/Save and Publish/Question Writer Tracker|Question Writer Tracker]].  

When have registered you will have 100MB storage space and a monthly bandwidth allowance of 1GB (1024MB) for free. All the quizzes you publish this way will be automatically tracked for you, so you can log on any time to see the results and analyse the responses to questions.

When you select publish to '''Question Writer Tracker''', Question Writer will ask you to enter the email and password that you used when you registered for your Tracker account. 

[[Image:QW Tracker_Login.jpg|center]] 
&lt;br&gt;

Question Writer will then automatically create the files and publish them on the Question Writer Tracker web page.  A pop up box will appear monitoring the progress.  When this has been completed a message will appear confirming the success of the operation.


 [[Image:QW3 web message.jpg|center]]

You can then paste the link directly onto your own website, or into an email or other document for distribution to whoever you want to access your quiz.

If you click '''yes''' on this message you will be taken directly to your quiz.

The quiz will be listed in Question Writer Tracker under the name that you gave as the Title to the Quiz in Quiz Properties, not the name that you have saved the quiz file under.  If you generate a new version of the same quiz, any older version will be overwritten in Question Writer Tracker, unless you give the new version a new name as Quiz Title. When you publish to tracker with the same quiz title you will be given a prompt to confirm that you do want to overwrite an existing quiz.

[[File:QW Tracker Overwrite.jpg|center]]


When you next you log into Question Writer Tracker, go to the Quizzes page.  Here you will be able to see all the quizzes you have uploaded to Tracker along with information about how much of your free space you have used.  You can also copy the link for any of your published quizzes, use the link to go to the quiz or remove the quiz by clicking on the red cross beside it.   

[[Image:QW3 tracker menu.jpg|center]]


At the top right hand of the screen you will see menu options allowing you to view or amend the details of your Tracker Account, go to the Results page or Log Out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Question Writer Tracker==


Question Writer Tracker is a free service from Question Writer.  It allows you to track and analyze the results for all your quizzes published on line and also provides webspace where you can upload your quizzes for easy access.

Once your quiz is published online you can create user tokens to restrict access to the quiz, eg to people who have paid or have reached some other criteria.  See the Question Writer blog for more detail on this [http://www.questionwriterblog.com/archives/2009/03/one_time_use_token.html]

To use this service you will have to register on the Question Writer website [http://www.questionwritertracker.com/account/login].  Enter your email address as your user name and a password (one that you will remember!). 

   
[[Image:QW3 tracker login.jpg|center]]

  
An email will be sent to your email address asking you to confirm that it is really you that is registering and once you have verified that, you will be able to publish quizzes to Question Writer Tracker and login and view your results. 


You also have the option to amend your account details at any time.  This includes your contact details, your Google Analytics ID and the automatic emailing of all results (even if you have not ticked the box in [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings|Web Settings]]). 


If you want to have results sent to the Tracker you will have to use the same email address in the set up to [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings/Send Results over the Internet|Send Results over the Internet]] as you used to set up your tracker account.  You can use the Question Writer results service for all quizzes, whether they are published using the Question Writer Tracker webspace or your own website.  More information on the results service can be found in the [[../Results/]] section of this chapter.

Thanks for the typo edits in the Method Manual for Salt Lake Studies.[[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 04:20, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

My goodness, you have been busy! Thanks again - it is folk such as yourself who have great attention to detail that turn my meanderings into readable text. I often feel that I am simply laying out the bare bones of the manual in a blinding hurry, when I get a gap in my day. I keep hoping for someone to fill in the blanks and catch my typos! At least the latter is occurring, thanks to you. [[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 01:49, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

Some things I plan to do to bring this family up to snuff:
*Adjust the help page so it serves as a user's guide as well as a programmer's manual.
*Add some top-navbox style options:
**Font size (normal or small; this might extend to the bottom navbox, not sure one way or 'tother).
**Arrow type (&lt;big&gt;←&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; would probably be the default).
**Alternative form that sits in the upper right corner, instead of spanning left-to-right.
*Right-hand links on bottom navbox, with anchors by module name.
*External links as an additional navlist entry type.
*Client template to generate print version of the book.

: I tried to add support for named colors like background=black. Apparently the first approach didn't work, so instead of using &amp;amp;nbsp; I've tried another approach which seems to be working. I also seemed to have missed a few places where I needed to switch around #'s and I think I found them all this time. What were you having trouble with?

:: In answer to your first question, the earlier approach with nbsp broke everything that actually used the color returned by Navlist/Map/Background or Navlist/Map/Border; I first noticed that from one of the Conlang pages, but once I knew what to look for it was observable from test case D on Navlist/Top.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 03:38, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The six &lt;u&gt;attributes&lt;/u&gt; in Dungeons and Dragons (hereafter referred to as &quot;DnD&quot;) define certain physical or mental abilities of a character, monster, or non-player character (NPC). These are:
* '''Strength''' (Str)
* '''Dexterity''' (Dex)
* '''Constitution''' (Con)
* '''Intelligence''' (Int)
* '''Wisdom''' (Wis)
* '''Charisma''' (Cha)

The most common methods to determine these scores are as follows:
# The player rolls 3d6 six times and places the scores where they are wanted. On average, this will produce a typical individual selected at random from the population. It is suitable for a low-powered campaign.
# An ability score is determined by rolling 4d6 and discard the lowest score. This is repeated six times and each score is placed next to the ability where they are wanted by the player. This method tends to produce higher than average scores, which is more appropriate for a heroic character.
# The point buy method is used to purchase ability scores out of a pool of points. The number of points available is determined by the DM from table 2 below. This method has the benefit of allowing the player to create just the type of character she wants to run. A drawback may be the relative ease of [[W:min-maxing|min-maxing]] the character. That is, the player can exaggerate the beneficial abilities for their character while minimizing the less useful abilities.

Hello, I've moved the page you created ([[Attributes]]) to [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons/Attributes]] as this is the recommended book structure. I've also updated the main [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] page so that the red links will now create pages in the right structure.

== Broken Ribs ==
On March 21 I came off my motorcycle while crossing some tram tracks early in the morning.

Several hours later when I regain consciousness, I awake in hospital with great confusion as to the year, let alone the day or month. Even now a few weeks later, I have no memory of what occurred in the accident, but have since learned that the cartilage in my neck (c5-c6) was badly compressed too.

After being prescribed medication to manage the pain, I discover from my doctor that it prevents bones from healing, thank you public health service. A few weeks down the track the excruciating pain from my ribs has reduced to merely extremely painful.

Hopefully as my ribs knit together over the next week the pain will substantially reduce. I can't wait.

[[Image:Blender3D WhatIsA3DSpace.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Figure 1:''' Objects in a three dimensional space. In the center of the coordinate system is the origin of the global coordinate system.]]

We'll start looking at how 3D scenes are represented in Blender.

As was explained in {{B3D:N2P/Module|3D Geometry}}, Blender represents locations in a scene by their coordinates.  The coordinates of a location consist of three numbers that define its distance and direction from a fixed origin.  More precisely:
* The first (or x-) coordinate of the location is defined as its distance from the YZ plane (the one containing both the Y and Z axes).  Locations on the +X side of this plane are assigned positive x-coordinates, and those on the -X side are given negative ones.
* Its second (or y-) coordinate is its distance from the XZ plane, with locations on the -Y side of this plane having negative y-coordinates.
* Its third (or z-) coordinate is its distance from the XY plane, with locations on the -Z side of this plane having negative z-coordinates.

Thus the origin (which lies at the junction of all three axes and all three planes) has coordinates (0, 0, 0).
{{clear}}

== Global and local coordinates ==

Blender refers to the coordinate system described above as the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|global coordinate system}}, though it's not truly global—each scene has its own global coordinate system.  Each global coordinate system has a fixed origin and a fixed orientation, but we can view it from different angles by moving a virtual camera through the scene and/or rotating the camera.

Global coordinates are adequate for scenes containing a single fixed object and scenes in which each object is merely a single point in the scene.   When dealing with objects that move around (or multiple objects with sizes and shapes), it's helpful to define a '''local coordinate system''' for each object, a coordinate system that can move with the object and follow the object around.   The origin of an object's local coordinate system is often called the '''center of the object''' even though it needn't coincide with the geometrical center of the object.

3D objects in Blender are largely described using {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|vertices}} (points in the object, singular form: '''vertex''').  The global coordinates of a vertex depend on:
* the (x, y, z) coordinates of the vertex in the object's '''local''' coordinate system
* the location of the object's center
* any rotation (turning) of the local coordinates system relative to the global coordinate system, and
* any scaling (magnification or reduction) of the local coordinate system relative to the global coordinate system.

For example, the teacup in Figure 1 is described by a mesh model containing 171 vertices, each having a different set of local (x, y, z) coordinates relative to the cup's center.  If you {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|translate}} the cup (move it without rotating), the only bits of the model that have to change are the global coordinates of the center; the local coordinates of all its vertices would remain the same.

=== Coordinates of child objects ===

[[Image:Blender3D ParentChildCoordinates.png|thumb|400px|'''Figure 1b:''' A parent serves as the source of the global coordinates for its child object. The child is the cup; the parent's orientation is shown with the colored arrows. [[File:Blender3d ParentChildCoordinateAnimation.gif|thumb|200px|Animation of the above]] ]]

Any object can act as a {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|parent}} for one or more other objects in the same scene, which are then referred to as its {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|children}}.  (An object cannot have more than one direct parent, but parent objects may themselves be the children of other objects.)

If an object has a parent, its position, rotation, and scaling are measured in the parent's local coordinate system, almost as if it were a vertex of the parent.  That is to say, the position of the child's center is measured from the parent's center instead of the origin of the global coordinate system.  So if you move a parent object, its children move too, even though the children's coordinates have not changed.  The orientation and scaling of a child's local coordinate system are likewise measured relative to those of its parent.  If you rotate the parent, the child will rotate (and perhaps revolve) around the same axis.

Parent-child relationships between objects make it simpler to perform (and animate) rotations, scaling and moving in arbitrary directions.  In '''Fig. 1b''' the teacup is a child object of the coordinate cross on the right. That cross is itself the child of an invisible parent. (It is both a parent and child.) In the cup's local coordinate system, it is not rotating, but as the cross on the right rotates around its Z axis, it causes the cup to rotate and revolve. In real animations, it will be much easier when the character holding the cup rotates, the cup changes its position respectively.

{{clear}}

== View coordinates ==

[[Image:Blender3D ViewCoordinatesProjectionPlane.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Figure 2:''' View coordinates and Projection Plane]]
Taking the viewer of the scene into consideration, there is another coordinate space: the view coordinates. In '''Fig. 2''' the viewer is symbolized by the camera. The Z axis of the view coordinates always points directly to the viewer in orthographic projection. The X axis points to the right, the Y axis points upwards ('''Fig. 3''').

[[Image:Blender3d ViewCoordinates.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Figure 3:''' View coordinates in viewing direction]]
In fact you always work in view coordinates if you don't set it any other way*. This is
particularly handy if you have aligned your view prior to modeling something, e.g. if an object has a slanted roof and you want to create a window to fit in this roof, it would be very complicated to build this window aligned to the local coordinate system of the object, but if you first align your view to the slanted roof you can easily work in this view coordinate system.

(* In the Blender 2.6 series, the default has been changed to global coordinates. View coordinates remain as an option.)

If you work in one of the three standard views (Front/Top/Side) the alignment of the view coordinates fits the global coordinates; therefore it is quite natural to model in one of the standard views and many people find this the best way to model.

== Normal coordinates ==

[[Image:Blender3d NormalKoordinates.jpg|thumb|400px|'''Figure 4:''' Normal coordinate spaces for faces. The normal is shown in blue.]]

Although Blender is a 3D program, only the faces are visible. The orientation of the faces is important for many reasons. For example, in our daily lives it seems quite obvious that a book lies flat on a table. This requires the surface of the table and that of the book to be parallel to each other. If we put a book on a table in a 3D program, there is no mechanism that forces these surfaces to be parallel; we have to ensure that ourselves.

The orientation of a face can be described with the help of a so-called {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|surface normal}}. It is always perpendicular to the surface. If several faces are selected, the resulting normal is averaged from the normals of every single face. In '''Fig. 4''' the normal coordinates of the visible faces are drawn.

This concept can be applied to individual points on the object, even if the points themselves have no orientation. The normal of a point is the average of normals of the adjacent faces.

''The images for this tutorial were produced with Blender v2.46.''

== UV Coordinates ==
In later parts (for example, talking about textures) you will come across coordinates labelled “U” and “V”. These are simply different letters chosen to avoid confusion over “X”, “Y” and “Z”. For example, a raster image is normally laid out on a flat, two-dimensional plane. Each point on the image can be identified by X and Y coordinates. But Blender can take this image and wrap it around the surface of a 3D object as a texture. Points on/in the object have X, Y and Z coordinates. So to avoid confusion, the points on the image are identified using U and V to label their coordinates instead of X and Y. We then refer to “UV mapping” as the process of determining where each (U, V) image point ends up on the (X, Y, Z) object.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is a large family of point-trick card games with the distinguishing feature that Jack and Nine of the trump suit are the highest trumps. The names of these games are often a variation of &quot;Klaverjas&quot;, being Dutch for Jack of clubs. This suggests that in an earlier form of the game, clubs was a permanent trump suit. Modern games of this family include the Dutch national card game Klaverjas, the French national card game Belote, and the Swiss national card game Jass. Games of this family are also popular in some locations in North America, in Jewish communities, in the Balkans and the Middle East, and in South Asia.

Almost all games in this family are played with decks of 24–36 French-suited playing cards. A notable exception is formed by Jass (played in Switzerland and Vorarlberg), which depending on the region is played with French-, Swiss- or German-suited cards. In most variants the point values of cards are as shown in the table.
The deck shown here has 36 cards, like the one used for Jass. The most typical deck for other variants is the [[w:Piquet deck|piquet deck]] of 32 cards, which omits the Sixes. Some variants also omit the Sevens and Eights, resulting in a deck of 24 cards.
The ranks of the cards are also as indicated by the table. In particular the ''aces and tens rank high'' (i.e. before the kings), and the Jack and Nine of the trump suit (if any) are promoted to become the two highest ranking trumps.
However, two variations occur frequently enough that they are worth mentioning here.

'''Tens may rank low:'''
While normally the tens rank between the aces and kings as one would expect for a card that counts almost as much as an ace and twice as much as a king, in some variants of the game the they rank low, i.e. immediately above the nines. As a result these very valuable cards (in terms of scoring points) are quite easy to lose in a trick.

'''Picture card values may be lower by one:'''
In some variants of the game the King, Queen and (non-trump) Jack score 3, 2 and 1 points, respectively, i.e. each one point less than normal.

==Basic game play==
There is great variation in how trumps are determined, e.g. by bidding, auction or putting a card face up, which may happen before all cards have been dealt. In some variants ''no trump'' is also an option, and in this case almost all variants agree about the rules for trick-play.

The first player (usually forehand, i.e. the player who sits after the dealer and received the first cards) leads any card to the first ''trick''. Each player in turn contributes one card. Players must ''follow suit'', i.e. play a card of the same suit as the first card in the trick, whenever possible. Only a player who is ''blank'' in the ''suit led'' is allowed to ''discard'' a card of another suit instead. The player who contributed the highest-ranking card of the suit led takes the trick, placing it face down on a stack in front of the player. The first player in each subsequent trick is the player who won the previous trick.

All rules agree that if a trump suit has been chosen, any trick containing a trump is won by the player who contributed the highest-ranking trump, even though the suit led may have been a plain suit. There is, however, considerable disagreement about the precise rules that answer the question when it is allowed to play a certain trump.

Once all cards have been played, each player wins the total point value of the cards in the tricks won by that player. More points may be added for:
* melding certain combinations of cards before the first trick, or
* capturing certain combinations of cards in a single trick; and
* winning the last trick.

==Trumps==
In the course of trick-play, players will occasionally trump a trick that started with a plain suit. And sometimes a player will lead a trump, resulting in a round in which every player overtrumps the previous players, if possible. These are typical situations in most Jass games, but different variants and sub-variants disagree about the details: When exactly can, or even must, a trump be played into a trick? This variability seems to be inherited from tarot games such as French Tarot; it can be regarded as the result of codifying the character of trumps in different ways:
* Trumps want to ''trump'' tricks which hitherto consist only of cards in plain suits.
* Trumps do not want to ''undertrump'', i.e. be played to a trick that already contains a higher trump.
These characteristics of the trump suit set the Jass family apart from most other modern trick-playing games, which typically treat trumps in the same straightforward way as whist does: In whist, trump is governed by exactly the same rules as all other suits. It merely happens to win the trick in some situations.

For describing the precise rules that govern trick-play the following terminology will be convenient:

;Follow plain suit: Play any card of the suit led. Does not apply if the suit led is trump.
;Follow trump suit: Play any trump. Only applies if the suit led is trump.
;Trump: Play any trump.
;Overtrump: Play a trump that ranks higher than all trumps already in the trick. This includes playing the first trump to a plain suit led trick.
;Undertrump: Play a trump that ranks lower than the highest-ranking trump in the trick.

This terminology makes it possible to describe complex rules by a short list of options, with the understanding that every card played is subject to the first applicable and satisfiable condition in the list. Thus it is easy to read from the example in the table above that players in Scarto must follow suit if possible; that a player who cannot follow suit must play a trump if possible; and only a player who is blank both in the suit led and in trumps may discard.

It makes sense to begin by considering only non-partnership games, and in partnership games the case that the partner has not played yet or does not head the trick. In the case of two-handed games the situation becomes even simpler, because in case a plain suit trick has been trumped no further cards can be played.

It is likely that all Jass games derive from a two-handed Jewish game. David Parlett traced the game back to a Dutch book of 1821 which describes a game called &quot;Smoojas&quot; (&quot;Jewish Jass&quot;). It is played with a 32 card piquet pack. Tens rank low, and picture card values are lower by one. As in many two-handed trick-taking games, there is initially a stock from which players complete their hands after each trick, and players may play any card without any restrictions such as following suit. Once the stock is empty, the rules shown in the table apply. The Wikipedia article for [[w:Belot|Belot]] currently describes rules of trick-play for a 2–4 player game which seem to correspond to this rule set. The rules for [[w:Manille|Manille]] (not a Jass game, although somewhat related) have the same property, although they differ with those for Belot in the way partnerships are treated.

Perhaps Jewish Jass changed its trick-play rules to those shown in the table under &quot;Most modern games&quot; before the variants for more players branched off.
In any case trick-play in the 2-handed Jewish and Hungarian game described by David Parlett under the rubric &quot;Klaberjass&quot; is as shown here (see also John McLeod on Bela [http://www.pagat.com/jass/bela.html]), and almost all modern Jass games agree with these rules in the 2-handed case, or for the second card played in each trick.

The rule sets in the table are ordered from most restrictive to most liberal.

This rule set is as in French Tarot. It is used in Belote, Coinche and the Rotterdam variant of Klaverjas (according to John McLeod and David Parlett). Also the German game Klabberjass described by John McLeod [http://www.pagat.com/jass/klabberjass.html]. Also Clabber as played in Indiana. [http://www.pagat.com/jass/clabber.html#play]

This rule set is used in the Amsterdam variant of Klaverjas (according to John McLeod and David Parlett). In two-handed games the situation in the middle column cannot arise, and therefore both rule sets agree.

While there is a great deal of variation in Jass games, and some uncertainty about fine points of trick-play rules since they are so complicated, they are essentially standardised. Sources: [http://www.jassonkel.ch/jasslehrgang/uebertrumpfen.htm], David Parlett, [http://www.pagat.com/jass/swjass.html#play].
Rule set for positive Swiss Jass is also used for Pandoeren [http://www.pagat.com/jass/pandoer.html] and a variant of Boonaken [http://www.pagat.com/jass/boonaken.html].

== Thinking of an op-amp as an integrator ==

...Really, how op-amps work is a key point to understanding op-amp circuits. When I was a student in middle 1970s, reading classical explanations (they still exist) I couldn't understand what and how an op-amp really does in op-amp circuits with negative feedback. Later, in middle 1980s, when I began explaining basic op-amp circuits with negative feedback to my students, I realized gradually a paradoxical fact: '''although an op-amp is really a proportional and, as they consider, an almost &quot;non-inertial&quot; device, in order to understand how op-amp circuits work, we have to think of it as of an integrating, inertial device''' what it actually is (see also [http://archive.chipcenter.com/analog/c007.htm op-amp myths], ''Integrator inside'' section). Figuratively speaking, we have to think of the op-amp as of a &quot;being&quot; that &quot;observes&quot; continuously its input voltage and changes its output voltage until it manages to zero the input voltage. If we think of the op-amp in terms of U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = A.V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; change simultaneously), we fall into a vicious circle traveling the feedback loop and we can never understand circuit operation. We have to assume that the output voltage stays late regarding the input voltage. More philosophically speaking, we have to see the causality in the op-amp operation; to think of the input voltage as of a cause and of the output voltage as of a result. Quite later I found this concept in ''The art of electronics'', &quot;The golden rules&quot; section (p. 177): ''What the op-amp does is &quot;look&quot; at its input terminals and swing its output terminal around so that the external feedback network brings the input differential to zero (if possible)''. As you can see, Horowitz &amp; Hill have also animated the inanimate op-amp with the sole purpose of showing what it actually does in negative feedback circuits.

The gain may be specified as &quot;output voltage/input voltage&quot;, &quot;output power/input power&quot; or any other combination of current, voltage and power.  In many cases, with input and output in the same units, gain will be unitless; for others this is not necessarily so – for example, a transconductance amplifier has a gain with units of conductance (output current per input voltage).

In most cases an amplifier should be linear, that is the gain should be constant for any combination of input and output signal. If the gain is not linear, e.g. by clipping the output signal at the limits of its capabilities, the output signal is distorted.

== Classification of amplifier stages and systems ==

There are many alternative classifications that address different aspects of amplifier designs, and they all express some particular perspective relating the design parameters to the objectives of the circuit. Amplifier design is always a compromise of numerous factors, such as cost, power consumption, real-world device imperfections, and a multitude of performance specifications. Below are several different approaches to classification:

=== Input and output variables ===

[[Image:Dependent Sources.PNG|thumbnail|300px|The four types of dependent source; control variable on left, output variable on right]]

Electronic amplifiers use two variables: current and voltage. Either can be used as input, and either as output leading to four types of amplifiers. In idealized form they are represented by each of the four types of dependent source used in linear analysis, as shown in the figure, namely:

Each type of amplifier in its ideal form has an ideal input and output resistance that is the same as that of the corresponding dependent source:&lt;ref&gt;It is a curiosity to note that this table is a [http://www.swemorph.com/ma.html &quot;Zwicky box&quot;]; in particular, it encompasses all possibilities.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice the ideal impedances are only approximated. For any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis often is used to find the impedance actually achieved. A small-signal AC test current ''I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' across the test current source determines the impedance seen at that node as ''R = V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; / I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Amplifiers designed to attach to a transmission line at input and/or output, especially RF amplifiers, do not fit into this classification approach.  Rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input and/or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match ''ratios'' of voltage to current.  Many real RF amplifiers come close to this ideal.  Although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, RF amplifiers can be characterized as amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Vsats: Very Small Aperture Terminals | author = John Everett | publisher = IET | year = 1992 | isbn = 0863412009 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=MWuXmf4V4NwC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=amplifier+impedance+transmission-line++dB&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=nsyFR5GqJ6eGtgPX4rXQBQ&amp;sig=Lwap3QvlOSI2ClwZlO4MM4BcD_A#PPA81,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common terminal ===

One set of classifications for amplifiers is based on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit.  In the case of bipolar junction transistors, the three classes are [[/Common emitter|common emitter]], [[/Common base|common base]], and [[/Common collector|common collector]].  For field-effect transistors, the corresponding configurations are [[/Common source|common source]], [[/Common gate|common gate]], and [[/Common drain|common drain]]; for triode vacuum devices, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.

=== Unilateral or bilateral ===

When an amplifier has an output that exhibits no feedback to its input side, it is called '''unilateral'''. One consequence is the amplifier has an input impedance that is independent of the load attached to the amplifier, and an output impedance that is independent of the signal source driving the amplifier. 

The opposite case is the '''bilateral''' amplifier, where feedback connects the output to the input side of the amplifier. Such feedback often is deliberate, for example negative feedback often is used to tailor amplifier behavior. However, at least as often, feedback is both undesirable and unavoidable; introduced, for example, by parasitic elements like inherent, undesirable capacitances in transistors that couple input to output. In any case, a bilateral amplifier has an input impedance that depends upon the load attached to the amplifier, and an output impedance that depends on the source driving the amplifier. 

Linear unilateral and bilateral amplifiers can be represented by two-port networks. Most amplifiers are bilateral to some degree, however they may often be modeled as unilateral under certain operating conditions to simplify the analysis (see the common base article for an example).

=== Inverting or non-inverting ===

Another way to classify amps is the phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal.  An '''inverting''' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, an inversion or mirror image of the input as seen on an oscilloscope). A '''non-inverting''' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An '''emitter follower''' is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal.

This description can apply to a single stage of an amplifier, or to a complete amplifier system.

=== Function ===

Other amplifiers may be classified by their function or output characteristics. These functional descriptions usually apply to complete amplifier systems or sub-systems and rarely to individual stages. 
*A '''servo amplifier''' indicates an integrated feedback loop to actively control the output at some desired level. A '''DC servo''' indicates use at frequencies down to DC levels, where the rapid fluctuations of an audio or RF signal do not occur. These are often used in mechanical actuators, or devices such as DC motors that must maintain a constant speed or torque. An '''AC servo''' amp can do this for some ac motors.  
*A '''linear''' amplifier responds to different frequency components independently, and does not generate harmonic distortion or intermodulation distortion. A '''nonlinear''' amplifier does generate distortion. 
*A '''wideband''' amplifier has a precise amplification factor over a wide range of frequencies, and is often used to boost signals for relay in communications systems. A '''narrowband''' amp is made to amplify only a specific narrow range of frequencies, to the exclusion of other frequencies. 
*An '''RF''' amplifier refers to an amplifier designed for use in the radio frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and is often used to increase the sensitivity of a receiver or the output power of a transmitter. 
*An '''audio amplifier''' is designed for use in reproducing audio frequencies. This category subdivides into small signal amplification, and power amps which are optimised for driving speakers, sometimes with multiple amps grouped together as separate or bridgeable channels to accommodate different audio reproduction requirements.
*A special type of amplifier is widely used in instruments and for signal processing, among many other varied uses. These are known as '''operational amplifiers''',  (or '''op-amps'''). This is because this type of amplifier is used in circuits that perform mathematical algorithmic functions, or &quot;operations&quot; on input signals to obtain specific types of output signals.  A typical op-amp has differential inputs (one &quot;inverting&quot;, one, &quot;non-inverting&quot; relative to the output) and one output. An idealised op-amp has the following characteristics:
**Infinite input impedance (so as to not load circuitry it is sampling as a control input)
**Zero output impedance
**Infinite gain
**Zero propagation delay

:The performance of an op-amp with these characteristics would be entirely defined by the (usually passive) components forming a negative feedback loop around it, that is, ''the amplifier itself has no effect on the output''. 

:Today, op-amps are usually provided as integrated circuits, rather than constructed from discrete components. All real-world op-amps fall short of the idealised specification above – but some modern components have remarkable performance and come close in some respects.

Most amplifiers and many other kinds of analog electronics are built using op-amps. They are so useful that we've dedicated an entire section to them, [[Practical Electronics/Operating amplifiers]].

=== Interstage coupling method ===

Amplifiers are sometimes classified by the coupling method of the signal at the input, output, or between stages. Different types of these include:
*'''R-C coupled amplifier, using a network of resistors and capacitors.''' By design these amplifiers cannot amplify DC signals as the capacitors block the DC component of the input signal. RC-coupled amplifiers were used very often in circuits with vacuum tubes or discrete transistors. In the days of the integrated circuit a few more transistors on a chip are much cheaper and smaller than a capacitor.
*'''L-C coupled amplifier, using a network of inductors and capacitors.''' This kind of amplifier is most often used in selective radio-frequency circuits.
*'''Transformer coupled amplifier, using a transformer to match impedances or to decouple parts of the circuits.''' Quite often LC-coupled and transformer-coupled amplifiers cannot be distinguished as a transformer is some kind of inductor. 
*Direct coupled amplifier, using no impedance and bias matching components. This class of amplifier was very uncommon in the vacuum tube days when the anode (output) voltage was at several 100 V plus and the grid (input) voltage at a few volts minus. So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC, e.g. in an oscilloscope. In the context of modern electronics developers are encouraged to use directly coupled amplifiers whenever possible.

=== Frequency range ===

Depending on the frequency range and other properties amplifiers are designed according to different principles.

*Frequency ranges down to DC are only used when this property is needed. DC amplification leads to specific complications that are avoided if possible.
*Depending on the frequency range specified different design principles must be used. Up to the MHz range only &quot;discrete&quot; properties need be considered, e.g. a terminal has an input impedance.
*As soon as any connection within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength of the highest specified frequency (e.g. at 100 MHz the wavelength is 3 m, so the critical connection length is maybe 3&amp;nbsp;cm) design properties radically change. For example a specified length and width of a PCB trace can be used as a selective or impedance-matching entity.
*Above a few 100 MHz it gets difficult to use discrete elements, especially inductors. In most cases PCB traces of very closely defined shapes are used instead.

=== Type of load ===

*Untuned - (a) audio (b) video
*Tuned (RF amps) - used for amplifying a single radio frequency or band of frequencies

== Implementation ==
Amplifiers are implemented using '''active elements''' of different kinds:
*The first active elements were relays. They were used in trans-continental telegraph lines in the 1800s; a weak current was used to switch the voltage of a battery to the outgoing line.
*For transmitting audio, carbon microphones were used as the first ever active element.
*Up to the early 1970s, many amplifiers used vacuum tubes (&quot;valves&quot; in the UK). Today tubes are only generally used for very high-power, high-frequency amplifiers, microwave ovens, CRT TVs, and for specialist audio applications, in which field they have achieved a degree of popularity. Many broadcast transmitters still use vacuum tubes. Valves' imperviousness to electromagnetic pulse damage may have led to their retention in certain defence contexts.
*In the 1950s the transistor began a gradual take over. These days, discrete transistors are still used in many electronics, but are increasingly replaced by ICs
*Beginning in the 1970s more and more transistors were connected on a single chip therefore creating the integrated circuit. a large proportion of the amplifiers commercially available today are based on integrated circuits.

For exotic purposes several other active elements have been used. For example in the early days of the communication satellite parametric amplifiers were used. The core circuit was a diode whose capacity was changed by an RF signal created locally. Under certain conditions this RF signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station. The operating principle of a parametric amplifier is somewhat similar to the principle by which children keep their swings in motion: As long as the swing moves you only need to change a &quot;parameter&quot; of the swinging entity, e.g. you must move your center of gravity up and down. In our case the capacity of the diode is changed periodically.

== Power amplifier classes ==
==== Angle of flow or conduction angle ====
Power amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for analog designs, and class D and E for switching designs based upon the conduction angle or 'angle of flow' Θ of the input signal through the amplifying device, that is, the portion of the input signal cycle during which the amplifying device conducts. The image of the conduction angle is derived from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. (If the device is always on, Θ = 360°.) The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier power efficiency. The various classes are introduced below, followed by more detailed discussion under individual headings later on.

;'''Class A'''
:100% of the input signal is used (conduction angle Θ = 360° or 2π, i.e. the active element works in its linear range all of the time). Where efficiency is not a consideration, most small signal linear amplifiers are designed as Class A, which means that the output devices are always in the conduction region. Class A amplifiers are typically more linear and less complex than other types, but are very inefficient. This type of amplifier is most commonly used in small-signal stages or for low-power applications (such as driving headphones).

;'''Class B'''
:50% of the input signal is used by each output transistor (Θ = 180° or π, i.e. the active element works in its linear range half of the time and is more or less turned off for the other half). In most Class B, there are two output devices (or sets of output devices), each of which conducts alternately (push–pull) for exactly 180 deg (or half cycle) of the input signal; selective RF amplifiers can also be implemented using a single active element. 

:These amplifiers are subject to ''crossover distortion'' if the handoff from one active element to the other is not perfect, as when two complementary transistors (i.e. one PNP, one NPN) are connected as two emitter followers with their base and emitter terminals in common, requiring the base voltage to slew across the region where both devices are turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Art of Electronics | author = Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1989 | ibsn = 0521370957 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;pg=PA411&amp;dq=crossover-distortion+class-b&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=v7nlR4CCDZaytgOT7IzZBA&amp;sig=Dj6XntJelOmRA80c0IMp9gcG01s }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;'''Class AB'''
:Here the two active elements conduct more than half of the time as a means to reduce the cross-over distortions of Class B amplifiers. In the example of the complementary emitter followers a bias network allows for more or less quiescent current thus providing an operating point somewhere between Class A and Class B. Sometimes a figure is added, e.g. AB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with higher figures implying a higher quiescent current and therefore more of the properties of Class A.

;'''Class D'''

:These use switching to achieve a very high power efficiency (more than 90% in modern designs). By operating each output device either fully on or off, losses are minimized. The analog output is created by pulse-width modulation, i.e. the active element is switched on for shorter or longer intervals instead of modifying its resistance. There are more complicated switching schemes like sigma-delta modulation, to improve some performance aspects like lower distortions or better efficiency.

;'''Other classes'''
:There are several other amplifier classes, although they are mainly variations of the previous classes. For example, Class H and Class G amplifiers are marked by variation of the supply rails (in discrete steps or in a continuous fashion, respectively) following the input signal. Wasted heat on the output devices can be reduced as excess voltage is reduced or kept to a minimum. The amplifier that is fed with these rails itself can be of any class. These kinds of amplifiers are more complex, and are mainly used for specialized applications, such as very high-power units. Also, Class E and Class F amplifiers are commonly described in literature for radio frequencies applications where efficiency of the traditional classes deviate substantially from their ideal values. These classes use harmonic tuning of their output networks to achieve higher efficiency and can be considered a subset of Class C due to their conduction angle characteristics.

More detail on the various classes is provided below.

=== Class A ===
Class A amplifying devices operate over the whole of the input cycle. The output signal is normally a scaled-up replica of the input. Class A amplifiers are the usual means of implementing small-signal amplifiers. They are not efficient; '''a theoretical maximum of 50% is obtainable with inductive output coupling and only 25% with capacitive coupling'''. 

In a Class A circuit, the amplifying element is biased so the device is always conducting to some extent, and is operated over the most linear portion of its characteristic curve (known as its transfer characteristic or transconductance curve). Because the device is always conducting, even if there is no input at all, power is drawn from the power supply. Quiescent power consumption is high, hence its inefficiency.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Electronic Amplifier Class A.png]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;Class A Amplifier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If high output powers are needed from a Class A circuit, the power waste (and the accompanying heat) is substantial. For every watt delivered to the load, the amplifier itself, at best, dissipates another watt. For large powers this means large and expensive power supplies and heat sinking. Class A designs have largely been superseded for audio power amplifiers, though some audiophiles believe that Class A gives the best sound quality, due to it being operated in as linear a manner as possible which provides a small market for expensive high fidelity Class A amps. In addition, some aficionados prefer thermionic valve (or &quot;tube&quot;) designs instead of transistors, due to claimed better sound quality.

Class A amplifiers are often used in output stages of op-amps; they are sometimes used as medium-power, low-efficiency, and high-cost audio amplifiers. The average power consumption is unrelated to the output power when amplifying ac. At idle (no input), the power consumption is essentially the same as at high output volume. The result is low efficiency and high heat dissipation.

=== Class B and AB ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:EFFICIENCY_CLASS_AB.GIF|thumb|right|Demonstration of Theoretical efficiency of Class B amplifier]] --&gt;

Class B amplifiers use 2 active elements that each amplify one half of the input wave cycle. They create a little distortion as one device hands over to the other, but their efficiency is much better than Class A. '''Class B has a maximum theoretical efficiency of 78.5% (i.e., π/4).''' This is because there is zero quiescent current in the amplifying elements. 

A single Class B element is rarely found in practice, though it can be used in RF power amplifier where the distortion levels are less important. However Class C is more commonly used for this.

A practical circuit using Class B elements is the complementary pair or &quot;push–pull&quot; arrangement. Here, complementary (or quasi-complementary) devices are used to each amplify the opposite halves of the input signal, which is then recombined at the output. This arrangement gives excellent efficiency, but can suffer from the drawback that there is a small mismatch at the &quot;joins&quot; between the two halves of the signal. This is called crossover distortion. An improvement is to bias the devices so they are not completely off when they're not in use. This approach is called Class AB operation. 

In Class AB operation, each device operates the same way as in Class B over half the waveform, but also conducts a small amount on the other half. As a result, the region where both devices simultaneously are nearly off (the &quot;dead zone&quot;) is reduced. The result is that when the waveforms from the two devices are combined, the crossover is greatly minimised or eliminated.

Class AB sacrifices some efficiency over class B in favor of linearity, so will always be less efficient (below 78.5%). It is typically much more efficient than class A. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Electronic Amplifier Push-pull.png]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;Class B push–pull amplifier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Class B or AB push–pull circuits are the most common design type found in audio power amplifiers. Class AB is widely considered a good compromise for audio amplifiers, with most of the efficiency of Class B, but little of its distortion.  Crossover distortion can be reduced further by negative feedback. Class B and AB amplifiers are sometimes used for RF linear amplifiers as well. Class B amplifiers are also favored in battery-operated devices, such as transistor radios.

=== Digital Class B ===
Class B amplifiers are in widespread use in logic ICs. They are much more efficient than class A, and are mostly only intended to provide logic 1 or 0 output. Some also provide high impedance output at times.

=== Class C ===
Class C amplifiers conduct less than 50% of the input signal, typically only conducting during input peaks. Distortion is high, but high efficiencies (up to 90%) are possible. Some applications (for example, megaphones) can tolerate the distortion. A much more common application for Class C amplifiers is in RF transmitters, where the distortion can be vastly reduced by using tuned loads on the amplifier stage. The input signal is used to switch the amplifying device on during peaks, and the complete waveform is recreated by tuned circuit.

The Class C amp has two modes of operation: tuned, and untuned.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Malvino, ''Electronic Principles'' (2nd Ed.1979. ISBN 0-07-039867-4) p.299.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram below shows a waveform from a simple class C circuit without the tuned load. This is called untuned operation, and the analysis of the waveforms shows the massive distortion that appears in the signal. When the proper load (e.g., a pure LC filter) is used, two things happen. The first is that the output's bias level is &quot;clamped&quot;, so that the output variation is centered at one-half of the supply voltage. This is why tuned operation is sometimes called a &quot;clamper&quot;. This action of elevating bias level allows the waveform to be restored to its proper shape, allowing a complete waveform to be re-established despite having only a one-polarity supply. This is directly related to the second phenomenon: the waveform on the center frequency becomes much less distorted. The distortion that is present is dependent upon the bandwidth of the tuned load, with the center frequency seeing very little distortion, but greater attenuation the farther from the tuned frequency that the signal gets. 

The tuned circuit will only resonate at particular frequencies, and so the unwanted frequencies are dramatically suppressed, and the wanted full signal (sine wave) will be extracted by the tuned load (e.g., a high-quality bell will ring at a particular frequency when it is hit periodically with a hammer). Provided the transmitter is not required to operate over a very wide band of frequencies, this arrangement works extremely well. Other residual harmonics can be removed using a filter.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Electronic Amplifier Class C.png]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;Class C Amplifier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Class D ===
[[Image:Pwm amp.svg|thumb|400px|Block diagram of a basic switching or PWM (Class-D) amplifier.]]

Class D amplifiers are much more efficient than Class AB power amplifiers. So Class D amplifiers use smaller lighter transformers and heatsinks. Power devices in a Class D amplifier are operated in on/off mode. Output stages such as those used in pulse generators are examples of class D amplifiers. The term usually applies to devices intended to reproduce signals with a bandwidth well below the switching frequency. 

These amplifiers use pulse width modulation, pulse density modulation (sometimes referred to as pulse frequency modulation) or more advanced form of modulation such as Delta-sigma modulation (for example, in the Analog Devices AD1990 Class-D audio power amplifier). 

The input signal is converted to a sequence of pulses whose averaged value is directly proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of the signal. The frequency of the pulses is typically ten or more times the highest frequency of interest in the input signal. The output of such an amplifier contains unwanted spectral components (that is, the pulse frequency and its harmonics) which must be removed by a passive filter. The resulting filtered signal is then an amplified replica of the input.

The main advantage of a class D amplifier is efficiency. Because the output pulses have a fixed amplitude, the switching elements (usually MOSFETs, but valves and bipolar transistors were once used) are switched either on or off, rather than operated in linear mode. This means that very little power is dissipated by the transistors, except during the very short interval between the on and off states. The wasted power is low because the instantaneous power dissipated in the transistor is the product of voltage and current, and one or the other is almost always close to zero.

Class D amplifiers can be controlled by either analog or digital circuits. The digital control introduces additional distortion called ''quantization error'' caused by its conversion of the input signal to a digital value.

Class D amplifiers have been widely used to control motors, and almost exclusively for small DC motors, but they are now also used as audio amplifiers, with circuitry to convert analogue to a much higher frequency pulse width modulated signal. The relative difficulty of achieving good audio quality means that nearly all are used in applications where quality is not a factor, such as laptops, modestly-priced bookshelf audio systems and &quot;DVD-receivers&quot; in mid-price home theater systems. 

High quality Class D audio amplifiers are now starting to appear in the market:
*Tripath have called their revised Class D designs Class T.
*Bang and Olufsen's ICEPower Class D system has been used in the Alpine PDX range and some Pioneer's PRS range and for other manufacturers' equipment.

These revised designs have been said to rival good traditional AB amplifiers in terms of quality.

Before these higher quality designs existed an earlier use of Class D amplifiers and prolific area of application was high-powered, subwoofer amplifiers in cars. Because subwoofers are generally limited to a bandwidth of no higher than 150Hz, the switching speed for the amplifier does not have to be as high as for a full range amplifier. The drawback with Class D designs being used to power subwoofers is that their output filters (typically inductors that convert the pulse width signal back into an analogue waveform) lower the damping factor of the amplifier. 

This means that the amplifier cannot prevent the subwoofer's reactive nature from lessening the impact of low bass sounds (as explained in the feedback part of the Class AB section). 
Class D amplifiers for driving subwoofers are relatively inexpensive, in comparison to Class AB amplifiers. A 1000 watt Class D subwoofer amplifier that can operate at about 80% to 95% efficiency costs about $250 USD, much less than a Class AB amplifier of this power, which would cost several thousand dollars.

The letter ''D'' used to designate this amplifier class is simply the next letter after ''C'', and does not stand for ''digital''. Class D and Class E amplifiers are sometimes mistakenly described as &quot;digital&quot; because the output waveform superficially resembles a pulse-train of digital symbols, but a Class D amplifier merely converts an input waveform into a continuously pulse-width modulated (square wave) analog signal. (A digital waveform would be pulse-code modulated.)

=== Special classes ===
==== Class E ====

The class E/F amplifier is a highly efficient switching power amplifier, typically used at such high frequencies that the switching time becomes comparable to the duty time. As said in the class-D amplifier the transistor is connected via a serial-LC-circuit to the load,
and connected via a large L (inductance) to the supply voltage. The supply voltage is connected to ground via a large capacitor to prevent any RF-signals leaking into the supply. The class-E amplifier adds a ''C'' between the transistor and ground and uses a defined ''L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to connect to the supply voltage.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Classe E.svg]] &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;Class E Amplifier&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The following description ignores DC, which can be added afterwards easily.
The above mentioned ''C'' (''C1'' in the figure) and L are in effect a parallel LC-circuit to ground. When the transistor is on, it pushes through the serial LC-circuit into the load and some current begins to flow to the parallel LC-circuit to ground. Then the serial LC-circuit swings back and compensates the current into the parallel LC-circuit. At this point the current through the transistor is zero and it is switched off. Both LC-circuits are now filled with energy in the C and the L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The whole circuit performs a damped oscillation. The damping by the load has been adjusted so that some time later the energy from the Ls is gone into the load, but the energy in both C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at the original value, to in turn restore the original voltage, so that the voltage across the transistor is zero again and it can be switched on.

With load, frequency, and duty cycle (0.5) as given parameters and the constraint that the voltage is not only restored, but peaks at the original voltage, the four parameters (L, L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, C and C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) are determined. The class F-amplifier takes the finite on resistance into account and tries to make the current touch the bottom at zero. This means the voltage and the current at the transistor are symmetric with respect to time. The Fourier Transform allows an elegant formulation to generate the complicated LC-networks. It says that the first harmonic is passed into the load, all even harmonics are shorted and all higher odd harmonics are open.

==== Class F and the even harmonics ====

In push–pull amplifiers and in CMOS the even harmonics of both transistors just cancel. Experiment tells that a square wave can be generated by those amplifiers and math tells that square waves do consist of odd harmonics only. In a class D amplifier the output filter blocks all harmonics, that means the harmonics see an open load. So even small currents in the harmonics suffice to generate a voltage square wave. The current is in phase with the voltage applied to filter, but the voltage across the transistors is out of phase. Therefore there is a minimal overlap between current through the transistors and voltage across the transistors. The sharper the edges the lower the overlap. 

While class D sees the transistors and the load as two separate modules the class F admits imperfections like the parasitics of the transistor and tries to optimise the global system to have a high impedance at the harmonics. Of course there has to be a finite voltage across the transistor to push the current across the on state resistance. Because the combined current through both transistors is mostly in the first harmonic it looks like a sine. That means that in the middle of the square the maximum of current has to flow, so it may make sense to have a dip in the square or in other words to allow some over swing of the voltage square wave. A class F load network by definition has to transmit below a cut off frequency and to reflect above. 

Any frequency lying below the cut off and having its second harmonic above the cut off can be amplified, that is an octave bandwidth. On the other hand an LC series circuit with a large L and a tunable C may be simpler to implement. By reducing the duty cycle below 0.5, the output amplitude can be modulated. The voltage square waveform will degrade, but any overheating is compensated by the lower overall power flowing. Any load mismatch behind the filter can only act on the first harmonic current waveform, clearly only a purely resistive load makes sense, then the lower the resistance the higher the current. 

Class F can be driven by sine or by a square wave, for a sine the input can be tuned by an L to increase gain. If class F is implemented with a single transistor the filter is complicated to short the even harmonics. All previous designs use sharp edges to minimise the overlap.
Class E uses a significant amount of second harmonic voltage. The second harmonic can be used to reduce the overlap with edges with finite sharpness. For this to work energy on the second harmonic has to flow from the load into the transistor, and no source for this is visible in the circuit diagram. In reality the impedance is mostly reactive and the only reason for it is that class E is a class F amplifier with a very simplified load network and thus has to deal with imperfections. 

In many amateur simulations of class E amplifiers sharp current edges are assumed nullifying the very motivation for class E and measurements near the transit frequency of the transistors show very symmetric curves, which look much similar to class F simulations.
The class E amplifier was invented in 1972 by Nathan O. Sokal and Alan D. Sokal, and details were first published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;N. O. Sokal and A. D. Sokal, &quot;Class E — A New Class of High-Efficiency Tuned Single-Ended Switching Power Amplifiers&quot;, ''IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits'', vol. SC-10, pp. 168–176, June 1975.
HVK&lt;/ref&gt; Some earlier reports on this operating class have been published in Russian.

==== Class G and H ====

There is a variety of amplifier designs that couple a class AB output stage with other more efficient techniques to achieve a higher efficiency with low distortion. These designs are common in large audio amplifiers since the heatsinks and power transformers would be prohibitively large (and costly) without the increase in efficiency. The terms &quot;class G&quot; and &quot;class H&quot; are used interchangeably to refer to different designs, varying in definition from one manufacturer or paper to another.

Class G amplifiers (which use &quot;rail switching&quot; to decrease power consumption and increase efficiency) are a more efficient than class AB amplifiers. The  class G amplifier has several power rails at different voltages, and switches between rails as the signal output approaches each. Thus the amplifier increases efficiency by reducing the wasted power at the output transistors.

A Class H amplifier takes the idea of Class G one step further creating an infinitely variable supply rail. This is done by modulating the supply rails so that the rails are only a few volts larger than the output signal at any given time. The output stage operates at its maximum efficiency all the time. Switched mode power supplies can be used to create the tracking rails. Significant efficiency gains can be achieved but with the drawback of more complicated supply design and reduced THD performance.

The classes can be most easily understood using the diagrams in each section below. For the sake of illustration, a bipolar junction transistor is shown as the amplifying device, but in practice this could be a MOSFET or vacuum tube device. In an analog amplifier (the most common kind), the signal is applied to the input terminal of the device (base, gate or grid), and this causes a proportional output drive current to flow out of the output terminal. The output drive current comes from the power supply. 

The voltage signal shown is thus a larger version of the input, but has been changed in sign (inverted) by the amplification. Other arrangements of amplifying device are possible, but that given (that is, common emitter, common source or common cathode) is the easiest to understand and employ in practice. If the amplifying element is linear, then the output will be faithful copy of the input, only larger and inverted. In actual practice, transistors are not linear, and the output will only approximate the input. Non-linearity from any of several sources is the origin of distortion within an amplifier. Which class of amplifier (A, B, AB or C) depends on how the amplifying device is biased — in the diagrams the bias circuits are omitted for clarity.

Any real amplifier is an imperfect realization of an ideal amplifier. One important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it can generate is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier will saturate and clip the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or if operational limits for a device are exceeded.

=== Amplifier circuit ===

The practical amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class AB push–pull output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Amplifier Circuit Small.svg|500px|A practical amplifier circuit]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot;&gt;A practical amplifier circuit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The input signal is coupled through capacitor C1 to the base of transistor Q1. The capacitor allows the AC signal to pass, but blocks the DC bias voltage established by resistors R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a differential amplifier (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a long-tailed pair. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to Q2 via R7 and R8. 

The negative feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier to compare the input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a [[/Common emitter|common emitter]] stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (A better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in Class A. The output pair are arranged in Class AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide the majority of the current amplification and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).

This design is simple, but a good basis for a practical design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably be found in a real design that would roll off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors — if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage. 

A common solution to help stabilise the output devices is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amp.

=== Notes on implementation ===

Real world amplifiers are imperfect.
*One consequence is that the power supply itself may influence the output, and must itself be considered when designing the amplifier
*The amplifier circuit has an &quot;open loop&quot; performance, that can be described by various parameters (gain, slew rate, output impedance, distortion, bandwidth, signal to noise ratio ...)
*Many modern amplifiers use negative feedback techniques to hold the gain at the desired value, reduce distortion and improve frequency response.

Different methods of supplying power result in many different methods of bias. Bias is a technique by which the active devices are set up to operate in a particular regime, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; there are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide both positive and negative voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class C amps, by definition, use a single polarity supply.

Most amplifiers have multiple stages in cascade to increase gain. Each stage of these designs may be a different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. For instance, the first stage might be a Class A stage, feeding a class AB push–pull second stage, which then drives a class G final output stage, taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses.

== Files from Commons ==

Please don't upload files from commons. You can already use Commons files on Wikibooks (and any other Wikimedia project). I've deleted the two you uploaded recently, they can be referenced here as [[:File:Bimanual alphabet.jpg]] and [[:File:Klallam people at Port Townsend.jpg]].

If you are going to upload a file under a free license, you should upload it to Commons if it may be useful to the wider community. Please also remember to cite the source of images you upload. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:29, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

Oops! I thought it referenced automatically when I inserted all the information during the upload process. Thank you for the note! --[[User:Klokow7568|Klokow7568]] ([[User talk:Klokow7568|talk]]) 23:39, 8 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

Python includes several modules in the standard library for working with emails and email servers.

==Sending mail==

Sending mail is done with Python's &lt;code&gt;smtplib&lt;/code&gt; using an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. Actual usage varies depending on complexity of the email and settings of the email server, the instructions here are based on sending email through Google's Gmail.

The first step is to create an SMTP object, each object is used for connection with one server.

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import smtplib
server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
&lt;/source&gt;

The first argument is the server's hostname, the second is the port. The port used varies depending on the server.

Next, we need to do a few steps to set up the proper connection for sending mail.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
server.ehlo()
server.starttls()
server.ehlo()
&lt;/source&gt;
These steps may not be necessary depending on the server you connect to. ehlo() is used for [[w:ESMTP|ESMTP]] servers, for non-ESMTP servers, use helo() instead. See Wikipedia's article about the [[w:Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] protocol for more information about this. The starttls() function starts [[w:Transport Layer Security|Transport Layer Security]] mode, which is required by Gmail. Other mail systems may not use this, or it may not be available. 

Next, log in to the server:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
server.login(&quot;youremailusername&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, send the mail:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
msg = &quot;\nHello!&quot; # The /n separates the message from the headers (which we ignore for this example)
server.sendmail(&quot;you@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;target@example.com&quot;, msg)
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that this is a rather crude example, it doesn't include a subject, or any other headers. For that, one should use the &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; package.

== The &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; package ==
Python's email package contains many classes and functions for composing and parsing email messages, this section only covers a small subset useful for sending emails.

We start by only importing only the classes we need, this also saves us from having to use the full module name later.
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
from email.MIMEMultipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.MIMEText import MIMEText
&lt;/source&gt;

Then we compose some of the basic message headers:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
fromaddr = &quot;you@gmail.com&quot;
toaddr = &quot;target@example.com&quot;
msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg['From'] = fromaddr
msg['To'] = toaddr
msg['Subject'] = &quot;Python email&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Next, we attach the body of the email to the MIME message:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
body = &quot;Python test mail&quot;
msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
&lt;/source&gt;

For sending the mail, we have to convert the object to a string, and then use the same prodecure as above to send using the SMTP server..
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import smtplib
server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
server.ehlo()
server.starttls()
server.ehlo()
server.login(&quot;youremailusername&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)
text = msg.as_string()
server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddr, text)
&lt;/source&gt;

If we look at the text, we can see it has added all the necessary headers and structure necessary for a MIME formatted email. See [[w:MIME|MIME]] for more details on the standard:
{{dropimage|The full text of our example message|width=650|&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print text
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=&quot;===============1893313573==&quot;

      <comment>/* Some more properties */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Definition 1''': Let (R,+,.) be a ring. A non empty subset S of R is called a '''subring''' of R if (S,+,.) is a ring.

For example the set &lt;math&gt;m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which stands for &lt;math&gt;\{0,\pm m,\pm 2m\cdots\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of the ring of integers, the set of Gaussian integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[i]&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_4&lt;/math&gt; has the set &lt;math&gt;\{\overline{0},\overline{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; as a subring under addition and multiplication modulo 4.

'''Theorem 1.15''': A non empty subset S of a ring R is a subring of R iff (i)&lt;math&gt;a-b\in S&lt;/math&gt; and (ii)&lt;math&gt;ab\in S \forall a,b\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': The proof is an elementary consequence of a similar theorem about groups. Clearly necessity is clear. For sufficiency, note that 0=a-a is in S, -a=0-a is in S and a+b=a-(-b) is also in S. Other properties of a ring follow trivially.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.16''': The intersection of two subrings of a ring R is a subring of R.

'''Proof''': Let S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two subrings and &lt;math&gt;a,b\in S_1\cap S_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a-b,ab\in S_1\cap S_2&lt;/math&gt; as they are also in S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (Note that the intersection is nonempty as it defnitely contains 0). But then the result holds by the previous theorem.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the corresponding result about unions may not be true. For example the union of &lt;math&gt;2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has 3 and 2 but not their difference 1 and so is not a subring of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition 2''': The '''center''' of a ring R is defined as the set &lt;math&gt;Z(R)=\{a\in R: xa=ax \forall x\in R\}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1.17''': The center of a ring R is a subring of R.

'''Proof''': Clearly if a and b are two elements in the center then for any x in R x(a-b)=xa-xb=ax-bx=(a-b)x and x(ab)=xab=axb=abx=(ab)x and so both a-b and ab are in the center. The result follows now from Theorem 1.15.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.18''': The center of a division ring is a field.

'''Proof''': If R is a division ring, then its center contains the identity 1 as x1=1x=x for all x. Also if a is in the center and ab=ba=1 then for any x, xb=x1b=xabb=axbb and so x=axb. Now bx=baxb=1xb=xb and so b is also in the center. Hence each element's inverse is also in the center. Finally note that that the elements commute with each other as they do so with all other elements of R. Other properties of a field follow by virtue of R being a division ring.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;.

==Some more properties==
These problems should be first tried as exercises by the reader.

'''Theorem 1.19''': If a is a fixed element of a ring R, show that &lt;math&gt;I_a=\{x\in R:ax=0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of R.

'''Proof''': Clearly if x,y are two elements in R then a(x-y)=ax-ay=0-0=0 and a(xy)=axy=0y=0 and so I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is a subring.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem 1.20''':If A and B are two subrings of a ring R then their '''sum''' is defined as the set &lt;math&gt;A+B=\{a+b:a\in A, b\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;. Show that the sum of two subrings need not be a subring.

'''Proof''': Consider the ring M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of 2x2 matrices with entries belonging to the integers. (Check that this is indeed a ring.) It is easy to verify that the sets &lt;math&gt;S=\{\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  a&amp;0\\ b&amp;0\end{smallmatrix} \bigr):a,b\in \mathbb{Z}\}, T=\{\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  0&amp;c\\ 0&amp;0\end{smallmatrix} \bigr):c\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; are subrings of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However their sum which contains the matrices &lt;math&gt;\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  1&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  2&amp;2\\ 2&amp;0\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)&lt;/math&gt; doesn't contain their product which is &lt;math&gt;\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix}  4&amp;2\\ 2&amp;2\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence sum of two subrings need not be a subring.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1.21''': An element &lt;math&gt;x\in R&lt;/math&gt; is called '''idempotent''' if x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=x. Let e be an idempotent in a ring R. Show that &lt;math&gt;eRe=\{eae:a\in R\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of R with unity e.

'''Proof''': Clearly if x,y are in eRe then x=eae and y=ebe for some a,b in R. Then x-y=eae-ebe=e(a-b)e and so x-y is in eRe. Also xy=eaeebe=eaebe=e(aeb)e and so xy is in eRe. Hence eRe is a subring. Finally note that xe=eaee=eae=x and ex=eeae=eae=x and so e is the unity of eRe.&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;.

==Exercises==
1. Show that the '''normalizer''' N(a) of a element a of a ring R defined by &lt;math&gt;N(a)=\{x\in R:xa=ax\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of R.

2. A non empty subset S of a field (F,+,.) is called a '''subfield''' of F is (S,+,.) is a field. Show that a subset S of a field F, containing at least two elements is a subfield of F iff (i)&lt;math&gt;a-b\in S\forall a,b\in S&lt;/math&gt; and (ii)&lt;math&gt;ab^{-1}\in S\forall a\in S,b(\ne 0)\in S&lt;/math&gt;.

      <comment>Adding a link to an old Wikipedia talk page about negative resistance</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I start here maybe the most interesting discussion about differential negative resistors concerning two unique operation modes - ''linear'' and ''bistable''. Linear applications include various exotic 1-port amplifiers (e.g., legendary tunnel diode amplifier). A lot of interesting negative resistor applications are based on bistable mode: exotic switching circuits with dual-treshold action ([[hysteresis]]), memory circuits (flip-flops), etc. Later, we might copy or move this discussion to [[w:Negative differential resistance|negative differential resistance]] page where its place is but now we have to ascertain if the differential negative resistors obey the definition. Please, join the discussion; the topic is extremely interesting and important.

==== Differential negative resistor operating in linear mode ====

Obviously, this definition is formulated especially for differential negative resistance but, unfortunately, it has problems even in this case. The definition is correct only if the differential negative resistor operates in linear mode (i.e., if we drive a current-driven differential negative resistor by a current and if we drive a voltage-driven differential negative resistor by a voltage). Let's ascertain it.

[[Image:Linear_voltage-driven_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3. An increasing voltage across a voltage-driven differential negative resistance results in a decreasing current and v.v.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Linear_current-driven_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4. An increasing current through a current-driven differential negative resistance results in a decreasing voltage drop and v.v.&lt;/center&gt;]]

As a rule, electronics resources show the IV curve of a differential negative resistance in its final N or S shape (e.g., see a [[:Image:Negative differential resistance.png|bare curve]]) and note there is a section with a negative slope. But nobody shows how this magic is done and what it actually means. Only, in order to grasp the idea of differential negative resistance, it is extremely important to show exactly how and why this part of the curve is inclined to the left. Here is the secret of the phenomenon.

The trick is extremely simple, clear and intuitive: this is the great ''dynamizing idea'' that is brought here to the utmost degree. A differential negative resistor is notning more than a kind of &quot;self-varying&quot;, dynamic resistor that changes extremely its instant (ohmic, &quot;positive&quot;) resistance depending on the current passing through the resistor or on the voltage applied across it; ''a differential negative resistor is actually an over-dynamic resistor.'' I have shown the evolution of this great idea in a circuit story&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/circuit_stories/inventing_circuits/r_decreased_resistance/r_decreased_resistance.htm How do we make decreased, zero and negative differential resistance?]&lt;/ref&gt; about S-shaped differential negative resistors (I have placed a reference to this story for your convenience, not to promote myself).

===== Applying a voltage across a voltage-driven differential negative resistance =====

Look at Fig. 3 to see how a voltage-driven differential resistor having an N-shaped IV curve behaves, in order to do this magic in the area of the negative resistance. In this graphical representation, I have superimposed the IV curves of the input voltage source (in a red color) and the differential negative resistor (in blue) on a common coordinate system. In addition, to make things absolutely clear, I have superimposed the IV curve of the instant ohmic resistance R (in orange) as well. Now, turn on your most human mental faculty - your [http://thinkexist.com/quotation/imagination_is_more_important_than_knowledge-for/260230.html imagination], and visualize in your [[Mind's eye|mind's eye]] what happens when the input voltage begins varying.

For example, when the input voltage begins increasing, its IV curve moves horizontally from left to right remaining parallel to itself. If the resistor was &quot;static&quot;, the crossing (operating) point would [[:Image:Voltage-driven_resistor_graph_1000.jpg|slide]] along the IV curve of its ohmic resistance having a positive slope. But it is a more &quot;clever&quot;:) dynamic resistor (like my opponents in this talk page:). So, it begins changing (in this case, increasing) its instant ohmic resistance R and rotating vigorously its IV curve clockwise. As a result, a wonder happens and the operating point slides along a hew IV curve having a negative slope. Note this is not a real curve as the ohmic IV curve is. It is an artificial, a synthetic, an imaginative IV curve; it is an illusion.

Does this case obey the definition, &quot;...an increasing current in the circuit results in a decreasing voltage...&quot;? No, as the voltage jumps in the negative resistance region (see [[#Passing a current through a voltage-driven differential negative resistance|below]]).

===== Passing a current through a current-driven differential negative resistance =====

A current-driven differential resistor with an S-shaped IV curve (Fig. 4) has the opposite crafty behavior:) - when the input current increases, it decreases its instant ohmic resistance R and rotates vigorously its IV curve contraclockwise. Now, the operating point slides upwards along a hew IV curve having a negative slope as [[#Differential negative resistor operating in linear mode|above]]. 

Does this case obey the definition now? Yes, if we only replace &quot;voltage&quot; with &quot;voltage drop&quot;:

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== Differential negative resistor operating in bistable mode ====

''If the differential negative resistor operates in bistable mode (i.e., if we drive a current-driven differential negative resistor by a voltage and if we drive a voltage-driven differential negative resistor by a current), the definition is not true.''

I give an opportunity to you to see why the definition has failed in these cases. If you do not manage, I will elucidate why. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 22:05, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

===== Applying a voltage across a current-driven differential negative resistance =====

[[Image:Bistable_decreasing_voltage_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 5b. When a decreasing voltage reaches V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the current decreases (jumps) but the voltage stays constant during the jump.&lt;/center&gt;]]

=Collijen Defense=
==4. Bc4==
4. Bc4 gambits a second pawn.  It develops the light-squared bishop to a place attacking blacks weakest square (F7)

This position often leads to the Danish Gambit after [[cxb2]].  Black almost always takes the pawn although he could play knight to c6 or f6 transposing into the Goring Gambit if white captures the pawn with his knight.

In one rare line, black advances his pawn to c2, not wanting to let white develop his dark squared bishop onto the long diagonal.

A '''solar panel''' converts the power of the sun into either electricity (where it is called 'photovoltaic') or heat (where it is called 'solar thermal').

==Who invented it?==
Currently it is unknown who invented the solar cell, but it was invented in Germany.

==How does it get power? ==
Solar panels get their power from the sun.  That is why they are called 'solar' panels because solar means sun in Latin.

==How does it work?==
It transforms solar power into regular electricity using the photovoltaic effect. 
==How dangerous is it?==
It is not very dangerous, but if you look at it too long, the reflected sunlight could damage your eyes. Also, solar panels can get very hot in summer, especially solar thermal ones.

==What does it do?==
It transforms power from light into regular electricity in large amounts usually (as there are small solar cells too). It contains lots of solar cells that do this.
==How does it vary?==
Solar power is a source of clean energy.  By covering just 2% of the earths surface, solar panels could provide enough energy for the current needs of the whole planet. Doing so could cause other problems like reducing the amount of land for growing food.

==What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created?==
==How much does it cost?==
In 1998, it was said that the cost per watt was about $4.50, which is 33 times lower than the cost in 1970 of $150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Intro==
Op Amp is a short hand term for Operational Amplifier. An operational amplifier is a circuit component that amplifies the difference of two input voltages:
:;V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = A (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

Op Amps are usually packaged as an 8-pin integrated circuit.

*V&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;: non-inverting input
*V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;: inverting input
*V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;: output
*V&lt;sub&gt;S+&lt;/sub&gt;: positive power supply
*V&lt;sub&gt;S&amp;minus;&lt;/sub&gt;: negative power supply

Op amps amplify AC signal or AC Voltage better than a simple bipolar junction transistor.

==Op Amp Functions==
===Voltage Difference Amplifier===
From above  
:; V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = A (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -  V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

===Voltage Comparator===
: V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;  V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = +V&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;
: V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;
: V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =  V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
===Inverting Amplifier===
With one voltage is grounded

===Non-Inverting Amplifier===
With one voltage is grounded
: If V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 , V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = A V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . Non-Inverting Amplifier

==Linear Configurations==
===Differential amplifier ===

====Voltage Difference Amplifier====

Whenever &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{f} = R_\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} = {R_\mathrm{f} \over R_1} \left( V_2 - V_1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

====Voltage Difference====
When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_\mathrm{f}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2 = R_\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; (including previous conditions, so that &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2 = R_\mathrm{f} = R_\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt;):

===Inverting Amplifier===
[[Image:Opampinverting.svg|thumb|Inverting amplifier]]

:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} = - V_\mathrm{in} \left( {R_f \over R_1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-Inverting Amplifier===
[[Image:Opampnoninverting.svg|thumb|Non-inverting amplifier]]

:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} = V_\mathrm{in} \left( 1 + {R_2 \over R_1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Integrator ===

[[Image:opampintegrating.svg|thumb|Integrating amplifier]]

Integrates the (inverted) signal over time

:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} = \int_0^t - {V_\mathrm{in} \over RC} \, dt + V_\mathrm{initial} &lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{in}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time, &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{initial}&lt;/math&gt; is the output voltage of the integrator at time ''t'' = 0.)

=== Differentiator ===

[[Image:opampdifferentiating.svg|thumb|Differentiating amplifier]]

Differentiates the (inverted) signal over time.  

''The name &quot;differentiator&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;[[#Differential amplifier|differential amplifier]]&quot;, also shown on this page.''

&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{out} = - RC \left( {dV_\mathrm{in} \over dt} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{in}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time)

{{clear}}

=== Comparator ===

[[Image:Opampcomparator.svg|thumb|Comparator]]

*&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} = \left\{\begin{matrix} V_\mathrm{S+} &amp; V_1 &gt; V_2 \\ V_\mathrm{S-} &amp; V_1 &lt; V_2 \end{matrix}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

Từ V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = A (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -  V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

* V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 khi V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

* V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 khi V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt; 

* V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 khi V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
: V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;-ss&lt;/sub&gt; 

When two input voltages equal. The output voltage is zero . When the two input voltages different and if one is greater than or less than the other

#V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt; khi V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
#V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;-ss&lt;/sub&gt; khi V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

{{clear}}

=== Instrumentation amplifier ===

[[Image:Opampinstrumentation.svg|thumb|Instrumentation amplifier]]


Combines very high input impedance, high common-mode rejection, low DC offset, and other properties used in making very accurate, low-noise measurements

* Is made by adding a [[#inverting amplifier|inverting]] buffer to each input of the [[#Differential amplifier|differential amplifier]] to increase the input impedance.

{{clear}}

=== Schmitt trigger ===

[[Image:Opampschmitt_xcircuit.svg|thumb|Schmitt trigger]]

A comparator with hysteresis

Hysteresis from &lt;math&gt;\frac{-R_1}{R_2}V_{sat}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{R_2}V_{sat}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{clear}}

=== Gyrator ===

[[Image:Gyrator.svg|thumb|Inductance gyrator]]

A gyrator can transform impedances. Here a capacitor is changed into an inductor. 

:&lt;math&gt; L = R_\mathrm{L} R C &lt;/math&gt;

{{clear}}

=== Zero level detector ===

Voltage divider reference

* Zener sets reference voltage

{{clear}}

=== Negative impedance converter (NIC) ===

[[Image:Negative_impedance_converter.svg|thumb|Negative impedance converter]]


Creates a resistor having a negative value for any signal generator

* In this case, the ratio between the input voltage and the input current (thus the input resistance) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{in} = - R_3 \frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

{{clear}}

== Non-linear configurations ==

=== Rectifier ===

[[Image:Super_diode.svg|thumb|Super diode]]

Behaves like an ideal diode for the load, which is here represented by a generic resistor &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

* This basic configuration has some limitations.  For more information and to know the configuration that is actually used, see the main article.

{{clear}}

=== Peak detector ===

[[Image:PeakDet.svg|thumb|Peak detector]]

When the switch is closed, the output goes to zero volts. When the switch is opened for a certain time interval, the capacitor will charge to the maximum input voltage attained during that time interval. 

The charging time of the capacitor must be much shorter than the period of the highest appreciable frequency component of the input voltage.

{{clear}}

=== Logarithmic output ===

[[Image:Opamplogarithm.svg|thumb|Logarithmic configuration]]

* The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{in}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out} = -V_{\gamma} \ln \left( \frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{I_\mathrm{S} \cdot R} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current''.

* If the operational amplifier is considered ideal, the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current flowing into the resistor from the source (and thus through the diode to the output, since the op-amp inputs draw no current) is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_\mathrm{in}}{R} = I_\mathrm{R} = I_\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the current through the diode. As known, the relationship between the current and the voltage for a diode is:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D} = I_\mathrm{S} \left( e^{\frac{V_\mathrm{D}}{V_{\gamma}}} - 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This, when the voltage is greater than zero, can be approximated by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D} \simeq I_\mathrm{S} e^{V_\mathrm{D} \over V_{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;

Putting these two formulae together and considering that the output voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of the voltage across the diode &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;, the relationship is proven. 

Note that this implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects.

{{clear}}

=== Exponential output===

[[Image:Opampexponential.svg|thumb|Exponential configuration]]

* The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{in}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out} = - R I_\mathrm{S} e^{v_\mathrm{in} \over V_{\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current''.

* Considering the operational amplifier ideal, then the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current through the diode is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D} = I_\mathrm{S} \left( e^{\frac{V_\mathrm{D}}{V_{\gamma}}} - 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{D} \simeq I_\mathrm{S} e^{V_\mathrm{D} \over V_{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;

The output voltage is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{out} = -R I_\mathrm{D}\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>Added an entry to reflect the changes to the &quot;flying Through a Canyon tutorial.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is for suggesting and tracking ongoing maintenance for the book &quot;Blender 3D: Noob to Pro&quot;.  If you want to add another suggestion to the list there that isn't already there, go ahead.  If you have a problem with one of the suggestions or want to remove one, please discuss the reason why on the [[Talk:Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Todo|talk page]] first.

== Pages to take care of ==
=== Unit 1 and Unit 2 ===
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/FAQ]] The page is outdated and the answers are not very good. The FAQ page does not fit well in the scope of the book. We could use a FAQ about the book itself though. There are better FAQs around. Suggestion: rewrite the page to make working with the book easier.
: I rewrote it to be clearer about its (the page's) purpose and make it more readable, without changing the content. I think it's a worthwhile page, though not really a FAQ per se. We could possibly rename it ''About This Book'' or something. [[User:Dolsson5|Dolsson5]] ([[User talk:Dolsson5|talk]]) 05:18, 12 May 2010 (UTC)
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Introducing Meshes]] This page is very confusing and redundant, repeating information found in many of the other tutorials. Suggestion: break any non-redundant info into the Modeling a Person tutorial or other related tutorials.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Curve and Path Modeling]] The page is useless, and the scope is not clear. Suggestion: add examples and show what we're going to show.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Intro to Bezier Curves]] Suggestion: remove the noob notes and include them in the text. Add images for the second part. There is an edited version of the page, check that and eventually replace the text.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Making Your Creation Smoother]] Wrong title, little content. Suggestions: rename the page to &quot;Working with MetaObjects&quot; (or similar) and add content.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Materials and Textures]] Little content. Suggestion: add examples and show the general way to go. There is a nice tutorial page at [[:de:Blender Dokumentation/ Tutorials/ Texturen/ Texturtypen]] in German, so the images could be used. This tutorial is in English already in the manual, so maybe we don't need it here.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Procedural Textures]] Little content. Suggestion: add content. Either [[:de:http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender Dokumentation: Prozedurale Texturen]] or more tutorial like [[:de:Blender Dokumentation/ Tutorials/ Texturen/ Holz]].
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Image Textures]] Very little content. Suggestion: add content. It would be an important tutorial.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Basic Seawater]] Practically no content. Suggestion: remove the page or, but more preferably, update heavily.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Texturing Basic Seawater]] No usable content. Suggestion: remove the page or, but more preferably, update heavily. Note: This page has been merged into [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Basic Seawater]].
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Mountains Out Of Molehills 2]] Screenshots would be useful. Suggestion: add screenshots of the settings.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/The Rusty Ball]] Too little content. Suggestion: add content or remove.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Procedural Eyeball]] Needs images. Suggestion: add images.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/UV Map Basics]] Version unclear. Suggestion: Add version notes.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Realistic Eyes In Blender]] An image file is missing. Looks great though. Suggestion: create the image file again and upload it with clear copyright.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Light a Silver Goblet]] Wrong position in the manual. Suggestion: move to lighting.

=== Unit 3 ===
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Beginning Lighting]] Very short page. Suggestion: This is an important yet extremely difficult page to write. Would need examples for different light setups. Or we just leave it as an introductory page without any real content?
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Adding Lamps]] Not so good example images at the beginning. The purpose of these examples is unclear. Suggestion: there is a quite good introduction to lighting in the manual at [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Tutorials/Lighting/BSoD], so maybe this article is not so important.  
* Missing page: Shadows!
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Faked Gi with Blender internal]] Quite a good page, but maybe a bit more text would be useful. Suggestion: Reword the noob notes, put them directly in the text.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/OSA]] The different OSA types are not explained, the information could be more complete and more precise. Suggestion: add more information. Images could be used directly from [[:de:Blender Dokumentation: Anti-Aliasing]], text would have to be translated.  
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Animation]] This page has much too little information. Suggestion: the manual is much better in this point. Leave the page in the state being? Or rework completely, though it would require a blender master to do it properly. 
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Basic Animation/ScreenLayout]] Very little information. Suggestion: add content, would be useful.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Basic Water animation]] It may be difficult to follow. Suggestion: add images which show the settings and give more information. Maybe use [[:de:Blender Dokumentation: Die erste Fluidanimation]] this tutorial in German and translate it? Nice thing about wikibooks: you don't have to upload new images but can simply reuse existing images from other wikibooks.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Flying Through A Canyon]] Argh, no images. Suggestion: add images.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Simple Cloth Animation]] No images. Works with Softbodys, not with the cloth system, so the title may be misleading. Suggestion: move the page (better title). Add images.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Soft Body with wind]] Missing image of the result. Suggestion: create a new one and upload it.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Your First Test]] This is about the game engine. Suggestion: move the page so that it gets a better title.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Match Moving]] The article is marked as a stub. Suggestion: rework the page. Maybe there is no good internal solution, so that a listing of external solutions is useful here?
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Beginning Modeling Final Project]] Purpose of this page is unclear. It is not very specific. Suggestion: add more specific advice, it may be a useful page.

=== Unit 4 === 
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/HDRi]] This and the following page is in the wrong section. It belongs to lighting. Suggestion: move the page to the appropriate place.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Realistic Water using Fluid Sim and Yafray]] This seems to be a better fluid sim tutorial. Suggestion: merge with the first FS tutorial.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/BBB's Particles -- New 2.46 Particle System]] Content is already at another place. Suggestion: remove the page.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Textures]] Page has practically no content. Wrong pagename. Suggestion: Remove page.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Bump Mapping]] Page has practically no content. Wrong pagename. Suggestion: Remove page.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Normal Mapping]] Wrong section. Suggestion: rename page and move it to another place in the TOC.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Texture Normal Mapping]] Wrong section. Suggestion: rename page and move it to another place in the TOC.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Color Map Normal Mapping]] Wrong section. Suggestion: rename page and move it to another place in the TOC.
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Modeling/Light Mapping]] Page has practically no content. Wrong pagename. Suggestion: Remove page.

== Suggestions ==
* Standardize the commands and instructions to one keyboard layout and operating system (i.e. Linux QWERTY United States English) and break out the alternative options (e.g. differences on Mac or DVORAK) into side boxes so they don't interfere with readability. The troubleshooting and alternative command options interfere with the readability of instruction steps because you have to wade through excess irrelevant information. these alternatives should be migrated either to the end of each article/section or to some offset side boxes with labels like &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; and &quot;alternative command sequences&quot; so that each set of instruction steps stands alone, so it's easy to separate the actual instruction sequence from the side notes and easy to pick out the differences between your system and the system the book/tutorial was written for. Alternatively make each page devoted to one OS, and do other pages, e.g.: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Making_Fire?linux etc. (note: other OS's will have their own ID, such as linux, win, mac, etc., these should be self explanatory). This link will obviously lead back to the ordinary page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Making_Fire.
: OS separation is neither useful nor necessary. Only a few pages about the interface would contain any real differences.  --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 19:51, 2 June 2009 (UTC)
* The ideal layout would be completely writing out and capitalizing the keys, like Control-S, Alt-V, and Super-Q. &quot;Meta&quot;, &quot;Windows Key&quot;, and &quot;Command&quot; should not be used, but the difference (as stated above) should be in some little box called &quot;Formatting Conventions&quot; near the beginning.. &quot;Keystrip 5&quot; and &quot;Numpad 5&quot; would be a good way to differentiate between number keys, and letter keys should always be capitalized if they are being instructed to be pressed.
* Always provide the regular Menu path to get to a command (at least the first time) or note that a regular Menu path doesn't exist. Too often the only option provided is a key sequence and the location of the command in the menus is not shown/known. Hot keys should be more along the lines of optional to learn, though obviously in blender it's good to know some of your standard keys, and some key commands possibly don't have a menu equivalent, but Menu paths should always be provided (if they exist) at least the first time a command or key is used/introduced.
* The intro of the book states that beginners need to read the chapters in sequence but there is a lot of repetition of the beginner information in later tutorials. Again this reduces readability because one must wade through irrelevant information. Remove the beginner explanations from later tutorials and instead include a disclaimer at the top noting the other pre-requisite tutorials.
* The inter linking of many pages does not fit to the TOC of the book, this should be fixed. 
* Cleanup the &quot;beginner&quot; tutorials section of this book, many tutorials do not seem that beginner and are not even that clear.
* Redo the beginning section to have a continuous sequence of tutorials.
* Remove most of the chapter style links connecting unrelated tutorials and instead list the tutorials by subject matter (similar to [[Blender_3D:_Tutorial_Links_List|this]])
* Have a link in the modules going back to tutorial indexes sorted by difficulty and / or subject (i.e.:&quot;back to beginner tutorials list&quot; instead of &quot;next chapter&quot;) 
* Remove the &quot;noob note&quot; discussions on the modules and move them over to the talk pages.
* Link to related content that helps readers locate tutorials that explain topics which the current one assumes knowledge of (similar to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Template:Japanese related]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for the Japanese wikibook)
* Add a version note to each tutorial and each image. For the images this should be done by the uploader.
* Move the mostly unfinished (or unreadable) articles into a development section (similar to [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Development]]), then move them back into the book once they reach a more complete / understandable state
* Move all the external links to the tutorial links list, or remove them simply, because they didn't belong here anyway. 
* Create a page about the scope and the purpose of the book
* Add a flag for excellent tutorials, that may be used as a guideline on how to write tutorials.

== Done ==
* [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Particle Systems]] Note: '''The first example could be more useful if it would show a bit more and give some tips about working with particle systems. Suggestion: add more content.''' Added a first, complete, simple tutorial. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 14:01, 7 April 2009 (UTC)

I do think that most of these are helpful, but I believe they could be drastically condensed to more quickly convey their information. Some of these go on for several paragraphs to convey a one or two sentence solution. --[[User:Null Point|Null Point]] ([[User talk:Null Point|talk]]) 03:28, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
:I suggest add a page and link it to the original page, on that new page title it (OriginalPageName)NoobNotesand instead of a whole page of notes just insert the page's NoobNote link in place and move that Noob Note to that page. IT will still carch people's attention by being right in the way of your tutorial but will not impede the flow of information if someone is reading and wants to skip the noob note.--[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 12:47, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
: What is a &quot;Noob Note&quot;? A note from a noob who has additional questions, or a note for a noob? 
:* If it contains additional information, it should either go directly in the page, or it is to advanced for the tutorial - so it may go at best to the discussion page, because most readers won't need it.
:* If someone needs clarifying information he should write it on the discussion page, than the tutorial could be made better. 
: In both cases the concept of a Noob Note seems strange to me. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 17:07, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
:: I can see the use of Noob Notes in the case of pointers for beginners, I've used a couple of noob notes so far for information in what I can do if something isn't working. There's a {{tl|info}} template that can be use for useful information, why not a similar &quot;noobinfo&quot; template that's targetted to those who are new to Blender with additional information? [[User:Daworm|Daworm]] ([[User talk:Daworm|talk]]) 02:40, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

:::Additions to a page should be evaluated based on their content, not who made them.  I don't see any reason to preserve the distinction between notes added by &quot;noobs&quot; or &quot;mere users&quot; and those added by the people who consider themselves to be &quot;authors&quot; or &quot;team members&quot;.  Daworm is quite right that questions and comments belong on talk pages.  For tips that might break the flow of a module, I recommend using a template such as {{Tl|B3D:N2P/Note}} or {{Tl|B3D:N2P/Hidden begin}}, depending how long and generally-applicable they are.  {{Tl|Info}} would also be acceptable. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 19:48, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

I second that it should be removed. There's no practical reason for why it should be there, etc. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 13:34, 10 April 2009 (UTC)
:Sure, done and done--[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 15:33, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

I'm someone desperately trying to find answers to how to use Blender. How can one find what's in your book without an index?!!!! Idiots.

== Rewrite of hotkey sections ==

The Blender hotkey information is in complete disarray, spread across many pages. I suggest that all relevant (by key, by mode, etc.) hotkey information be placed on single pages. We should write a unified hotkey template to make this easier. The template should have all the hotkey information in it so we don't have to update key information on every page every time something changes. It should look something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{B3D:Hotkey
|filter={{none|some key|some Blender mode}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Every page should employ the template. The main hotkey page should have all the hotkeys, sorted by key (no filter). The navigation table should be rewritten so that the by-key information leads to anchors on the main hotkey page instead of leading to separate pages. Also, a general update of the information would be in order. Is this all possible? --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 14:52, 4 May 2009 (UTC)
: I don't understand what you would actually like to achieve? Do you want to write a hotkey reference? And what is the purpose of the template? --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:44, 5 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Actually, we already have a hotkey reference, check the TOC. It's just that it's completely disorganised and horrible. The template should make updates easy by effectively acting as a hotkey database, so as soon as the template is updated, all the pages get updated instantaneously. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 08:33, 5 May 2009 (UTC)
:: OK, I've seen a second [[Blender 3D: HotKeys|Blender HotKey doc]] and and am rewriting the entire TOC to replace the current hotkey links (plus much more). We should move this to that doc's discussion section. Oh, and, please don't do any major TOC rewrites until I finish this. Thanks! --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 11:25, 6 May 2009 (UTC)

== The &quot;under construction&quot; icon ==

Do we really need it? I thought it's obvious that any unfinished module is &quot;under construction&quot;. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 07:16, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
: I'm not 100% sure whether these icons has the same meaning. A tutorial may be finished, but could be improved. But we could use the 0% sign instead. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 14:56, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Then we don't need it. As I said, anything unfinished is logically improvable. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 08:58, 14 May 2009 (UTC)

== Page merge proposal ==

I suggest that [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Introduction]] be merged with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Thinking in 3D]]. They should contain the same information and an ambiguous ''Introduction'' page looks unsightly anyways. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 18:59, 15 May 2009 (UTC)
: I agree, but would go a step further and merge both with [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Understanding Coordinates]]. So the page would have real content. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 06:40, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Very well. I'll see what I can do. --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 08:57, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
:: Alright, done. Now go sight them! ;) --[[User:Electro|Electro]] ([[User talk:Electro|talk]]) 09:28, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

==Using this page==
Is it appropriate to mark an item as done/in progress after attempting to complete it? --[[User:Illusionist|Illusionist]]
: Absolutely. There is no one who would supervise this process, but some people are trying and check if you change the status of a page. So go ahead. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 08:01, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Suggestions&quot; alternate viewpoint ==

Quote from page:
''The intro of the book states that beginners need to read the chapters in sequence but there is a lot of repetition of the beginner information in later tutorials.  Again, this reduces readability because one must wade through irrelevant information. Remove the beginner explanations from later tutorials and instead include a disclaimer at the top noting the other pre-requisite tutorials.''  

Repetition is the core of learning.  I think revisiting a topic a few times helps retention. How could it be irrelevant unless it covers something foreign to the exercise? People know how to skim past items they are already familiar with.  If nothing else, the reader may receive some needed reinforcement, or gain a better understanding of the concept and/or it can even be a source of pride for those that they &quot;already know that bit&quot; when they get to it.   

However, there are things within early pages ( I'm looking at you:[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Know_What_You're_Doing#Organize_early.2C_organize_thoroughly.21]] ) where technical terms are being used in detail (without being introduced) that SHOULD mean nothing to a noob that is reading items in-order.  That's something that kills readability, and is discouraging to someone who has accepted the mantle of &quot;noob&quot; (by reading this at all) and is still &quot;not smart enough&quot; to understand items which the writer(s) appears to assume is common knowledge for noobs.

--[[User:Deadguy|Deadguy]] ([[User talk:Deadguy|talk]]) 13:28, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
: I agree with both points. --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 04:31, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

== Version of Information? ==

Just wondering, to what version should the Wikibook pages be detailed for? Latest available? Perhaps have a template for things where short-cuts have changed etc. and say &quot;in earlier versions you may have to do A -&gt; B -&gt; C instead of A -&gt; B -&gt; D&quot;

Does that makes sense?
[[User:Daworm|Daworm]] ([[User talk:Daworm|talk]]) 02:49, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

Case in point [[:File:Blender Screenshot for Beginner Tutorial.jpg]] '''this image''', do you think perhaps update the image to a standard Blender view of current version? Not a modified colour view as that's the only page with a non-standard blender colouring for example.
[[User:Daworm|Daworm]] ([[User talk:Daworm|talk]]) 02:51, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

== Merging Sections ==

I propose merging

[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating Basic Seawater]] &amp; [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Texturing Basic Seawater]] into one article and fluff it out some more with appropriate content.

[[User:Daworm|Daworm]] ([[User talk:Daworm|talk]]) 03:50, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

== 2.5 - How do we handle such updates? ==

I would like to start working on content that is formatted for Blender 2.5, but it's not very clear to me how to introduce any new content without causing confusion for users still working in 2.49.

Looking around a little, it does not seem like these pages are getting a super huge amount of updates.  Maybe someone with more wiki experience can let me know how this is normally done.  Can we make a &quot;branch&quot; of the book that has tags for 2.5, or copy the entire thing and start to edit like crazy?  Clearly the biggest issue is concurrent updates:  if someone wants to improve something that is documented for 2.49, but it is no longer correct for 2.5, how do we keep the versions growing in value with such updates?

Any thoughts out there?

--[[User:Ksamson|Ksamson]] ([[User talk:Ksamson|talk]]) 19:21, 16 December 2009 (UTC)

:I think forking the entire book would be counterproductive.  However, it's quite appropriate to note in the text differences between 2.5x and 2.49b.  If a note gets to be than a sentence or two long, please use the {{Tl|B3D:N2P/Hidden begin}} template to minimize the impact on text flow.  When 2.5x becomes stable, someone can go through and update the modules affected by the changes. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 18:12, 9 November 2010 (UTC)

== Get rid of the confusing 'Do' boxes ==

This is an issue that popped up on BlenderArtists. I suggest that we completely get rid of {{B3D:N2P/Do|these}} awful 'Do' boxes, IMHO they just confuse the reader. I mean, this is 3D modelling, you gotta have some brains to get into it and I think they are just useless and take up space. Not to mention that it's far easier (and more readable) to type plain text.

With that in mind, why not we make plain text the standard for commands instead of those boxes? At least change the formatting to something like '''&lt;code&gt;this inline text in bold.&lt;/code&gt;''' --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 08:04, 18 July 2011 (UTC)


==Outdated==
The entire tutorial from what I've seen in Unit 2 is outdated. It pertains mostly to 2.4x only, but occasionally fills in some '2.58', '2.61', or '2.3' stuff. Needs to be MUCH better. nothing more to say.</text>

==Introduction==

This chapter describes the process of designing a new embedded system, or of improving an existing one. That is, how does an individual engineer, or a team of engineers and project managers, tackle the design of an embedded system in [[w:Design_process#Typical_steps|a systematic way]]. This chapter tries to incorporate more than just the engineer's view of the design process: often, a process starts with a company's CTO (''chief technical officer'') discussing the functionalities of a new product with a customer (''requirement analysis''), with the HR (''human resources'') and CFO (''chief financial officer'') stepping in in a second phase (''high level design'') to estimate how many and which people to put on the project, and how much complexity and risks it brings for the company. Only then, the engineers can start the ''detailed design'' phase, and begin to think about ''implementation'' and ''testing''.

Although this book focuses on embedded systems with an important
amount of mechanical subsystems, the design steps can probably also be
applied to design problems in most other areas of engineering.

==Design steps==

When designing a system, there is a sequence of steps that has to be followed before finishing an end product. These steps  to design are:
* Requirement definition
* System specification
* Functional design
* Architectural design
* Implementation (Prototyping)
* After-sales service/support

It’s not necessary to spend the same amount of time and budget on each of these six steps. One part will go faster than the other. Sometimes even a step can be skipped or cancelled.
Mostly it will be necessary to iterate between these steps to reach an final product.

In the next subsections, there will be more explanation about each of these 6 steps. Hereby an impression will be given about how to implement the steps during the designing of a system or product.
===Requirement definition===
In this first stage of the design process, it’s important to recognize the needs. The question that must be asked is: What does the user want?

How the product will work and witch components to use is not important at this stage. A good way to look at the system is that of a black box. Now it is only important to know what the user has to be able to input, and the demanded output associated with the input.
===System specification (Project description)===
In this step, the real engineering begins. The implementation of the requirements from the first step has to be realized. It is important at this stage to distinguish between system requirements and system specifications. The requirements describe what the users want out of the system when they put something in it. The specifications describe what is necessary internally to meet the requirements. This takes into account that the final project will have some real world environment where it will have to operate. That means we should consider how our system will interact with the user and the actuators it will have to control.

During this phase, the complexity of the system will become clear. This is important to have a global view of the project you’re working on.(See complexities of systems)
===Detailed description (functional design)===
Once the development team understands the requirements needed in order to solve the issues from the previous step, the phase of looking at how the system will work begins.

During this step of the design, the designer decides how the system will be divided into functional blocks and how they will be interconnected and implemented. It’s important to have a view of the process as a system that consists of blocks. 

To do this, it’s recommended to use a block diagram approach. By doing this, a data flow between the controller and the controlled object must be defined. So the first step in defining our detailed description would be to compile a data flow diagram. 

The following step would be to define exactly what these data flows entail. What are the control signals to be given, and what are the returned variables.

It is important not to specify components at this stage of the designprocess, but to keep a broad view throughout this step, later on components can be chosen. This keeps all options open and will lead to a better solution.  
===Architectural design===
After the previous stages, the design team gets a good view of the whole system and its functionalities. Now it’s time to translate this blocks and data flow into real hardware. 

It’s necessary to have different possibilities for each individual block. Hereby the team has the best option to realize the design specifications and requirements.

After these architectural decisions have been made, it’s time to put all the functional blocks together. This can cause some serious ‘logical problems’ . Therefore it can be necessary to iterate on this process.

When putting these blocks together one has to pay attention to the communication between the different blocks. If you connect these blocks you have to be sure that the logic between the different blocks is respected. This means that semantics are a relevant and important issue here.
===Implementation (Prototyping)===
When the design team finished the hardware design, a first prototype of the system can be made. This prototype is important because it’s necessary to do some tests. 

By doing this tests logic errors and hardware disabilities can be found. Feedback will be generated which can be used as input to improve the whole system.

When huge errors are found or the system does not meet the specifications, it can be necessary to return to the functional design step. 
===After-sales service/Support===
Some systems or products need to be followed during their lifecycle. This is called after-sales service. For example: some hardware will have to be replaced, software code must be updated, the system needs an upgrade,… 

Also, the client may need support. Some systems can get very complex so it’s impossible to understand it without a detailed manual and instructions from the developer. The success of a product can improve if there is a good manual and good support.


==Design models==
==Cross-sectional design issues==
===Communication===

Communication is one of the most important aspects in the whole process of designing an embedded system or a product in general.  If there is no communication or a lack of communication projects can get delayed which raises the costs significantly. Communication is important especially when dealing with complex systems. Complex systems are almost always designed by many different people, teams, who often have a different professional background. Not only is communication important because of different professional backgrounds, but it also insures a smooth transition between different phases of the design process and thus less iterations which leads to a quicker development of the system. In other words, communication in an organisation may be used to influence, inform, control or inspire.

In general two broad categories of communication can be distinguished. The first is the strictly managed, structured formal  communication. The second the informal communication. Both are very important for an efficient product development environment.
 
''Formal communication:''
Formal communication channels follow the organisational structure or hierarchy.  In the process of designing a new system, the most important direction of communication is probably horizontal. Horizontal communication occurs across the same hierarchy level and involves for example meetings and coordination between teams of subsystems, or the transition of information from one department to the other after completing a phase in the design process, here documentation is an very important issue and will be dealt with further in this section. 

''Informal communication:''
Informal  communication exists outside the formal lines of the organizational structure. An example of this is friendship groups. The informal communication channel serves two main purposes: it permits employees to satisfy their need for social interaction in the workplace and it can improve an organization’s performance by creating alternative, and frequently faster and more efficient, channels of communication (Robbins et al. 2000). So this type of communication is very important in an organization because solutions to problems can be found much more quickly than through the formal channels, and it can lead to more creative ideas coming from different backgrounds leading to a potential more optimal solution.

''Documentation:''
Documentation is a crucial part of the communication when going through the whole design process. At the end of each phase of the design process, other teams and people are involved in the next phase of the project. This means that every action, decision that has been taken in the previous phase has  to be documented so the working principle of the system as well as the semantics of every term that has been used is clear and transparent.  Documenting is often a hard and time-consuming handling because the person who writes it has to be aware of the terms and principles that can be unclear.
Documentation is not in each phase of the design process in the same form and in the same quantities.  When defining the requirements, documentation consist mainly out of a list of key words that describe the requirements.  System specifications needs more documentation but is still schematic.  So in general we can conclude that how further the phase is  in the design process how more detailed the documentation has to be.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics ''Semantics:'']
Semantics is as mentioned important when systems and people are communicating. Often a system consists out of different subsystems who will have to communicate with each other, so the input of one subsystem has to know what the meaning is of the output of the other system. Therefore when using terms, words, designers will have to explain exactly which connotation these terms and words have. If this is not done, misunderstanding can cause the whole system to fail and then it is very hard to know where the errors are, because same words have been used for other meanings.

Closely related to semantics is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon ''jargon''], jargon causes problems when for example the end user has a totally different background then the engineer who designs the product and thus uses other words for same concepts.

===Late design commitments===

It is crucial for a good design not to make quick decisions about the implementation of the design but to wait as long as possible to fill in the real components and hardware for your design.  A late design commitment leaves open a lot of options for the implementation later on and leads to a better solution and more creativity for the developed system. In the software jargon this late design commitment is called “delaying commitment”. Late commitment is actually a part of a development strategy called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development “lean software development”], this strategy focuses on quick response on the market. It’s a strategy adopted from Toyota who first implemented it in the automotive industry. 

How far in the design process one can keep a broad view is often very market depending. The view can be kept broad until the point where a particular system or product is linked to a customer, this point is called the [http://d.wanfangdata.com.cn/NSTLQK_NSTL_QK6919002.aspx order penetration point]. Depending on the product delivery strategy (make to stock, assemble-to-order, make-to-order, engineer-to-order) the view can be kept broad the whole process or is already determined by the end-user at the beginning of the design process.

===Recources===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management ''Human resources:'']
The most valued assets of an organization are without any doubt the people who individually and collectively contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the business.
Human resource management (HRM) is thereby a crucial organizational activity which has to make sure that the right people are employed for the right product at the right time. 
HRM not only has to hire and fire, but it should also bring a culture into the organization of continued growing of individuals and teams by education and team building. 
If a certain complex embedded system has to be designed, HRM should make sure that enough people with the right backgrounds are assigned to the project.

===Quality===

Quality can mean different things for different people, a common factor is that they are all important. Consumers may focus on the ''specification quality'', asking if the implemented specifications are really needed and useful or on the ''relative quality'', meaning how the system compares to similar systems of the competition. Producers on the other hand probably will view quality as the amount of embedded systems/products that are produced correctly.

Two main issues have to be handled when dealing with quality. On the one hand there should be ''prevention'', which can be achieved by implementing a quality management system  or at system level FMEA can be used. More about these kinds of failure modes and prevention can be read in an separate chapter that deals with this issue ([[Embedded Control Systems Design/Failure modes and prevention]]). On the other hand there should be a ''control system'' to check if there are defects. 
In the early days of quality control, only the end-product was checked for errors, now the general trend is the implementation  of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TQM total quality management] philosophy. This philosophy exist of a total control of the production process and the implementation of quality control not only at the end stage but most importantly at all stages throughout the design process. Another part of the philosophy is to make all people involved in the organisation aware of quality, this shows the importance of good communication in total quality management.   

Because quality management is a key issue in the design process and the entire organisation, international standards have been made to help cope with quality in the design, development and delivery of a general product or service. These standards are called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso_9000 ISO 9000:2000] standards. This is an extensive family of standards and mostly a part of them are implemented like the ISO 9001, which deals with the quality of the end-product.

The organisation itself has to decide which level of quality they want to reach, this has to be in consultation with the resource management, because the higher the level of quality the company want to achieve, the more recourses there have to be allocated to it.

      <comment>some thoughts on alternative formats</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Re format ==

Some perspective on how I ended up choosing the format I did, and alternatives to it.

My original plans were much more grandiose.  For each page there would be links on the left to all ancestors of the current page, and links on the right to all of their successors.  This would have been technically feasible, but I ultimately didn't do it for two roughly co-equal primary reasons, with at least one secondary reason also figuring into the equation.
# Not all books have &quot;parent&quot; pages, and not all that have them use the same conventions for naming them.  It just happens that the Conlang book, on which I primarily work, is organized with a hierarchy of pages, each of which has a complete set of ancestors named by removing suffixes of the path &amp;mdash; Conlang/Intermediate/Sounds/Phonotactics has ancestors Conlang/Intermediate/Sounds and Conlang/Intermediate (and one might or might not count the book's main page as an ancestor).  In contrast, though, Using Wikibooks has pages of the form Book/Chapter/Section, but not Book/Chapter; and in that situation one might reasonably either have no parent, or count the first section of a chapter as the &quot;parent&quot; of the other sections of that chapter.  If I was going to make the tools applicable to a maximally wide range of books, without presenting a bewildering array of optional parameters (which I was hoping to avoid), it seemed advisable to try not to build into the tools too many structural assumptions about how the book is organized.
# The full-blown top navbox, with all ancestors and their successors, would have been harder to use because it was so complicated.
# There are some awkward organizational questions that would have to be given somewhat arbitrary answers (either by the template designer, or by the book designer if a battery of optional parameters were provided to support different choices).
#* One might reasonably put all ancestors in a column in the center of the box, with the current page at the bottom of the column and the book's main page at the top of the column; but then, what goes over on the left?  Just the predecessor, at the bottom left?  But then, what if the predecessor is the parent &amp;mdash; should that go at the bottom left, or one line up from that?  Or if the ancestors go in the left column, what happens when the predecessor has several generations of different ancestors from the current page?  The vision of a whole matrix of links in the top navbox was pretty strong reinforcement for the Keep It Simple, Stupid approach (2).
#* What about successor links when the current page has descendants?  A single successor would be the first child, but if you've got mulitple ancestors, wouldn't it make sense to have the next page at the same level, as ''well'' as the first child?
In the end, I devised the &quot;split mode&quot; option on Navlist/Link so that I could simultaneously provide only two links (one predecessor and one successor) and yet fully clarify the hierarchical structure of the book, if any.

A side consequence of all this is that the format I finally settled on probably should be called something other than &quot;long&quot; &amp;mdash; because compared to some alternatives, it's really quite compact.

It occurs to me that one might provide a &quot;mode&quot; option on this navbox that would be passed on through to Navlist/Link, so that split mode can be disabled on books that have no deep structure.  (I think that was probably what I had in mind when I deliberately gave the Navlist/Link parameter a name that I didn't think would collide with anything else in the navbox templates.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:07, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, Tbone2550,

I just would like to share with you, that I am a person that feeds off criticism, but to be honest if the response you made on my page is any of bit true, then I would like to suggest that you read my article closer. I do not think you actually read the article, because it is very relevant to the goal that I am trying to accomplish within the text that I post. I can say I appreciate your opinion though.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dancing Doll.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Angel Airfreshener - Tree Top Doll]]Plastic canvas needlepoint is just a variation of regular needlepoint but can be much more fun and useful, because you can make so many decorative and 3D things from it that would not be possible to create with just cloth. The projects that can be made are only limited by your imagination.

Many people don't know how to do this enjoyable and addictive craft. This guide is meant to explain the basics to you and hope those of you that would like to try out can use this information to start a new hobby you will love for a lifetime. Your friends and family will also enjoy all the beautiful handcrafted things you will give as gifts.

'''Things You Should Know Before Starting A Project'''
On any pattern you work you will find the plastic canvas grid is either counted out by using the terms lines or threads or by holes or squares. I prefer to count the holes of the plastic canvas because I think it's easier.

Plastic canvas comes in 4 sizes: 5 holes to the inch, 7 holes to the inch, 10 holes to the inch, and 14 holes to the inch. Check the materials list at the top of any pattern to see what size canvas the pattern call for. I prefer to stitch projects using 7 count plastic canvas. The plastic canvas sheets also come in different types. The standard clear variety is used on most patterns. It also comes in a variety of colors. Don't use a colored canvas unless the pattern calls for it, because the yarn might not cover it all and the grid may show through. The canvas also comes in a stiff variety or a soft type. Again these are not used unless the pattern requires them.

The best type of yarn to use is regular worsted weight yarn. It's economical, comes in a variety of colors, and can be bought almost anywhere. I never use the type of yarn sold in those little skeins just for plastic canvas. It is expensive and not necessary to do so. I recommend buying Red Heart yarns it can be purchased at many online stores or at your neighborhood Walmart. Also check garage sales for bargains. I have bought bags of yarn very cheap there.

'''Washing Of Plastic Canvas Stitched Items'''
If a project gets soiled it can be washed by soaking it in a sink with warm water and a little dish soap. DO NOT use hot water and DO NOT put it in the washing machine or dryer. Just let it soak in the sink for a little while, rinse and let sit in bath tub to drain and dry over night. Items like a tote bag that will get a lot of handling can be sprayed with Scotchgard to protect it from soiling if desired. DO NOT dry clean or use cleaning solvents, it could melt the plastic grid. If an item gets dusty just use your vacuum to remove the dust.

'''What You Need To Get Started'''
The first thing you should do is practice the basic stitches so you will need a few sheets of 7 count plastic canvas. Buy a couple of yarn needles especially sold for this type of needlepoint. I say buy a couple because I always lose mine down in the chair cushions. You'll also need worsted weight yarn and a pair of scissors. Now that you have your needle, yarn and plastic canvas let's practice some stitches. To keep a project neat on the wrong side no knots are used. When starting a row a small end of the yarn or tail is left on the backside when you pull the yarn through to the front. The first few stitches of the are done over that tail on the wrong side to lock the yarn so it won't come undone. 

[[Image:Contintal stitch.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Continental Stitch Example]] '''Continental Stitch:''' This is a basic stitch that is used on most patterns. Start the stitch by leaving about a 1 inch tail of yarn on the backside and bring your needle up through the hole marked black dot. Go back down to the backside at the red dot. All stitches are done in a left to right manner.

[[Image:Slanted goblen stitch.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Slanted Gobelin Stitch Example]]'''Slanted Gobelin Stitch:''' This stitch really is just a variation of the regular continental stitch but it can be done over 2 or more threads of the canvas at a time. The first stitch of the row is just a continental stitch as before. The second stitch comes up at the second black dot and down at the second red dot over the first one. Continue across to the left side, flip and start again as before.

[[Image:Goblen stitch.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Gobelin Stitch Example]]'''Gobelin Stitch:''' Do the stitches up from the back at the black dot and down through the red dot working over the little tail of yarn as before to keep the stitches from coming undone. The pattern you are going to do will tell you if you should use 1 strand of yarn or 2 . Usually the stitches worked over 2 or more threads will require 2 strands of yarn to cover the grid better.

[[Image:Overcast.jpg|thumb|right|173px|Overcast Stitch Example]]'''Overcast Stitch (also called the Whipstitch):''' This stitch is used to finish off the unstitched edge of a project. When stitching corners I usually make at least 3 stitches instead of the 2 stitches shown. The whipstitch is used when you are joining 2 pieces of a pattern together such as the sides of a tissue box. Use extra stitches if necessary on the corners or sides if they are required to cover the edge of the grid neatly without showing through. Just the 2 pieces back to back and overcast where they should be joined.

There are tons of other stitches and variations of stitches out there but working with this form of needlepoint is a learning experience and you will learn more tricks of the trade and ways of doing things as you get used to using the basic stitches.

'''Two Last Tips For You Before You Start Your First Project:'''
To end off at the end of a row when you are finished. Turn over to the backside of your canvas and run the needle under 4 or 5 stitches then cut the yarn. You will also use this way to start again if you run out of yarn in the middle of a row. I use 3 feet long pieces of yarn when stitching so you don't have too many stops and starts. Just run the yarn under a few stitches on the backside and finish stitching across.

'''That's It !!! Now You Are Ready To Start Your First Project !!!'''

== What a current source is ==

[[Image:Ideal_current_source_65b.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 1: How does a constant current source behave?&lt;/center&gt;]]

We begin our story with general questions: &quot;What is a '''constant current source'''? What do we want it to do? How does a current source behave? How do we figure out that some device is a current source? How do we make a current source? Do we need a &quot;definition&quot; for such a self-speaking term?&quot; Obviously not; we can take for granted the notion of ''constant current source''. Nevertheless let's mention that it's a thing (electronic device) producing electrical current. For such a simple device, we would expect it to have a simple behaviour. We would very much like it to produce a '''constant''' current, regardless of the load we apply.

What have you known about the current source from the basic course of electricity? Here is the well-known symbol of a current source (Fig. 1). How to make a good guess that it is a current source? If someone gives us a (black) box with two leads and says that it is a current source, how do we convince ourselves that it is really a current source? Let's conduct some experiments. For example, what will happen, if we connect the two leads (a short circuit - case 1 on the picture)? Is it dangerous for the current source (comparing with a voltage one)? Indeed, there is nothing dangerous for a current source, if we short its two leads. As the current source is designed for a given current, it keeps up (limits) the current thus protecting itself.

Then, maybe the opposite condition - an open circuit (case 3 on the picture) - will be dangerous as the current source will try to pass the same current as before. In this situation, the current source is misled: it doesn't see the open circuit; it &quot;thinks&quot; there is something connected there. It just &quot;sees&quot; that no current flows and raises its internal voltage up with the &quot;hope&quot; to pass a current through the harmful &quot;thing&quot;. Of course, the current source does not manage to pass any current through the open circuit and reaches the final (compliance) voltage; a saturation and even a breakdown occurs. Thus, the compliance voltage represents the maximum voltage that the current source can reach when it strives to produce the desired current.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==A passive one==

[[File:Simplest_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 2 : Making the simplest current source&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== The general idea ===

How do we make the most simple current source? As we all know,
thanks to a certain wise man called Ohm, the only way to get yourself some current is to apply some voltage over some resistance. The easiest way to achieve 
this is to connect a voltage source in series with a resistor.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I=U/R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

For example, take a standard 9V battery and a 9kΩ resistor, connect them in series - and there you have it, a 1 mA current source (you can measure it with an ammeter).

&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;I = 9 V / 9 kΩ = 1 mA&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

OK, we all know Ohm's law as a mathematical equation... but what's the logic behind it? We know '''the fact''' that voltage over resistance produces current, but '''why'''? Voltage is in fact a genuine '''Force'''; another possible explanation would be to think of '''voltage''' as some kind of '''potential''' - like a smart man's potential to learn many things. In order for this potential to become something real, to move the smart man up the line of personal improvement, (this '''movement''' would be a kind of '''current''') it has to be put in action over some obstacles - exams, tasks, etc. (this would be the equivalent of '''resistance'''). Another analogy would be the potential of a car's engine to propel the vehicle forward - there must be something to act upon - the road surface, for example.

=== The imperfections ===

[[File:Passive_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3: The load decreases the current.&lt;/center&gt;]]

But enough philosophy... now that we have a current source, let's use it to power up something - let's connect a '''load''' (it could be a light bulb, a resistor, anything consuming current). But now a problem appears... the ammeter shows less current, than we expected. We may look at the problem from two viewpoints.

'''...in terms of resistance...''' Why - because the load introduces some new resistance to the circuit, thus rising its equivalent resistance and lowering the current (note the voltage supply stays constant). If we put a bigger load, we would see that the current decreases even more: I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/(R +  R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).

'''...in terms of voltage.''' The real load introduces some voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, which affects the excitation voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, not all the input voltage is applied across the current-setting resistor R but only the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, here the voltage difference V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; determines the current I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; instead the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the current decreases: I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/R.

It appears that our most simple current source can't cope with various loads and is unable to keep the current at a constant rate. That's why  these kind of circuits are called '''passive''' - they don't react to changes and disturbances. So, the most simple current source that we've made ourselves is '''a passive one''' (it's like a reluctant worker, who doesn't alter his efforts regardless of how much work there is to be done). Well, this passive circuit is imperfect; it can't stand against the load &quot;intervention&quot;, especially if the load varies. It is a static, fixed, non-adaptable circuit...; it needs some improvement... What do we do then?

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==Two ways to make an active one==

==== The basic &quot;dynamizing&quot; idea ====

Obviously, we have to reveal the truth by ourselves; let's then begin reasoning. The problem pops up when we connect a load and, what is worse, if we begin varying its resistance. Note the load may be not only a steady or varying resistor; it might be a capacitor that is charging, a diode (ordinary, zener, LED, base-emitter junction, etc.) or even a voltage source (e.g., a rechargeable battery)... It is not so important what exactly the load is; it is only important that a voltage drop appears across the load and this voltage drop confuses things.

If we look around, we can see that most things in this world are changeable, adaptable, dynamic... According to this observation, we have to make our current source react somehow to the load &quot;intervention&quot;, to resist to its attempt to lower the current. That means something inside the current source has to change, in order to compensate the disturbing voltage drop across the load. What can change in this simple electric circuit?

In our recipe for current we have two ingredients - voltage and resistance. Hence, if we want to make our current source react to changes in load, we have to  alter one of the two ingredients dynamically, in relevance with the change in load resistance.

=== Making the internal voltage dynamic ===

[[File:Bootstrapped_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 4: Keeping up a constant current by a dynamic voltage source.&lt;/center&gt;]]

One possible solution would be to vary the internal voltage - when the load increases, the internal voltage rises too. We can call this one '''dynamic current source with following internal voltage'''.

It may seem like a smart idea, but unfortunately - it is not. It's actually a kind of [[w:bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] - this term comes from the story about [[w:Baron Munchhausen|Baron Munchhausen]], who once got stuck in quicksand, and pulled himself up by his own bootstraps.

This solution has quite a limited ability to compensate changes in load, because the varying supply voltage will quickly reach its maximum.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Making the internal resistance dynamic ===

[[File:R_dynamic_current_source_65b_1000.jpg|right|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;Keeping up a constant current by a dynamic resistor.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The other possible solution is to vary the internal resistance. This time, when the load resistance increases, the internal resistance R will have to decrease, keeping the sum R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; unchanged, so the current flow stays at a constant rate. Hence the name of the resistor '''R''' is '''current-stable resistor'''. 

Of course, this method also has a limited ability to compensate changes in load resistance, because the decreasing internal resistance will reach zero at a certain time.  But it's much more simple to implement (it's easier to play with resistance, then messing around with voltage).

We will continue our quest to destination ''Simplest transistor current source'' by using the second methodology. What element will we use to materialize the '''dynamic internal resistance''' solution? As the name of this topic implies, it's going to be the '''transistor'''. Let's talk about its behavior to find out why...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==Active current source with a BJT==
===What is the transistor and why did we choose it===
[[FIle:Transistors-white.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;Transistors&lt;/center&gt;]]
Enter the '''transistor''' - considered one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. A tiny device, that literally changed the world and now dominates all areas of life - it can be found in every electronic device around us, as it is the fundamental building block of modern electronic circuits. 

OK, the transistor is pretty cool... but what is it ''actually''? Its name comes from ''transfer resistor - transistor''... which doesn't clarify its structure, neither its purpose. To keep it short, the transistor is a semiconductor device comprising two PN junctions and has three terminals. Let's talk a bit more about its behaviour, as it is much more interesting ;)

It can do a fascinating trick - '''amplifying a signal'''. At least that's how they call it, even though it's not amplification at all. Actually, the transistor allows us to control a larger current flow (the output) with a smaller current flow (the input). It's more like '''creating a scaled copy of the input signal using additional power''', than amplifying it. Think of it as a ''current valve'' - valves are devices used to control the flow of a fluid, in our case the current would be the equivalent to fluid. 

Transistor are also used for '''electronically controlled switches''' - just like ON/OFF buttons, operated by electronic means. This powerful idea is the heart of digital circuitry today.

[[File:NPN_BJT.svg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;center&gt;An NPN Bipolar Junction Transistor&lt;/center&gt;]]
For a wonderful and detailed explanation of this transistor behaviour by means of hydraulic analogy - check the [[#References/See also|References/See also]] section.

Transistors come in a variety of types, with the most popular being '''MOSFET'''s and '''BJT'''s, but the list continues with lots of others (basically derivatives of the two most popular ones). We will use a '''BJT''', which stand for ''Bipolar Junction Transistor''. ''Bipolar'' indicates that both the electrons and holes take part in the transistor's operation.

Much more can be said about this wonderful invention, but that's a long story outside the scope of this article.


====Hydraulic analogy - the BJT as a ''current valve''====
[[File:GateValve.JPG|thumb|150px|Valve - a variable ''water'' bottleneck]]
As we saw in some of the other articles of Circuit Idea, hydraulic analogy is a powerful and intuitive concept for explaining electrical circuits.
Current flow (hence the word &quot;flow&quot;) can be represented by the flow of a fluid. Usually, when we want some fluid flowing at a constant rate, (e.g. when  watering the garden with a hose), we create a ''constraint'' on the fluid path, creating a ''bottleneck''.[[Image:Potentiometer.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Potentiometer - a mechanically controlled ''current'' bottleneck]] A ''bottleneck'' (consider the name) is the point that has the lowest throughput, thus determining the maximum flow capacity. Bottlenecks cam be found not only in hydraulic stuff, but in virtually any system imaginable. In hydraulic terms, the most simple variable element for creating a bottleneck is the valve. 



In the electrical world, the closest analog to the valve is the variable resistor - also called a ''potentiometer''.

Well, the transistor can behave as a variable resistor too, but unlike the mechanically controlled potentiometer, it's an electrically controlled one - the output collector-emitter(C-E) current can be controlled by the input base current or the base voltage, whichever suits us more.
So here comes the simple idea - if we apply a constant base voltage, we will set a constant C-E current. When the C-E voltage increases (e.g. due to decrease in voltage on the load resistor Rl) the C-E resistance will increase too (remember we set the C-E current to constant using a constant base voltage). So what do we get - a dynamic varying resistor which keeps a constant current flow. In short - ''a current-stable resistor''. Which is exactly what we need in order to make a constant current source.

====Sprinkle that with theory...====

[[FIle:Trans_output_va_2_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|240px|&lt;center&gt;IV curves (both RL and RT vary). &lt;br&gt; ''A nice and clear scheme to be added''&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Transistor_npn.svg|right|thumb|175px|&lt;center&gt;Transistor - an ''electronically'' controlled ''current'' bottleneck&lt;/center&gt;]]

This behaviour is shown on the IV diagram. They name it ''output characteristic'', because it represents the processes occurring at the output part of the transistor depending on changes in current or voltage. We can explain it by some ugly complex formulas found in thick textbooks on semiconductors, but we would rather think of it in a more user-friendly manner.

Imagine it as a mechanism with the '''I''' line acting as a &quot;fixed rail&quot; (representing the current which appears to be a constant), on which the crossing of the two &quot;pivots&quot; - '''Rl''' and '''Rt''' lines - point '''A''' slides. As we decrease the load resistance ('''Rl''' that is) point A slides down the '''Rl''' line, up the '''Rt''' line, and to the right on the '''I''' line. This means that the transistor resistance '''Rt''' increases, so the whole resistance of the circuit remains the same, and therefore the current flow remains the same. As we do the opposite - guess what - exactly the opposite things happen ;)

===The solution - based on team work===
[[File:Simplest_trans_current_source_whiteboard2_65b_lab3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Building the simplest BJT current source on the whiteboard.&lt;br&gt; ''A nice and clear scheme to be added''&lt;/center&gt;]]
As the saying goes, two heads are better then one. More than two are even more ;) The point here is, that great things in life, no matter how simple, are more often produced by a team effort, rather than a personal one.

So is the case with our solution. Let's present our team... 

In the middle, surrounded by a blue line is the &quot;boss&quot; of the circuit - the varying load resistor Rl. It's he who leads the concert, and the whole circuit is built for him - to satisfy his needs and desires for constant current. The nameless resistor just beneath the boss is his &quot;bodyguard&quot; - just in case someone curious moves the slider of the &quot;boss resistor&quot; to its very end and try to short-circuit the power source through the transistor.

Everything outside the blue line is the BJT current source itself - a whole team of elements working for the &quot;boss&quot;. There's the &quot;hero&quot; of the circuit - the workhorse - the mighty bipolar junction transistor (BJT), who does all the dirty job (donkey work :) of keeping the constant current. This is our ''bottleneck'' point, which determines how much current can pass through. Connected to its base is his &quot;manager&quot; (modern heroes need to have managers), the varying resistor (potentiometer) P, who is basically a varying voltage divider, and by the means of base voltage Vb tells the transistor what to do. In this case - using a constant base voltage the manager tells him to keep the current flow at a constant rate. The &quot;manager&quot; also has a &quot;bodyguard&quot; - Rb keeping the power source safe from short-circuit's caused by someone playing with the potentiometer P.

Then there are our watchful eyes - the voltmeter V2, used to keep an eye on the voltage drop on the load resistor (the boss), another voltmeter V1, watching over the voltage drop on the transistor's collector-emitter junction, and an ammeter, which gives us a sneak-peak on the current flow.

Last, but not least - the power source VCC, who brings the whole circuit to life :)

===Will the circuit pass its exams?===
Now, let's put our solution on the examination table and make some observations.

====What happens when we vary the load?====
.. we observe a change in V1 and V2, but no change in the ammeter. We're happy: the current flow is constant :) How did that happen?

When we increase the load resistance Rl so does its voltage drop, which can be seen on voltmeter V2 (logically simple - more resistance generates more pressure). As V2 shows an increment, V1 respectively shows a decrement (their sum represents the voltage of the power source Vcc). Since we made the transistor act as a current-stable resistor, it &quot;senses&quot; the decrement of the C-E voltage drop and obediently reduces its resistance, so the sum of resistances in the circuit branch remains the same. Therefore the current flow remains the same too.

When we decrease the load resistance, exactly the opposite happens (V2 shows a decrement, V1 shows an increment, the transistor rises its resistance, the sum of resistance remains the same, and so does the current flow).

====What happens when we vary the supply voltage?====
Well, that was quite easy, so let's try a more difficult test - we will vary the supply voltage.
Our expectations are that the current will remain constant, due to the fact that our &quot;manager&quot; (the potentiometer) keeps the ''bottleneck'' of the circuit at the same throughput level by applying constant voltage. 
Unfortunately, as we conduct the experiment we notice that the current changes... see you on the next exam session, constant current source, you've failed.

But what is the problem? Hence the power supply of the potentiometer - it's the one we changed in order to facilitate the examination, therefore we have also changed the bottleneck throughput. Our ''simplest current source'' fails this test, because we use the same power source for driving the transistor as well as for powering the whole circuit.

===The next step: adding a diode===
Our solution failed the last test, but is failure a bad thing?
It can be considered good, because it gives us the opportunity and motivation to improve our ideas and to move up the ladder.

Obviously, we need to drive our transistor with an independent power supply.
One way to do this is to use another voltage supply, dedicated entirely for this purpose. This is somewhat expensive solution, because it uses twice as much resources (two power supplies instead of one).

The more clever way of doing the trick would be to replace the ''voltage-divider circuit'' with a ''voltage-stabilizing one''.
This can be done by replacing the potentiometer with a diode (which is a voltage stabilizing element, as we all know) - an idea with more potential than you would first think of, because it's the way to go if you want to build the famous ''current mirror circuit''... which is a vast topic itself and it will be considered in another article of '''Circuit Idea'''.

If not mistaken 1 cup = 249 ml; so 1/3 cup is 80 ml; 2/3 cup would be 160 ml. [Unidentified author, pre-2009/Nov/7th]

Neither recipe indicates how many it serves.
The preamble, reciting history, is redundant with the history given on [[Beef Stroganoff|the main page]] about this dish; surely the Cookbook page should skip most of this and refer to that page for such material.  A sentence or two of background should suffice. [Eddy] [[Special:Contributions/84.215.6.188|84.215.6.188]] ([[User talk:84.215.6.188|talk]]) 18:26, 7 November 2009 (UTC)

A variation of this dish is to use Kangaroo instead of Beef; affectionately known as Kangastrog.

== Wrong Meat Wrong Mushrooms ==

Chuck or ground beef is not the way to make a good Beef Stroganoff; use sirloin or higher.  Although I never flour my beef pieces the original recipe does call for flouring.  The best way to make a strognaoff is found in the &quot;Great Dinner's from Life&quot; cookbook published in the early 70's.

One pound cubed sirloin
1 medium onion diced
8 oz FRESH mushrooms - small whole buttons are great, but hard to find in bulk mushrooms; if unable to find slice the normal size mushrooms.  I like a lot of mushrooms and typically  add more
1 tsp dry mustard - add water and let stand for at least 10 minutes, then add 1 tsp sugar
1 cup sour cream - more if you like it really soupy
Burgundy Wine to taste 
Salt and Pepper to taste

Serve over noodles or rice.

Do not use cream of mushroom soup, do not us canned mushrooms

== Wrong technique - saute, not stew ==

Stroganoff is designed as a saute, not a stew. The recipes here call for cooking up to an hour covered, for fully cooked/stewed meat. In a correct preparation, the meat is seared rare and reserved while the sauce is prepared separately. The two are combined at the end and warmed through before serving. The result is pieces of perfectly tender medium-rare (pink) steak in a rich sauce.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{message box|image=The GIMP icon - gnome.svg|message=This is ''just'' a '''convention'''!}}

This page is a manual of style for the [[GIMP]] book. This is just an outline that still misses many things. If you don't agree with something, then start a discussion on the talk page. Do that as well if you want to add something (base was created without any discussion).

== Naming Convention ==
=== Pages ===
# Never shorten the titles of pages (like in [[../Editing/]]), but rather use full names (like in [[../Selection Tools/]])

=== Images ===
# All images '''must''' begin with ''GIMP-''.
# All screenshots should be in PNG format. This assures high quality of these, because PNG is not a lossy format.
# If the image is on some topic than try to make all images really related (like in [[GIMP/Toolbox]] (you can see that all tools have something in common))

== Categorizing ==
'''Always''' put any images, pages and templates in [[:Category:GIMP]]

&lt;!-- Redirects should go to [[:Category:The GIMP - Redirects]]. --&gt;

== Images on pages ==
Try to put many, but not too much images. Also these should be placed well on page (again like in [[../Selection Tools/]]), possibly with some description. Images placed in the text should not be bigger than text (or not much bigger).

== Overall look ==
Pages should have some headlines, to make editing and reading easier. A great example of this are all tool pages.

== Shortcuts ==
If you're putting a shortcut on a page make it bold (instead of &quot;Ctrl&quot; use '''Ctrl'''(&lt;nowiki&gt;'''Ctrl'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)). If there is no shortcut ([[../Foreground Select/]]), make it italic. Do not make anything bold in tables.

== Navigation ==
Always put &lt;!-- &lt;s&gt;[[:Template:GIMP/Nav|this]]&lt;/s&gt; --&gt; [[:Template:Chapter_navigation|this]] template &lt;!-- &lt;s&gt;on the top&lt;/s&gt; and--&gt; at the bottom of the page. &lt;!-- &lt;s&gt;Description is on its page. Also put after/before that a line(&lt;nowiki&gt;----&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;/s&gt;--&gt;

== Comments ==
There are comments on some pages, which contain information from a newer, unstable version. These should be uncommented once the next stable series are out (i.e. 2.8 after 2.6).

Ever since Pierre-Simon Laplace envisioned the Hypothetical &quot;Laplace's Demon&quot; in 1814, an entity with infinite computing power that knows the exact location and velocity of every particle in the universe, there has been speculation that if one had such abilities, the past, present, and future of the universe can be predicted. However, there are limits to even this kind of knowledge, and it may very well be impossible for mankind to ever find the much sought-after &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;. Does Laplace's Demon hold proof of Predestination? Could it even exist? We will examine these questions shortly.

==Laplace's Demon and Predestination==
Let us assume, for one moment, that Laplace's Demon not only could exist, but it is real. The entity is sitting in a laboratory, doing computations, and feeding scientists data about the future of the universe. This scenario could be thought of as absolute proof that free will is an illusion, and that predestination rules the universe. As the Demon simulates particles ricocheting off of each other, forming atoms, cooling down, then gradually forming stars several billion years ago, it watches matter spin, gravity attract material; Earth forms, then life forms, then Humans slowly evolve, it predicts the chemical reactions going on inside our brains, it knows what we will do, what we will think, and what we will feel. For the processes of our brain are no different, no less certain than the boiling of water or the constant flickering of minute switches in the circuitry of a computer. Neurons fire, some adrenaline is released there, some dopamine here, and you get a human thought. What we perceive as free will is merely routine chemical processes occurring within our brains, and we are no more than clumps of matter floating around in the universe like the coldest space rock, as time moves only forward, and the universe expands outward. and nothing- nothing is uncertain in the mind of the Demon.

== A Counter to Laplace's Demon==
According to chemical engineer Robert Ulanowicz, in his 1986 book Growth and Development, Laplace's demon met its end with early 19th century developments of the concepts of irreversibility, entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics. In other words, Laplace's demon was based on the premise of reversibility and classical mechanics; thermodynamics, i.e. real processes, however, are, under current theory, thought to be irreversible. There has recently been proposed a limit on the computational power of the universe, specifically the ability of Laplace's Demon to process an infinite amount of information. The limit is based on the maximum entropy of the universe, the speed of light, and the minimum amount of time taken to move information across the Planck length, and the figure was shown to be about 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; bits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia: large numbers#Computers and computational complexity | &quot;Computational capacity of the universe&quot;]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, anything that requires more than this amount of data cannot be computed in the amount of time that has lapsed so far in the universe. So not only could Laplace's Demon in the literal sense never exist, but due to the second law of thermodynamics, its principle of predestination is also invalid.

Also, Laplace's Demon's knowledge is limited by the fact that it is in and of itself a part of the universe it is observing. To the question, &quot;Will you answer this question to be true or false?&quot;, Laplace's Demon can never accurately determine the answer. This is similar to trying to determine the truth of the statement, &quot;The next sentence is true. The previous sentence is false.&quot; Any object in the universe is limited in computing power by itself being a part of that universe, Therefore, it is impossible for the human mind to comprehend a true &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;.

== Elementary Chaos Theory ==
To predict whether a baseball heading towards a house will fall short, smash through the window, or pass overhead -- we look at the location and velocity of that baseball, and we can get a rough estimate of where it will land with a simple estimate.
With a bit more information about the wind, we can get an even better estimate of where it will land. There are infinite other factors, for example, the tiny aerodynamic imperfections of the surface of the ball, the gravity of the ball and all objects surrounding it, and other such data that each subtly contribute to the velocity and impact site of the ball, and when they all add together, they can change the trajectory of the ball drastically.

Some kinds of uncertainty are &quot;linear&quot; -- if my measurement of the horizontal velocity of the baseball is 10% too low, then the baseball will probably land about 10% further than my estimate.
Other kinds of uncertainty are &quot;exponentially growing&quot; (&quot;deterministic chaos&quot;).

==Conclusion==
In spite of all these things, we can still learn something from Laplace's Demon. For example, the more data that you have about the universe, the more accurate and long range your predictions can be. According to chaos theory, very small factors can alter and influence large and complex systems over time. A butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon could potentially cause a hurricane in the Gulf coast a week later; e.g. the &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot;. However, the more &quot;butterflies&quot; you factor in, the longer the range of your weather predictions could be. Perhaps, one day a vast network of quantum computers, being fed data about micro-climate systems across the planet and planetary systems, the temperature over all regions of the sun, and other data, long-range interplanetary weather- forecasting may not be impossible. However, humans will never be able to predict the future state of the universe accurately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro==
An oscillator is a circuit which generates a repetitive electric signal of given waveform (for example a sinewave).

==Electronic Oscillation==
Electronic Oscillator is an electronics circuit that generates oscillation when circuit is in resonance a natural process when all the frequency components cancel out . Commonly found in LC and RC Phase Shift 

In electronics, oscillation occurs when the following conditions are met
* Output voltage is equal to input voltage and inverted
* The Phase Angle difference between input and output voltage must be 180

===Passive Oscillation===
With Series LC or Parallel LC . At Resonance, the frequency dependent components will cancel out ie impedance of inductor will cancel impedance of capacitor &lt;math&gt;Z_L + Z_C = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ω
:;&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since ω = 2πf therefore
:;f = 1/2π&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

This frequency is called Resonance Frequency and usually denoted as f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;

At Resonance Frequency
:&lt;math&gt;V_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V_L - Z_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V_C = - Z_L&lt;/math&gt;

The voltage of the series LC keeps oscillating between inductor's voltage and capacitor's voltage between phase angle 0 - 180

;In LC circuit, oscillation occurs at the resonance frequency
:;f = 1/2π&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Active Oscillation===
====Fixed Frequency Oscialltor====
For active cicuit, to meet the requirement for oscillation require 
:An Inverter that has output voltage equals to input voltage and inverted . So any Transistor or Op Amp Amplifier can be configured to act as an Inverter

:A Feedback circuit between input and output that provides 180 degree difference in phase angle . This can be achieved through Resonant Tuned LC circuit or three stage of RC Phase Shift with each stage has a phase shift of 60

For Resonant Tuned LC circuit, the oscialltion frequency is equal to the resonant frequency
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2π&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

When choosing the value of &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt; in power of 10 so that &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;-½n&lt;/sup&gt; then the oscillating frequency can be calculated by
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-½n&lt;/sup&gt;


For RC Phase Shift
:; Tanθ = 1/2π f &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{RC}&lt;/math&gt;
:; Tan 60 = Sin 60 / Cos 60 = &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} {\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the frequency change through phase change is
:f = 1/2π  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3} \frac{1}{RC}&lt;/math&gt;

When choosing the value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{CR}&lt;/math&gt; in power of 10 so that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{CR}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;-n&lt;/sup&gt; then the oscillating frequency can be calculated by
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.33 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-n&lt;/sup&gt;

====Variable Frequency Oscialltor====
Variable Frequency Oscialltor can be achieved through inverter with feedback circuit of 
* 2 series inductors L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel to one capacitor C
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2π &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{(L_1 + L_2)C}}&lt;/math&gt;

* 2 series capacitors C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel to one inductor L
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2π &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{(C_1 + C_2)L}}&lt;/math&gt;

* 2 series capacitors C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel to a tuned LC

==Electro-Mechanical Oscillation==
===Crystal Oscillator===
A '''crystal oscillator''' is an [[electronic circuit]] that uses the mechanical [[resonance]] of a vibrating [[crystal]] of [[Piezoelectricity#Materials|piezoelectric material]] to create an electrical signal with a very precise [[frequency]].
:;f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = n f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;

Hello, I am dudemeister1234, a 13 year old male wikibooks contributer. All articles that I create or edit I will provide links to on this page, and copies of my sandbox pages will be posted as well.

Here's a little thing I'm writing right now:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CAVEAT Needed'''

A caveat is needed on the last block of solutions that warns readers that the code will not compile because of ambiguity between the code in the solution and that in Prelude.

=== Other recursive functions ===

&lt;nowiki&gt;:(&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This is no good to a learner (like myself) &amp;mdash; the solution for the log2 problem:

&lt;pre&gt;
log2 1 = 0
log2 n = 1 + log2 (n `div` 2) -- the &quot;`&quot; make div into infix notation
&lt;/pre&gt;

Ok, so when was I supposed to have read about `div` and infix notation?  The central challenge to the problem should be thinking about a recursive definition of a logarithm, but instead it turns out to be a trick question about syntax that hasn't been discussed yet, and isn't discussed now.

I had written the right function definition, but had no idea about `div` until coming here after wasting a bunch of time trying to figure out how to use &quot;/&quot;, silly me.  

What does that explanation even mean?  It's frustrating, and uninformative.  I understand it's an 'advanced' question, but it's only advanced because it asks about stuff I would have no way of knowing, unless I just peek back here.</text>

== Rules and Guidelines ==

Here is a short list of general guidelines that you should follow when starting a new book. You don't ''need'' to follow these, but it's in the best interest of your books long-term development to do so:

;Plan every step of the book creation process as if you aren't going to be around to implement it: Wikibooks is like a hobby at best, an idle waste of time for most people. Real life can and will get in the way of your work here at Wikibooks. Even if you don't leave forever, you may take some time off. You'll get sick, or go to school, or work late hours, or have events to do with your family. Your ISP will shutdown your internet connection and a tornado will ruin a fiber optic cable down the road. Trust me, you won't always be able to be here.
:With that information in mind, make sure that you lay out your plans and your intentions in a way that other people will be able to follow in your absence. Explain your actions, leave notes, use discussion pages. Expect that anything on your TO-DO list will be done by somebody else.

;New contributors will be discouraged by tasks that are too large:New users want to be able to start small, and work up to larger tasks as their confidence improves over time. Make sure your book contains lots of foot-holds where new users can make meaningful contributions without getting in over their heads. Stub pages are very important in this regard. Make sure every page in your book contains at least a rough outline and ideally a small amount of text showing what kinds of material that page should contain. Include some links to Wikipedia articles, or links to other resources to give contributors an idea of exactly what the page should contain. If users see a book with a long TOC composed entirely of redlinks, they won't know what everything means and where everything should go and they will get discouraged. If your book is too bad for too long, it is liable to get deleted for this very reason: In certain stages of development a book is more of a hindrance then a help to new contributors.

;Don't be too ambitious:If you plan a book that's too large for one person to finish, you will fail to finish it. 

;Save early, save often:This is more of a general rule about wikis and is not specific to writing a new book. However, it's an important rule. Save your work often, so that you don't lose much in a freak accident and so readers/reviewers can look at your contributions and help to identify--and correct--problems.

;Use the {{tlx|New Book}} and {{tlx|Subject}} templates:It may seem like a small thing, but using these two templates on your book helps to ensure that it gets registered by the system and can be found by new readers. If people can't find your book, they won't read it and it will be worthless.</text>

Thank you for starting
[[A Lecture on the Limits of Human Knowledge]].
I look forward to reading future versions of it.

Is this intended to focus on theoretical ultimate limits?
Or do you want people to also add information about things that we don't yet know,
but there seems to be no reason we couldn't figure it out in a few years?

I noticed your comment on [[User:Herbythyme]]'s talk page and figured I'd drop you a short welcome message. The links above should get you started. See [[Help:Contents]] for our gateway to the help pages. Let us know if you have trouble finding anything. Our help and project pages aren't quite as accessible as they could be and any hints as to what newcomers are hoping to find would help. Happy editing! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:37, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

==Silesian!?==
It seems to me that the former version was kinda polish dialect, and not Silesian (Schlesisch)?&lt;br&gt;
What do you mean? &lt;br&gt;
Having taken the Silesians land - by robbing and expelling them - was it not enough? &lt;br&gt;
Do you still have to abuse and distort the terms to make them fit?&lt;br&gt;
And why does wikipedia help them to do so, by approving this fraud!? &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following are the steps required to set up a Revit MEP 2009 project utilizing a linked
architectural file. These instructions are slightly different than what was required for a 2008
project and changed significantly in the 2010 version with the ribbon interface. 


'''1-Linking an Architectural Revit model'''

Save architectural Revit model(s) on the server in the appropriate job folder. If the file name
ends with &quot;Central&quot;, rename it. For example, if the file name is 4567 Office Arch Central.rvt,
rename it to 4567 Office Arch.rvt.

1. Open the architectural file(s). Before clicking open, check the Detach from Central
option. Accept any warning prompt that appears.

2. Once the file is open, go to File --&gt; Purge Unused…

3. Click on Check All then click OK.

4. Save and close the file.

5. Start a new project.

6. Go to File --&gt; Import/Link --&gt; Revit…

7. Browse for the Revit building model file. Before clicking Open, check the Origin to
Origin option. Click Open.


'''2-Copy/Monitor Levels'''

1. Once the file is open, double-click on one of the default elevation views within the Project
Browser if not already selected.

2. Zoom (Zoom Region - ZR) into the edge of the building where it shows the Levels
(typically on the right hand side of the elevation view).

3. Go to Tools —&gt; Copy/Monitor —&gt; Select Link (or Click the Copy/Monitor toolbar
button and click Select Link.)

4. Select the building model by left-clicking on any part of it. In the Design bar (on the left),
the Copy/Monitor mode is activated.

5. In the Copy/Monitor menu, click Options. The default options can remain as they are but
can be edited as needed. Close Copy/Monitor Options.

6. In the Copy/Monitor menu, click Copy.

7. Individually click on each level of the building model. Allow time for Revit to process the
information after each click. Accept any warnings that may appear.

8. Click Finish Mode in the Design Bar to close the Copy/Monitor menu


'''3-Creating floor plans'''

1. Go to View —&gt; New… —&gt; Floor Plan…

2. In the New Plan dialog box, the levels that you copied in the previous steps should be
listed. Select each one and click OK. Floor plans default to 1:100 but can be changed
Revit MEP 2009 Project Setup revitgarage.com
if needed.

3. By default, Revit sets these new floor plans up as Architectural plans. In the Project
Browser, expand the Architectural heading and you’ll see the new plans that you just
created.


'''4-Copy/Monitor Grids'''

Copying grids allows you to stretch the grid lines and bubbles in your plans, sections, and
elevations to fit your sheet views. It also allows you to monitor any changes to the grid layout.
Once you copy grids, you will then need to turn off the linked architectural/structural grid lines.

1. Switch to a plan view.

2. Go to Tools —&gt; Copy/Monitor —&gt; Select Link (or Click the Copy/Monitor toolbar
button and click Select Link.) Select the building model by left-clicking on any part of it.
In the Design bar (on the left), the Copy/Monitor mode is activated.

3. In the Copy/Monitor menu, click Copy.

4. Individually click on each grid line of the building model. Allow time for Revit to process
the information after each click. Accept any warnings that may appear.

5. Click Finish Mode in the Design Bar to close the Copy/Monitor menu.

6. Within each floor plan that was created in the previous section, you will need to turn off
the grids within the linked architectural/structural file(s).

7. To do this, go to Visibility Graphics (VG) and click on the Revit Links tab.

8. Next to the link name click on By Host View and click the button next to Custom.

9. Next, click on the Annotation Categories tab.

10.Click on the list box and change &lt;By Host View&gt; to &lt;Custom&gt;

11.Scroll down the list of annotation categories and uncheck Grids.

12.Click Ok twice to exit out of Visibility Graphics.


'''5-Enable Room Bounding'''

Beginning in Revit MEP 2009, rooms are no longer required to be copy/monitored. Instead, room
bounding elements are automatically carried into the MEP model when the architectural file is
linked in. In order for these room boundaries to be “activated”, you must manually change a
setting.

1. Click on the linked architectural model and to go Element Properties.

2. In the Element Properties dialog box, click on Edit/new…

3. Under Constraints, check the box next to “Room Bounding”.

4. Click OK to close the properties dialog boxes.


'''6-Adding Spaces &amp; Space Tags'''

The concept of Spaces was introduced in Revit MEP 2009. Spaces allow for the engineer/designer
to have control over how a building’s interior volumes are calculated in building analysis software.
Therefore, in order to tag a room, a Space must first be placed within the room bounding area.
Placing Spaces can be a somewhat complex task to create them correctly. I will walk through a
basic space application but will not go into the process any further in these instructions. Once
spaces are placed, Space Tags can then be placed on each Space (room).
Revit MEP 2009 Project Setup revitgarage.com

1. In the mechanical design bar, click on Space.

2. In the Type Selector bar, set the Upper Limit and Offset. For example, if you are placing
a Space on Level 1, you’d set the Upper limit to Second floor with an Offset of 0.0m. Also,
to automatically tag the space when it is placed, be sure to check the “Tag on placement”
box.

3. Next, place the cursor over a room and an “X” will appear within the room boundary
(which will be high-lighted in green).

4. Click within the room to place the Space.

5. A Space will be placed within the room boundary and tagged with a Space Tag.
Optional - The Space Tag included with Revit MEP tags the Space with the Space Name
and Space Number. In order for the tag to display the architect’s room name and number,
the tag must be modified.

6. Click on the Space Tag and click the Edit Family button.

7. Within the Space Tag family, click on “Space Name” and then click the Edit Label…
button.

8. In the Edit Label dialog box, click on the Name “Label Parameter” and click the remove
button.

9. From the Category Parameters list, select Room Name and click the add button.

10. Follow the same procedure for the Space Number (replace it with the Room Number
parameter).

Update: There is now a external tool that will automatically rename the space names and
numbers to match the room names and numbers. By using this tool, you can use the OTB
(out of the box) Space Tag. Note: The Space Naming Utility is only available to Autodesk
Subscription members.


'''7-Creating the Central File'''

At this point, the project file has been set up and is ready to be saved to the project server as
the Central File.

1. Go to File --&gt;Worksets… Click Ok in the Worksharing dialog box.
The Worksets dialog box will then appear showing the two default worksets. Click OK.
(After clicking OK, Revit MEP will update the file and enable worksharing. This may take
some time, so be patient).

2. Once the worksharing process is complete, Go to File —&gt; Save As. Click on the
Options… button and verify that Make this the Central location after save option is
checked. (It may already be checked and grayed out which is okay). Click OK.

3. Save the file in the appropriate project folder and name it in the following format:

Project#)-(Project Name)-MEP(version #) Central.rvt

For example: 5432-Office Building MEP09 Central.rvt

This format will allow the local file creation script to work properly)

4. Close the Central file.


'''8-Creating a local File'''

1. Create a project folder within your Revit Local Files folder (if not already created)

2. Create a new local file.

3. Open the local file.


'''9-Setting up MEP Floor Plans'''

In previous steps, floor plans were created based on the levels that were Copied/Monitored.
When these plans were created, they defaulted to an Architectural discipline. In order to create
plans for the MEP disciplines (Mechanical, Plumbing, Power, Lighting, Systems, Fire Protection)
you must duplicate the Architectural plans and change their discipline settings. Prior to
duplicating the architectural plans, make sure all spaces are placed and tagged, views are
cropped as required, and grid bubbles are adjusted. Otherwise, you'll be doing these things in all
of MEP you are getting ready to create. It is much more efficient to do it once than multiple
times.

1. To create a MEP floor plan, right-click on the appropriate floor plan in the project browser
and choose the Duplicate with Detailing option (this will copy the space tags).

2. When you duplicate a floor plan, the plan will be named Copy of Level 1, for example.

3. Right-Click on the duplicated floor plan and select Properties…

4. Set the Discipline and Sub-Discipline for the duplicated floor plan as required. If a Sub-
Discipline you need isn't listed, you can type one in.

5. After you set the Discipline and Sub-Discipline, the floor plan will automatically be moved
into a new location within the Project Browser base on those settings.

6. Right-Click on the new floor plan and select Rename. To simplify things, name the view
how you want it to appear in the plan title on the plot sheet. For example, a first floor
mechanical plan could be named FIRST FLOOR MECHANICAL PLAN.

7. Follow this procedure for any MEP plan you wish to create.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;Hi there!  My name is Jessie, and I happily claim the titles of 'Certifiably Insane' and ‘Trekkie’.&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#CC6300&quot;&gt;My life is equally as insane as I am.  I live in Virginia Beach . . . though I haven’t actually been to said beach in several years; too many TTT’s (Tourists in Tacky T-shirts).&lt;/font&gt;

[[File:Onoz &amp; Omg.gif]]

&lt;font color=&quot;#B048B5&quot;&gt;I am beyond addicted to my television, and can often be found watching&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#4863A0&quot;&gt;NCIS,&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#C7A317&quot;&gt;Star Trek,&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#00FF00&quot;&gt;CSI:  New York,&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#EE9A4D&quot;&gt;or CSI:  Miami.&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;font color=&quot;B048B5&quot;&gt;I’m also addicted to Harry Potter, though you really don’t want to take me to the movies with you . . . I happen to be that one person who keeps saying, “. . . but it didn’t happen that way in the book!”&lt;/font&gt;

[[File:800px-Harry Potter Chibi.jpg]]


&lt;font color=&quot;#CC0066&quot;&gt;Now books are another story.  My favorites include:  The House of Night novels, Twilight, The Princess Diaries, and Diary of A Wimpy Kid.&lt;/font&gt;



&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot;&gt;I also happen to be one of those people your mother warned you about . . . you know . . . the Music Major?  She was right, we’re all nuts.&lt;/font&gt;

[[File:Squirel Waving.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;




&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#2554C7&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

[[File:Post.gif]]


&lt;font color=&quot;#C45AEC&quot;&gt;Over the years I’ve thought about the many things that I wanted to do with my life; but one thing was always present in the ever changing list, to be a Music Teacher.  As I worked towards that goal, I’ve had many people ask me why I wanted to become a Teacher rather than a Performer.  After thinking about the question for some time, I came up with many answers such as,&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font color=&quot;#3EA99F&quot;&gt;“It’s easier to get a job as a Music Teacher straight out of college,”&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font color=&quot;#C45AEC&quot;&gt;and,&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font color=&quot;#667C26&quot;&gt;“Performers are a dime a dozen.”&lt;/font&gt;  

&lt;font color=&quot;#C45AEC&quot;&gt;But somewhere along the way I found the answer that would make my own Music Teachers proud,&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font color=&quot;#F76541&quot;&gt;“I love music, and wish nothing more than to be involved within it for the rest of my life.  I want to be able to pass on my love of music to the many children I might encounter teaching, in hopes that at least one of them will come to love music as much, if not more, as I do.”&lt;/font&gt;  

&lt;font color=&quot;#C45AEC&quot;&gt;It is my greatest wish that I might be able to do as I dream.  As for becoming a concert pianist?  Who knows, it could still happen.&lt;/font&gt;




&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#2554C7&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Educational Philosophy&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

[[File:Post.gif]]


&lt;font color=&quot;#339900&quot;&gt;It is my belief that a teacher is many things.  A teacher is a freind, a mentor, a leader, an enemy, and a guidepost.  A teacher should play both good cop and bad cop when needed.  They should also encourage students towards the future, and aid them in any way they can.

A teacher is not a baby sitter.  It is not a teachers job to teach children how to behave in public.  Instead, it is their job to present an appropriate image for students to associate with the basic standards they have learned from their parents.  

A teacher is not the only teacher that is important either.  A parent is likely the most important teacher in a students life.  Other teachers may be a church leader, an older sibling, your relatives, the neighbors . . . just about anyone they may ever encounter.  It is every single persons job to be an example for the students in this world.

As a parting note, a student is not simply a young child, there are many students and their ages span the entire life span.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</text>

;'''Tudo bem?''' - how are you? (lit. Everything well?)
:'''tudo''' - everything
:'''bem''' - well

;Obrigado (-a) - Thank you (G1)

;Também - also, too

;estou - conjugation of &quot;estar&quot; (G2)

;Tchau - bye!

==Introducing Yourself==
{| border = 0 width=45% bgcolor = &quot;F5E1DE&quot;
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''João''': Olá. Qual é seu nome?
|-

'''Maria''': Maria. E o seu?
|-

'''João''': Sou João. Tchau, Maria!
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''Maria''': Tchau, João!
|}

;'''Qual é o seu nome?''' - What is your name?
:'''Qual''' - which
:'''é''' - is (you'll see this further in chapter 2)
:'''nome''' - (masc.) name
;Seu - Yours (Masc.)
;Sou - I am

''The question'' Qual é seu nome? ''may also be answered as'' Meu nome é ... '', meaning &quot;My name is...&quot;'.'

''Be careful not to mix um &quot;seu&quot; and &quot;sou.&quot; ''

=Pronunciation=

''(Don't worry about learning the meaning of these words just yet. You'll learn them later on. Just focus on the pronunciation for now.)
''

==Nasal vowels in Portuguese== 
Unlike its close neighbor, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese makes great use of nasal vowels. You probably observed this in the words bom, bem, também, and João.  Listen to the nasal vowels and try to imitate the native speaker:
	
:am, an, ã - amplo (ample), fantástico (fantastic), maçã (apple)
:em, en - exemplo (example), entrar (to enter)
:im, in - íntimo (intimate)
:on - onda (wave)
:um - um (one)

Be careful, though. If the m or n is followed by another vowel, the sound is not nasal:

:amigo, caneta
:eminente, enimigo
:imitar, menina
:onífero
:unilateral

==The Tilde and Ç==
Portuguese has five accents: the acúte, the gràve, the circumflêx, the çedille, and the tilde (~). The accents will all be explained as they appear. Let's take a look at the trickiest one for foreigners to pronounce: the tilde. The tilde can only appear in the following combinations: ã, ãe, ães, ão, ãos, ões. They are usually preceded by the c-cedille (ç), or ''cê-cedilha''. The cedille is only found in this form. Examples are maçã, ação, ações. Try to imitate the native speaker (the following words are in the singular and followed by the plural):

:maçã, maçãs
:cidadão, cidadãos
:aviãos, aviãos
:mãe, mães

|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;Bom dia!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;Boa noite!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}

;Bom dia
:used in the mornings, even if, after waking up, even if the sun is not out
;Boa tarde
:used in the afternoons (literally after noon) until the sun sets
;Boa noite
:used after sunsets until one goes to sleep


Those time-specific greetings should only be used in those times; for greetings that are not time-specific, use the following:


'''Olá''' -a formal hello, usually to someone of a higher rank, an elderly person, or someone to whom you wish to show more respect

'''Oi''' - an informal hello, used among children and teenagers, friends, or those substantially younger than you


To dismiss yourself, simply say '''Tchau'''. Despite sounding informal, there is no formal equivalent of it.


==Pronouns==

The Portuguese pronouns are as follows:

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Pronouns|Pronomes|Subject Pronouns|2}}
! Eu (I)
! Nós (We)
|-
! Você (You)
! Vocês (You - plural)
|-
! Ele (He)
! Eles (They - masculine or mixed)
|-
! Ela (He)
! Elas (They - feminine)
|}

Be careful: Eles can either refer to a group of various masculine nouns or a group of mixed masculine and feminine nouns. Elas can only refer to a purely feminine group.

==Exercises==

'''A.''' How would you greet someone at the following times of the day?

#7h00
#13h30
#10h45
#12h00
#20h30

'''B.'''

#How would you greet an executive officer, not considering of the time of day?
#How would you greet a friend at any time?
#Or a young person?
#Or an elderly lady in the afternoon?


'''C.''' What pronoun would you use to describe the following groups of people?

=Grammar=
==Gender==

Words in Portuguese are either masculine or feminine. The general rules are presented below, with examples:

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Genders| | |4}}
|bgcolor = &quot;#349843&quot;| Masculine
|
|bgcolor = &quot;#349843&quot;| Feminine
|
|-
! &quot;o&quot; ending
! fato, pato, livro
! &quot;a&quot; ending
! janela, geladeira, pera
|-
! &quot;ão&quot; ending
! chão, pão, refrão
! &quot;ão&quot; ending (less)
! visão, ação, mão
|-
! consonant ending
! lápis, ônibus
! &quot;dade&quot; or &quot;gem&quot; ending
! idade, viagem
|}

Adjectives always have to agree with their noun, which is why you see the difference between ''bom'' and ''boa'' in ''bom dia'', ''boa noite'', and so on.

There is only one word in Portuguese that changes gender with the speaker is thank you. If you're male, say ''obrigado.'' If you're female, say ''obrigada.'' This rule still applies if you turn down an offer (&quot;No, thanks&quot;): ''Não, obrigado'' and ''Não, obrigada.''

==Estar==
There are two verbs that stand for &quot;to be&quot; in Portuguese: ''ser'' and ''estar''. Each one is used in different cases, and they are not interchangeable. Let's take a look at the uses of ''estar'' (you'll see ser in [[Theunixgeek/Brazilian Portuguese/Chapter 2 | chapter 2]]).


{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Usage|Estar|To Be (situational)|1}}
! Location
|-
! Feelings
|-
! Present Conditions
|-
! Present Appearances
|-
! Civil Status
|-
! Auxiliary in the Present Continuous
|}

Here is its conjugation:

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Verb|Estar|To Be (situational)|2}}
! Eu estou
! Nós estamos
|-
! Você está
! Vocês estão
|-
! Ele/Ela está
! Eles/Elas estão
|}


An example of ''estar'' that was used in the dialogue was &quot;estou bem,&quot; meaning &quot;I'm well.&quot; Note how the verb is being used to express a present condition that at another point may change - &quot;não estou bem&quot; means &quot;I'm not well.&quot; Keep in mind that this negation can also be used with other verbs.

Now, you may be wondering how come the second person in Brazilian Portuguese (but not in European Portuguese) is conjugated just like the third person. That's because ''você'' evolved from the now-archaic ''Vossa mercê'', meaning &quot;your mercy&quot;, as a polite form of &quot;you&quot;. In Portugal, ''você'' is only used in extremely formal situations, while in Brazil it is used both formally and informally.

An interesting aspect of the verb ''estar'' is the fact that is developing into another verb - ''tar'' - in colloquial speech. Many teachers of Portuguese even consider that in the future ''tar'' will be the accepted form of the verb and ''estar'' will be considered archaic. It's relatively simple; the &quot;es-&quot; in the beginning of the verb is removed from all the conjugations (eu estou - eu tou; você/ele está - você/ele tá, etc.).

Whenever you go to a Brazilian party, you're sure to find [[Cookbook:Brigadeiro | brigadeiros]], small balls of fudge placed on a little paper holder. This dessert is extremely popular throughout the whole country.

'''Portuguese in Daily Life:''' Should someone offer you a brigadeiro, what would you say to accept the offer (be sure to change it depending on your gender)? How would you decline the offer?

      <text xml:space="preserve">At high frequencies, or more specifically when the wavelength is small compared to other geometrical features, sound behaves as if it travels along rays, just like light rays. A flashlight beam is a good example of a bundle of light rays. This aspect of wave behavior is called geometrical optics because one can analyze things (such as telescope mirrors) by geometrically tracing rays, rather than solving a wave equation.</text>

=Why Learn Portuguese?=

Portuguese is a Romance language spoken by 240 million people - more than the number of German, Italian, and Polish speakers combined! It is the 7th most-spoken language in the world. It is very closely related to other Romance languages such as [[Spanish]], [[Catalan]], [[Italian]], and [[French]]. Most Portuguese speakers are located in Brazil, although large numbers of Portuguese speakers are also found in Angola, Mozambique, as well as in other places in Africa and Asia.

Portuguese is considered a Category I language, meaning it is relatively easy for English speakers to pick up. As you'll see, Portuguese does carry a few similarities to English.

In this course, you'll learn Brazilian Portuguese, which is different in some aspects of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation from other dialects of Portuguese.

Don't be overwhelmed by accented letters in the language - keep in mind that the Portuguese language has actually been '''simplified''' over the years (provàvelmente - provavelmente; diccionário - dicionário; idéia - ideia; ambìgüidade - ambiguidade). It has actually lost an accent: the trema, which used to be used as ü, and the grave accent, which used to denote secondary stresses, today only appears as à in only one specific case.

=How to Use the Lessons=

The language lessons in this textbook are made to be followed in a certain manner to ensure full absorption of the content. Be sure to follow these steps:

# Look over what will be presented in the lesson. Keep it in mind as you move along.
# Listen to the dialogue or text reading provided; you might not understand it completely at first, but keep in mind that you will by the end of the lesson.
# Repeat the speakers as you move along in the pronunciation section. You'll be presented with vocabulary at this time. 
# Complete all of the vocabulary exercises provided.
# Read the grammar section and try to understand it thoroughly. If you have any doubts, feel free to ask about them in the Discussion section (the tab at the top) of the page.
# Complete the grammar exercises.
# Listen to the dialogue again. You'll be surprised at how much you've learned.
# Complete all the review exercises.

=Editing the Course=
This course was very carefully planned. Do not make any modifications to the overall structure of the book and the order that the content is presented unless you find it absolutely necessary. Remember to keep the book well-illustrated! Illustrations help to fixate things in memory. Do not feel hesitated, however, to contribute to the book. After all, that's what Wikibooks is there for!

This book follows many of the guidelines displayed in the [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] Wikibook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In trick-taking games, activity is centered around ''tricks''. A trick starts by one player''leading'' a card (or rarely more than one card), i.e. putting it face up in the middle of the table. Other players put additional cards face up on top until the trick is over. One player ''wins'' the trick according to certain rules. The following general rules are common to the large majority of modern trick-taking games and need not be mentioned when describing a specific game.

==General rules of trick-taking games==
Players sit around a table or other space so as to form a circular order.
The game is played either ''clockwise'' or ''counter-clockwise'', according to whether the &quot;next&quot; player or &quot;following&quot; player is considered to be the one to the left or right of the &quot;previous&quot; player. The game is organized into ''deals'', which have the following structure.

One player, called the ''dealer'', shuffles the cards face down and presents the deck face down to the previous player for cutting. The previous player can either trust the dealer (often signalled by knocking on the deck), or ''cut'' it by taking off three or more cards, putting them on the table, and putting the remaining three or more cards on top.

The dealer then takes a prescribed number of cards from the top of the deck and places them face down in front of the next player, who is also known as ''eldest hand''. (Eldest hand is also known as ''elder hand'' in two-player games and as ''forehand'' in games of German origin.) The dealer proceeds to give the same number of cards to the player following forehand, and so on, and finally takes the same number of cards for themselves. This procedure is repeated until all players have the required number of cards. E.g. the dealer might deal 8 cards ''in batches of'' 3–2–3, i.e. give 3 cards to each in the first round, 2 in the second, and 3 in the last. If the game rules do not specify batch size, or offer several possibilities, the dealer has free choice but must not change the method during the game. Any remaining cards form the ''stock''. Once the dealer has finished dealing, all players take up their cards. (Taking them up earlier is illegal or merely bad etiquette, depending on the game.) The players hold their cards so that no other player can see them.

After dealing there is often a phase in which some details of the rules of trick-play are determined. Sometimes this is done by turning the next card from the stock face up to determine a trump suit. Sometimes there are many more possibilities, and the decision happens by means of formalized negotiations that are known as ''bidding'' or ''auction''.

Regardless of what happened in the bidding phase, if any, forehand leads to the first trick. In subsequent tricks, the player who won the previous trick leads.
The player who leads to the trick plays out one card, i.e. puts it face up on the surface between the players. The next player also plays one card, and so on, until everybody has contributed. The suit of the first card is the ''suit led''. Each subsequent player must ''follow suit'', i.e. play a card of the suit led, if they have such a card. Otherwise they must ''trump'' (play a card of the trump suit; in this context this only makes sense if the suit led wasn't the trump suit) or ''discard'' (play a card of a different suit that is not trump).
At any stage the player who contributed the highest trump is said to ''head'' the trick. If there are no trumps in a trick, the player who played the highest card of the suit led heads the trick. The player who heads the trick after the last card has been played to it wins the trick, takes the cards and places them face down in front of themselves, on top of any other, previously won tricks.

Once everybody is without cards, the deal ends and players count their trick points. Methods for this vary strongly between games, but two major methods are counting tricks and counting point-values of cards. The trick points translate into points for the overall score according to rules that depend on the game and possibly on other parameters such as what happened in the bidding phase.

Eldest hand becomes the dealer for the next deal. The game is typically played for a number of deals (divisible by the number of players) or until one player has reached a certain target score.

==Partnerships==
Many games are for 4 players in fixed partnerships. In this case partners always sit crosswise. 
In some games there are partnerships that vary from deal to deal, often depending on the outcome of the bidding phase. In such games all players stay in their original position.

Partners will inevitably form conjectures on each other's cards based on observations of the cards that the partner plays or how high the partner bid if there is a bidding phase. However, with very few exceptions it is not allowed to consciously pass on information to the partner using any kind of codes, sign language etc.

==2-phase trick-play==
In a ''2-phase trick-taking game'', the first trick-play phase is as described above, but with two important differences:
#The player who has won a trick takes up a card from the stock, and the other players do the same in the usual order.
#Players are completely free in what card they can play out. In particular they need not follow suit.
It follows that players always have the same number of cards in their hands when playing to a trick. The second rule is a pragmatic consequence of the first: If a player does not follow suit in this phase, this is very hard, and often impossible, to detect.

The second trick-play phase starts when the stock has been reduced to strictly fewer cards than the number of players. (In many games it is empty at that stage.) It is played according to the ordinary, unchanged rules of trick-play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Interfacing to other programs via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model COM] can be easily done in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java] using the [http://sf.net/projects/jacob-project JACOB] library. However coping with all the low-level interface when talking to an application is quite tedious. Especially since the interface is designed for C not for Java, not to mention Clojure. So we will try to improve the situation a little bit using the power of Clojure.

== Basic Interface ==

Let's start with a simple example. We start Excel, make the instance visible. Then we shutdown the whole system again.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
  (import '(com.jacob.com Dispatch
                          ComThread))

  (def xl (new Dispatch &quot;Excel.Application&quot;))
  (Dispatch/put xl &quot;Visible&quot; true)
  (Dispatch/call xl &quot;Quit&quot;)
  (ComThread/Release)
&lt;/source&gt;

The ugliness of the interface should be immediately visible. We have to call a C interface through Java. So let's wrap the &quot;Visible&quot; call.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
  (defn excel-application-visible
    ([xl]
     ; No argument? Return the current value.
     (Dispatch/get xl &quot;Visible&quot;))
    ([xl v]
     ; Argument given? Set it as new value.
     (Dispatch/put xl &quot;Visible&quot; v)))

  (excel-application-visible xl true)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is much better. We have hidden away the low-level interface behind a simple Clojure function call. Now we have to wrap all the properties and function calls into such functions. But wait! Up to now, this was nothing special. Just a function call. Clojure can save us some work here.

== Functions of First Class ==

Defining a few functions to wrap the interface quickly shows a lot of repetition. Take the previous example: we pass-in the Excel instance and maybe a value and call the underlying interface accordingly. But this is always the same task. So we can put this functionality into a driver function and use partial evaluation to create the wrapper function.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
  (defn property-driver
    ([prop xl]
     (Dispatch/get xl prop))
    ([prop xl v]
     (Dispatch/put xl prop v)))

  (def excel-application-visible (partial property-driver &quot;Visible&quot;))

  (excel-application-visible xl true)
&lt;/source&gt;

So what happens here? We define a new function which is also parametrized by the property name. Then we use the built-in &lt;code&gt;partial&lt;/code&gt; to create a specialized function, which is specialized to act on the &quot;Visible&quot; property. So &lt;code&gt;partial&lt;/code&gt; has a function as return value.

== Macros ==

Now we have a set of wrappers to hide away the low-level interface. But what about the last instruction in the first example: &lt;code&gt;(ComThread/Release)&lt;/code&gt;? Well, this is needed to clean up the COM side and has to be called in each thread, which used COM. This can get especially tedious when faced with exceptions. To get rid of the low-level handling, we use another part of Clojure's power: macros!

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
  (defn with-excel*
    [thunk]
    (let [worker (fn []
                   (let [xl (excel-application-new)]
                     (try
                       (thunk xl)
                       (finally
                         (excel-quit xl)
                         (ComThread/Release)))))
          t      (new Thread worker)]
      (. t start)
      (. t join)))

  (defmacro with-excel
    [varname &amp; body]
    `(with-excel* (fn [~varname] ~@body)))
&lt;/source&gt;

First we define again a driver function, which does the heavy lifting. It takes a function, which it calls in newly created thread. The function is handed over the Excel instance. Everything is wrapped into a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; to ensure proper cleanup even in case the function throws an exception.

Of course it is not our intention to always define a new function manually, when we want to call this wrapper. Hence we define a macro, which does this for us. It takes a symbol which makes the Excel instance available to the body. The body is wrapped into an anonymous function, which closes the body over its bindings and packages everything up for our wrapper.

== Wrap-Up ==

Rewriting with this modifications our initial example gives us this nice and concise code.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
  (with-excel xl
    (excel-application-visible xl true))
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course this example isn't really useful, but it clearly shows the improvement over the previous pure Java code. Also the power lies in the part we don't see: even if we were throwing an exception in the &lt;code&gt;with-excel&lt;/code&gt; everything would be cleaned up.

Further experimenting is left to the user. Things which were left out are e.g. a macro constructing the wrappers, or a function handling &lt;code&gt;Variant&lt;/code&gt; types of the COM interface. So experiment and have '''fun'''!

      <comment>Fixed a bug in the known function. If word is not present in nwords, known used to return #{} which would cause the (or to evaluate to true). Returning nil if the set is empty instead.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Peter Norvig wrote an excellent example of a spelling corrector in Python. You can see [http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html How to Write a Spelling Corrector] for a more detailed explanation.

This code, translated into Clojure by language creator Rich Hickey, demonstrates the Python-like brevity of Clojure:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn words [text] (re-seq #&quot;[a-z]+&quot; (.toLowerCase text)))

(defn train [features]
  (reduce (fn [model f] (assoc model f (inc (get model f 1)))) {} features))

(def *nwords* (train (words (slurp &quot;big.txt&quot;))))

(defn edits1 [word]
  (let [alphabet &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;, n (count word)]
    (distinct (concat
      (for [i (range n)] (str (subs word 0 i) (subs word (inc i))))
      (for [i (range (dec n))]
        (str (subs word 0 i) (nth word (inc i)) (nth word i) (subs word (+ 2 i))))
      (for [i (range n) c alphabet] (str (subs word 0 i) c (subs word (inc i))))
      (for [i (range (inc n)) c alphabet] (str (subs word 0 i) c (subs word i)))))))

(defn known [words nwords] (let [result (set (for [w words :when (nwords w)]  w))]
                             (if (empty? result)
                             nil
                             result)))

(defn known-edits2 [word nwords] (set (for [e1 (edits1 word) e2 (edits1 e1) :when (nwords e2)]  e2)))

(defn correct [word nwords]
  (let [candidates (or (known [word] nwords) (known (edits1 word) nwords) 
                       (known-edits2 word nwords) [word])]
    (apply max-key #(get nwords % 1) candidates)))
&lt;/source&gt;

To use:
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(correct &quot;misstake&quot; *nwords*)
(correct &quot;speling&quot; *nwords*)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: training with [http://norvig.com/big.txt big.txt] may require the jvm to be started with a heap bigger than its default.  You can increase the heap size either by starting java with the &quot;-server&quot; option or setting the maximum heap size explicitly: &quot;java -Xmx128m ...&quot;

      <comment>oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver is preferred and the still-existing oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver has been officially deprecated by Oracle.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is intended to be a reference for using JDBC with Clojure.  We'll create a simple blog database to see the basic functions in clojure.java.jdbc.

==Connection Examples ==
Below are several examples of connecting to a database of JDBC through Clojure.  They all depend on the Clojure Contrib library org.clojure/java.jdbc.  Also, you need to have the proper JDBC jar in the class path.

=== Microsoft SQL Server  ===
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(use 'clojure.java.jdbc)
(def db {:classname &quot;com.microsoft.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver&quot;
               :subprotocol &quot;sqlserver&quot;
               :subname &quot;//server-name:port;database=database-name;user=sql-authentication-user-name;password=password&quot;
})
;Add Classpath to your C:\Program Files\Java\JDBC\sqljdbc_3.0\enu\sqljdbc4.jar
;Below code demos how to execute a simple sql select query and print it to console
;This query will print all the user tables in your MS SQL Server Database
(with-connection db 
      (with-query-results rs [&quot;select * from sys.objects  where type = 'U'&quot;] 
           (doseq [row rs] (println (:name row)))
))
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Apache Derby ===
Derby supports either client/server or embedded operation. This example uses the embedded mode.
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(use 'clojure.java.jdbc)

(let [db-path &quot;c:/derby/myblog&quot;]
  
  (def db {:classname &quot;org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver&quot;
           :subprotocol &quot;derby&quot;
           :subname db-path
           :create true}))
 &lt;/source&gt;

===H2Database ===

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(let [db-protocol &quot;tcp&quot;            ; &quot;file|mem|tcp&quot;
      db-host     &quot;localhost:9092&quot; ; &quot;path|host:port&quot;
      db-name     &quot;Sample&quot;]
 
  (def db {:classname   &quot;org.h2.Driver&quot; ; must be in classpath
           :subprotocol &quot;h2&quot;
           :subname (str db-protocol &quot;://&quot; db-host &quot;/&quot; db-name)
           ; Any additional keys are passed to the driver
           ; as driver-specific properties.
           :user     &quot;sa&quot;
           :password &quot;&quot;}))

;
; specify the path to your database driver
; 
(add-classpath &quot;file:///c:/Installation/h2/bin/h2.jar&quot;)

;;
;; Here is an example of creating a symbol in the 
;; existing namespace as an alias to a namespace
;;
;(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as sql]) 
;(sql/with-connection db
;  (sql/with-query-results rs [&quot;select * from customer&quot;]
;    (dorun (map #(println (:lastname %)) rs))))
 &lt;/source&gt;

===MySQL ===
The MySQL connector is fairly straightforward to set up.  The classname and subprotocol are set to the values for MySQL.  The db-port is set to 3306, as this is the default port for MySQL.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(use 'clojure.java.jdbc)
 
(let [db-host &quot;localhost&quot;
      db-port 3306
      db-name &quot;a_database&quot;]
 
  (def db {:classname &quot;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&quot; ; must be in classpath
           :subprotocol &quot;mysql&quot;
           :subname (str &quot;//&quot; db-host &quot;:&quot; db-port &quot;/&quot; db-name)
           ; Any additional keys are passed to the driver
           ; as driver-specific properties.
           :user &quot;a_user&quot;
           :password &quot;secret&quot;}))
 &lt;/source&gt;

===PostgreSQL ===
The PostgreSQL connection is virtually the same as the MySQL version.  The classname and subprotocol attributes are set for their appropriate PostgreSQL values.  db-port is set to 5432, as this is the default PostgreSQL port.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(use 'clojure.java.jdbc)

(let [db-host &quot;localhost&quot;
      db-port 5432
      db-name &quot;a_database&quot;]

  (def db {:classname &quot;org.postgresql.Driver&quot; ; must be in classpath
           :subprotocol &quot;postgresql&quot;
           :subname (str &quot;//&quot; db-host &quot;:&quot; db-port &quot;/&quot; db-name)
           ; Any additional keys are passed to the driver
           ; as driver-specific properties.
           :user &quot;a_user&quot;
           :password &quot;secret&quot;}))
&lt;/source&gt;

===Oracle ===
The Oracle connector is fairly straightforward to set up.  The classname and subprotocol are set to the values for Oracle.  The db-port is set to 1521, as this is the default port for Oracle XE.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(use 'clojure.java.jdbc)
  (def db {:classname &quot;oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver&quot;  ; must be in classpath
           :subprotocol &quot;oracle&quot;
           :subname &quot;thin:@172.27.1.7:1521:SID&quot; 
           :user &quot;user&quot;
           :password &quot;pwd&quot;})
 &lt;/source&gt;

===DataSource - Oracle ===
Here's an example of pooled db connections using the c3p0 library on top of oracle.
Make sure c3p0 jars and oracle driver jar is in the classpath.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example
  (:use clojure.java.jdbc)
  (:import javax.sql.DataSource
           com.mchange.v2.c3p0.DataSources))

(def db {:datasource (DataSources/pooledDataSource 
                       (DataSources/unpooledDataSource &quot;jdbc:oracle:thin:USER/PASS@HOST_IP:PORT:SCHEMA&quot;))})
&lt;/source&gt;

===DataSource - PostgreSQL ===
Example of pooled db connection using PostgreSQL's PGPoolingDataSource class.
Note that this is not recommended for production. Use c3p0 or similar instead.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example
  (:use clojure.java.jdbc)
  (:import javax.sql.DataSource
	   org.postgresql.ds PGPoolingDataSource))

(let [db-host &quot;localhost&quot;
      db-name &quot;example&quot;
      db-user &quot;username&quot;
      db-pass &quot;notTelling&quot;]
  (def db {:datasource (doto (new PGPoolingDataSource)
				(.setServerName   db-host)
				(.setDatabaseName db-name)
				(.setUser         db-user)
				(.setPassword     db-pass)
				(.setMaxConnections 3))}))
&lt;/source&gt;

===DataSource - JNDI ===
Application servers typically bind data sources into JNDI:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(ns example
  (:use clojure.java.jdbc))

(def db {:name &quot;jdbc/TestDS&quot;})
&lt;/source&gt;

==DDL Examples ==
In the following examples we'll call the database connection '''db'''.  These examples have been tested with MySQL, Postgres would use &quot;SERIAL&quot; rather than &quot;AUTO_INCREMENT&quot;.

=== Creating a Table ===
We'll start by creating a table called '''blogs'''.  This table has three columns.

*id (Primary Key)
*title
*body

==== Derby ====
Adding a timestamp column to show off more DDL.
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn create-blogs
  &quot;Create a table to store blog entries&quot;
  []
  (clojure.java.jdbc/create-table
    :blogs
    [:id :int &quot;PRIMARY KEY&quot; &quot;GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY&quot;]
    [:title &quot;varchar(255)&quot;]
    [:body :clob]
    [:created_at :timestamp &quot;NOT NULL&quot; &quot;DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP&quot;]))
&lt;/source&gt;

==== MySQL ====
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn create-blogs
  &quot;Create a table to store blog entries&quot;
  []
  (clojure.java.jdbc/create-table
   :blogs
   [:id :integer &quot;PRIMARY KEY&quot; &quot;AUTO_INCREMENT&quot;]
   [:title &quot;varchar(255)&quot;]
   [:body :text]))
&lt;/source&gt;


This method will create a method '''create-blogs''' that creates a table when called.  You can invoke the method as follows

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
 (clojure.java.jdbc/with-connection
   db
   (clojure.java.jdbc/transaction
     (create-blogs)))
&lt;/source&gt;

====Exercise ====
Create a method to create a table named '''categories'''.  This table has the following columns

*id (Primary Key)
*name

=== Dropping a Table ===
Below is a method to drop a table.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn drop-blogs
  &quot;Drop the blogs table&quot;
  []
  (try
   (clojure.java.jdbc/drop-table :blogs)
   (catch Exception _)))
&lt;/source&gt;

To invoke the method call it like this:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
 (clojure.java.jdbc/with-connection
   db
   (clojure.java.jdbc/transaction
     (drop-blogs)))
&lt;/source&gt;

====Exercise ====
Create a method to drop the table named '''categories'''.

===Dropping All Object Using do-commands ===
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn drop-all-objects
  []
  (do-commands &quot;drop all objects;&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(clojure.java.jdbc/with-connection
  db
  (clojure.java.jdbc/transaction
    (drop-all-objects)))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Adding Columns ===

TO DO

=== Removing Columns ===

TO DO

==DML Examples ==
Okay, we've got a schema.  Bring on the CRUD!

=== SELECT ===

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(with-connection db 
   (with-query-results rs [&quot;select * from blogs&quot;] 
     ; rs will be a sequence of maps, 
     ; one for each record in the result set. 
     (dorun (map #(println (:title %)) rs))))
&lt;/source&gt;

To retrieve the CLOB column with Derby, you can convert the returned object to a String,
and you must be inside of a transaction to do that.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn clob-to-string [clob]
  &quot;Turn a Derby 10.6.1.0 EmbedClob into a String&quot;
  (with-open [rdr (java.io.BufferedReader. (.getCharacterStream clob))]
    (apply str (line-seq rdr))))

(with-connection db
  (transaction
   (with-query-results rs [&quot;select * from blogs&quot;] 
     ; rs will be a sequence of maps, 
     ; one for each record in the result set. 
     (doseq [row rs] (println (declob (:body row)))))))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== INSERT ===
This function inserts an entry into the blog database.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn insert-blog-entry
  &quot;Insert data into the table&quot;
  [title,body]
  (clojure.java.jdbc/insert-values
   :blogs
   [:title :body]
   [title body]))
&lt;/source&gt;

And invoking the function

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
 (clojure.java.jdbc/with-connection
   db
   (clojure.java.jdbc/transaction
    (insert-blog-entry &quot;Hello World&quot; &quot;Life is awesome in the lisp world.&quot;) ))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== UPDATE ===
Here's an example updating a blog entry.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn update-blog
  &quot;This method updates a blog entry&quot;
  [id attribute-map]
  (clojure.java.jdbc/update-values
   :blogs
   [&quot;id=?&quot; id]
   attribute-map))
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's update the first blog entry.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(with-connection db 
  (clojure.java.jdbc/transaction
    (update-blog 1 {:title &quot;Awesome Title&quot;})))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== DELETE ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
;
; the first line allows us to say sql/with-connection instead of
; clojure.java.jdbc/with-connection
;
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as sql])
(defn delete-blog
  &quot;Deletes a blog entry given the id&quot;
  [id]
  (sql/with-connection db
    (sql/delete-rows :blogs [&quot;id=?&quot; id])))
&lt;/source&gt;

== Paging ==

=== Oracle and HSQLDB ===

Please read http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/issue-archive/2006/06-sep/o56asktom-086197.html.

The order collection must always contain a unique ordering value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;

(defn as-str [&amp; s] (apply str s))

(defn create-query-paging [{:keys [tbl properties order predicate from max] :or {max 100} }]
  &quot;Creates a SQL query using paging and ROWNUM()&quot;
  (str &quot;SELECT * from (select &quot; (clojure.string/join &quot;,&quot; (map #(str &quot;a.&quot; %) properties)) 
                        &quot;, ROWNUM() rnum from (select &quot; (clojure.string/join &quot;/&quot; properties) 
                        &quot; from &quot; tbl 
                        &quot; order by &quot; (clojure.string/join &quot;,&quot; order) &quot; ) a &quot;
                        &quot; WHERE ROWNUM() &lt;= &quot; max
                        &quot;) WHERE &quot; (if-not predicate &quot;&quot; (str predicate &quot; and &quot;)) &quot; rnum &gt;= &quot; from))

(create-query-paging {:tbl &quot;mytable&quot; :properties [&quot;*&quot;] :order [&quot;id&quot;, &quot;ts&quot;] :from 10 :max 20} )
;&quot;SELECT * from (select a.*, ROWNUM() rnum from (select * from mytable order by id,ts ) a  WHERE ROWNUM() &lt;= 20) WHERE rnum &gt;= 10&quot;

==Why Learn Portuguese?==

Portuguese is a Romance language spoken by 240 million people - more than the number of German, Italian, and Polish speakers combined. It is the 7th most-spoken language in the world. It is very closely related to other Romance languages such as [[Spanish]], [[Catalan]], [[Italian]], and [[French]]. Most Portuguese speakers are located in Brazil, although large numbers of Portuguese speakers are also found in Angola, Moçambique, as well as in other places in Africa and Asia.

Portuguese is considered a Category I language, meaning it is relatively easy for English speakers to pick up. As you'll see, Portuguese does carry a few similarities to English.

In this course, you'll learn Brazilian Portuguese, which is different in some aspects of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation from other dialects of Portuguese.

Don't be overwhelmed by accented letters in the language - keep in mind that the Portuguese language has actually been '''simplified''' over the years (provàvelmente - provavelmente; diccionário - dicionário; idéia - ideia; ambìgüidade - ambiguidade). It has actually lost an accent: the trema, which used to be used as ü, and the grave accent, which used to denote secondary stresses, today only appears as à in only one specific case.

==How to Use the Lessons==

The language lessons in this textbook are made to be followed in a certain manner to ensure full absorption of the content. There are twelve sections per course, of which there are two: Basic and Intermediate. Be sure to follow these steps:

# Look over what will be presented in the lesson. Keep it in mind as you move along.
# Listen to the dialogue or text reading provided; you might not understand it completely at first, but keep in mind that you will by the end of the lesson.
# Repeat the speakers as you move along in the pronunciation section. You'll be presented with vocabulary at this time. 
# Complete all of the vocabulary exercises provided.
# Read the grammar section and try to understand it thoroughly. If you have any doubts, feel free to ask about them in the Discussion section (the tab at the top) of the page.
# Complete the grammar exercises.
# Listen to the dialogue again. You'll be surprised at how much you've learned.
# Complete all the review exercises.

==Editing the Course==
This course was very carefully planned so try to avoid modifications to the overall structure of the book and the order that the content is presented unless you find it absolutely necessary. Remember to keep the book well-illustrated! Illustrations help to fix things in memory. Do not hesitate, however, to contribute to the book (and sign your name on the [[Brazilian Portuguese/Contributors | contributors list]]. After all, that's what Wikibooks is there for!

This book follows many of the guidelines displayed in the [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] Wikibook.

Good luck in your studies!

|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''João''': Bom dia, Maria. Tudo bem?

'''Maria''': Tchau, João!
|}

[[File:Driver_hand_waving.jpg | thumb | right | Bom dia!]]


;'''Bom dia''' - good morning
:'''bom''' - good
:'''dia''' - day

;'''Tudo bem?''' - how are you? (lit. Everything well?)
:'''tudo''' - everything
:'''bem''' - well

;Obrigado (-a) - Thank you (G1)
(Obrigado: male speech; Obrigada: female speech.)
;Também - also, too

;estou - conjugation of &quot;estar&quot; (G2)

;Tchau - bye!

===Introducing Yourself===
{| border = 0 width=45% bgcolor = &quot;F5E1DE&quot;
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''João''': Olá. Qual é o seu nome?
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot; bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''Maria''': Maria. E o seu?
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''João''': Sou João. Tchau, Maria!
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''Maria''': Tchau, João!
|}

;'''Qual é o seu nome?''' - What is your name?
:'''Qual''' - which
:'''é''' - is (you'll see this further in chapter 2)
:'''o''' - masc. definite article, singular (the) - also deepened in chapter 2
:'''nome''' - (masc.) name
;Seu - Yours (Masc.)
;Sou - I am

''The question'' Qual é seu nome? ''may also be answered as'' Meu nome é ... '', meaning &quot;My name is...&quot;'.'

''Be careful not to mix &quot;seu&quot; and &quot;sou&quot;. ''

===Structure: How are you?===

In Portuguese, there are various ways to ask how someone is and various ways to reply. Here are the most commonly used ones:

{| border = 0 width=45% bgcolor = &quot;F5E1DE&quot;
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
A: Tudo bem?
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
A: Tudo bem com você?
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
A: Como vai?
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot; bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
B: Tudo, obrigado.
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
B: Tudo, graças a Deus.
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
B: Estou bem, obrigado.
|}

Keeping in mind that Brazil is traditionally a Roman Catholic country (a little less than 70% of the population by now, though Christianity is still at about 90%), expressions such as ''graças a Deus'' (thank God) or ''fique com Deus'' (be God with you) are very common.

==Pronunciation==

''(Don't worry about learning the meaning of these words just yet. You'll learn them later on. Just focus on the pronunciation for now.)
''

===Nasal vowels in Portuguese===
Unlike its close neighbor, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese makes great use of nasal vowels. You probably observed this in the words bom, bem, também, and João.  Listen to the nasal vowels and try to imitate the native speaker:
	
:am, an, ã - amplo (ample), fantástico (fantastic), maçã (apple)
:em, en - exemplo (example), entrar (to enter)
:im, in - íntimo (intimate)
:on - onda (wave)
:um - um (one)

Be careful, though. If the m or n is followed by another vowel, before stress takes place, the sound is not nasal:

:''a''migo, c''a''neta
:''e''m''i''nente, ''i''n''i''migo
:''i''mitar, m''e''n'''i'''na (slightly nasalized i)
:'''o'''nífero (slightly nasalized o)
:'''u'''nilateral (slightly nasalized u)

===The tilde and ç===
Modern Portuguese has four accents, in order of most common use: the acute (´), the circumflex (^), the tilde (~) and the grave (`). Brazilian Portuguese had a diaeresis (¨) in the past, with the same use of that in Spanish, and all of Portuguese has ''cê-cedilha'' (ç), with the same use of that in French, though it is not regarded as an accent anymore). The accents will all be explained as they appear. Let's take a look at the trickiest one for foreigners to pronounce: the tilde. The tilde can only appear in the following combinations: ã, ãe, ães, ão, ãos, ões. They are usually preceded by the c-cedille (ç), or ''cê-cedilha''. The cedille is only found in this form. Examples are maçã, ação, ações. Try to imitate the native speaker (the following words are in the singular and followed by the plural):

:maçã, maçãs
:cidadão, cidadãos
:avião, aviões
:mãe, mães

==Vocabulary==

{|
|[[File:Red_sunrise.jpg|250px]]
|[[File:Georges_Seurat_031.jpg|280px]]
|[[File:Night_sky.jpg|280px]]
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;Bom dia!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;Boa tarde!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;Boa noite!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}

;Bom dia
:used in the mornings, even if the sun is not up yet after waking 
;Boa tarde
:used in the afternoons (literally after noon) until the sun sets
;Boa noite
:used after sunsets until one goes to sleep


Those time-specific greetings should only be used in those times; for greetings that are not time-specific, use the following:


'''Olá''' -a formal hello, usually to someone of a higher rank, an elderly person, or someone to whom you wish to show more respect

'''Oi''' - an informal hello, used among children and teenagers, friends, or those substantially younger than you


To dismiss yourself, simply say '''Tchau'''. Despite sounding informal, there is no formal equivalent of it.


===Pronouns===

The Portuguese pronouns are as follows:

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Pronouns|Pronomes|Subject Pronouns|2}}
! Eu (I)
! Nós (We)
|-
! Tu (You)
! Vós (You - plural)
|-
! Você (You)
! Vocês (You - plural)
|-
! Ele (He)
! Eles (They - masculine or mixed)
|-
! Ela (She)
! Elas (They - feminine)
|}

Be careful: Eles can either refer to a group of various masculine nouns or a group of mixed masculine and feminine nouns. Elas can only refer to a purely feminine group.

===Exercises===

'''A.''' How would you greet someone at the following times of the day?

#7h00
#13h30
#10h45
#12h00
#20h30

'''B.'''

#How would you greet an executive officer, not considering of the time of day?
#How would you greet a friend at any time?
#Or a young person?
#Or an elderly lady in the afternoon?


'''C.''' What pronoun would you use to describe the following groups of people?

[[File:Xhosa-children.JPG|220px]]

==Grammar==
===Gender===

Words in Portuguese are either masculine or feminine. The general rules are presented below, with examples:

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Genders| | |4}}
|bgcolor = &quot;#349843&quot;| Masculine
|
|bgcolor = &quot;#349843&quot;| Feminine
|
|-
! &quot;o&quot; ending
! fato, pato, livro
! &quot;a&quot; ending
! janela, geladeira, pera
|-
! &quot;ão&quot; ending
! chão, pão, refrão
! &quot;ão&quot; or &quot;ã&quot; ending (less)
! visão, ação, mão, vilã, alemã.
|-
! consonant ending
! lápis, ônibus
! &quot;dade&quot; or &quot;gem&quot; ending
! idade, viagem
|}

Adjectives always have to agree with their noun, which is why you see the difference between ''bom'' and ''boa'' in ''bom dia'', ''boa noite'', and so on.

The one word in Portuguese that changes gender according to the speaker is &quot;thank you&quot;. If you're male, say ''obrigado.''
If you're female, say ''obrigada.'' This rule still applies if you turn down an offer (&quot;No, thanks&quot;): ''Não, obrigado'' and ''Não, obrigada.''

===Definite and Indefinite Articles===

The following table presents all that you need to know about the Portuguese articles, remembering that &quot;definite&quot; is &quot;the&quot; and &quot;indefinite&quot; is &quot;a/an&quot; in English.

{|width=45% {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Articles|Definite|Indefinite|3}} 
! 
|bgcolor = &quot;#349843&quot;| Masculine
|bgcolor = &quot;#349843&quot;| Feminine
|-
! def. singular
! o
! a
|-
! def. plural
! os
! as
|-
! indef. singular
! um
! uma
|-
! indef. plural
! uns
! umas
|-
|}

''Uns'' and ''Umas'' translate as ''some'' or ''a few''. Take the following, for example:

:'''o cachorro''' - the dog
:'''os cachorros''' - the dog''s''
:'''um cachorro''' - a dog
:'''uns cachorros''' - some dog''s''

:'''a ideia''' - the idea
:'''as ideias''' - the idea''s''
:'''uma ideia''' - an idea
:'''umas ideias''' - some idea''s''

===Estar===
There are two verbs that stand for &quot;to be&quot; in Portuguese: ''ser'' and ''estar''. Each one is used in different cases, and they are not interchangeable. Let's take a look at the uses of ''estar'' (you will see ser in [[Brazilian Portuguese/Chapter 2|Chapter 2]])

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Usage|Estar|To Be (situational)|1}}
! Location
|-
! Feelings
|-
! Present Conditions
|-
! Present Appearances
|-
! Civil Status
|-
! Auxiliary in the Present Continuous
|}

[[File:German_Pinscher.JPG | thumb | ''Um Cachorro'' - an example of a masculine noun]]


Here is its conjugation:

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Verb|Estar|To Be (situational)|2}}
! Eu estou
! Nós estamos
|-
! Tu estás
! Vós estais
|-
! Você está
! Vocês estão
|-
! Ele/Ela está
! Eles/Elas estão
|}


An example of ''estar'' that was used in the dialogue was &quot;estou bem,&quot; meaning &quot;I'm well.&quot; Note how the verb is being used to express a present condition that at another point may change - &quot;não estou bem&quot; means &quot;I'm not well.&quot; Keep in mind that this negation can also be used with other verbs.

Now, you may be wondering how come the second person in Brazilian Portuguese (but not in European Portuguese) is conjugated just like the third person. That's because ''você'' evolved from the now-archaic ''Vossa mercê'', meaning &quot;your mercy&quot;, as a polite form of &quot;you&quot;. In Portugal, ''você'' is only used in extremely formal situations, while in Brazil it is used both formally and informally.

An interesting aspect of the verb ''estar'' is the fact that is developing into another verb - ''tar'' - in colloquial speech. Many teachers of Portuguese even consider that in the future ''tar'' will be the accepted form of the verb and ''estar'' will be considered archaic. It's relatively simple; the &quot;es-&quot; in the beginning of the verb is removed from all the conjugations (eu estou - eu tou; você/ele está - você/ele tá, etc.).

====Exercises====
'''A.''' Determine the gender of the following words (M - masculine, F - feminine). Mark it with its definite and indefinite articles.

# um capítulo (chapter)
# uma coisa (thing)
# uma ideia (idea)
# um pão (bread)
# uma flor (flower - be careful; this one's irregular)

'''B.''' In which of the following cases would you use ''estar'' during translation?

# She is married.
# He's in Rio de Janeiro this week.
# My friend is a doctor.
# His wife is a nurse.
# They are both working at the hospital.
# They are at the hospital now.
# The house is so messy now!

Whenever you go to a Brazilian party, you're sure to find [[Cookbook:Brigadeiro | brigadeiros]], small balls of fudge placed on a little paper holder. This dessert is extremely popular throughout the whole country. Here's a [[Cookbook:Brigadeiro | brigadeiro recipe]] - we'll be referring back to it in [[Brazilian Portuguese/Contents/Chapter 17 | chapter 17]].

'''Portuguese in Daily Life:''' Should someone offer you a brigadeiro, what would you say to accept the offer (be sure to change it depending on your gender)? How would you decline the offer?

where are you from? If you have access to Spanish TV you can hear Brazilian players speaking Spanish with Brazilian accent. ;-)

I really think a more thorough explanation of the distinction between &quot;estar&quot; and &quot;ser&quot; is in order.
Acho importante explicar a distinção entre &quot;ser&quot; e &quot;estar&quot; de uma forma mais completa.
While it would be impossible to clarify every distinction in their use, I believe a good way to explain the difference to English speakers is as follows:
&quot;Estar&quot; generally means &quot;to be&quot; in a temporary state, as in, for instance, &quot;I am angry / Estou zangado&quot;; While &quot;ser&quot; means &quot;to be&quot; in a more permanent sense, such as, &quot;I am Brazilian / Eu sou brasileiro&quot;.  I will only be angry momentarily, while, I will be Brazilian for my entire life, or permanently.
This distinction is not made clear in this book, as it currently exists.
I feel that the current organization, with these two verbs discussed in distinct chapters, is not helpful.  Presenting these two verbs together, with a thorough explanation of their differences, and clear examples, such as above, would make more sense than the current configuration.

:Actually I believe the current article is wrong it the way it displays it currently - it says civil status would be &quot;estar&quot; but that's not the case for &quot;I'm married&quot;...
:It's also not the only place where this wikibook chapter could be improved. I found it very needing in a lot of areas - there is a test for masculine feminine nouns without any explanation of masculine and feminine in portuguese.

I refer to the following quote:
::&quot;The tilde can only appear in the following combinations: ã, ãe, ães, ão, ãos, ões. They are usually preceded by the c-cedille (ç), or cê-cedilha. The cedille is only found in this form. Examples are maçã, ação, ações. &quot;
&quot;The cedille is only found in this form&quot;: My suggestion is to be more specific about the cedille being tied to the &quot;c&quot; rather than &quot;this form&quot;. Particularly, considering the selection of examples given:
&quot;Examples are maçã, ação, ações. &quot; This set of examples could be misleading, since one might be tempted to think that cê-cedilha could only occur before &quot;ã, ãe, ães, ão, ãos, ões&quot;. I suggest adding praça, começávamos, açúcar and preço. There is no rule excluding any form (accent, tilde, no particular marker) of a, o or u after a cê-cedilha that I am aware of. It's just that cê-cedilha can neither be followed by e nor i.

      <comment>Added self-referential version</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A function which lazily produces [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number Fibonacci numbers]:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(def fib-seq 
  ((fn rfib [a b] 
     (lazy-seq (cons a (rfib b (+ a b)))))
   0 1))
user&gt; (take 20 fib-seq)
(0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Recursive Version ==
A version with recursion on data, not functions. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corecursion :

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(def fib-seq
     (lazy-cat [0 1] (map + (rest fib-seq) fib-seq)))


user&gt; (take 20 fib-seq)
(0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181)
&lt;/source&gt;

A different recursive version, making use of the [http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/reductions reductions] function. ... Does this work? NO. Seems a fake. See discussion.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(def fib-seq
     (cons 1 (reductions + (first fib-seq) fib-seq)))

user&gt; (take 20 fib-seq)
(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Properly Scoped Version ==
There might be a problem in the precedent versions : they create fibonacci lazy-sequences that are bound to top level vars. And as such they are not garbage collected, and if used to compute a very long sequence, will consume a lot of heap.
It could be smarter to define fib-seq as a no-arg function that will return a lazy-seq on demand. Then the lazy seq could be put by the caller in the appropriate scope (hopefully not the top level scope) :

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn fib-seq []
  ((fn rfib [a b] 
       (cons a (lazy-seq (rfib b (+ a b)))))
    0 1))

user&gt; (take 20 (fib-seq))
(0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using iterate ==
We can use [http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/iterate iterate] to generate pairs of [a b] and then take the first of each one.
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;

(defn fib-step [[a b]]
  [b (+ a b)])

(defn fib-seq []
  (map first (iterate fib-step [0 1])))

user&gt; (take 20 (fib-seq))
(0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181)
&lt;/source&gt;

This example also uses [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_Clojure#Destructuring destructuring].

== Recursive Fibonacci with any start point and the amount of numbers that you want ==
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn fib [start range]                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  &quot;Creates a vector of fibonnaci numbers&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  (if (&lt;= range 0)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chicken Parisian''' is a recipe for the Crock-Pot.  It contains chicken, rice, wine, and Cream of Mushroom.

==Ingredients==
*boneless chicken cuts
*1 box white rice
*Cream of Mushroom
*red/white wine (use cooking wine for more flavor)
*1-2 pinches flour (may not be needed)
*1 can sour cream

==Servings==
8 servings

==Procedure==
Prepare this before lunch starts, to have it in time for supper.

#Ready the Crock-Pot.  
#Mix the wine and Cream of Mushroom together in the Crock-Pot.  If you added too much wine, sprinkle in some flour to keep the sauce from losing viscosity.
#Once the mixture is thoroughly stirred, take the chicken cuts, strip off the fat, and rinse well.  Then immerse it in the sauce mixture in the Crock-Pot. Be sure to fully saturate the cuts with it.
#Add in a whole can of sour cream, mix around, put the lid on, and set the Crock-Pot to cook for 8 hours.
#Around the time that it will be done, boil some rice in a pot.  Serve the rice beneath the contents inside the Crock-Pot.

If having for leftovers, be sure to refrigerate the sauce and rice in separate containers.

{| border = 0 width=45% bgcolor = &quot;F5E1DE&quot;

|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''Pedro''': João, o que você faz?

'''Pedro''': Que coincidência! Também sou médico!
|-
|colspan = &quot;0&quot;  bgcolor = &quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
'''João''': Que interessante!
|}


;'''O que você faz?''' - What do you do?
:'''o que''' - what (lit. &quot;the what&quot;)
:'''você faz?''' - do you do? (lit. &quot;you do&quot;)
:'''faz''' - you/he does; conjugated from the irregular verb Fazer

;'''Sou médico. E você?''' - I'm a doctor. And you?
:'''sou''' - I'm; conjugated from the irregular verb Ser  (lit. &quot;am&quot;. Note that the pronoun there is hide. &quot;Eu sou&quot; = &quot;I am&quot;)
:'''médico''' - doctor
:'''e você?''' - And you? 

;'''Que coincidência! Também sou médico!''' - What a coincidence! I'm a doctor too!
:'''que''' - what
:'''também''' - too, also, either

:'''Que interessante!''' - Interesting! (lit. What interesting!)

====Structures: Que ...! ====
The structure &quot;Que...!&quot; in portuguese is, in certain ways, unique. The structure that is similar to it in the English language is &quot;That`s...!&quot; or sometimes only a word: &quot;Word!&quot;. For example: in the dialogue João says &quot;Que interessante!&quot;, in this case it would be like an &quot;Interesting!&quot; (lit. That`s interesting!). 
Examples of similar &quot;Que...!&quot; structures in english:
# That`s...! ''That is nice!''; In portuguese: &quot;Legal!&quot;, &quot;Isso é legal!&quot;.
# Word! ''Wonderful!''; in portuguese: &quot;Maravilhoso!&quot;.

&lt;big&gt;Watch out&lt;/big&gt; - ''professor'' can be used for both teachers and professors, although ''mestre'' can also be used for the latter.

===Adjectives===
====Exercises====

==Grammar==
===Ser===
''Ser'' is the other verb that means &quot;to be&quot; (The first one is the verb ''estar''). It is used to express a permanent condition or fact.
{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Usage|Ser|To Be (factual)|1}}
! Permanent Description
|-
! What Something's Made Of
|-
! Permanent Facts
|}

Here is its conjugation:

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Verb|Ser|To Be (factual)|2}}
! Eu sou
! Nós somos
|-
! Tu és
! Vós sois
|-
! Você é
! Vocês são
|-
! Ele/Ela é
! Eles/Elas são
|}

===Fazer===
''Fazer'' means to do or to make. It can be used interchangeable between the two definitions. It is an irregular verb, so it doesn't follow the rules of other -er verbs.

{| {{User:Theunixgeek/Portuguese table|Verb|Fazer|To Do/Make|2}}
! Eu faço
! Nós fazemos
|-
! Tu fazes
! Vós fazeis
|-
! Você faz
! Vocês fazem
|-
! Ele/Ela faz
! Eles/Elas fazem
|}

Here are a few examples of its uses:

O que o médico faz? (Questions are discussed in the [[#Asking &quot;What&quot; Questions | next section]])

===Asking &quot;What&quot; Questions===

===Adjectives===
An adjective is a word that modifies a noun or pronoun by giving more information about it. They answer the questions, &quot;what kind?&quot;, &quot;which one?&quot;, &quot;how many?&quot;, and &quot;how much?&quot;.

This introduction is intended for readers who have already some experience with other programming languages&amp;mdash;some mathematical curiosity may be helpful. It is not about &lt;i&gt;learning programming&lt;/i&gt; but learning the specifics of the OCaml language and how to use them well.

For learning more about the OCaml language and how it is linked to other languages, don't hesitate to read [[w:OCaml|Wikipedia's article about OCaml]].

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is OCaml ? ==

OCaml is a programming language, that is to say a way to give instructions to a computer in order to get back results or effects.

As Java, C# or Python, OCaml is a ''high level language'', conceived for writing evolved applications or libraries, without caring about low level issues, like memory management, and made to encourage code and component reuse. Like those languages, OCaml has many specialized libraries for manipulating user interfaces, 3D graphics, web services, sound and music, mathematical objects and more.

As opposed to Java, C# or Python, all being ''imperative languages'', OCaml is in the ''functional languages'' category. To build an imperative program, the coder creates sequences of statements, each modifying the data in memory or performing input/output.  In contrast, we build functional programs out of functions in a more mathematical sense, similar to evaluating a long formula. OCaml also has imperative features (as well as object-oriented ones), so we sometimes classify it as ''multi-paradigm.''

Creators of Java or C# claim that their languages are ''statically and strongly typed'', but this is only partially true. In contrast with this, OCaml is truly ''statically and strongly typed'', which means that the language does several automatic verifications and rejects programs it considers erroneous lacking sufficient rigor. Moreover, OCaml's typing is inferred, meaning that most of those verifications are made transparently, without giving additional information to OCaml, as opposed to Java or C# where we have to give the type of each variable, argument, method.  On the other end of the spectrum, dynamically typed languages like Python don't have control over the sanity of runtime operations, but OCaml analyzes that when compiling, requiring us to be more rigourous when writing programs, but increasing program reliability and simplifying tests. Moreover, since type verifications are done at compile-time and not runtime, programs aren't slowed down by those coherence tests.

As opposed to Java, C# or Python, OCaml aims at being a &lt;i&gt;declarative language&lt;/i&gt;, that's to say we rather describe a solution to a problem than building it step by step. To do it, we benefit from the extensibility of the OCaml language. Indeed, when an application needs some repetitive and complex operations, we can create a new primitive to do this operation by extending OCaml's syntax or by creating a sublanguage of OCaml itself for solving your problem. This way, some libraries, instead of bringing in new features for the language, modify the language itself.

As opposed to Java, C# or Python, OCaml tries as much as possible to be a &lt;i&gt;high performance language&lt;/i&gt;. OCaml programs start much faster, usually run faster and will often need 4 times less memory than a Java or C# program. OCaml programs generally use a little more RAM than equivalent Python programs but will be executed about 10 times faster. In some cases, thankfully quite rarely, these performance gains occur to the detriment of comfort of coding.

And finally one thing, unlike Java or C#, and just like Python, OCaml remains an &lt;i&gt;experimental language&lt;/i&gt;, which means it regularly gains totally new functionality. Versions of OCaml specialized in distributed programming (JoCaml, Acute), manipulating XML trees (OCamlDuce), writing compilers (MetaOCaml), writing shell scripts (Cash), and more also exist.

With some experience in OCaml programming, you'll figure out that OCaml programs are much shorter than similar programs in Java or C#, thanks to powerful abstraction primitives, OCaml's extensibility, type inference and a shorter syntax. This shortness is often an advantage, even if code is then more concentrated, so sometimes harder to read.

== Why learn OCaml ? ==

This question has many responses.

For mathematicians, physicists, statisticians or other users of scientific programs, OCaml allows the development of quick, reliable programs, partially because the source code of the program will resemble the mathematical description of the problem, so it'll be easier to verify.  Secondly, the functional decomposition permitted by OCaml avoids many errors.  Lastly, modern functional programming simplifies the creation of generic and easily reusable libraries.

Programmers who know Java, C#, C, C++ or other languages will discover through OCaml other ways to see the world and to write their programs to depend less on the execution mode of the machine and more on the intended results, to change the programming language to adapt to the problem au fur et à mesure de la progression du projet, or (again) other techniques of decomposing and reusing code.  Even if you can't use OCaml in your career, its concepts will allow you to analyze many problems through a perspective you didn't have before.

Python, Ruby and JavaScript programmers will discover a comfortable language in which there will be found many already known ideas, but in a more rigorous form and more adapted to the development of big, critical projects.  On the other end, users of industrial languages -- where the essential concepts go back to the 1970s -- will find newer ideas that have come out of the research world.  Many of the concepts considered innovative in industry are pulled directly from functional languages: exceptions, array bounds checking, garbage collection, type inference, generic types, specialized mini-languages, sour? enumerations, closures...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Revenue Growth thru Energy Savings ==

This concept was first presented by Tim Maloney in early 2009.

Currently, it is being looked at as an addition to the Exec Summary, and as a way to better prove why energy savings is integral to a firms revenue stream.

'''Revenue Growth Example A'''

Company A savings = $611,768 but from a managers perspective they should expect to see at least a $12,223,536 in revenue growth (at an estimated 5% profit margin) by implementing the recommendations. Putting it in revenue terms is more powerful and tells the real story (it isn't about saving money, it's about making it).

This is also a better pitch to future customers, i.e. IAC audits resulted in an average revenue growth of x for a certain industry. In others words, &quot;we want to come to your business and help grow revenue&quot;.

We would use average industry sector profits margins, the company can use their own data to get the real number.

Calcs:
(Cost savings/profit margin) =  revenue growth

'''Revenue Growth Example B'''

Here is the story of Hippy Widgets Inc. It is intended to demonstrate how energy management and energy savings can increase revenue while reducing a company's exposure to risk.

Background:

Hippy Widgets makes widgets at its factory in Veneta, Oregon. The company is easily able to sell $1,000,000 in widgets each year using all of Hippy Widgets Inc.?s available capacity. The company?s owner, Barbara Streisand, wants to generate more revenue and make more money.

The company owns 10 machines costing $300,000 each. Each machine can produce 10,000 widgets (10,000 widgets/machine x $10 revenue/widget = $100,000 in Revenue capacity/ machine).

A recent IAC audit found $10,000 in potential yearly savings at an initial investment of $20,000.

Hippy Widgets has $20,000 available to invest and also has a credit line available.

Hippy Widgets has a 10% profit margin.

What should the company do?

Option 1:
The production manager wants to use the $20,000 as a down payment on a new machine and finance the remaining $280,000. The machine will produce an addition 10,000 widgets and generate $100,000 in revenue.

Option 2:
The maintenance manager suggests using the $20,000 to implement the IAC recommendations.


Evaluate:

Option 1:
$300,000 investment for $100,000 revenue/year

Option 2:
$20,000 investment for $10,000 energy savings
$10,000 energy saving ÷ 10% profit margin = $100,000 revenue/year


Option 2 generates an equal amount of revenue and requires less financial risk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sources that provide Voltage or Current to provide electricity for electrical devices to operate.

==Voltage Sources==
There are two Voltage Sources generally used in any applications namely AC and DC Voltage Source:

===DC Electricity===
DC stands for Direct Current . Voltage source that has constant voltage that does not change with time and can be expressed mathematically
:;v = V

DC Voltage sources are found in Batteries,  

===AC Electricity===
AC stands for Alternating Current . Voltage source that has current amplitude varies sinusoidally with time and can be expressed mathematically
:; v = V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; Sin wt 
::V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; The highest value of the voltage also called Peak Voltage measured in Volt (v)
::t - time measured in second (s)
::w - Angular Frequency . w = 2πf = &lt;math&gt;\frac{2\pi}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

AC Voltage source are generated from AC generators.

==Current Sources==
Current sources act in a similar manner to voltage sources, except that they try and maintain a constant current. Current sources are mainly constant current devices, meaning that they have a set value that they try and maintain, but also exist as variable devices, such as in transistor models.

If you use MagicJack without the dongle, i.e. run from the hard drive, you can move/rename the '''*.skn ''' files from the local '''mjusbsp''' folder. The SoftPhone app will show up with a bland UI, but has an Exit button that unloads from memory.

=Theoretical Approaches in Medical Anthropology=

There are three theoretical approaches to understanding human health.  The first is the epidemiological, or ecological, approach.  This approach examines the way culture and the natural environment interact to create patterns of health or disease.  The second is the interpretivist approach.  This approach looks at the way cultures use symbolic meaning to describe and understand health and disease.  The third is Critical Medical Anthropology.  This approach focuses on how economics and politics affect human health.


==Epidemiological Approach==

[[Epidemiology]] is the study of factors effecting health and disease among populations and is considered a fundamental aspect of public health research. Epidemiology focuses on identifying disease risk factors based on how, when, and where they occur. By collecting this data, Epidemiologists provide data for measuring the occurrence of health phenomena. Epidemiologists use various forms of investigation and analysis to examine the relationships between human disease and the environment and ultimately to determine the causes of a particular disease.  This approach can be utilized by anthropologists to examine the cultural patterns that may affect the prevalence of a particular disease.  Cultural factors that may contribute to disease include,  but are not limited to, eating habits, work, location, sexual activity, social interaction, and medical practices.  Yet, even with all these factors included, epidemiological studies can never prove causation; meaning that it can never prove the exact factor that caused the disease or health problems.  It can only associate a factor with a health issue.

In addition epidemiological studies are divided into two types; Retrospective and Prospective. Retrospective describes whether the events have already occurred and Prospective describes whether the events may occur in the future. The most common studies of epidemiological are Retrospective which are also known as case-control studies. Case-control studies take place when there is an outbreak of disease in the population and the cause of the disease is unknown or when the population is not familiar with the disease. (http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/TIB/epidemiology.html)

==Interpretivist Approach==

Cultures throughout the world use different systems of meaning to describe and respond to illness.  Anthropologists who study these differences with symbolic meaning employ the interpretivist approach to medical anthropology.  This approach looks at illness from an [[W:emic|emic]] perspective attempting to understand health and disease relative to a particular culture. By gaining an emic perspective on a culture, medical anthropologists can further understand that notion of &quot;embodied person-hood.&quot; Embodied person-hood is defined as the relationship of cultural beliefs and practices in connection with health and illness to the sentient human body. This is the core focus for anthropologists using the interpretivist approach.

====Birth Care in Norway====

One example of effectively using the Interpretivist approach is the examination of birth care in Norway. Since 1991, Norway houses the largest number of refugees from Somalia due to their civil war. A large amount of these refugees are infibulated women. Medical anthropologist R. Elise B. Johansen examined the cultural understanding of childbirth in Norway in an attempt to understand why Somali immigrants are at a higher risk for birthing complications. Birthing practices in Norway emphasize the natural process of birth and rather than favoring an obstetrician and medication, they favor midwives. Health care professionals have little part in the birthing process, as anything more would be disrespectful the woman in labor. The problem with integrating this approach with Somali women who are infibulated is that midwives assume that the Somali women too would want as natural of a birth as possible, without being defibulated. The midwives fail to open up a dialect about possible birthing options all together. This not only leads to severe pain while giving birth, but it also can lead to medical complications. This lack of dialogue has lead to misunderstanding of how the Somali women want to give birth- mainly, the misunderstanding that a Somali woman would not want to be defibulated. It also leads to a high incidence of birthing complications. Had the midwives opened a discussion with the Somali women, they would have discovered that many Somali women wanted to be defibulated and further more, did not want to be refibulated. By examining the systems of meaning surrounding birth in Norway, Johansen was able to determine that the challenge lay in complex interpretations of such cultural elements as gender, nature, health and gender equity [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120178543/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0]. Through her interpretivist approach, Johansen was able to understand the medical issue of birthing complications in the context of a specific culture. This study also shows how even attempts to be culturally sensitive can misguide us and increase social confusion. These problems are key reminders of the importance of education and dialogue when attempting to bridge cultural gaps.

==Critical Medical Anthropology==

Critical medical anthropology focuses on how economics and politics shape the overall status of human health.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Medical_Anthropology Critical medical anthropology] addresses the disparities in the quality of health and care in the presence of social inequalities. Social divisions based on race, ethnicity, gender and class can influence access to health care and susceptibility to disease.  Critical medical anthropologists acknowledge these social factors when looking at the prevalence of a particular disease and ways to prevent it.  In a 1998 study of inner-city Hispanic children, critical medical anthropologist Merrill Singer found that food insecurity and hunger were prevalent conditions.  By identifying variables associated with these conditions, Singer was able to determine risk factors for food insecurity and hunger that could be used by policy makers to improve food programs and public health policy.  Critical medical anthropologists have worked hard to draw attention to some of the shortcomings of western biomedicine in combating health issues such as hunger and malnutrition and to find ways to improve public health.

===Other Theoretical Approaches===

Medical Anthropology draws upon many different theoretical approaches. It pays attention to popular health culture as bioscientific epidemiology as well as the social construction of health knowledge, and the politics of science. Medical anthropologists study the health of individuals in the background of larger social formations, and how environment affects humans and other species. They also study cultural norms, social institutions, politics and globalization.

In medical anthropology, the two aspects of sickness are divided to better care and heal those in need. Disease and Illness are two very different things in the medical field that are responded in different ways. Diseases are the biological and psychological malfunctioning of the body physically. Illnesses deal with the psychology of the human where the psychosocial experiences bring on the sense of illness or disease.

4. '''Diagnosis/Divination''' -A [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/diagnosis diagnosis] is the act of identifying or determining the nature and cause of a disease or injury through the evaluation of a patient. [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/divination Divination] is the seeing of future events or somehow gaining unknown knowledge through the supernatural.

==Healers==


1. '''Acupuncturist''': One who inserts needles into various points on the body in order to relieve pain or to relax certain areas of the body. Although [[w:acupuncture|acupuncture]] scepticism among western medicine practitioners is somewhat common , it is still quite popular not only in its original country of China but also in many western countries.[3] {{ref|Altshul, Sara}} When acupuncture originated in China, it was founded on the belief that illnesses were caused by an imbalance of qi energy in the body. Qi energy is considered a universal energy that flows through lines in the body called meridians. The acupuncturist would insert a needle into points along the meridian in order to stimulate the blockage or imbalance of energy. Some modern Western medical scientists believe there is an alternative explanation to the idea of qi energy. They believe that success in acupuncture is due to the needles stimulating the nervous, endocrine, and lymphatic systems. In my experience with acupuncture, the needles are inserted in areas of the body that one would not normally associate with the problems they are experiencing. The placement of the needle in places other than where the patient is experiencing the pain causes hormones to relieve pain and thus relax the body. &lt;ref&gt; Katie Monicatti &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref&gt; nccam.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction.htm &lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Image:Acupuncture1-1.jpg|thumb|Needles being inserted into a patient's skin.]]

2. '''Bonesetter''': A person who treats or sets fractures, broken or dislocated bones. Bonesette originated from ancient Egyptian and Asian Cultures. Bonesetters are typically used to aid the healing the process of the bones, which will allow them to heal properly. This is essential in say athletes, where bone fractures or breaks are serious to their careers.

3. '''Chiropractor''': Chiropractors treat problems with the [[W:Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal system]] many times by manipulating the spine. It is a natural, drug free way of healing the nervous system and general health. Some practice methods such as water therapy, light, massage, ultrasound, acupuncture and heat.

4. '''Surgeon''': Surgeons have been around since the development of practitioners, and have evolved from such roles as &quot;bonesetters.&quot; A High profile position, many of today's surgeons go through extensive schooling of usually 8 or more years. A vast array of surgeon jobs is seen from plastic surgery to brain surgery these men and women are the top healers and medical professionals of our time. &lt;ref&gt;  http://education-portal.com/plastic_surgeon_schools.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GI at Guantanamo visits the dentist.JPG|thumb|Dentist works on patient]] 

5. '''Dentist''': One whose business it is to clean, extract, or repair natural teeth, and to make and insert artificial ones; a dental surgeon. This business is especially important in cultures in where physical appearance is of significant importance.
From the perspective of a middle class American, most Americans today receive good dental health care. Most people go to the dentist every six months for a cleaning or dental examine to check the health of their teeth. &lt;ref&gt; corey colbo &lt;/ref&gt;  

6. '''General Practitioner''': A medical practitioner who provides primary care and specializes in family medicine.

7. '''Herbalist''': A person who uses herbs (plants and plant extracts) as their way of healing and alleviating illness. Although the American health care system is based on more modern treatments; herbalists have the potential to make a tremendous contribution to America’s primary care crisis through health promotion, disease prevention, and affordable, ecologically sound treatment alternatives.&lt;ref&gt; The American Herbalist Guild. http://www.americanherbalistsguild.com/ &lt;/ref&gt; I do agree with this statement, but with my own herbalist, she recommends to go to a biomedical physician if you have any serious illness.

[[Image:Iraqi doctor.jpg|200px|right|An Iraqi doctor examining a little girl]]

8. '''Midwife''': A health care profession where providers give prenatal care to expecting mothers, attend the birth of the infant, and provide postpartum care to the mother and her infant. Midwives must be certified as such but do not need to be certified as a nurse, they are most commonly used in uncomplicated, low risk pregnancies. &lt;br&gt; Midwives spend time with the mother during her pregnancy, they are there to support the mother and encourage her to trust her instincts, ultimately letting nature take its course. Many medical doctors in this case would use preventive testing and medical technology such as ultrasounds and pain medication to monitor the birthing process. These techniques are usually unnecessary in uncomplicated deliveries, midwives will perform these if necessary but cannot do so without a doctors supervision. &lt;br&gt; In the past midwives were not obligated to have the extensive formal training they are today, they traditionally learned through apprenticeship and did not know how to fight infections. This resulted in a higher death rate of a mother and her child with midwives than with doctors. In order to give midwives the medical training they needed a school for certified American nurse-midwifery was founded in 1932.

9. '''Oneself''': Healing of ones self is usually used to heal spiritually, mentally or emotionally rather than physically. When it is used for physical purposes, this usually means that other health care is not available for the individual. &lt;br&gt;
Some cultures have individuals who are designated specialist in healing. Others such as the Subanun in Mandanao have no assigned healers, they are all active participants in the health of their kin and neighbors and are called upon to aid each other. &lt;br&gt;
Cancer is usually considered a disease that the power of oneself can heal. Positive thinking or having a positive, powerful attitude is believed to help heal. 

10. '''Psychiatrist''': A [[w:Psychiatrist|Psychiatrist]] a doctor who is certified in treating mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos074.htm &lt;/ref&gt;They are also authorized to prescribe medications to their patients.  Like a psychologist, psychiatrist treat illness by methods of psychoanalysis, psychotherapy. A psychiatrist is unique in that they are required to obtain medical certification as a doctor, whereas a psychologist, who has many of the same responsibilities as a psychiatrist is not. &lt;ref&gt; McKenzie Chambers, personal experience from studying psychology at Western Washington University &lt;/ref&gt;

11. '''Shaman''': A [[w:shaman|shaman]] is a practitioner of shamanism, is a mediator between the human and spiritual worlds. They are known for their ability to cure illness and to pass between the supernatural and natural worlds so as to provide answers for humans. Shamans are said to be able to use divination and to tell the future. Shamanism is used most commonly in Central Asia. [2] {{ref|Fock, Niels}}However, many cultures all over the world have a Shaman. Some cultures in South America and even cultures in Canada have a Shaman. Occasionally, as many Shaman as possible from the Americas, all from different cultures, will come together and practice various ceremonies together. Such as the &quot;sweat hut&quot; ceremony. The Shaman of a culture in Ecuador spoke of these Shaman &quot;conventions.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Breen, Coco: Ecuador &lt;/ref&gt; The Ju/'hoansi of Southern Africa have Shamans who can enter &quot;half death&quot; (what would be called &quot;trance&quot; in English). &quot;Half death&quot; enables them to travel to the world of the spirits to cure those who are sick. &lt;ref&gt; Cultural Anthropology, A perspective of the Human condition &lt;/ref&gt;


12. '''Massage Therapist''': A doctor who uses body pressing movements across another body to relieve stress as well as reduce side affects of cancer treatments; although the validity of its effectiveness is questioned though many stand by its success rate firmly. Its said to decrease heart rate and blood pressure, as well as anxiety and fatigue. Further more it releases toxins stored in the muscles and is a therapeutic way of healing for those that can afford it.    &lt;ref&gt; http://ict.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/2/4/332 &lt;/ref&gt;

13. '''Faith Healing''': Faith healing involves the placebo effect, which is a form of medication with no actual medicine in it.  However, the patient can still &quot;feel better&quot; when they take the treatment, even if it is not directly affecting the body.  This is because &quot;the patient has a certain belief in the treatment...the patient's belief leads him or her to expect that, following this treatment, he or she is likely to get better...&quot;  Consequently, he or she will quite literally mentally heal themselves. &lt;ref&gt; Lars Bäckman, Psychology at the Turn of the Millennium. http://books.google.com/books?id=Qut6bQZeXssC&amp;pg=RA1-PA224&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;ots=zzbgctnB4h&amp;dq=psychologist+healer&amp;lr=#PRA1-PA226,M1 &lt;/ref&gt;

14. &quot;Physiotherapist&quot; A health care professional who issues services and help to those in need of rehabilitation as a result of old age, injury or disease. The main goal is to promote the utmost range of movement and functionality of the body. Often a patient will meet with a PT and receive a diagnosis based on patient history and physical examination. After which a program based on the patients needs will be issued and followed through with. PT programs vary based on patient needs. &lt;ref&gt;^ American Physical Therapy Association Section on Clinical Electrophysiology and Wound Management. &quot;Curriculum Content Guidelines for Electrophysiologic Evaluation&quot; (PDF). Educational Guidelines. American Physical Therapy Association. Retrieved on 2008-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

15. '''Naturopath[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturopathy]''': A health care provider who follows a natural approach to healing of the body using natural remedies and the body's vital ability to heal and maintain itself. Naturopathic philosophy favors a holistic approach and minimal use of surgery and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturopathy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healing Substances==
Cultures use a variety of different substances for healing. Some cultures rely on drugs to induce a state of healing, while others put their lives in the hands of healers such as shamans to regain health. In many cases, people rely on both medical pluralism and medical syncretism. Medical pluralism refers to the employment of more than one medical system or the use of both conventional and complementary and alternative medicine, while medical syncretism is the fusing of traditional and biomedical practices. There were several healing methods mentioned during cultural anthropology 201 that serve as a prime example of various healing substances. It is important to note that in many cases the state of healing that is accomplished in one culture may not be able to be accomplished in another due to differing perspectives on how the substance is meant to affect a person. For example, there is a vast difference between the use of drugs for recreation and their use for healing. In some cultures it is believed that during drug use a person reaches a heightened state in which they are able to begin healing, whereas in other cultures this heightened state is used for pure enjoyment. 
	
The Peyote cactus is an example of a substance that it used in indigenous cultures in the Americas. It is a small, spineless cactus that is native to the southwest United States, parts of central Mexico, and primarily in the Chihuahuan desert. Peyote gives the consumer an enhanced feeling of deep introspection and insight that can be accompanied by audio or visual hallucinations. These hallucinations have made Peyote a sought after recreational drug leading to it becoming a controlled substance in many countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Peyote Legal Status by Erowid, March 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
With this heightened awareness of self, Peyote users can be healed of any type of spiritual, physical, or other social hindrance. Traditionally, peyote has also been used to heal toothache, pain experienced during childbirth, fever, breast pain, skin diseases, rheumatism, diabetes, colds, and blindness. 
[[Image:Flowering peyote cactus.jpg|thumb|left|A flowering peyote, in cultivation.]]
	
More examples of healing substances include magic mushrooms of Oaxaca, similar to the Peyote in which the consumer enters a psychedelic state and is able to allow the mushrooms to heal themselves spiritually and physically. Ayahuasca, a substance found surrounding Amazonian areas is also used to achieve psychedelic healing along with the San Pedro cactus found in the coastal parts of Peru. Coca, tobacco and alcohol can also be considered healing substances and are more prevalent across cultures than the aforementioned drugs. 

====Bee Sting Therapy====
Bee sting therapy can mostly be found in Asian countries such as Taiwan. The bee sting therapy has been found to help with many ailments from making you look younger to helping with arthritis, all the way to relieving symptoms of multiple sclerosis. There is no proof that the bee sting therapy is the reason for these results, but &quot;...scientists have found potent anti- inflammatory and germ fighting protein.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; National Geographic Taboo Video Series 2005, Creature Cures. Season Two. &lt;/ref&gt; Bee sting therapy is closely related to acupuncture, and some think that bees were initially used in the acupuncture process.

===Ethnobotany===
	[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnobotany Ethnobotany] is the analysis of indigenous plants that are used by a particular culture for food, medicine or other purposes.  The study of these plants is used to garner accurate understanding of their medical potential and cultural usage.   Someone who is trained in this field of work is called an ethnobotanist.  Their job is to travel to different locations in the world for the purpose of studying the relationships between plants and culture.  Their knowledge is gleaned from the perspective and information provided by the culture with which the plant is used.  Ethnobotanists look for plants which effectively treat disease or relieve symptoms. These plants can then be synthesized into medication to provide treatment for other populations. 
[[File:Mayan_priest_performing_healing.jpg|thumb|left|Mayan priest performing healing]]

The roots of ethnobotany can be traced back to an ancient Greek surgeon named Dioscorides.  He was the first person to organize plants into specific classifications.  Around AD 77 Dioscorides produced the publication, “De Materia Medica”, which consisted of information on all the plants he researched.  This botanical reference book compartmentalized approximately 600 plants.  It also included facts about the plants such as; what season it was in bloom, how to use it medicinally, its toxicity level and whether or not it was edible.  In 1542 Leonhart Fuchs achieved a similar feat when he published, “De Historia Stirpium”, another botanical reference book that catalogued plants indigenous Germany and Austria (the book contained information on about 400 plants).  Another important figure in the development of ethnobotany was John Ray.  He was the first person to understand and explain the concept of species; he also produced important publications such as, Catalogue of Cambridge Plants, Synopsis Methodica Avium et Piscium and Methodus Plantarum (works were published between 1660-1713).  The methods for categorizing plants continued to develop and it reached its apex with a Swedish medical student named Carl Linnaeus.  Linnaeus invented the classification system known as taxonomy.  This system of classifying organisms is still utilized in contemporary times.  His book, Species Plantarum, had listings for approximately 5,900 plants.  The term ethnobotany was developed by John Harshberger around 1895.  Harshberger was the professor of botany at the University of Pennsylvania.  He spent many years traveling the globe researching and cataloguing different regions native plant life.

=====[[w:Ibogaine|Ibogaine]]=====
[[File:Iboga.jpg|thumb|right|Iboga, a principal component of [[w:ibogaine|ibogaine]]]]
As stated previously, ethnobotany is the study of how a culture uses its indigenous plants for medicinal purposes.  The native plant species and their preparation for use are usually new and different (sometimes confusing) to the ethnobotanist.  An example of an idiosyncratic way of healing (pertinent to ethnobotany) can be seen in the religious rituals of the Bwiti.  Bwiti is a religion that is practiced by the people of Gabon (a country in west central Africa).  This particular creed relies heavily on the use of ibogaine (a powerful psychoactive which is derived from the root of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iboga ''Tabernanthe ibona''] shrub).  ''Tabernanthe iboga'' is indigenous to Gabon and is easily accessible to people of the Bwiti religion.  Iboga is most commonly ingested through chewing on the root of the shrub or brewing the plant into a tea.  The plant is revered by the Bwiti because of its hallucinogenic properties which cause practitioners to receive revealing visions and deep introspective self-contemplation.  Iboga is consumed for religious ceremonies, initiations, coming of age rituals and healing processes.  When a person within the Bwiti community becomes ill he or she is fed iboga to get in touch with their imbwiri.  The imbwiri is a spirit represented in human configuration which will either cure the individual or provide valuable information on the antidote.  Iboga was brought to Europe by French and Belgian researchers in the late 1800’s.  By the 1960’s ibogaine (although still rare) had been introduced to many different parts of the world. (mainly as a psychoactive drug).  The medical potential of this drug was discovered by a man named Howard Lotsof in 1963.  He realized that this substance could combat heroin and opiate addiction.  It also could alleviate the painful and mentally exhausting withdrawal symptoms.  Howard cured his own heroin addiction through this method and introduced ibogaine to his friends who were also habitual heroin users with positive results.  As time progressed ibogaine was found to be useful in treating many addictions including unhealthy reliance on cocaine, crack, alcohol, methamphetamine and nicotine.  Even though this drug showed potential towards battling addiction it was outlawed in many countries (including the U.S.) because of its hallucinogenic properties.  Although ibogaine has been marked illegal there are still underground clinics that provide full treatments serving the drugs medical ideology.  Research on ibogaine is still being conducted today and it could eventually become a fully marketable, synthesized anti-addiction medication.  

=====Candlenut Tree=====
The ''Kukui'' or Candlenut tree, is an example of an indigenous plant used by a culture for food, medicine, and other purposes. Native Hawaiians used the nut, sap, and leaves for various everyday uses. The nut, which produces copious amounts of oil, was strung onto palm fronds and used a torch  or candle (thus the name Candlenut). The nut was also roasted and sprinkled on food for added flavor, but it was also known to have laxative properties. The sap of the green nut was spread on cuts and cold sores to speed up healing. The leaves and flowers were used for making ''lei.'' As a child growing up in Hawaii, my friends and I made spinning tops out of the shell of the nut. Many visitors to Hawaii would recognize the ''Kukui'' nut as the black, shiny nut strung on ribbon to make a lei that lasts indefinitely.



'''THE CURE-ALL HERB''' 

from west Africa, Senegal. These two drinkin herbs drink keeps most of the people healthy 
'''Kinkiliba''' (combretum micrantum) is the most common herbal tea found throughout West Africa. Many West-Africans begin their morning with a cup of this powerful tea that is great for maintaining general health and well-being. Kinkiliba aids in the treatment of fevers, colds, flues, aches and pains. This herb is a natural diuretic and helps to speed up the healing process when one is ill. One may also apply solutions of the leaves or the roots to speed up the healing of old wounds. This miracle tea is also known to prevent malaria and lower blood pressure. The herb serves as an antibacterial and antispasmodic as well.  

THE DETOXIFYING HERB 

'''Kelle''' (khaya senegalensis) is a common herb used throughout West Africa for a body cleanser and energy booster. West Africans soak the bark in water and drink the mixture for a general detoxification and intestinal cleanser. Kelle is also used to bring down fevers and to combat general fatigue.

'''Acacia Senegal'''
 
the way of Uses - Gum arabic’s main effect is to form a protective soothing coating over inflammations in the respiratory, alimentary, and urinary tracts. In conjunction with various astringents, it is helpful for coughs, sore throat, and catarrh, as well as in cases of diarrhoea and dysentery. The mucilage makes a good vehicle for other medicines, in addition to having nutritional value in its own right. However, most of the gum arabic imported to USA goes to the food industry to give body and texture to products for bakers and a hard sheen coating on candies.  

'''Botanical Name''' - Acacia Senegal  
 
'''Common Names'''- Acacia Gum Powder, Cape gum, Egyptian thorn, Demulcent Gum, Gum Arabic Tree.  
 


'''Medicinal Marijuana'''

[[File:ST-3-bud.jpg|thumb|Some cannabis bud, which is well-cured (i.e. dried slowly following a specific procedure). The strain is Sweet Tooth #3]]

Marijuana is used in many cultures as a healing remedy for a great number of ailments.  Medicinal Marijuana is legal to possess in a few various states in America with an appropriate prescription showing your entitlement to the plant.  California has the greatest number of Marijuana dispensaries and the greatest number of legal cannabis users. However, due to the federal government's lack of support for medicinal marijuana, raids on dispensaries are still common. &lt;ref&gt; Laine, Miranda personal experience from watching the documentary &quot;Super High Me&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;It also means that an individual who uses marijuana with a legal prescription can be subject to federal punishment even though their state allows for prescription use of the drug.  Marijuana has long been sought out as a medicine for patients looking to 'ease the tension'.  It is primarily used as a pain reliever of muscle relaxant but it has also been claimed to help with insomnia, glaucoma, and alcoholism.  Cancer patients receiving radiation are also given the option to take the plant in order to settle the stomach and promote eating. For patients with Multiple Sclerosis, prominent in the Pacific North West and Northern Europe, Medicinal Marijuana is an effective and viable treatment for pain, muscle spasms, and the reduction of pressure in the optic nerves. 

Marijuana has been recognized and used as an effective remedy to various ailments for thousands of years. As early as the third century B.C. people had discovered the benefits of marijuana and partaken in its advantages.   Since then marijuana has been used for recreational, medicinal, and religious/spiritual purposes. In 1937 marijuana was criminalized in the U.S. after the Marihuana Tax Act, which included penalty provisions and detailed rules for handlers of marijuana. Violating this law could result in a fine of up to $2000 and five years in prison.   At the time a slogan used by proponents of the drug claimed that ‘marihuana’ caused “Murder! Insanity! Death!” &lt;ref&gt;Armentano, Paul. “The Drug War's Latest Tally: 872,721 Pot Arrests, an All-Time High” AlterNet. 16 Sept. 2008. 10 Oct. 2009. &lt; http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/98952 &lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Critics of Ethnomedicine'''

Although most individual ethnomedical practices have been criticized for various traits they possess (e.g. claims of spiritual healing being a hoax, psychiatry not being able to cure alcoholism), one argument stands out as criticizing almost all forms of ethnomedicine. This argument criticized the mental orientation of most forms of ethnomedicine. Biologist Horacio Fabrega Jr. Writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The implicit assumption adopted by the researcher is that he is dealing with a disorder that is either typically psychiatric or at least psychiatric-like. Excessive preoccupation with this dimension on the part of culturally oriented anthropologists has tended to obscure the influences that biological components have on [culturally defines] illnesses. Consequently, the potential of examining the reciprocal influences that phsychoculture and biological factors have on instances of illness occurrence [as defined and categorized by subjects] has been missed.    
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Doctors and anthropologist who practice ethnomedicine experience criticism for making the assumption that an ailment can be cured using ethnomedicine without weighing the possibility of biological medicine.    

'''American Ethnobotany'''

[[:Echinacea 3.jpg|thumb|right|Echinacea; The spiny flower center from which the name derives]]
There are many plants which play important roles in North American culture through medicine and recreation. One well known example is [[w: Echinacea|Echinacea]], a popular herbal remedy.  Echinacea is native to North America and has long been used by the Plains Indians for its medicinal properties. It is believed to shorten the duration of a cold and treat many of the symptoms such as coughing, sore throat and headache.  Recent studies have suggested that Echinacea has little or no effect on the duration or severity of a cold, and it is merely taken to provide some sort of comfort to the sick person. The effectiveness of Echinacea is still a subject of debate , but it remains a culturally important remedy in North American ethnobotany.

Goldenseal (Orange-root, Orangeroot; Hydrastis canadensis) is a perennial herb in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to southeastern Canada and the northeastern United States and is another prominent herb used in North America. Goldenseal was in extensive use among certain Native American tribes of North America, both as a medicine and as a coloring material. Goldenseal was extensively used for cancers and swellings of the breasts by the Eclectics, although it was not considered sufficient for cancer alone &lt;ref&gt; http://altmedicine.about.com/cs/herbsvitaminsek/a/Goldenseal.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

====Biopiracy====
[[File:Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves &amp; flowers in Kolkata W IMG 6199.jpg|right|thumb|Leaves and flowers of a Neem tree in Kolkata, West Bengal, India.]] [[w:biopiracy|Biopiracy]] is the appropriation, or patent, of indigenous biomedical knowledge by foreign entities without compensatory payment.  In other words, it is the illegal harvest of plants used by a particular culture for medicinal purposes by individuals from another culture. The 'piracy' or taking takes place when individuals or corporations patent these plants, the methods of processing plant based substances or the genetic information for their exclusive use and sale. The patent often prohibits the communities that identified the bio active properties, developed processing and extractive technologies and bred the plants, for using the plants for their purposes or selling the plants or plant based products in parts of the world where copyrights are enforced.


A related concept is [[w:Commercialization_of_traditional_medicines|bioprospecting]].  This term is sometimes used to refer to biopiracy with a less negative connotation, where the assumption is the patented item had a known use already.  Alternately, the bioprospecting company is searching for novel compounds or genes in items that were not used traditionally.  Companies can harvest plants or organisms with little to no opposition in some parts of the world, and then patent any part of them that ends up being useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An example of biopiracy is the [[w:Neem|Neem tree]] which has been used in India for over 2000 years for medicinal and other purposes. In 1995 a the [[w:US Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]]  and multinational [[w:WR Grace|WR Grace]].&lt;ref name='N000123'/&gt;, patented through the European Patent Office (EPO) the emulsions of Neem tree and is suing Indian firms for using it in products.  The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had actually been in use in India for over 2000 years. In 2000 the EPO ruled in India's favour but the US multinational mounted an appeal claiming that prior art  about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March  2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent rights keeping the tree free of any patent restrictions.&lt;ref name='N000123'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=India wins landmark patent battle | date=9 March, 2005 | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/sci/tech/4333627.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2009-10-02 | language =en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=Medical Systems=

'''Naturalistic System'''

An approach to the explanation, diagnosis, and treatment of illness which focuses on the underlying biomechanical processes behind human disorder. Naturalistic medicine is largely the foundation of the Western model of biomedicine and practitioners rely heavily on the use of imaging technologies and the scientific method to develop treatment plans. Philosophically, naturalists approach human disorder from the perspective that illness is impersonal and that there is always an identifiable source of pathology in the diagnostic process. 

'''Personalistic System'''

Largely uncommon in the developed world, the personalistic approach to medicine explains human disorder in terms of preternatural sources of pathology (such as spiritual possession or religious transgression). Illness is considered unique to the patient and medical practitioners often call upon supernatural forces to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of disorders. An example of this is the “evil eye.” A person who is envious of another’s good fortune may transfer malignant influence through the “evil eye”, which will result in harm to the recipient.  &lt;ref&gt; http://www.enotes.com/public-health-encyclopedia/theories-health-illness &lt;/ref&gt;

Modernly, personalistic systems of medicine are most commonly found in small-scale societies. Globally, the personalist approach in decline and has disappeared completely in some cultures. For example, therapeutic shamanism was commonly practiced amongst Inuit peoples and a complex tradition of spiritual healthcare was reported by early ethnographers (see Merkur 85). These traditions are now very rarely practiced and many of the traditional practices have been lost entirely (see [[W:Shamanism_among_Eskimo_peoples|Shamanism amongst Eskimo peoples]]).



==Medical Models==

Medical models are the explanations of health and illness that are accepted by different cultures. The biomedical model is the most widely accepted medical model by many cultures, including the vast majority of Western culture, but there are multiple other explanations that are accepted by some cultures.

The medical model of disability is a model by which illness or disability is the result of a physical condition, is intrinsic to the individual (it is part of that individual’s own body), may reduce the individual's quality of life, and causes clear disadvantages to the individual.

Some anthropologists believe that the biomedical model is quite provincial.  They do not believe that there is enough room for the interpretation of the psychological, behavioral, and social aspects of all of the illnesses.  Something called a biopsychosocial[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;196/4286/129] model has been proposed. In this there would be more room different aspects of health care.

===Humoral===
The term Humoral refers to elements in the blood or other fluids that reside within the body. In medicine,the term humor refers to a fluid substance. The aqueous humor is the fluid that normally resides within the front and rear chambers of the eye. The humors were part of an ancient theory that believed that health came from balance between the bodily liquids. These liquids were termed humors. If these fluids were not balanced, a person was more likely to become infected with diseases.

Paired qualities were associated with each humour and its season and element,the humors were: 
#Phlegm: winter, water, characteristics: rational, calm, unemotional 
#Blood: spring, air, characteristics: courageous, hopeful, amorous 
#Gall: (black bile thought to be secreted by the kidneys and spleen) autumn, earth, characteristics: guardian, despondent, sleepless, irritable 
#Choler: (yellow bile secreted by the liver) winter, water, characteristics: rational, calm, unemotional 

This theory which was also known as the humoral theory, humoralism, and humorism was devised before the time of Hippocrates (c.460-c.375 BC). Today pathology rests on a cellular and molecular foundation. All of the humors have been dispelled, except for the aqueous humor and vitreous humor of the eye.

The health and healing system of Haiti incorporates humoral-influenced concepts from West Africa.  Their system relies on monitoring and regulating their four humors (hot and cold, dry and wet).  Eventually their system was simplified, with the dry and wet humors being omitted.  They believe a balance is necessary to maintain good health.  The balance is affected by the season, how they live and especially how they eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Kallawaya Traditional Medicine===
The shamans of the Kallawaya people, located in the  Andes in Bolivia are an example of humoral medicine. They believe that health and illness are affected by the balance of spirit and soul caused by the earth, or the goddess Pachamama. Their healing art is based in their ability to look into the lives of the ill to see patterns in the day to day aspects such as work, health, routines and relationships and to recognize where there are imbalances.  Shamans make use of music, dance, and animal sacrifice to help appease the divine, thus curing illness.  The shamans use many herbs, for instance most of the Kallawaya healers have knowledge of at least 300 herbs. They also incorporate alcohol and ayahuasca, which, with the guidance of the shaman, can produce a drug-induced state of healing&lt;ref&gt; http://www.infohub.com/TRAVEL/SIT/sit_pages/4295.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Ayurveda===

[[Image:Dwanandhari Deva.jpg|thumb|left| Dwanandhari Deva is believed to be the Lord of Ayurveda]] Ayurveda is a 5000-year old traditional system of medicine in India that originated during the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas Vedic]] period of Indian history. [[http://www.chopra.com/ayurveda|Chopra]] It is also practiced as an alternative system of medicine in other parts of the world, where yoga, meditation, massage, or healing herbs or foods are used as a supplement to the biomedical model.

Ayurveda is a humoral system, in which blood, chyle, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, and semen are the primary elements. These are divided into air (or spirit), phlegm, and bile, each of which represent a divine force, or dosha. The three doshas are vata (air), pitta (bile) and kapha (phlegm). According to Ayurveda, humans are dominated by one or two of these doshas. Having a balance between the three means that one is in complete health. This balance is achieved through moderation of sleep, sexual intercourse, medicine, and food. Different types of foods are beneficial to people of different doshas. When the doshas are too far out of balance, it can lead to both physical and mental sickness.

Ayurvedic practices include hygienic rituals, ingestion of certain foods and herbs as treatments, and yoga or meditation. Balance between the physical and mental is an important aspect of Ayurvedic healing.

===Spiritual Healing===

[[Image:Tanumânasî kapalabhati.JPG|thumb|right|A man practices yoga meditation outside.]]

Spiritual healing practices transmit energy to a person in need through means of meditation, prayer, or the presence of a healer, and provide an alternative to standard medical procedures. It is part of the holistic approach to healing, which involves the unification and harmony of the mind, body, and spirit in order to achieve wellness. Because sickness often originates in the mind, spiritual healing can be beneficial in alleviating stress, coping with emotional issues, and increasing overall happiness. The absence of such mental problems can eliminate physical troubles. For example, meditation aids in lowering heart rate, decreasing high blood pressure, and lessening cholesterol levels because it clears and calms the mind to the extent that stress does not affect the physical state of the body. 

A popular and recommended act of spiritual healing, is found in Yoga.  It has been said by many that it allows and gives a sense of self awareness, benefits to positive mental presentation, and overall stressing personal strength and confidence in living a spiritual healthy lifestyle. 

In various cultures, healers who practice spiritual healing believe that human beings are surrounded by healing mechanisms in the form of energy, which maintain a balance and order between mind, body, and spirit. A healing procedure often begins with a healer hovering his or her hands above a patient’s body to uncover areas where energy is blocked and healing is needed. Healing energy is then transported through the healer’s hands and into the patient. 

Religion often plays a role in spiritual healing in that people form a relationship with a higher source and are able to channel energy from such a source. This being could be God, nature, or something else meaningful to the individual. It is important to note that if the individual who chooses to form this connection holds full commitment and trust in the higher source, feelings of security, peace of mind, and guidance and are likely to follow, all of which are essential in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

For millennia other cultures around the world have used natural euphoria inducing drugs to better connect with the spiritual world.  Though governments around the world have banned the use of drugs for such purposes, their medical and spiritual capabilities remain true.  Researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that in a controlled experiment test subjects were feeling and behaving better fourteen months after consuming Magic Mushrooms &lt;ref&gt;CBS News (original ref author Roland Griffiths of Johns Hopkins) http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/01/tech/main4221948.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_4221948 &lt;/ref&gt;.  There is evidence in caves of the Sahara tracing the use of Magic Shrooms back to nearly 7,000 BC to connect with the spiritual realm.



'''Pranic Healing''' goes beyond just mental or physical or even emotional healing. It provides the right training and scope for those who are interested in spiritual practises, and offers a structured platform for achieving illumination through soul-realisation and later, God-realisation. Pranic Healing is an ancient science and art that has been adapted and systematized by the founder of modern Pranic Healing, Grand Master Choa Kok Sui. It has been used to heal countless people through the ages. The principle is simple. We know that every living being possesses the inborn ability to heal itself. Pranic Healing simply enhances this healing process by utilizing the energy of life. This energy is called 'Prana' (life-force) in Sanskrit. For those who are on a quest for spirituality, Pranic Healing can help too. 
To promote health and the knowledge of Pranic Healing in the developing world, Grand Master Choa Kok Sui established the World Pranic Healing Foundation, Inc. in Manila, Philippines in 1990. WPHF has in turn set up a subsidiary company in Bangalore, World Pranic Healing India Private Limited.   
There are currently 12 Pranic Healing Foundations in India working under license from World Pranic Healing India Private Limited, to promote the teachings of GMCKS around India. More Foundations will be set up in the near future
Definition: A no-touch natural healing system that utilizes prana or vital energy to cleanse and energize the human energy body, and to accelerate the natural healing power of the physical body.

===Kundalini Tantric Yoga===

A popular form of spiritual healing is found in Kundalini Tantric Yoga, practiced in various parts of India and the United States. Kundalini energy refers to dormant or spiritual energy within the body that we are usually unaware of.  Once Kundalini energy is activated through deep meditation and yoga, the nadi system, referring to channels of Kundalini energy, is activated as well. This creates a connection between the seven levels of chakras, or centers of consciousness potential that reside along the spine. Each chakra corresponds to a set of desires connected to a certain element. 

[[File:Chakras.jpg|thumb|The seven different chakras pictured in their locations, with the exact number of petals each chakra is said to have.]]
The first of the seven chakras is called the Muladhara. Its color is red and it is said to lie between the genitals and the scrotom. It governs sexuality and instinct. The second chakra is orange and it is called the Svadhisthana. It lies on the belly and is said to govern, among other things, creativity. Manipura is the third. It is yellow, lies just under the solar plex and controls one's will power. The fourth chakra is the Anhata. Anhata is located near and governs the heart. It is the color green. Vishuddha is the fifth. Its color is turquoise and it governs the voice. It is located in the throat. Ajna, the sixth, is indigo blue. It lies in the brain and governs wisdom. The final chakra can only be tapped upon once all the other chakras have energy flowing through them. It is called Sahasrara. It is purple and it brings enlightenment. It sits on top of the head and is said to inspire universal consciousness and unity.

The goal of Kundalini Tantric yoga is to free oneself from such desires as energy moves higher and higher along the chakras, opening them until it reaches the seventh chakra, called the Sahasra Chakra, located at the top of the cranium. A person can move energy through his or her chakras through tantric yoga, a form of yoga in which one seeks to free the mind of desires through various breathing exercises, contemplation, and meditation. When the seventh chakra is finally opened, a person is said to achieve full consciousness and liberation from the slavery of desires.  Through the spiritual experiences one has encountered with the opening of each chakra, the result is inner harmony and overall happiness, which are significant aspects of living a positive, healthy lifestyle. 

On a religious note, Hindu mythology offers an explanation for the movement of Kundalini energy throughout the body as one practices Tantric yoga. It is said that the serpent goddess Kundalini Shakti resides at the base of the spine, coiled up around the first chakra. As energy is activated and released through Tantric Yoga, she awakens and rises up the spine, opening the chakras along the way and energizing these conscious potentials. When she reaches the seventh chakra, she is united with her spouse, the God Shiva. Shiva is a symbol of change and the destruction of old habits. Their union leads to the liberation of the individual practicing the yoga, turning them into an “individual of the universe.”

===Western Biomedical Model===
[[Image:Monoclonal antibodies4.jpg|thumb|Cell culture vials.]]
This is the most popular medical model in medicine today and can be found all across Western societies, as well as others. It looks at humans as scientific organisms in order to discover methods for curing diseases and treating illness. This model focuses mainly on physical processes, such as physiology and biochemistry, disregarding social or spiritual factors. Under the biomedical model, health is defined as the absence of pain or disease, and the body is thought to be able to be fixed with scientifically based treatments. 

It should be noted that the Western approach to biomedical theory and practice is constantly adapting in response to new scientific and philosophical revelations regarding illness.The model focuses on the treatment and cure of disease through science, and does not promote disease prevention. In recent years, naturopathic medicine (once largely considered at odds with orthodox biomedicine)has gained recognition as a viable facet of treatment for a wide variety of disorders.

One of the criticisms of the Western Biomedical Model is that it discounts the personal knowledge and beliefs of its participants. The system is said to consider ‘professional knowledge’ as the correct, rational, scientific approach while lay beliefs are considered non-rational, unscientific, suppressions and thus discounted. This leads to potential tension between health care providers and patients.  &lt;ref&gt; http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=278223 &lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographic example: The [http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_western_health_model_biomedical_model biomedical model] has been critical in the development of our country. One of the many influences it has had was treating [[w:tuberculosis|tuberculosis]], a life threatening infectious disease. In 1880, after studying the disease scientist could confirm it was contagious. Even before antibiotics this helped to dramatically decrease the number of people that died by using quarantining and sanitizing methods. In the mid 20th century, when antibiotics were discovered, an effective cure for the disease was developed. Many strains have become resistant to certain drugs however, and the medical field has been forced to develop several ways to fight the disease.



====Immunization====
[[File:Child vaccine.jpg|thumb|Infant being administered a measles vaccine in Kibati, Congo ]]

The term immunization refers to rendering an organism immune to a specific communicable disease (1). Immunizations work by triggering the human body to produce antibodies that will help fight a particular disease. The antibody response is created by injecting a small amount of either a dead or live virus, (depending on the virus) into the person receiving the immunization in order to initialize a immune system response to the virus (2). Therefore in the future if the person who was immunized was exposed to the virus, he or she would already have the antibodies to fend off the virus. Along with the introduction and transmission of many new complex diseases, population growth and the globalization of medicine has brought about the eradication of many previously devastating disorders, including small pox and polio, through wider availability of immunizations. Many parents in Western countries routinely schedule immunizations for their children to prevent them from contracting a specific communicable disease. While many vaccinations are routine and readily available only in developed nations, the continued globalization of medicine will eventually have a dramatic effect on the improvement of health care in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;. ref: http://www.answers.com/topic/immunization &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; ref: href=&quot;http://www.wisegeek.com/how-do-immunizations-work.htm#il&quot;&gt;Source: How Do Immunizations Work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great deal of controversy over vaccination. Issues over the morality, ethics, necessity and safety has led some parents to keep their children from being vaccinated. Opponents of vaccines claim that they are dangerous, ineffective or infringe on personal rights.

And example of this is the current debate over whether or not certain vaccines cause autism in children. There is a small but dedicated group of doctors who claim that vaccines may be linked to the onset of autism in children. As a result many parents are insisting their children be exempt from the mandatory vaccines although there are no medical findings which prove the link between the two. &lt;ref&gt; http://specialchildren.about.com/od/autismandvaccines/i/vaccines_2.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

=Globalization and Health=
==Epidemiologic Transitions==
; New Infectious Diseases : A disease that emerges within a population that is new or the number of infectious cases within a population or geographic area rapidly increases. Since 1940 over 300 new infectious diseases have been discovered, some of the most well known being severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), methicillin-resistant staph (MRSA), and [[w:AIDS|Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)]]. Many drug-resistant strains of diseases are becoming more common and 71% of these new infectious diseases start in the wildlife. As globalization increases, infectious diseases will continue to affect a larger and wider population. {{ref|webmd.com}} Classification of disease is as follows; an epidemic is a local outbreak of a rare disease. When this disease spreads through many human populations across a large region, it is then classified as a pandemic.

; Medical Plurism : The integration of biomedicine and other forms of health care. Examples of medical pluralism include taking antibiotics and vaccines upon acute trauma or infection, as well as relaxation rituals to decrease stress and improve mental health. Medical pluralism includes involving different wellness techniques to improve, maintain, and prevent overall well-being. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pluralism]

; Diseases of Development : The main causes of illness and death in developed countries are cancer and diseases of the respiratory, cardiovascular and nervous systems. In the developing world, communicable diseases are the main problem, with deaths occurring primarily due to respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, infections at birth, diarrhoeal disease and tropical diseases such as malaria. Failure to use existing treatments effectively, inadequate or non-existent interventions, and insufficient knowledge of disease all contribute to damaged health. 

; Health Definition : Along with this increased communicability there has come a more unified definition of health itself. There are many organizations that work worldwide to increase the quantity of life around the globe. One such organization is the World Health Organization. They describe health as “A state of complete physical, mental, and social well being and not merely in the absence of disease and infirmity”.

===Some Diseases that are Intensified Due to Globalization===
1.[[W:Malaria|Malaria]] 
[[Image:Malaria.jpg|thumb|right|Malaria.]]

•Falciparum Malaria is a vector borne infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites. It kills around one million people per year, mostly children.  Even though initiative was taken to eradicate the disease after WW2, it prevails in many parts of the world. In some areas, globalization is fostering an increase in malaria. In low income countries, economic hardships have made it difficult to install strong mosquito control programs. Also, global warming may extend the latitude and altitude of malaria because misquotes thrive in certain temperatures. An example of how malaria can be brought from one country to another on the other side of the world can be seen in a close friend of mine who traveled to Kenya a couple of years ago.  He had all of the necessary vaccines to travel to Kenya, despite this, he still contracted malaria.  The good news is that he can afford the medications necessary to control the disease and has not caused any form of an outbreak in the U.S. thanks to precautions taken by the U.S. to eradicate the disease. All of this is to show that it is still possible to contract the disease even if one is from a developed country.

2.[[W:Chagas Disease|Chagas Disease]] 
[[Image:Carte maladie Chagas.png|thumb|250px|Chagas in [[Latin America]] (A:[[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]] zones)]]

•Land clearance in South America has spread the triatomine bugs to much of the continent. Due to economic adversity and social unrest,  there has not been a great stride in establishing sufficient housing. As more virgin forests are deforested the more the disease is able to spread to people. There is however effective control programs that are fighting the disease. The disease is usually spread by insect through the sucking of blood, it can also be spread by mother to fetus, blood transfusions, organ transplants and food that is contaminated with the disease. 

3.[[W:Leishmaniasis|Leishmaniasis]] 
•Is transmitted by the bite of a female sandfly. This disease is spread most rapidly when people live in a newly deforested area. In the 1980’s there was a huge housing crisis because the population of the Brazilian city of Amazonians doubled. The disease flourished because of their high adaptability to the human blood. 

4.[[W:Lyme Disease|Lyme Disease]] 
•This ancient bacterial infection is returning to North America, Europe and temperate Asia resulting in a skin rash, swollen joints and flu like symptoms. Some suspect that this is due to the reversion of farmland to woodland, which led to the increase of deer that possess the ticks. Also, the deer’s predators were killed over a century ago in the deforestation. 

5.[[W:Dengue|Dengue]]

•Uncontrolled urbanization and inadequate management of water and waste has led to increase of this disease. Cases have increased 20-fold since the 1950’s. Air travel has allowed the disease to create newer more deadly versions of itself, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever.  It had been found that 8% of diseases that tourist catch while overseas are Dengue.  Dengue often starts with a headache muscle and joint pains fever, and rash. The rash usually appears on the lower limbs and the chest and continues to spread over the body.

6. AIDS: 
Possibly the greatest pandemic of our generation, AIDS is responsible for over 2.1 million deaths, 330,000 of which are children.  Three quarters of these deaths have occurred in sub-Sahara Africa.  Though globalization helped to spread this disease around the world through a greater global connectivity, it is also helping to clean up its own mess.  Globalization has allowed for the flow of information about safe sex practices and sterile drug practices to avoid further infections.  By becoming one of the greatest killers of our time, AIDS has also brought awareness to most of the world and has recruited millions to fight against it.

=Mental Health and Culture Bound Syndromes=
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture-specific_syndrome Culture Bound Syndromes] are those in which changes in behavior and experiences have substantial effects on peoples lives.  These illnesses are not &quot;sicknesses&quot; but rather identified as syndromes. A syndrome is a group of symptoms when present together are characteristics of a specific disorder, disease, etc.{{ref|www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/54246?pagenumber=2}}   The patterns of the symptoms that characterize or indicate can be of a particular social condition like heavy pollution. Syndromes can be a culture bound syndrome like Anorexia Nervosa or they can be a biological syndromes like Down’s Syndrome. The word syndrome comes from the Greek meaning “run together”. Medical anthropology describes culture-bound syndrome as a combination of psychiatric and somatic symptoms that are considered to be an identifiable disease that is only discovered within a specific society or culture. There are no changes in the biochemical or structural of body organs or functions, and the disease is not recognized in other cultures. A substantial portion of mental disorders are at least partially if not completely conditioned by the culture in which they are found. Some disorders however are more culture-specific than others. The concept of culture-bound syndromes is a controversial subject to which many psychologists, medical doctors and anthropologists reject the concept.  

Culture bound syndromes can include:
===Obesity===
	
[[Image:Botella CocaCola.jpg|thumb|High-fructose corn syrup, found in most soda beverages, is public enemy number one in the war against obesity.]]
Obesity is a condition affecting more than 300 million people (&lt;ref&gt;Backgrounder, International Food Information Council Foundation. http://www.ific.org/nutrition/obesity/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;) common in mainly first world countries, that affects millions of people. It is a term used to describe a person who is so overweight that is has become the cause of many other afflictions that could potentially threaten a person’s life. A person is ''obese'' when their body mass index exceeds 30 kg/m2(&lt;ref&gt;Backgrounder, International Food Information Council Foundation. http://www.ific.org/nutrition/obesity/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;)The World Health Organization(WHO) considers obesity to be one of the top 10 causes of preventable death worldwide.  It is a ''Culture Bound Syndrome'' that exists almost entirely in the richest countries in the world. Overweight individuals in developing countries are considered attractive and desirable due to the connotations of this; excess wealth and the ability to live lavishly and abundantly. This is the opposite in developed countries where thinness implies wealth. One who is wealthy can eat a balance and healthy (thus more expensive) died and has the luxury, time and money to exercise in either a gym or with the help of a personal trainer.

===Ataque de Nervios===

Commonly found in Hispanics.Out-of-consciousness state resulting from evil spirits. Symptoms include attacks of crying, trembling, uncontrollable shouting, physical or verbal aggression, and intense heat in the chest moving to the head. These ataques are often associated with stressful events (e.g., death of a loved one, divorce or separation, or witnessing an accident including a family member). 

===Mal de Ojo===

Medical problems, such as vomiting, fever, diarrhoea, and mental problems (e.g., anxiety, depression), could result from the mal de ojo (evil eye) the individual experienced from another person. Mal de Ojo is initiated when a person of higher strength gazes upon the weaker counterpart out of envy or admiration &lt;ref&gt;Mal de Ojo. http://altmed.creighton.edu/MexicanFolk/mal_de_ojo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. The condition is common among infants and children; adults might also experience similar symptoms resulting from this mal de ojo. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnstate.edu/robertsb/306/culture%20bound%20syndromes.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anorexia===

[[Image:Lindsay Lohan.jpg|thumb|Pop icons suffering from Anorexia have raised popular awareness to this disease.]][[w:Anorexia Nervosa|Anorexia Nervosa]],a westernized eating disorder, commonly shortened to anorexia. Anorexia Nervosa is a psychiatric illness which is specifically defined as the obsessive fear of gaining weight. Most commonly this disorder affects teenage girls, but males account for 10% of the reported cases. [[w:Bulimia Nervosa|Bulimia Nervosa]] is also a similar culture-bound syndrome to Anorexia Nervosa in which purging is the method of losing weight. Many times people who have these eating disorders though do not have one strict eating disorder. It tends to be a combination of anorexia, bulimia and binge eating. For example, a person may restrict themselves to not eating, but if they do they may go and work out excessively and then binge eat after &lt;ref&gt;Alexis Gradwohl, Skyline High School, Developmental Sciences Teacher, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases however, these eating disorders are developed as a coping mechanism for problems other than the common fear of weight gain. Providing its victims with a sense of control, anorexia and bulimia can help ease the mind even if the goal is to find stability in areas other than weight loss.

The process used to initially lose and prevent weight gain is voluntary starvation, but other methods such as purging, excessive exercise and the use of dietary pills are used also to control body image. One of the proposed reasons for the cause of this disease is the effect of images portrayed by the media on young women and men, demanding a necessity to be slim, because that is the only socially acceptable way to look

The [[w:DSM IV|DSM IV]] outlines the criteria utilized to diagnose anorexia nervosa; which includes dropping 15% below ones recommended body weight for his or her height.  Accompanying this extreme weight loss is an unnatural fear of gaining weight; severe delusions about one’s own body and amenorrhea.

There are two subtypes of Anorexia Nervosa also outlined in the DSM IV.  The first is the restricting type.  This is characterized by food restriction and starvation,  The second subtype is the [[w:binge eating|binge eating]]- [[w:purging|purging]] type.  This is characterized by the consumption of large amounts food followed by self induced vomiting or use of laxatives.    

Anorexia Nervosa disorder also severely interferes with social functioning, those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa tend to suffer academically and withdraw from friends and family. It is a disorder that is often met with a great deal of scepticism and unfortunately many refuse to recognize the severity of this condition.  People incorrectly assume that if the affected person wants to get better, all they need to do is start eating. Sadly this is a debilitating disorder that affects both body and mind; and will likely affect those diagnosed, for the rest of their lives.  This disorder is met with severe mental distortions, for which there is no simple remedy.  People who are diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa develop severe heart and health problems, as well as being at higher risk for developing depression and suicidal tendencies.  Approximately 10% of diagnosed cases result in death.  

Many who are diagnosed usually have several underlying issues that are entirely unrelated to food.  Often they maintain unrealistic ideas of perfection and a severe need for personal control, for many, managing their food intake fills this need.  Each person has the ability to restrict what goes into their own body and as a result, they begin to associate the declining number on the scale with self control.  Initially many of these people are met with praise from their peers for their weight loss, resulting in positive reinforcement.  Some begin to link weight loss with acceptance, popularity and self worth.  Once these associations are made it is extremely difficult to extinguish them; particularly in countries that value and idealize unrealistic images of beauty and weight. Even though there are many treatment facilities available that treat both of the mental and physical aspects of this disorder very few people ever fully recover. Therefore it is believed that the most successful form of treatment is prevention.

There are many cultural aspects that influence this disorder as well.  The prevalence of this disorder is much higher in the United States and other western countries.  Many have suggested that young men and women are often exposed to false ideas of perfection.  Specifically in the United States, the majority of advertisements, television shows, movies and magazines most are exposed to, depict images of men and women with a body type that less than 5% of the people of the general population actually possesses.  This may account for the higher frequency of this disorder in specific regions.  As a result, many programs for example the Dove campaign, which supports and promotes body acceptance, pressuring the concept of &quot;Real Beauty,&quot; through their billboards with real women with curves and imperfections, their explanations of airbrushing further  help, support and counteract the development of unrealistic ideologies relating to weight and beauty.

Equally dangerous and even more prevalent in American society is the issue of overeating and obesity in children and teens.  Over the past decade, the obesity rate in children has increased dramatically; the Center for Disease Control found that the obesity rate in children ages 6-12 has increased from 6.5% to 17% in the last 25 years. http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/childhood/prevalence.htm) . There are many causes for this increase including misinformation about diets, an increase in hobbies unrelated to physical activity (video games, computer games etc.) and a decrease of time spent in Physical Education classes throughout schooling.  

'''Symptoms include:'''
-Loss of at least 3 regular menstrual periods (in women).
-Refusing, avoiding, or not wanting to eat in public
-Anxiety
-Weakness
-Brittle skin
-Shortness of breath
-Obsessiveness about calorie intake
-muscle loss/degeneration
-Additionally, anorexic people have a tendency to create a distorted, negative view of themselves
'''Differences Between Anorexia and Bulimia:'''
-People who suffer from bulimia typically eat large quantities of food and then purge, referred to as (binge and purge). 
-Anorexics suffer from lack of food ingestion.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web

===Amok===

Malaysian sudden mood change/aggression.

[[w:Amok|Amok]] is the psychological disorder where males who typically have never acted out before experience a sudden mood change and become violent and angry. Deep shame experienced by the male often seems to be the cause of the sudden mood changes such as jealousy and gambling losses. People suffering from a mood change will often attempt to hurt or kill anyone they run into.  Often people who have these mood shifts will end up being killed by a bystander out of self-defense or other reasons, or the person suffering from Amok will commit suicide. The word was derived from the Malay, Indonesian and Filipino word &quot;amuk&quot; which means &quot;mad with rage.&quot; The term has been changed into slang in the United States and the phrase [[W:Running Amok|Running Amok]] is used to describe someone who is acting crazy or can't control themselves.

===Dhat Syndrome===

The patient is preoccupied with the excessive loss of semen by nocturnal emissions. There is a fear that semen is being lost and mixed in urine.  
In the Hindu culture and religion, it is believed that &quot;40 meals create one drop of blood, 40 drops of blood create one drop of bone marrow and 40 drops of marrow create one drop of semen.&quot;  It is thought in the Hindu culture in India, although not isolated there, that the loss of semen can deteriorate your health and create health problems. Symptoms of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhat_syndrome Dhat Symdrome] are depression, preoccupation, trouble sleeping, inability to perform sexually, exhaustion and headaches, and others. In order to treat these symptoms of depression and anxiety, counseling or anti-anxiety or anti-depression medications have been found to be of use.

Retraction into body. (Malay Koro, Sudan melting penis/cell   phone phenomenon)

•[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genital_retraction_syndrome Genital Retraction syndrome] is a culture bound syndrome occurring mostly in African and Asian men. This syndrome causes the men to think that their penis is going to shrivel into their stomach and that they will die. In South East Asia this syndrome has become known as “Koro”, which means “head of the turtle”. It can also be referred to as penis panic.  In this case a large group of men can become panicked about their genitalia disappearing.  Often these fears come about in cultures where witchcraft is used, or where biological education isn’t available. In 1997 lynch mobs in Ghana attacked foreigners they accused of being sorcerers capable of shrinking men’s penises.

===Latah===
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7365478 Latah] is a culture-bound syndrome that exist in Malaysian and Indonesian cultures. People showing signs of this syndrome respond to minimal stimuli with exaggerated startles. Sometimes, after becoming started, people suffering from this syndrome will obey the commands or imitate the actions of the people around them. Most occurrences of Latah are intentionally provoked to act as entertainment for those surrounding. Latah is very closely tied to specific factors in the cultural systems of the Southeast Asian societies in which it is found.  The Latah syndrome exemplifies the very dynamic and complex ways in which neurophysiological, experiential, and cultural variables coincide with each other to produce a strongly marked phenomenon in these cultures.
It is most widely known as a hyperstartling condition which mainly occurs in Malayan cultures. Latah is also the name for those who have the condition, which consist mainly of adult women.  During episodes of this behavior, Latah's are usually not held responsible for their actions. It is also closely related to another condition called [[W:Hyperexplexia|Hyperexplexia]].
(SE Asia women, obey, not responsible for acts)

===Piblokto===
[[Image:Inuit-Kleidung 1.jpg|thumb|right|Two Inuit women and child. Origin: Taken by Angsar Walk [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inuit-Kleidung_1.jpg]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piblokto Piblokto], pronounced (pee-block-toh) and loosely translated from Inuit to English means &quot;running crazy&quot; is a hysterical/dissociative state. It occurs mostly in the winter season and typically shown in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit Inuit] or Eskimo women and is characterized by short attacks of disturbed behavior that are not remembered by the individual afterwards. 

The symptoms can include running naked through the snow, an insensitivity to extreme cold, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia coprophagia] (the consumption of feces), [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echolalia echolalia] (the repetition of words), depression, screaming, crying, and violence towards other people and animals.
Piblotko is most often seen in women of the Inuit tribe. These people inhabit the areas of northern Canada,Greenland, the coastal regions of Alaska and north eastern Asia/Russia. They are able to inhabit very harsh conditions, and tolerate the snow and ice of the Arctic tundra for most of the year. There has never been a recorded case of Piblotko in children, although women in tribal groups have been recorded as having as many as 5 attacks of hysteria a day.
The Inuit people's diet mainly consists wild game, whale and seal meat. A diet high in protein, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium#Controversial_health_effects selenium], and fats may help these people escape the risks of cancer but not the biological/psychological malady of Piblotko.
Although commonly thought of as a psychological ailment, Piblotko may be linked to vitamin A toxicity, or hypervitaminosis A. Vitamin A toxicity is caused by an overconsumption of pre-formed Vitamin A, which is the result of high amounts of vitamin A in the diet at one time. This can lead to altered mental state, confusion, headache,and irritability, as well as many symptoms that are common to Piblotko. Piblotko has also been recorded in Inuit dogs and while these dogs are not considered infectious, they are shot when symptoms first occur and then eaten by the tribe.
SAD- seasonal affective disease can loosely be linked to this syndrome as the weather and light are factors that play straight into symptoms like depression.

===Susto===

Susto is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_illness: Folk Illness] that is most commonly found in Latin America. The term &quot;susto&quot; comes from the Portuguese and Spanish word for fright. In this way, the illness is called “fright sickness”. It is also referred to as &quot;spirit attacks,&quot; most common among Native Americans. The disease is usually generated from a traumatic experience like the death of a loved one, an accident, or anything else that might cause physiological pain. It is most common in women but can also be found in men and children. The illness in not recognized by Western Traditional Medicine, but is commonly compared to anxiety disorders. 

Symptoms of susto can be nervousness, anorexia, insomnia, listlessness, despondency, involuntary muscle tics, and diarrhea.  Treatments of this illness are mostly natural and herbal, such as consuming marijuana teas, Brazil wood, and orange blossom.  The most effective treatments are done by what is called a healer and can include different sort of rituals. The closer these rituals are practiced to when the traumatic experience occurred, the better. It is also very important to recognize the event and not suppress it.

Susto is often compared to other biomedical illnesses. In 2002 studies about susto were conducted in; Latin communities, the United States, Mexico and Guatemala.  First they defined susto in the different communities. Although the definition differed from region to region, the main idea was that susto was an illness caused by fright, and not necessarily loss of soul. It was seen as a serious illness that could even lead to death.  But to better understand this folk illness, in biomedical culture and culture I am familiar with in United states, susto is best related to depressive disorders, post traumatic stress disorder, and somatoform disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Loue, Sana, Martha Sajatovic, and Jeffrey L. Longhofer. Diversity Issues in the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Research of Mood Disorders. illustrated. United States: Oxford University Press , 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opsophagos===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsophagos Opsophagos] was an ancient Greek label given to anyone who had an extreme and irrepressible desire for eating fish. 

The term is a definition one’s character, not literally their general palate for fish. Charging someone with the term is directed in a very negative manner- it parallels being indicted with having over-indulgent behavior, a taboo in Greek society. Opsophagos is synonymous with words like unsophisticated and barbaric- words opposite of rationality. The fish is simply a symbol for overindulgence.

Greek tall tales describe an opsophagos as a gluttonous and greedy man who would consume all prepared fish, sharing none with anyone. The painted image of an opsophagos was the opposite of an ideal human- a man with a heat-resistant throat to handle fish too hot for anyone else to eat, thus keeping the fish for only themselves.

Opposite of America’s Judeo-Christian tradition, Greek thought and morality is more flexible than the orthodox, black and white view of simple rights or wrongs. For example, instead of ruling out women or wine, Greeks believe in “nothing in excess”-enjoy life’s pleasure but under control. This is contrary to the American idea of suppressing vices and how negative habits should be cut out out completely “cold turkey”.

===Ghost Sickness===
[[Image:Mojave DustDevil.jpg|thumb|right|A Dust Devil is an example of a manifestation of Ghost Sickness]]
Ghost Sickness originates from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Nation Navajo Nation] and is believed to be a psychotic disorder associated with death. 
Common symptoms include fatigue, recurring nightmares, hallucinations, and a constant feeling of terror. The people of the Navajo Nation believe that a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chindi Chindi] causes Ghost Sickness. A Chindi is the ghost of the Navajo Tribe and many believe that this ghost is released during a person’s dying breath, and it is also believed to nearly always be an evil force. A common manifestation of a Chindi is believed to be a Dust Devil, and the direction they spin signifies whether it is a ‘good’ Chindi or a ‘bad’ one; a clockwise spin is considered good – a counter-clockwise is considered bad. Other Native American tribes have modified beliefs of Ghost Sickness and have attempted to prevent or avoid passing it on. For example, the Lakota Tribe attempted a ban on mourning rituals in order to avoid the illness in the 1800's, but many still practice modified rituals.

===Windingo===
Windigo (or Witiko)  A culturally bound syndrome found among the  Algonkian Indians, NE United States and Eastern Canada.  Windigo is the famous syndrome of obsessive cannibalism or the consumption of another’s flesh. Windigo has fallen under skeptical eyes and too many is now somewhat discredited. A modern medical diagnosis of this condition would probably label it paranoia due to the irrational perceptions of being persecuted for suffering from Windingo. Fear of prosecution is prevalent among victims of Windingo because of the cultural universal that eating humans is wrong. Windigo was supposed to have been brought about by consuming human flesh in desperate circumstance such as famine situations. Afterwards, the individual who consumed flesh was supposed to be haunted by cravings for human flesh and thoughts of killing and eating humans.  In other words Windigo is the unwanted transformation into a cannibal.

In the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States where climate was harsh, Windingo would develop among families whom were isolated in their homes due to heavy snow storms and thus had inadequate food and supplies.  Symptoms of Windigo include vomiting and lack of appetite. The individual suffering would then begin to develop delusions of him or herself believing they are becoming a Windigo Monster. People suffering from Windigo psychosis claim to see others as edible which only increases with time. As the individual becomes aware of the transformation they begin to deeply fear becoming a cannibal. Victims of Windigo psychosis often experience severe panic and anxiety. Suicide is common in order to prevent themselves from becoming Windigo monsters. {{ref|[http://homepage.mac.com.maccajor/cbs_frame.html][http://plato.stanford.edu/]}}

===Zar===

'''Zar'''[http://web.archive.org/20070717095352/homepage.mac.com/mccajor/cbs_frame.html] is experienced in Ethiopia, Somalia, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, and other places in the Middle East and North Africa.  The feeling you get when you have zar is spirit possession.  Some symptoms that could occur are dissociative episodes with shouting, laughing, singing, weeping, or hitting the head against some sort of surface.  Individuals may refuse to do simple tasks such as eat or go about their tasks in daily life.  They also may show withdrawal and apathy.  In some cases the person might develop a long-term relationship with the possessing spirit, but this is the rarest symptom.  Zar can also be used as part of the training and practice of shamanistic healers. [http://www.health24.com/mind/culturebound_syndromes/1284-1304,13259.asp] This is usually practiced in Africa and is unfamiliar in Europe.  Since this is a trance that is induced voluntarily as part of a shamanistic ritual, it is not considered a disorder.

Zar was experienced in many cases when immigrants would move from Ethopia to Israel.  This is when zar was known to happen the most.  Zar as a voluntary induced spirit would occur the most in Northern African countries.  One of the most common possession phenomena in Africa and in other continents is the belief in possession by spirits, known as zar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Chris Cookston)

Interview with Janise Medina.
Janise graduated with honors from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama with a BA in Interior Design. Her work has been recognized by large firms in the South as some of the best they've ever seen.


(Chris)

'''What are the steps of the design process?'''


(Janise)

1) Conceptualizing and Programming

2) Schematic Design

3) Design Development

4) Documentation

5) Execution


(Chris)

'''Can you expand a little on each step?'''


(Janise) 

1) ''Conceptualizing and Programming'':

5% of your total design time is spent on this step. This is the most important step! Although, no design actually happens here.


•	''Conceptualizing'': Begin with an abstract concept. In interior design, the designer asks &quot;what is the “feel” of the design?&quot; Not “what material will the walls be” but &quot;what is this supposed to feel and look like?&quot; A good concept is written down in about a paragraph. It is very solid, condensed and used as the “Bible” for the design. It doesn’t change down the road. An outstanding design will come from a strong concept.
E.g. A clean place where a lot of people can gather. Another example: A refrigeration system that can fit inside of fireman suits.
These are examples of concepts.

•	''Programming'': Here, you need to thoroughly research the consumer in order to turn the concepts into customer requirements. This can be a book long if it's needed.
E.g. In the gathering place, the components of programming would be a janitors closet, max 500 occupancy, a big stage, etc. For the refrigeration system, the components would be a weight limit, size limit, cooling temperature, etc.


2) ''Schematic Design'': 

This step takes 10% of your total design time. Here you must come up with several different ways to solve the design. Take the numbers from the program and make many designs. Don’t get into nitty gritty details, but utilize the numbers from the program. After you have about 5 designs, sit down and evaluate the merit of each design and pick the best one. If none are satisfactory enough, you need to come up with more designs.


3) ''Design Development'':

25% of all design time is spent on this step. All design decisions are made here. Keep track of every decision. Don’t let anything fall through the cracks. With the chosen design, start hammering out the design flaws. Go from a general, vague design to a very specific, detailed design.

e.g. bubble diagrams --&gt; Block diagrams --&gt; Final design (google: bubble diagrams for more information)

This is where concurrent design is at its peak. Designers, analyzers, and vendors work together to come up with a design. By the time DD is over, you know &lt;u&gt;exactly&lt;/u&gt; what the design is going to be. This includes material, time, vendors, labor, money, etc.


(Chris)

'''In DD, do you try to foresee future problems and solve them before you run into them?'''


(Janise)

Well, don’t paralyze yourself with “what-ifs”. Be responsible but don’t be neurotic. Interior designers follow the International Building Code in order to eliminate any unforeseen problems. (similar to ASME codes) If the program was very specific and the designers followed them well, and followed the codes, most future problems will be eliminated.


(Chris)

'''Ok, please continue.'''


(Janise)

4) ''Documentation'':

40% of your total design time is spent on this step. This is a very monotonous, meticulous step. It consists of Construction Documents and Specifications. You need to document every single detailed design decision during this time.


•	Construction Documents are documentation of how everything goes together. E.g. What is the space between this window and this wall, or how far is this bolt from this gear?

•	The Specifications document describes the specifics of each part going into the design. Any and all information pertaining to the design goes here. For example, if using a certain type of bolt, the specifications of the bolt are its material, chemical composition, who made it, when it was made, where it came from, what size is it, its thread count, its weight, its density, etc. This document is critical for the people building the product. If they are confused about something because it wasn't specified in the specifications document, they might build something incorrectly which might cause harm to the consumers, creating a lawsuit.


5) ''Execution'':

This step requires 20% of the total design time. In this step, the design actually gets built. Here, the project team decreases significantly. Only the managers oversee this step.


(Chris)

'''What should be done if unforeseen problems come up in Execution?'''


(Janise)

The only problems that should come up in execution are vendor change, material change, or dimension change. If that happens, the change needs to be documented and amended in the construction documents and specifications.
Any changes in the purpose or function of a part or design should have been done back in DD.


(Chris)

'''What step would be the right step to decide whether or not to terminate a design?'''


(Janise)

Schematic Design


(Chris)

'''How do you know when it is right to move onto the next step?'''


(Janise)

When you are done doing what the step requires you to do, move on to the next step.


(Chris)

'''Is an engineering design process different from an interior design process?'''


(Janise) 

Of course, in a lot of aspects it has to be different. The details change from discipline to discipline. The percentages of time spent on each step may change as well, but the 5 steps of the design process never change.


(Chris)

'''Can one person go through the Design Process alone?'''


(Janise)

I wouldn’t recommend it. One person can be blind to a lot of things. A different perspective is necessary for good design.
'''Good design doesn’t exist without collaboration.'''


(Chris)

'''What is your experience using the design process?'''


(Janise)

Following the design process is hard work. You will get bogged down and tired in each step and you will be ready to move on, but if you push through and finish each step correctly as it should be finished, the design will be very successful.
If you follow the process, you will be rewarded. If you don’t, you may still get something that works, but it will just be average.
I used it correctly in school. My projects were recognized by industry leaders as some of the best they’d ever seen. The firm that I work for doesn’t follow the design process. Their projects are a liability for them getting sued.


(Chris)

'''What are the advantages of using the design process?'''


(Janise)

The advantage is exemplary, superior design.


(Chris)

'''What are the disadvantages?'''


(Janise)

It takes a lot of time and hard work, but it’s worth it.


(Chris)

'''What are some credible sources that you would recommend using when learning about the design process?'''


(Janise)

I just used my professors and textbooks.


(Chris)

'''Is there anything else you’d like to add?'''


(Janise)

Yeah. Anyone who is teaching design and doesn’t teach these steps should be [fired].

(Chris)

'''Thank you for your time.'''

===Overview of biological characterisation===

Salt lakes contain both macroscopic and microscopic plant and animal life. A description of the flora and fauna of a lake is an essential part of characterising the lake.

Methods for collecting, measuring the extent and identity of the biota of salt lakes will be discussed more fully in the relevant sections of this manual. This page provides an overview of the types of activities and equipment you may find useful in developing an understanding of the populations of flora and fauna in your lake.

The types of collections and measurements you may wish to obtain could include;
#Identifying submerged aquatic macrophytes and macroalgae (SAMM), using manual collection, identification (often using a dissecting microscope) and drying &amp; pressing voucher herbarium specimens.
#Measuring the extent of SAMM using boat transects or aerial photography from aircraft, balloons or kites.
#Sampling the water column for phytoplankton, using dip samples or a towed plankton net. Counting and enumeration is conducted using a compound microscope.
#Sampling the periphyton by 'scrubbing' rocks or using artificial substrates. Once again, identification and enumeration require the use of a compound microscope.
#Sampling benthic mats using coring devices and that trusty microscope again.
#Sampling aquatic macroinvertebrates using dip nets and kick nets
#Collecting terretrial invertebrates using light sheets, sweep nets, and other methods
#Using pop nets, fish traps, kick nets and dip nets to catch fish
#Undertaking bird point counts and recording calls
#Recording bat calls
#Examining the lake edges and playa surfaces for scats and tracks
#Using hair tubes to determine whether mammals are part of the food web of your lake

Techniques and equipment are detailed in the relevant sections of this manual. Additionally, references to texts that contain detailed descriptions of some of the less common methods or equipment are also provided.

One piece of equipment that is used extensively in investigations of the biota of a salt lake is the compound microscope. The basic use and maintenance of this essential piece of equipment is described here.

===The microscope and its use===

[[File:Labelledmicroscope.gif|thumb|400px|right|Click the image to view its image description page, which includes copyright information.]]
The parts of the microscope are labelled in the diagram to the right. Place slide on the stage. Rotate nosepiece so that the x10 objective is in use. Start with the objective down near the slide and coarsely focus upwards by turning the focus control towards the operator. Never focus downwards as the objective could smash into the slide. 

Use the fine focus control to gain the clearest image. 

Adjust the eyepieces so that the image unites. The eyepieces adjust both for distance between pupils and individual focus. Make sure that the image through the fixed eyepiece is sharp, then adjust the other eyepiece to match.  It is often easier to view through a binocular microscope if you don't actually touch the eyepieces, but view from a slight distance. 
    
Close the condenser iris just enough to give the specimen some contrast. It should be about one third closed. Too much closure results in reduction of depth of field. Remove an objective and look down the tube to check on closure. 

===Maintaining the microscope===

Microscopes must be kept clean and dry. Refer to each microscope's manual for details of specific maintenance requirements. General advice is presented here. 
     
Dust should be removed from the eyepieces and objectives using a blow-brush. Stubborn dirt and fingerprints may adhere to the lenses and should be removed using a softly wadded piece of laboratory lens cleaning tissue. If necessary, dampen the lens by breathing on it. 

Solvents should NEVER be used to clean a microscope lens or the &quot;blooming&quot; will be removed, resulting in distorted images and &quot;halos&quot; around specimens in the field of view.
 
Wipe down the body of the microscope occasionally, using a damp cloth. 
    
If an objective should come into contact with brine take immediate steps to prevent damage. Salt will corrode the objective, so unscrew the objective from the nosepiece, then unscrew the outer housing of the objective. Wipe off any brine, paying particular attention to the thread where the objective screws in to the nosepiece. Wipe over with another lens tissue, dampened with fresh water. Repeat with several changes of dampened lens tissue until all salt has been removed. Leave until completely dry before reassembling. 

If dirt should enter the body of the microscope, unscrew the objectives and use a blow-brush to remove any loose debris.     
Regularly check that the condenser iris and lens are in working order.

===Overview===

Salt lakes host both aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates. When the lakes contain water a range of insect larvae, molluscs and crustaceans inhabit the water column and benthic zone. When the waters evaporate the dry playas host wolf spiders and other terrestrial invertebrates (Hudson???)

===Methods for sampling aquatic macroinvertebrates===

Aquatic macroinvertebrates may be collected using pond nets. The collected specimens are emptied into a white tray for sorting and voucher specimens may be relaxed with soda water before being preserved in alcohol.

When surveying a single lake, sampling should occur within the entire range of habitats available (open waters, shallow water over hard and soft bare benthos or over submerged aquatic macrophytes, rocky edhes, within areas of emergent vegetation). To ensure you have sampled representatively, construct a species accumulation curve (Smith, 1996). Collect in 5 minute units from a variety of locations within each habitat area until the number of new species encountered with each collection flattens out.

When surveying groups of lakes within a bioregion, two 10-minute collections are sufficient in lakes with a relatively homogenous habitat. Those lakes with several distinct types of habitat (e.g. rock edges, aquatic weeds, mud) should be sampled using two 10-minute collections of each major habitat type. The construction of an accumulation curve, based on 5-minute sub samples of the two 10-minute samples plus another 40 minutes (i.e. 1 hr of collecting divided into 5 minute units) will enable the researcher to determine how representative the 10-minute collections are. A reasonably diverse lake from the group of surveyed lakes should be chosen to conduct the accumulation curve.

Specimens should be listed, and representatives preserved for later identification. Species abundance may be noted on a log scale (r =1, o =5 individuals, x = 10 individuals, xo =50 individuals, xx = 100 individuals, xxo =500 individuals, etc.).  This method is rapid, and the accuracy is sufficient to allow the data to be used for community analysis in PRIMER multivariate analysis.     

Quantitative sampling by methods such as benthic cores provide poor species richness results and require large numbers of replicates to obtain accurate abundances. This is due to benthic habitat heterogeneity. Such methods require a very large investment in time and sample handling effort, making them more suitable for in-depth studies than for simple characterisation of lakes. 

===Vouchers===

A voucher collection should be maintained of aquatic macroinvertebrates collected. Vouchers may be used to ensure 'between survey' consistency where different personnel conduct surveys, and also allow later researchers to ensure which species were present at a point in time, regardless of taxonomic revisions that may have occurred in the interim. Macroinvertebrate species considered new to a region may be separated for identity confirmation by the appropriate taxonomic expert for that group at a time convenient to the expert.

To ensure the invertebrate fauna are relaxed prior to death and preservation, samples of invertebrates should be deprived of oxygen. This may be done by adding soda water to the samples. Once all fauna have ceased movement, the vouchers may be transferred to alcohol for preservation. While methylated spirits is sufficient for most purposes, it is not appropriate if the vouchers may need to have DNA analysis at some time in the future, or for species new to science. In these cases pure ethyl alcohol is used for preservation.


===Methods for collecting terrestrial invertebrates on dry playa lakes or adjacent to wet lakes===

[[File:Barber pitfall trap.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Pitfall traps may be used in isolation or drift fencing may be attached to them to increase their catchment area|left]]
Terrestrial invertebrates utilising the emergent macrophyte habitats of the salt lakes may be sampled by using a sweep net (2 x 10 min sweeps) and by observation.  &quot;Pollard walks&quot; are timed observational walks where the observer passes through all the habitat types adjacent to the lake and across the playa surface. &quot;Quadrats along transect&quot; observations are similar to pollard walks, but used for playa flat surveys to determine the presence of fauna that burrow or stay close to the soil. Wet micro-pitfalls are usefull for collecting invertebrates, as are light trapping, tanglefoot bands on trees, sticky cockroach lures and whitefly/aphid traps. Active searching for ants and soil invertebrates using leaf litter sieving and soil core sieving are time consuming but can provide a surprising quantity of creatures.

===Sampling adequacy===

When sampling terrestrial invertebrates, the following advice holds: 
#wet micropitfalls and various sticky lures should be spaced at least 9 per 100 square metres; 
#construct a new species accumulation curve over the trapping period, and 
#cease trapping when the curve starts to flatten, or when four days have passed.

===Vouchers===

Invertebrates are poorly known and recorded in many parts of the world and voucher specimens from surveys may be lodged with the regional museum.

=Related Fields=

==General Bibliographies of Tibetan Studies==
{{drop|I}}n order to situate this bibliography among other Tibetan studies bibliographies, it is worth mentioning what other bibliographies are available. I have used all of the ones relevant for this study. But also this may help the student navigate the secondary literature in other areas. Bibliographies of primary sources, manuscript catalogues and the like have been excluded.  Perhaps most relevant here is Clark (2006) which includes a bibliography of Tibetan dictionaries. 
	Bibliographies of Tibetan studies concentrating on research in Japanese include Sadakane (1982, 1997) and Suo (1999). A useful bibliography of Chinese and Tibetan language works has been issued in three volumes covering the period 1949-2000 (Zhongguo Zangxue shumu 1994, 1997, 2001). The somewhat longer period 1872-2004 is covered in another two volume bibliography (Zhongguo zangxue lunwen 1999, 2006). However whereas the former has information in Tibetan and English as well as Chinese, the latter is a monolingual publication. Bibliographies focusing on work in other languages include French *(Aubin 1993), German *(Aschoff 1992), and Italian *(Angelini 1994).

==Tibeto-Burman==
Tibetan is generally considered a member of the Tibeto-Burman (also called Sino-Tibetan) family. Bibliographies of Tibeto-Burman studies include Shafer (1957), Hale (1982), and LaPolla and Lowe (1994). Another important bibliographic resource is van Driem (2001). Attempts to reconstruct Tibeto-Burman (none terribly successful) include Shafer (1966-???), Benedict (1972), and Matisoff (2003). MENTION SUB BRANCH RECONSTRUCTIONS. and GONG

==The Bodish Languages==
Apart from the Tibetan languages the Bodish subbranch of Tibeto-Burman is probably among the least researched branches of Tibeto-Burman. Languages regarded as members of this family include Bumthang (Michailovsky and Mazaudon 1994; van Driem 1995), Tshangla (Stack 1897, Hoffrenning 1959, Das Gupta 1968, Hoshi 1987; Andvik 1999), Monpa (Lu 1986; Nishida 1988, Sun et al. 1991, Lu 2002), and Zhangzhung (Nagano and LaPolla 2001). Zeissler (2004) is an attempt to postulate a broad theory of Bodish syntax in both its diachronic and geographic varieties, but attempts more than it achieves, and appears to have been based solely on secondary literature.  Some papers on Kurtoep include Hyslop (2008a, 2008b, 2009).

==The indigenous grammatical tradition==
The study of the indigenous Tibetan grammatical tradition, while of course offering much insight into the language, is a field in itself. Therefore, no attempt to comprehensivly discuss the Tibetan genres of Sum rtags and Brda gsar rnying will be made in this bibliography. Studies of the Tibetan grammatical tradition include Inaba (1989), Miller (1976, 1993) and Verhagen (1994, and 2001). It remains a discipline in its infancy.

==The Tibetan alphabet and paleography==
Uray 1955, van Schaik. also articles on the alphabet by Francke, Filliozat (?), and Laufer.

==Tibetan in contact with other languages==
Studies of loanwords from Tibetan into other languages include Róna-Tas (1962, 1966) for Mongour, Emmerick (1983, 1985) for Khotanese, de Roerich (1957) for Mongolian, and Jacques (2004) for Japhug Rgyalroṅng. Studies of loanwords into Tibetan include Laufer (1916/18 and 1919) from various languages, Emmerick (1983, 1985) from Khotanese, and Beckwith and Walter (1997) from Indo-European, and Norbu and Takeuchi (1991) from Mongolian. Studies of Tibetan words written in other scripts include Laufer (1914), Miller (1955b), Li Fang-Kuei (1979), Zhang (1987), Che (1991) and Róna-Tas (1992). Studies concerning the influence of Tibetan on Tokharian include Sapir (1936) and Ivanov (1961).

=Varieties of Written Tibetan=
{{drop|V}}ery little rigorous work has been done on the classification of forms of Written Tibetan. The two categories that appear relatively well defined are &quot;Old Tibetan&quot; and &quot;Modern Literary Tibetan&quot;. The former, &quot;Old Tibetan&quot; consists of imperial stone inscriptions on the one hand and Dunhuang documents and wood slips on the other hand. The latter, &quot;Modern Literary Tibetan&quot; may be defined as writing in Tibetan after the communist takeover of Tibet, or generically as the form of writing found in newspapers and modern secular publications such as novels and short stories. It is convenient to define &quot;Classical Tibetan&quot; negatively as all forms of Written Tibetan not belonging to these two categories. 

==Classical Tibetan==

===Classical Tibetan Grammars===
The first published Tibetan grammar was that of de Koros, this was translated into German and slightly amended by Schmidt. Schmidt also has a Russian version. Foucaux learned Tibetan using de Koros materials but came to write his own grammar. 
Cordier (1907) is one of the few grammars to incorporate the various studies of Schiefner. 

Beyer's grammar (1992) is insufficient in various respects. Despite being positively reviewed (Behr 1994, Davidson 1996, Eimer 1993, LaPolla 1994, Miller 1994). Beyer cites neither his predecessors nor his textual examples. He contributes little new, and muddles much of his sources.  Other Tibetan grammars include: Inaba (1954), Hahn (1994), Hodge (1990), Bskal bzang vgyur med (1981, 1992), Wilson (1992), and Schwieger (2006).   (DESCRIPTION OF EACH NEEDED)

BACOT, de KOROS, SCHMIDT, ROERICH (?)

===Classical Tibetan Phonology===

===Classical Tibetan Morphology===
Wolfenden (1928) discusses the 'prefix' m- used with nominals. 
Uray's papers on duplication (1954), -e (1953), and the diminutive (1952). Zhang Jichuang (2009) describes Classical Tibetan lexical morphology from the 'word family' perspective. Anton Schiefner (1877) and Michael Hahn (1978) have insightful studies of how the plurals ''-dag'' and ''-rnams'' differ. Hoshi (2012) explores the use of the polar question marker ''e'' arguing that it was borrowed into Classical Tibetan from eastern Tibetan dialects.

Lyovin (1970) makes some desultory remarks on the internal reconstruction of the verbal system, which in some ways presage the more thoroughgoing and more influential work of Coblin from a few years later.

Coblin (1976) undertakes an internal reconstruction of Tibetan that has been highly influential. His internal reconstruction eliminates all vowel and auslaut alternations from the verb stems.

===Classical Tibetan Syntax===

Taube (1953-1954) compares the verbal categories of Tibetan and Sanskrit as reflected by the Tibetan translation of the ''Bodhicaryāvatāra''. 

Thre is an excellent article on zero-anaphora in Classical Tibetan by Andersen (1987), which unfortunately seems not to have been noticed much by other researchers. Andersen discusses in particular the use of ''-pa-dang'' to block zero-anaphora. He also discusses constructions which are comparable to the passive and anti-passive. 

The syntactic effect of converbial markers has also been adressed by Abel Zadoks and Felix Haller from the perspective of 'switch-reference'. Unfortunately none of the studies of Zadoks have been published, the handouts he presented at various conferences in the early 2000s are however invaluable. The study of Haller (2009) is mostly devoted to Shigatse dialect. In his treatment of Classical Tibetan (based on the Mila rnam thar) he acknowledges neither the previous work of Andersen and Zadoks, nor does he present sufficient examples to demonstrate his claims.  One can hope for a fuller treatment in his forthcoming Habilitationsschrift. 

Oetke (1977) discusses the use of ''vgyur'', ''byed'', and ''yin'' as auxiliary verbs, in particular with reference to conditional clauses in Buddhist literature. He suggests that the main distinction is one of 'control' versus 'non-control'. His seems to be the earliest discussion of this important distinction in any variety of Tibetan. 

Sato (1994) discusses ergativity in Classical Tibetan. On the same topic is the disasterous article by Saxena (1989) which must be read together with the response to it by Dempsey (1993). Nagano (1994) discusses two examples one from Old TIbetan and one from Classical where he believes the suffix -kyis marks the patient of a transitive clause. He has another paper about this too somewhere.

===Studies on the language of specific Classical Tibetan Documents===
Roesler (2011) discusses the grammar of the ''Dpe chos'' of Po-to-ba Rin-chen-gsal. 

===Classical Tibetan Dictionaries and General Works of Tibetan Lexicography===
Pre-modern dictionaries including Manchu-Tibetan, and Sanskrit-Tibetan dictionaries have been excluded. see Simon's article, the bibliography of Walters, and the article by Ruegg in Studia Tibetica 4. 

The first Tibetan dictionary by a western author is a manuscript Tibetan-Latin dictionary by the Cappucian missionaries Giuseppe da Ascoli, Franceso Maria da Tours and F. Domenico da Fano (1674-1728), compiled between 1708 and 1713. This dictionary unfotunately remains unpublished but according to Simon (1964: 85) an extract is held at the Bibliothèque Nationale (Fonds Tibétain No. 542). Because this dictionary reportedly carries indication of pronunciation it could be of significant interest for Tibetan historical phonology. 
	A Tibetan Italian dictionary was compiled by F. Francesco Orazio della Penna (1680-1745), a student of da Fano. The text of this work was translated into English and considerably mangled. The English version became the first published Tibetan dictionary (Schroeter 1826) but the original remains unpublished. These first two dictionaries and well as those of de Kőrös (1834), Schmidt (1841), Jäschke (1881), Desgodins (1899), and Das (1902) are well discussed by Simon and require no lenghty discussion here. 
	 de Kőrös is widely regarded as the founder of Tibetology as an academic discipline He has himself been the subject of a significant amount of research. 
	Schmidt (1841) is largely a translation of de Kőrös (1834) into German, but it has been supplimented with lexicographical entries from some Tibetan-Mongolian glossaries at Schmidt's disposal. (WHICH ONES). Schmidt also prepared a Tibetan-Russian dictionary, which however I have not examined. A biography of Schmidt is provided in Babingen (1920).
	In Jäschke's first dictionary of 1866, the entries are alphabetized by their phonetic romanization, according to Latin alphabetical order. Tibetan script equivalents given for each entry, and differences of dialect are reported; information on verb syntax or stem variation occasionally reported. This dictionary was intended for practical use in the colloquial language. (OF LADAKH OR CENTRAL TIBET???) His 1881 dictionary does not differ significantly from the 1871 dictionary (IS THIS TRUE??). This is the first Tibetan dictionary of real caliber, and indeed as a work of lexicography is unrivaled to this day. 

	In the history of Tibetan lexicography special place must be afforded to the word of Chos kyi grags pa (1946). This is the first indigenous Tibetan dictionary (although the author was actually ethnically a Mongolian) to be organized alphabetically. Chos kyi grags pa received the aid of Dge 'dun chos 'phel in compiling the work. The latter has become a subject of scholarly inquiry in his own right, which now verges on a subdiscipline within Tibetan Studies (CITATIONS).  Until recently this was used very widely be Tibetan as well as Western scholars. A number of lexeme from this dictionary are discussed in Wilhelm, F. (1962).

Gould and Richardson (1943) produced an interesting lexical resource. In a series which included Tibetan Verbs, and Tibetan Sentences. Each of 2950 syllables is numbered. Compound words are listed under each heading, and crossreferenced to each of their members.  A phonetic transcription is given. Intransiive and transitive verbs are marked, aswell as honorifics and high honorifics. A real contribution to Tibetan etymology and word analysis which has not be properly followed up on. For a similar work see Tshe dbang rnam rgyal ([1958] 1997). Gould’s work is reviewed by Edgerton (1944), Barnett (1946) and Steward (1947). 

A number of dictionaries can be mentioned all of which serve more or less the same function and are of roughly equal quality, i.e. derivative, somewhat unreliable, unscientific, but useful. In ths category would be a French-Tibetan dictionary (Giraudeau and Goré 1956) closely based on Desgodins (1899) but incorporating more modern technology as well, the Tibetan-Russian dictionary of Semichov (1963), which includes an appendix of verb tables,  the Tibetan-German dictionary of Richter (1965), the Tibetan-English dictionary Buck (1969), which relies heavily on the French Catholic lexicographical tradition. 

	The luminous figure of early twentieth century Tibetology, George Nicholas de Roerich, left a long manuscript Tibetan-English dictionary as part of his Nachlass. It was edited and translated into Russian to form a twenty volume Tibetan-English and Russian dictionary. The size of the work and erudition of its author recommend it. Unfortunately not citing any sources it is not a methodological improvement on its peers, and is now rather difficult to obtain. CITATION

A number of other Tibetan-Tibetan or Tibetan-Chinese dictionaries were published in Tibet during the fifities, unfortunately they have all so far evaded me and it seems unproductive to share the inadaquet bibliographic scrapes which I have managed to collect. 

	A Tibetan-Tibetan dictionary of lasting importance is Tsan chung (1979). This is an excellent dictionary, with carefully written definitions. The cross references are excellent, and the handling of verbs is more sophisticated and reliable than in most dictionaries. Its relatively small size means that obscure words are not to be found, though it does have a strength in colloquial words and eastern dialect words. The examples appear to have been invented by the authors. While not a contribution to the scientific description of the Tibetan language, for a dictionary of its nature and size it is the best that can be achieved. Western students of Tibetan who do not yet know most basic vocabulary and are making the transition from using bilingual to monolingual dictionaries will find a particular asset in this work. It has been unfortunateley somewhat upstaged by its larger but less carefully edited sucessor, to be treated in the next paragraph. 
	The dictionary which has become the current unrivaled standard is that of Zhang (1985). It is certainly a very large and useful work, but its merit is somewhat overrated. The definitions are so laconic as to sometimes be unintelligible, in particular words close in meaning are poorly differentiated. As usual, the compilers do not cite their examples or provide information on their sources. They have also haphazardly included geographical and biographical information properly outside the scope of a dictionary. Begun in 1928, as a translation of Jäschke (1881) the only mention of sources I am aware of cites western works, and Qing dynasty works in general.
	This work has been the subject of an translation into English (Skorupski 2001) though so far only until the letter nya, and supplement of more recent words has been compiled by Hackett (2001). The handling of tshad ma terminology in Zhang (1985) has been criticized by Bkra shis bzang po (1999). The verb entries have been excerpted and published separately as Li yung khrang (1989). Hackett (2003a) is a dictionary of verb stems and verbal collocations with lexical semantic information and paradigm example sentences taken from classical literature using techniques of corpus linguistics.  Hill (2010) is a dictionary of verb stems collected from previous sources.

==Old Tibetan==
Takeuchi (2012) treats the periodization of Old Tibetan. 

===Old Tibetan Grammars===
As yet no grammar of Old Tibetan has been written. 

===Old Tibetan Phonology===
Hill (2010b) provides an overview of Old Tibetan synchronic phonology. Contributions to particular issues in Old Tibetan phonology include Beckwith (2006), Che (1981, 1984), Dragunov (1936, 1939), and Hill (2005b, 2006, 2007, 2009). Zhang Jichuan 張濟川 (1982) studies stop finals, sandhi with case markers, and the effects of the ''da-drag''. 

A newly discovered source for Tibetan historical phonology is a collection of Dunhuang texts which are the transcripts of oral teachings, and give information about the pronunciation of Tibetan in medieval Dunhuang (van Schaik 2007).

Nancy Caplow has reconstructed stress for proto-Tibetan (Caplow 2009).
Jacques (2009a) has argued that consonants of the type Cwa orignate from *Cuba in pre-Tibetan.
Temple (2012) explores the conditioning of palatalization in Old Tibetan.

===Old Tibetan Morphology===
Hill (2005a) treats changes in the inflection of the verb for 'to write', Jacques (2010) extends the same argument to a further group of verbs. Hill (2010a) discusses the case marker ''-las'' after verbal nouns. Hill (2012b) discusses case grammar. Jacques (2012) speculates about the history of verbal morphology.

===Old Tibetan Syntax===

Zeisler (2002) takes note of a ''potentialis'' use of the imperative stem in Old Tibetan.

===Old Tibetan Dictionaries===
To date only one work has been published which can be properly called a dictionary of Old Tibetan, this being Btsan lha ngag dbang tshul khrims (1997). This work carefully quotes and cites its sources, however not specifically enough to afford confirmation. Citations have been culled from Dunhuang texts as well as the Bdra gsar rnying, and commentarial literature. Thus it exceeds the scope of Old Tibetan per se, but this only adds to its utility. Despite the very high quality of this work, which exceeds that of most scholarship emmiting from the PRC, in my view a comprehensive dictionary-cum-thesaurus of Old Tibetan texts making specific citations is a remaining desideratum of both Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman studies. Another Old Tibetan dictionary is that of Rnam-rgyal Tshe-ring (2001) which I have not yet seen. Although not dictionaries as such the glossaries of Li and Coblin (1987), Richardson (1985), and F. W. Thomas (1935-1965) should be mentioned as lexicographical resources for Old Tibetan. Although the last is now quite outdated. A number of Old Tibetan texts have been fully indexed, though without any definitions or commentary in Choix 3 and 4, and in Takeuchi (1995), and (1997-1998). Although, Takeuchi  (1995) does contain a short glossary of terms, and a variety of invaluable lexicographical data and discussion throughout. Work on Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman historical linguistics must reply foremost upon Old Tibetan, and although more work can be done in Old Tibetan lexicography, enough resources are already available to make the common practice of many Tibeto-Burmanists of replying exclusively on Jäschke 1881 now inexcusible. There is an indigenous tradition of providing glossaries of Old Tibetan words and phrases in Classical Tibetan, such works are extensively employed by Btsan lha ngag dbang tshul khrims (1997), Mimaki has made two studies of one of the earliest by Dbu pa blo gsal (Mimaki 1990, 1992). An overview of this literature in general is provided in an article by Manfred Taube.

==Modern Literary Tibetan==

===Modern Literary Tibetan Grammars===

In the later part of the 20th century one of the most active figures in Tibetan lexicography has been Melvyn C. Goldstein. His work is especially strong in political and military terminology. His first dictionary was published in 1975. It is very positively reviewed by Wylie (1980). Goldstein (1984) later compiled an English-Tibetan dictionary. The carefulness of editing seems uncharacteristic of Goldstein’s work. In 2001 he published a dictionary which is ostensibly a new edition 1975 dictionary though many times its size. It suffers from many basic problems such as cross་references which lead nowhere, and mistakes in alphabetical order. Although ostensibly centered around the language of contemporary news and literature, because the work incorporates other dictionaries more or less in totol, this work even contains Old Tibetan vocabulary. As the first place to turn for a word it has its place. Although this work is useful for reading texts, especially modern, because of its large vocabulary, it fails to contribute to scientific lexicography. The negative comments of the reviewers are well deserved (Beckwith 2001, Denwood 2002, Tsering 2002 CONSULT THIS ONE).
	Hackett (2001) edited and oversaw the compiling of a dictionary of neologisms compiled from PRC newspapers. This dictionary contains words not already in Zhang (1985), and is intended to serve as a  supplement to it. Many quotations are provided drawn from &quot;The Tibet Daily&quot; (བོད་ལྗོངས་ཉིན་དེའི་ཚགས་པར་) and &quot;Lhasa Evening News&quot; (ལྷ་སའི་དགོང་དྲོའི་ཚགས་པར་), but no specific citations are provided.  A older, smaller lexicon of newspaper terms can be found in the reader of Sedláček (1972), but many are outdated.

=Spoken Tibetan Languages=
{{drop|D}}escriptive work on Tibetan dialects began in a piecemeal fashion through the work of missionaries and explorers in the 19th century. Inevitably this research focused on the languages of border regions either in the far West or East. Subsequent work on spoken Tibetan languages has focused above all on Lhasa dialect, the 'lingua franca' of Central Tibet and the Tibetan exile community. These three forms of language are often confused in the literature. Recent work on a number of other dialects has filled out the picture. 

==Surveys and comparative works==
Bonnerjea (1936) offers a pioneering contribution in the comparative phonology of Tibetic languages. His 1937 efforts at comparative morphology, entirely constrained by the straight-jacket of Latinate terminology, is however disappointing (Bonnerjea 1937).

The Tibetan Dialects Project at the University of Berne has been collecting data for a Comparative Dictionary of Tibetan Dialects. This massive project, headed for many years by Roland Bielmeier, is documenting the exact phonetic realisation of Tibetan-derived vocabulary in dozens of Tibetan languages in five countries. 

Gesang Jumian &amp; Gesang Yangjing (2002) provide a short introduction to several Tibetan dialects.

Wang Yao (1996) treats the phonetic evolution of the word ''zla-ba'' 'moon', and the phonetic evolution of ''zl-'' more generally, in several dialects. In the same year, Denwood (1996) treated the same set of questions.

==Western Dialects==
Jacques (2009b) has an article showing that what has been argued to be an archaism in the Western Tibetan vowel system is in fact an innovation. 

===Balti===

Some early word lists for Balti include Vigne (1842), Austen (1866:PAGES), and Jäschke (1881: PAGES).

====Balti Grammars====
Bielmeier, Roland (1985). REVIEWED BY SPRIGG AND KVAERNE
READ, SPRIGG

Lobsang, Ghulam Hassan (1995)

Eunice Jones (2008) has an MA thesis devoted to evidentiality and mirativity in Balti.

====Balti Dictionaries====
Sprigg (2002)

===Ladakhi===

====Phonology====
Miller (1956), Koshal (1976)

====Texts====
A Tibetan script Ladakhi text is Francke (DATE 2000). 

====Grammars====
Grammars of Ladakhi include Francke ([1901] 1979), Koshal (1979, 1982), Norman (2001). Tournadre (1996) and Zeisler (2004) treat specific topics in Ladakhi grammar.

====Dictionaries====
Sandberg (1894) includes a long vocabulary of Ladakhi words. Dicionaries of Ladakhi include Ramsay (DATE), Norberg-Hodge and Paldan (199?) and Hamid (1998). Rebecca Norman is compiling a Ladakhi dictionary which will exceed all previous efforts in scope. 

Works dealing with social linguistics include Zeisler (2006).
Works that I have to read before evaluating include Dey (1975) and Koshal (1990).

===Zanskar===
Hoshi Michiyo (1978) has a glossary.

===Purik===
Bailey (1920: PAGES), short grammar, text and vocabulary.

===Ngari===

==Central Tibetan (Ü-Tsang) (including Southern dialects)==

===Lhasa, 'Central', and 'Modern Standard'===
Because many researchers do not rigorously distinguish the speech of the city of Lhasa per se from other forms of speech dubbed 'Lhasa Tibetan' it is convenient to treat Lhasa dialect together with the other dialects of Central Tibet which have been referred to as 'Lhasa' or generically as 'Central' Tibetan. In addition the ''lingua franca'' of the Tibetan exile often all called 'Lhasa' Tibetan is covered in this section. 
====Handbooks and Manuals====
A number of works treat 'Central Tibetan' without referring more specifically to dialect. Grammars of 'Central Tibetan include Sandberg (1894), and Roerich and Phuntshok (1957) both of which include fairly extensive vocabularies. Early handbooks include Lewin (1879), Sandberg (1894), and Henderson (1903), Bell (1905). Roerich and Phuntshok, Amundsen
It is not really clear that Lewin is describing Lhasa dialect. 

A good discussion of the previous literature is in Haller's Shigatse grammar, which would almost be worth just translating here. 

A discussion of the phonemes of Dbu-gtsang dialect is found in P. Miller (1951).

Handbooks and Manuals include those of the Changs, Goldstein and Nornang (1970), working with one of the same informants. Hu Tan (1989), which is very popular in China. Recently, and popular in Europe and North America is Tournadre and Dorje (2003).

====Dictionaries====
Hoshi (2003) is a colloquial Tibetan-Japanese verb dictionary. Kitamura and Nagano (1990) is a Tibetan Japanese dictionary which I have not yet seen.

====Grammars====
Kitamura (1977) has a short grammar. Hoshi M. (1988) also has a grammar. There is a longer grammar in Chinese by Wang Zhijing (1994). A Tibetan to Chinese dictionary of Lhasa dialect which i also haven't seen is yu et al. (1983).

====Phonology====
The phonology of Lhasa dialect, in particular the analysis of tone has been rather controversial. Sprigg (1955, 1961, 1993). 

Hári (1979) studies tone. 

The retention and over-application of -bC- word internally has been studied by Chang and Chang (1967) and Shirai (1999). 

Pao et al. (1992) has a study of instrumental phonetics. 
Tang and Kong (1991) discuss vowels, vowel length and tone. 

Róna-Tas (1984) compares the analysis of the vowel system across several authors, focusing of the description of Chang and Chang, from a typological perspective.

Hu Tan (1991b) has a study of final consonants. 

Chang and Chang
Sprigg
Chao, 
Jin Peng (1958) treats mostly phonology. He suffers from the Chinese obssesion of giving the &quot;same&quot; sentence in several dialects.
Zhou Li (1986) teaches how to read Tibetan script in the pronunciation of Lhasa. His description of phonology closely matches that of Tournadre, with a more detailed treatment of tone and tone sandhi.

Dawson wrote a PhD thesis (1980) on Lhasa phonology in keeping with the tradition of Goldstein and Nornang. She has also written a related paper on Lhasa vowels (1985).

Geziben (1996) has something on trochaic structures in the tone system.

====Word Classes====
Agha (1990)

====Ergativity====
Tournadre (1996) an article by the Changs.

====Morphology====
Robin and Vittrant (2007) treat reduplication in Lhasa dialect. Hu Tan (1991) discusses nominalization.

====Verbal System====

=====Evidentiality=====
Yukawa (1966) gives an excellent description of this morpheme, unfortunately however relying on the notion of 'person'. Jin (1979) describes ''yod'', ''yod-pa-red'', and '''dug'', but I have not read his paper. 

Takeuchi (1990) provides a masterful survey of the Lhasa Tibetan verbal system and sketches the development of evidential marking from Old Tibetan to several modern dialects. Saxena (19997), in contrast, offers an ignorant and error filled attempt at a treatment of the same question, bizarrely ignoring Takeuchi's previous study. 

Delancey has treated the auxiliary system of Lhasa and Modern Standard Tibetan in a number of papers. In particular he has written about the use of the morpheme '&lt;i&gt;dug&lt;/i&gt; to express information new to the speaker, i.e. the admirative, called 'mirative' by DeLancey. Most researchers (e.g. Tournadre, Volkart)  see '&lt;/i&gt;dug&lt;/i&gt; instead as showing visually witnessed information. Hill (2012) argues against DeLancey's analysis, which DeLancey (2012) accepts.

Hongladarom (1994) traces the history of '&lt;/i&gt;dug&lt;/i&gt;, and argues (incorrectly) that the meaning which DeLancey refers to is quite recent. Hill (2013) however shows that '&lt;/i&gt;dug&lt;/i&gt;, had evidential functions already in Classical if not in Old Tibetan. 

Hongladarom (1993) discusses the evidential system from the perspective of sociolinguistics and conventionalized social situations. 

Bartee (1996) also treats the evidential system, from the perspective of deixis and 'cognative grammar' but because her framework still accepts such categories as 'person' and 'conjunct/disjunct' it is hard to use.

=====Tense and Aspect=====
Hoshi I. (1994a) discusses the temporal and aspectual uses of the V-ki-yod, etc. construction. A similar paper which I have not read is Hoshi I. (1994b) in Japanese. Hoshi I. also has an article on the auxiliary ''yong'' (1998) and the nominalizer ''mkhan'' (2004) in Lhasa Tibetan.

=====Light verbs=====
'Verbalizers' are treated by Kopp (1998).

====Texts====
There is a collection of texts by Chang and Chang (1978, 1981) and quite a series by Michiyo Hoshi.

===Dingri===
(Hermann 1989)

===Western Drokpa===
(Kretschmar 1986)

===Southern Mustang===
(Kretschmar 1995)

===Shigatse===
Shigatse (Jin Peng 1958, Haller 2000). In addition Kim (1996) discusses relativization in Shigatse. 

===[[w:Sherpa_language|Sherpa]] ===
It is mainly spoken in Nepal as well as in Sikkim/India. The Sherpa language is comprised of several dialects : Shorong (Solu), Pharak, Khumbu, Rolwaling and Dram (Tournadre and al. 2009b).

Schöttelndreyer (1978) studies Sherpa discourse. 

Tournadre and al. (2009b) wrote the first Sherpa-English dictionary, based on the Khumbu dialect, which provides Tibetan provides both Tibetan and Nepali equivalents as well as the Tibetan etymology. Sherpa words are presented in a romanization system with a notation of tones. This dictionary includes a brief description of the Sherpa-speaking area, dialectal variation, and the linguistic affiliation of the language. It is the first publication to provide information about the phonological correspondences of Literary Tibetan in Sherpa. These correspondences, as well as the basic lexicon, clearly show that Sherpa is derived from Old Tibetan and is closely related to Classical Literary Tibetan. The specificities of Sherpa verb morphology are described in great detail in an appendix of this dictionary.

===[[w:Jirel|Jirel]] === 
Maibaum, A. and Strahm, E.(2005) wrote the first Jirel dictionary. Tournadre and al. (2009:22) say: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Jirel is another Tibetic language which is closely related to Sherpa. Most Jirel speakers live in Jiri, a village in the Dolakha district, near the Solu area. Jirel has preserved a number of conservative phonological features which were lost in Sherpa (such as the final /t/ sound, as discussed in section 2.1 of Appendix 3). The mutual intelligibility between Sherpa and Jirel is not high. Jirel has been more strongly influenced by Nepali and Hindu language and culture than has Sherpa.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kyirong-Kagate ===
This group is comprised of several dialects according to Tournadre (2005): Kyirong (Lende), Kagate, Tsum, Langtang and [[w:Yolmo|Yolmo]] ([[w:Helambu|Helambu]] Sherpa). There is an extensive dictionary of Yolmo by Hari, A.M. and Chhegu Lama (2004) as well as a shorter grammatical description (Hari 2010). According to Tournadre and al. (2009:22): &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Yolmo is another Tibetic language spoken in Sindhupalchok and Nuwakot districts. It is often referred to as “Helambu Sherpa” by the Nepalese people. However, as demonstrated by Anna Maria Hari (2004: 699), Yolmo is closely related to Kagate, and is not a Sherpa dialect.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; While Hari has worked on the Melamchi Valley variety spoken in the Sindhupalchok district, Yolmo is also spoken in the Lamjung district of Nepal (Gawne 2010), and a smaller dictionary of that variety also exists (Gawne 2011), as well as a grammatical description as part of Gawne (forthcoming). There has been considerably less work published on Kagate, with an extensive phonemic description by Höhlig and Hari (1976) and a short discussion of reference in narratives Höhlig (1978).

There is very little in the way of descriptive work on Kyirong, save for a grammar by Brigitte Huber (2005) that also includes historical annotations. Hildebrandt and Perry (2011) note that the Gyalsumdo language variety spoken in the Manage district of Nepal shows strong similarities to Kyirong, as well as Nubri, and would therefore likely be classed in the &quot;Kyirong-Kagate&quot; group.

===[[w:Bhutia|Bhutia]] (or Lhoke or Drenjongke)===
Spoken in [[w:Sikkim|Sikkim]]/India (Sandberg 1895)

===[[w:Dzongkha|Dzongkha]]===
The national language of Bhutan was dubbed 'Dzongka' and committed to writing. The native speakers of this language are known as the Ngalong. Byrne (1909) provides an early description. Walsh (1905) describes the Gro-mo dialect spoken in Chumbi. On behalf of the government of Bhutan, van Driem (1992) wrote a complete grammar.

=Tibetan Computational and Corpus Linguistics=

Hackett, P. (2000a, 2000b) present the theory and initial results of experiments in the construction of a Tibetan Information Retrieval system using the first publicly available corpus of classical literary Tibetan (ACIP).  In particular, both works highlight the construction of an automatic rule-based part-of-speech tagger in combination with a word-segmentation algorithm.  

Hackett, P. (2003b) presented theoretical and statistical estimates for the morphological entropy of literary Tibetan.

Hackett, P. (2010) presents techniques of topic-boundary detection for precision indexing of corpora of Tibetan classical literature.

Caizhijie and Cairang Zhuoma (2010) discuss the development of the 'Pandita' dictionary for Tibetan auto-segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. 

Cairang Zhuoma and Cai Zhijie (2011) describes an algorithm used for &quot;decomposing&quot; Tibetan words, which seems to mean to assigning each letter to its place in the syllable, e.g. -g- in bsgrubs is the ming-gzhi, -s is the yang-'jugs, etc. I am not really clear what practical purpose such a system serves. 

Tsering Rgyal and Dbangphyug Tsering (2010) presents an overview of a dictionary-based part-of-speech tagger, including a detailed list of the categories and entities they attempted to tag.

Liu, H. et al. (2010). Sun, Y. (2010). (DESCRIPTION NEEDED)

Chungku, C., J. et al. (2010) discusses a project to developed a Dzongka corpus and tag set.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
There are two writing systems: the classical that is popular among those who write in the Milanese style, and the other is a more phonetic version used in most parts of western Lombardy and in the whole of eastern Lombardy. Efforts are being made to create a single writing system.

==How many people speak this language?==
About 3,5 million
==Where is this language spoken?==
In parts of Northern [[Wikijunior: Europe/Italy|Italy]]: Lombardy, eastern Piedmont (provinces of Novara and Verbano Cusio Ossola); in Southern [[Wikijunior: Europe/Switzerland|Switzerland]]: Canton Ticino and southern Graubünden; and in some small linguistic communities by the descendants of immigrants (for example in Villa Lugano, a borough of Buenos Aires).
==What is the history of this language?==
''Lombard'' is a Romance language somewhat similar to [[Wikijunior:Languages/Italian|Italian]] and [[Wikijunior:Languages/French|French]].  The domination of the Italian language has meant that in recent years there are fewer and fewer Lombard speakers.

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==




==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==

      <comment>/* Phoenician Sports */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Phoenicia was an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient Canaan, with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern day Lebanon, extending to parts of Israel, Syria and the Palestinian territories. Phoenician civilization was an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the Mediterranean during the period 1550 BC to 300 BC. Though ancient boundaries of such city-centered cultures fluctuated, the city of Tyre seems to have been the southernmost. Sarepta (modern day Sarafand) between Sidon and Tyre, is the most thoroughly excavated city of the Phoenician homeland. The Phoenicians often traded by means of a galley, a man-powered sailing vessel and are credited with the invention of the bireme

=Introduction to Phoenicia=
Phoenicia was an area containing today's Lebanon and areas above it, comprised of nine autonomous city-states. In spite of being divided as such, the Phoenicians were very closely confederated; that is to say that their societies were very similar to each other in script, religion, and inter-city games.

Geographically, Phoenicia was very well off. Right to the east there used to be a cedar forest, and further on there were hills. Except for the Romans (who caused the Phoenician civilization to become extinct), no other empire had ever dominated Phoenicia. This is due to the fact that the Phoenicians were commercially very important to other cultures. 

[[File:Phoenicia_map-en.svg | thumb | left | 300px | A map of the Phoenician city-states]]

=Economy=
Phoenician economy was a civilization entirely based on maritime commerce and seafaring.

=Culture=
==Structure of Phoenician Society==
Phoenicia was divided into nine autonomous city-states, each with their own absolute ruler.

They had a very mobile society, in which, either by luck or competence, one could move between social echelons.

==Phoenician Religion==
The Phoenicians were polytheists. Their main god was Baal.
Baal (ba'al), plural Baalim (ba'allm) [Semitic,= possessor], name used throughout the Old Testament for the deity or deities of Canaan. The term was originally applied to various local gods, but by the time of the Ugarit tablets (14th cent. B.C.), Baal had become the ruler of the universe. Baal (Hadad) is regularly denominated &quot;the son of Dagan,&quot; although Dagan (biblical Dagon) does not appear as an actor in the mythological texts. Baal also bears the titles &quot;Rider of the Clouds,&quot; &quot;Almighty,&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Earth.&quot; 

Baal is also called El however in the Ugaritic myths he's depicted as son of El, The first Canaanite god. Ba'al who died was resurrected by El's daughter Anat.

They were the only people of the Middle East to sacrifice humans; those being sacrificed had to be pure in the sense of not working and being a virgin. This meant that children were the only ones that were sacrifices for the gods.
There were many temples of Baal in Canaan, and the name Baal was often added to that of a locality, e.g., Baal-peor, Baal-hazor, Baal-hermon. The Baal cult penetrated Israel and at times led to a syncretism. The practices of holy prostitution and child sacrifice were especially abhorrent to the Hebrew prophets, who denounced the cult and its &quot;high places&quot; (temples).

==Phoenician Sports==
The Phoenicians held inter-city games, similar to those of the Greeks. For the Phoenicians, the city that won the games won it because the patron god of the city had helped them; this would mean that all the other cities should pay reverence to that god until the next games.The Phoenicians also had a palestra which was a gym or wrestling school.
 

[[File:Phoenician_alphabet.svg | 350 px | thumb | The Phoenician alphabet]]

=Contributions=
The Phoenicians had numerous special methods of boat-making that are still used to this day, including the design of a boat and how to make it impermeable.

More importantly, though, was the contribution of the first alphabet (originally used to ease communication with other people, giving rise to cognates and new scripts).

Hi folks, I think you either dont know, what Silesian means, or you intentionally abuse this term for whatsoever polish dialect/slang? (so called Slonskian), that is more similair to russian, then to any other east-high-german dialect!? Silesian (Schlesisch) is still a geman dialect with obvious similarities to Fränkisch, Hessisch and Pfälzisch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a large number of files in one or more collections and you want to generate a histogram chart that shows the relative distribution of the number of files in each size range.

== Method ==
We will use the xmldb:size() function to generate a list of all the file sizes in a given collection.  We can then transform this list into a series of strings that can be passed to the Google Charts line chart function.

The format of the size function is the following:
  xmldb:size($collection, $document-name)
This function returns the number of bytes in a file.


Our first step is to create a sequence of numbers that represents all of the sizes of resources in a collection:
  let $sizes :=
   for $file in xmldb:get-child-resources($collection)
      let $size := xmldb:size($collection, $file)
      return
         $size

This can also be done with a combination of the collection() function and the util:document-name() function:
   let $sizes :=
      for $file in collection($collection)/*
         let $name := util:document-name($file)
         let $size := xmldb:size($collection, $name)
         return
            $size

== Sample Program ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

(: Put the collection you want to analyze here :)
let $collection := &quot;/db/test&quot;

(: How many bytes in each section :)
let $increment := 10000

(: How many divisions :)
let $divisions := 20

(: Color for the lines or the bars in RRGGBB :)
let $color := '0000FF'

(: For vertical bar chart use 'bvs', for line chart use 'lc', for spark line (no axis) use 'ls' :)
let $chart-type := 'bvs'

(: this is the max size of a google chart - 30K pixels.  The first number is the width, the second is the height.  :)
let $chart-size := '600x500'

let $uriapi := 'http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?'

let $sizes :=
   for $file in xmldb:get-child-resources($collection)
      let $size := xmldb:size($collection, $file)
      return
         $size

(: the raw data counts for each range.  The 't' is just a marker that it is true that we are in this range. :)
let $raw-data :=
    for $range in (0 to $divisions)
       let $min := $range * $increment
       let $max := ($range + 1) * $increment
       return
          count(
               for $number in $sizes
               return
                 if ($number gt $min and $number lt $max)
                 then ('t') else ()
              )

let $max-value := max($raw-data)

(: scale to the max height :)
let $scaled-data := 
   for $num in $raw-data
   return string(floor($num div ($max-value div 500)))

(: join the strings with commas to get a comma separated list :)
let $data-csv := string-join($scaled-data, ',')

(: construct the URL :)
let $chart-uri := concat($uriapi, 'cht=', $chart-type, '&amp;amp;chs=', $chart-size, '&amp;amp;chco=', $color, '&amp;amp;chd=t:', $data-csv)

(: return the results in an HTML page :)
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Google Chart Histogram View of {$collection}&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Google Chart Histogram View of {$collection}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{request:encode-url(xs:anyURI($chart-uri))}&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Result ==
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=ls&amp;chs=500x500&amp;chco=0000FF&amp;chd=t:83,6,13,37,85,414,500,87,41,31,11,16,9,12,5,7,4,4,3,1,1

== Discussion ==
To run the query you will need to customized the name of the collection that you are analyzing.  After you run the query you can check to make sure the results are what you expect and then copy the results into a browser URL.

Note that if there are files over the max size indicated in the top range, an additional count of these file sizes should be added.

  let $top-range := $increment * ($divisions + 1)
  let $top-count := count(
            for $num in $sizes
            return
               if ($num &gt; $overflow)
                 then ('t')
                 else ()
        )

This query could also be parametrized using the get-parameter() function so that many of the parameters that are passed to the Google chart can also be set as a parameter in the XQuery of the URL.

== instanceof operator ==

The &lt;tt&gt;instanceof&lt;/tt&gt; operator determines if an object was instantiated as a child of another object, returning true if this was the case.  &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; is a binary infix operator whose left operand is an object and whose right operand is an object type.  It returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the left operand is of the type specified by the right operand  It differs from the &lt;code&gt;.constructor&lt;/code&gt; property in that it &quot;walks up the prototype chain.&quot;  If object &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is an extension of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;a instanceof b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a instanceof c&lt;/code&gt; both return true, whereas &lt;code&gt;a.constructor === b&lt;/code&gt; returns true, while &lt;code&gt;a.constructor === c&lt;/code&gt; returns false.

== Inheritance by Prototypes ==
The prototype of an object can be used to create fields and methods for an object.  This prototype can be used for inheritance by assigning a new instance of the superclass to the prototype. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
function CoinObject()
{
    this.value = 0; 
    this.diameter = 1;
}

function Penny()
{
    this.value=1;
}
Penny.prototype = new CoinObject();

function Nickel()
{
    this.value=5;
}
Nickel.prototype = new CoinObject();
&lt;/source&gt;

== Inheritance by functions ==
{{TODO|Provide a recommended method for function-based inheritance - one reference is [http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html http://www.crockford.com/javascript/inheritance.html]|JavaScript}}
&lt;source lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
function CoinObject()
{
    this.value = 0; 
    this.diameter = 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Grammar==

===Plurals of Nouns===
Almost every portuguese word ends with '''s'''

to know how to make the plural:
The suffix '''-s''' is added normally
The '''-es''' is added when the word ends with '''r''' or '''z'''; in some words ending with '''ão''', the '''o''' is removed to add '''-es''' (Pão → Pães).
The '''-is''' is added in some words ending with '''al''', '''el''', '''ol''' or '''ul'' (Pastel → Pastéis (the accute is added for the pronunciation))
The '''-ns''' is added in words ending with '''m''' (Atum → Atuns)
The '''-ões''' is added in some words ending with ão. (ão is removed and then -ões is added) (Limão → Limões)
====Regular Plurals====
Casa → Casas
====Irregular Plurals====
''Qualquer'' (any) becomes ''quaisquer''.
Most words that end with 'x' don't change: ''Tórax'' (thorax. chest), ''inox'' (Stainless steel)

===Notes===
*''papel'' (paper) never takes the indefinite articles. The following are the possibilities:

'''
: o papel
: os papeis '''
:: Remember that to make an -l noun plural, switch the -l to -is.
:: Furthermore, ''os papéis'' may also mean &quot;the forms&quot; or &quot;the documents.&quot; '''
: o pedaço/a folha de papel (the piece/sheet of paper)
: os pedaços/as folhas de papel (the pieces/sheets of paper)
: um pedaço/uma folha de papel (a piece/sheet of paper)
: uns pedaços/umas folhas de papel (some/a few pieces/sheets of paper)'''


Here are a few extra vocabulary words:

'''o teste''' - quiz or multiple-choice question (you're being &quot;tested&quot; on it)

'''a prova''' - test (you're trying to &quot;prove&quot; you know it)

'''o exame''' - exam

'''a nota''' - numerical grade

'''a pergunta, questão''' - question ('''pergunta''' tends to be used more for spoken questions, '''questão''' for written ones)

'''a resposta''' - answer (think of &quot;response&quot;)

'''a redação''' - essay

:'''a dissertação, a redação dissertativa''' - expository essay

Be careful not to mix up the meanings of ''teste'' and ''prova'' - ''testes'' are worth less than ''provas'', which are in turn worth less than ''exames''.

===Exercises===

'''A. Testes e Questões Dissertativas''' - Multiple-Choice Questions and Written Answers

1. Qual vale mais pra nota final? (Which is worth more for the final grade?)
:A. Um Teste
:B. Uma Caneta
:C. Uma Prova
:D. Uma Borracha

2. Explique sua resposta pra primeira pergunta em inglês. 
(Explain your answer to the first question in English.)

3. Quais três coisas são necessárias para escrever na sala de aula (em português)?
(Which three things are necessary for writing in the classroom? Answer in Portuguese.) &lt;sub&gt;Warning: when answering this one, remember the adjective for &quot;necessary&quot; and that in lists, a comma never precedes &quot;e&quot; - Um, dois e três - NOT &lt;strike&gt;Um, dois, e três&lt;strike&gt;.

==Access Control ==

JavaScript does not provide a direct means to control access to internal variables, however, it is possible to restrict access to some variables.  

By default, variables within an object are public and can be modified anywhere in the code.  As such, any programmer that uses the code in the future may change the internal state of the object unexpectedly, which has the potential for problems.  While the easiest protection against this is to properly document your code (e.g. comments showing how to use the object), there are cases where you want to block direct access to a variable.  

To declare and use a variable as private, there are two steps required:
* Declare a new variable within the constructor using the var statement. 
* Create an anonymous function within the constructor, and assign it as a method for an object.  

{{TODO|Cleanup example; it's currently purely synthetic and arbitrary.|JavaScript}}
The example below shows a private field being used:
&lt;source lang=JavaScript&gt;
function MyObject()
{
   this.publicNumber = 10;  // Public field.
   var privateNumber = 20;  // Private variable.  

   this.getPrivateNumber = function() 
   {
      return privateNumber;
   }
}

testObject = new MyObject();
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;var privateNumber&lt;/code&gt; is normally a local variable that only exists within the function.  As you can see, it is accessed in &lt;code&gt;this.getPrivateNumber()&lt;/code&gt;, which is an anonymous function, attempting to access it directly would result in an error. Since this anonymous function is declared in the constructor, it can use and modify the local variables declared in &lt;code&gt;function MyObject&lt;/code&gt;, and keeps a reference to the variable even when the function returns.  The anonymous function is bound to an instance of the object, and creating a new MyObject will create a new anonymous function that refers to the new &lt;code&gt;privateNumber&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For a very long time, Piquet was the dominant 2-handed card game. It features a remarkable combination of melding and trick-taking. One interesting feature is the strong asymmetry between dealer and non-dealer. The game is played with what is known as a piquet deck and has been used for numerous other games since. There are also variants for more than 2 players.

==Overview==
The game was originally played with 36 cards, but since c.&amp;nbsp;1700&lt;ref&gt;Merlin, ''Origine des cartes à jouer, p. 121: &quot;… le 6 est supprimé, ainsi qu'il l'est dans le piquet français depuis la fin du dix-septième siècle.&quot; Cavendish (1896), p. 76: &quot;In the edition of 'The Compleat Gamester' of 1709 a note is added, that 'These were the Rules of the Game when it was play'd with the sixes, but however the Rules hold for the Game as it is play'd at present without the Sixes, only when it is played without the Sixes the Elder Hand is to take Five of the eight cards in the stock.'&quot; This fixes the time when the alteration of the pack became generally recognised in England.&lt;/ref&gt; it is played with 32 cards: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7. The rules have numerous variants, but the following deliberately vague and incomplete description correctly describes all of them.

The dealer deals 12 cards to each player, in batches of 2 or in batches of 3. The remaining 8–12 cards form the stock.
Elder hand (i.e. the non-dealer) first discards some cards, then draws from the stock to fill his hand up again. Afterwards dealer does the same.

Before card-play begins, the players need to find out who holds the better cards with respect to three kinds of announcements, ''point'', ''sequence'', and ''set'', and consequently has the right to score for them. ''Point'' goes to the player who has the greatest number of cards in one suit, and scores the number of cards.&lt;ref&gt;This is not entirely accurate, see Cavendish (1896), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sequence'' goes to the player who has the longest consecutive sequence in one suit. This player can score for all such sequences in his hand: 3 or 4 points for every such sequence of length 3 or 4, and 15–18 points for every such sequence of length 5–8. ''Set'' goes to the player who has the highest-ranking 4 of a kind, worth 14 points, or else 3 of a kind, worth 3 points. Often only Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten are allowed in sets. As for sequences, the player with the highest-ranking set can score for all sets.

Elder hand begins card-play by leading to the first trick. The second player to a trick must follow suit; in older rules there was also an obligation to take the trick when possible. In this phase players can score points for leading to a trick and for winning a trick. In the end, a player who won more than 6 tricks also scores 10 bonus points.

There are a number of ways to obtain additional bonus points. A player who has no court/face cards before discarding, scores 10 points for ''carte blanche''. A player who scores 30 points or more before the opponent scores at all gets another 30 points for ''pic'', or 60 points for ''repic'' if this happens before the first card is played out. A player who wins all tricks scores another 30 points, in addition to the 10 points for winning the majority of tricks, for ''capot''.

==Modern English rules==
Since 1744, the standard rules for Piquet in England were those from Hoyle's &quot;Short Treatise on the Game of Piquet&quot;, which contained 26 rules regulating specific difficulties. Later editors of Hoyle's Games added 9 more rules, but these were not considered authoritative. In 1873 the Portland Club developed a more complete set of rules for Piquet ''au cent''. This was followed in 1882 by the publication &quot;The Laws of Piquet adopted by the Portland and Turf Clubs&quot;, which quickly became the English standard for both Piquet ''au cent'' and Rubicon Piquet. The rules for playing a hand, as given in that publication, differ in many details. Some of these differences do not appear to be justified by the different accounting methods. The rules for Piquet ''au cent'' are generally more conservative than those for Rubicon Piquet.

===Rubicon Piquet===
General principles for these rules are that in calling, a player whose call is not good or equal is only required to expose a minimum of information; and that any information exposed to the dealer may be deferred to after the first deal. Also, both players must discard at least 1 card.

'''Dealing:''' For all purposes (cutting for deal, calling and playing) the cards rank A–K–Q–J–10–9–8–7. Dealer deals 12 cards to each, in batches of 2 or in batches of 3. The remaining 8 cards form the stock.

'''Discarding and taking in:''' The first 5 cards on the stock belong to elder hand, who discards 1–5 cards and draws the same number. If elder hand  draws less than 5 cards, he may look at the remainder, at least one of which will be drawn by dealer. Dealer discards at least 1 card and up to as many as remain in the stock, and draws the same number. If dealer leaves any cards in the stock, he may decide that both players may look at them. In this case elder hand must lead to the first trick before looking, or at least announce which suit he will lead.

'''Calling and showing:''' The ''point'' is always called first; the right to score it is won by the player with the greater number of cards in a single suit. The sum of pip values as indicated in the table is used as a tie-breaker. The player whose point passes scores the number of cards. The order of the next two calls is not compulsory, although sequences are normally called before sets because they must be scored before sets. (This can be important w.r.t. pique or repique.) The right to score for ''sequence'' is won by the player with the longest consecutive sequence of at least three cards in one suit. The rank of the highest card in the sequence is used as a tie-breaker. The player whose sequence passes scores the value of the sequence plus any additional inferior sequences, as indicated in the table. The right to score for ''set'' is won by the player who has the greatest number of cards of the same rank, the number being at least three and the rank being at least 10. The rank is used as a tie-breaker. The player whose set passes scores the value of the set plus any additional inferior sets, as indicated in the table.

Players are allowed to make understatements when calling, so long as they actually hold the cards they claim to hold. E.g. it is allowed to pretend that a sequence is shorter than it is, or to call an inferior sequence that one also holds, but not to pretend that a sequence to a Queen is a sequence of the same length to a Jack.

Each call begins by elder hand announcing a minimum of information (number of cards for point, length for sequence, size for set). Dealer responds with &quot;good&quot; if his hand is inferior or &quot;not good&quot; if it is better. If the information is not sufficient, dealer responds with &quot;equal&quot;, and elder hand announces the tie-breaking information. Dealer again responds with &quot;good&quot; or &quot;not good&quot;. When calling point or sequence the tie-breaker may not actually break the tie, and so dealer may also respond with &quot;equal&quot;. In this case neither player scores.

Every card used to score must be disclosed on request, either by showing it or by saying what it is. For elder hand this obligation starts immediately after scoring; for dealer it starts after elder hand has led to the first trick. It is proper etiquette to volunteer this kind of information when it is relevant for the opponent.

'''Playing cards:''' Elder hand leads to the first trick. The second player to a trick must follow suit if possible. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick. There are no trumps. Whenever a player leads to a trick, he scores 1 point. Whenever a player wins a trick with the second card, he also scores 1 point. The winner of the last trick additionally scores 1 point. A player who wins more than 6 tricks scores 10 points for the card. A player who wins all tricks instead scores 40 points for ''capot''. Players can always look at earlier tricks and at their own discards.

'''Special cases:''' A player who scores 30 points or more before the opponent scores at all gets another 30 points for ''pique'', or 60 points for ''repique'' if this happens before the first card is played out. Equality in one of the three calls does not count as scoring in this sense for either player. A player who, before discarding, has neither King nor Queen nor Jack, can score 10 points for ''carte blanche''. This must be announced as soon as discovered. The ''carte blanche'' must be proved, by dealing the cards quickly on the table, after the opponent has discarded. Thus if elder hand has ''carte blanche'' he discards but does not draw, and tells dealer to discard (and not draw). Then he shows his hand, after which both players draw in their cards.

'''''Partie:''''' A ''partie'' normally consists of six deals, players players cutting for the right to decide who deals first (which is a slight advantage), and then dealing alternately. In case of a tie, another two deals are played. In case of another tie the ''partie'' is drawn. The outcome of a ''partie'' is also expressed in a score. Normally this is 100 points plus the difference of total scores. However, if the loser of the ''partie'' scored less than 100 points, the winner is said to win a ''rubicon'', and the value of the ''partie'' is 100 points plus the ''sum'' of total scores.

===Piquet ''au cent''===

Dealer need not discard, but may discard up to as many as remain in the stock, and draw the same number. If dealer leaves any cards in the stock, he may decide that both players may look at them. In this case elder hand must lead to the first trick before looking, or at least announce which suit he will lead.

The player whose sequence passes scores the value of the sequence plus any additional inferior sequences, as indicated in the table. The right to score for ''set'' is won by the player who has the greatest number of cards of the same rank, the number being at least three and the rank being at least 10.

Having shuffled the cards, the dealer presents the deck to the non-dealer for cutting. At this point the non-dealer may instead shuffle as well, in which case the dealer shuffles again and presents the deck again for cutting. The non-dealer is obliged to cut; the two parts of the stack must be at least two cards each. (In case of any irregularities in cutting, the dealer deals again.)

The non-dealer having cut, the dealer puts what was the lower part of the stack on top of what was the higher part, and deals 12 cards to each in batches of 2 or 3. Each player may only change the size of the batches after having told the opponent before shuffling.

If, due to a mistake by the dealer, one player has 13 cards, non-dealer decides whether the deal must be repeated. If the deal is not repeated, the error is corrected in the next stage in the obvious way, i.e. by the affected player taking one card less from the stock than otherwise possible and discarding as many as necessary to keep 12. If one player has 14 or more cards, dealer must deal again in any case.

If the talon contains a face-up card by mistake, and the card is not the top card of the talon or the top of dealer's 3 alloted cards, this is ignored.  The case of misdeal mentioned above does not apply (that is, non-dealer has no right to repeat the deal).  But this situation may arise with a 7-card talon when correcting a misdeal, or with a 9-card talon [when do the rules allow a 9-card talon?]

In some countries the local custom says that the dealer counts the first 5 cards of the stock and puts them crosswise on top the last 3. This should not be followed, as it gives the dealer the chance to notice special features of the individual cards.

If a player realizes that he dealt out of turn, he can insist that the deal be aborted and the opponent deals, even after players have seen their hands, so long as no one has followed to the first card led.

A player who has carte blanche, i.e. not a single King, Queen or Jack, can count them singly on the table and score 10 points. This has to be done immediately after the opponent has drawn from the stock and discarded. I.e. dealer does it before drawing, while non-dealer does it after both have drawn and discarded. These 10 points are subject to duplication etc. like any other game points.

Non-dealer discards 5 cards and replaces them from the stock. Non-dealer has the right to discard and replace 1 to 4 cards instead of 5, but has to announce this. Non-dealer may look at whichever of the top 5 cards he leaves in the stock. [Do the rules mention dealer's discard? Must dealer discard at least 1 card?]

A player who has taken too many cards from the stock but has not seen them, may simply put them back. A player who has taken too many cards and has seen them, must forfeit all declarations.  The punished player's opponent scores all legal combinations unconditionally.

If after discarding a player has less than 12 cards (because he received less than 12 from the dealer, or because he drew less than he discarded), then this is ignored. At the end of the hand, the player with more cards plays a one-card &quot;trick&quot; or even a series of them.

Non-dealer is not allowed to encourage dealer to make a mistake, by appearing to wait for dealer to discard and draw before non-dealer has done it. In this case the deal (&quot;coup&quot;) is annulled. If dealer erroneously draws before non-dealer for any other reason, the punishment varies according to local custom.

If non-dealer has not announced discarding and drawing less than 5 cards, and dealer took the stock expecting to find only 3 cards there and consequently has more than 12 cards, then the deal is repeated unless non-dealer agrees with dealer playing with the bigger hand.

Players must not even touch the stock before discarding, or they forfeit all declarations. After touching the stock, a player may not change the discard any more. In the worst case, if a player discovers having discarded too many cards only after touching the stock, the player will have to play with fewer cards as described above.

A player may not waive the punishment of an opponent having more than 12 cards, and may not fix the error by drawing superfluous cards as in a children's game.

Non-dealer adds the point values of the cards of one suit and announces the result, provided it is at least 30. He looks for the longest sequence in suit, with the highest ranks, and announces the length and the suit. And he looks for the highest-ranking quatorze (i.e. four of a kind of Tens or above) or threes (also Tens or above) and announces that. All in one go. One is allowed to announce inferior combinations that one holds instead of better ones, but of course that can lead to losing the right to score to the opponent.

Dealer makes similar calculations, but only announces what is better than what non-dealer has announced.

Now non-dealer scores for those announcements that were not topped by dealer. For point the number of cards. For Sequence the sequence announced and any lower sequences, counting 18, 17, 16, 15, 4, 3. For the quatorze or threes announce and any lower ones 14 or 3.
Non-dealer simultaneously plays out the first card for trick-play and scores 1 point for playing out.

Business (or Strategic) management is the art, science, and craft of formulating, implementing and evaluating cross-functional decisions that will enable an organization to achieve its long-term objectives. It is the process of specifying the organization's mission, vision and objectives, developing policies and plans, often in terms of projects and programs, which are designed to achieve these objectives, and then allocating resources to implement the policies and plans, projects and programs. Strategic management seeks to coordinate and integrate the activities of the various functional areas of a business in order to achieve long-term organizational objectives. A balanced scorecard is often used to evaluate the overall performance of the business and its progress towards objectives.

Strategic management is the highest level of managerial activity. Strategies are typically planned, crafted or guided by the Chief Executive Officer, approved or authorized by the Board of directors, and then implemented under the supervision of the organization's top management team or senior executives. Strategic management provides overall direction to the enterprise and is closely related to the field of Organization Studies. In the field of business administration it is useful to talk about &quot;strategic alignment&quot; between the organization and its environment or &quot;strategic consistency&quot;. According to Arieu (2007), &quot;there is strategic consistency when the actions of an organization are consistent with the expectations of management, and these in turn are with the market and the context.&quot;

Before reading the rest, it is recommended that [[/Overview of  Strategic Planning|An Overview of  Strategic Planning]] be read.

'''Strategic planning''' is an organization's process of defining its strategy, or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy, including its capital and people. Various business analysis techniques can be used in strategic planning, including SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats ) and PEST analysis (Political, Economic, Social, and Technological analysis) or STEER analysis involving Socio-cultural, Technological, Economic, Ecological, and Regulatory factors and EPISTELS (Environment, Political, Informatic, Social, Technological, Economic, Legal and Spiritual)

Strategic planning is the formal consideration of an organization's future course. All strategic planning deals with at least one of three key questions:
# &quot;What do we do?&quot;
# &quot;For whom do we do it?&quot;
# &quot;How do we excel?&quot;
In business strategic planning, the third question is better phrased &quot;How can we beat or avoid competition?&quot;. (Bradford and Duncan, page 1).

In many organizations, this is viewed as a process for determining where an organization is going over the next year or more -typically 3 to 5 years, although some extend their vision to 20 years. 

In order to determine where it is going, the organization needs to know exactly where it stands, then determine where it wants to go and how it will get there. The resulting document is called the &quot;strategic plan&quot;.

It is also true that strategic planning may be a tool for effectively plotting the direction of a company; however, strategic planning itself cannot foretell exactly how the market will evolve and what issues will surface in the coming days in order to plan your organizational strategy. Therefore, strategic innovation and tinkering with the 'strategic plan' have to be a cornerstone strategy for an organization to survive the turbulent business climate.

== Vision, mission and values ==
Vision: Defines the desired or intended future state of a specific organization or enterprise in terms of its fundamental objective and/or strategic direction.

Mission: Defines the fundamental purpose of an organization or an enterprise, basically describing why it exists.

Values: Beliefs that are shared among the stakeholders of an organization.  Values drive an organization's culture and priorities.

== Methodologies ==
There are many approaches to strategic planning but typically a three-step process may be used:

* '''Situation''' - evaluate the current situation and how it came about. 
* '''Target''' - define goals and/or objectives (sometimes called ideal state)
* '''Path''' - map a possible route to the goals/objectives

One alternative approach is called ''Draw-See-Think''

* '''Draw''' - what is the ideal image or the desired end state?
* '''See''' - what is today's situation? What is the gap from ideal and why?
* '''Think''' - what specific actions must be taken to close the gap between today's situation and the ideal state?
* '''Plan''' - what resources are required to execute the activities?

An alternative to the ''Draw-See-Think'' approach is called ''See-Think-Draw''

* '''See''' - what is today's situation?
* '''Think''' - define goals/objectives
* '''Draw''' - map a route to achieving the goals/objectives

In other terms strategic planning can be as follows:

* '''Vision''' - Define the vision and set a mission statement with hierarchy of goals
* '''SWOT analysis|SWOT''' - Analysis conducted according to the desired goals
* '''Formulate''' - Formulate actions and processes to be taken to attain these goals
* '''Implement''' - Implementation of the agreed upon processes
* '''Control''' - Monitor and get feedback from implemented processes to fully control the operation

== Situational analysis ==
When developing strategies, analysis of the organization and its environment as it is at the moment and how it may develop in the future, is important. The analysis has to be executed at an internal level as well as an external level to identify all opportunities and threats of the external environment as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the organizations.

There are several factors to assess in the external situation analysis:

# Markets (customers)
# Competition
# Technology
# Supplier markets
# Labor markets
# The economy
# The regulatory environment

It is rare to find all seven of these factors having critical importance. It is also uncommon to find that the first two - markets and competition - are not of critical importance. [http://www.cssp.com/external_situation.php (Bradford &quot;External Situation - What to Consider&quot;)]

Analysis of the external environment normally focuses on the customer. Management should be visionary in formulating customer strategy, and should do so by thinking about market environment shifts, how these could impact customer sets, and whether those customer sets are the ones the company wishes to serve.

Analysis of the competitive environment is also performed, many times based on the framework suggested by Michael Porter.

== Goals, objectives and targets ==
Strategic planning is a very important business activity. It is also important in the public sector areas such as education. It is practiced widely informally and formally. Strategic planning and decision processes should end with objectives and a roadmap of ways to achieve those objectives.

The following terms have been used in strategic planning: desired end states, plans, policies, goals, objectives, strategies, tactics and actions. Definitions vary, overlap and fail to achieve clarity. The most common of these concepts are specific, time bound statements of intended future results and general and continuing statements of intended future results, which most models refer to as either goals or objectives (sometimes interchangeably).

One model of organizing objectives uses hierarchies. The items listed above may be organized in a hierarchy of means and ends and '''numbered''' as follows: Top Rank Objective (TRO), Second Rank Objective, Third Rank Objective, etc. From any rank, the objective in a lower rank answers to the question &quot;How?&quot; and the objective in a higher rank answers to the question &quot;Why?&quot; The exception is the Top Rank Objective (TRO): there is no answer to the &quot;Why?&quot; question. That is how the TRO is defined. 

People typically have several goals at the same time. &quot;Goal congruency&quot; refers to how well the goals combine with each other. Does goal A appear compatible with goal B? Do they fit together to form a unified strategy? &quot;Goal hierarchy&quot; consists of the nesting of one or more goals within other goal(s). 

One approach recommends having short-term goals, medium-term goals, and long-term goals. In this model, one can expect to attain short-term goals fairly easily: they stand just slightly above one's reach. At the other extreme, long-term goals appear very difficult, almost impossible to attain. Strategic management jargon sometimes refers to &quot;Big Hairy Audacious Goals&quot; (BHAGs) in this context. Using one goal as a stepping-stone to the next involves '''goal sequencing'''. A person or group starts by attaining the easy short-term goals, then steps up to the medium-term, then to the long-term goals. Goal sequencing can create a &quot;goal stairway&quot;. In an organizational setting, the organization may co-ordinate goals so that they do not conflict with each other. The goals of one part of the organization should mesh compatibly with those of other parts of the organization.

==Mission statements and vision statements==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Dilbert --&gt;
Organizations sometimes summarize goals and objectives into a '''mission statement''' and/or a '''vision statement''': 

While the existence of a shared mission is extremely useful, many strategy specialists question the requirement for a written mission statement. However, there are many models of strategic planning that start with mission statements, so it is useful to examine them here.

* A '''''Mission statement''''' tells you the fundamental purpose of the organization. It concentrates on the present.  It defines the customer and the critical processes.  It informs you of the desired level of performance.

* A '''''Vision statement''''' outlines what the organization wants to be. It concentrates on the future.  It is a source of inspiration.  It provides clear decision-making criteria.

Many people mistake vision statement for mission statement. The Vision describes a future identity while the Mission serves as an ongoing and time-independent guide.  The Mission describes why it is important to achieve the Vision. A Mission statement defines the purpose or broader goal for being in existence or in the business and can remain the same for decades if crafted well. A Vision statement is more specific in terms of both the future state and the time frame. Vision describes what will be achieved if the organization is successful.

A mission statement can resemble a vision statement in a few companies, but that can be a grave mistake. It can confuse people. The vision statement can galvanize the people to achieve defined objectives, even if they are stretch objectives, provided it can be elucidated in SMART (project management)|SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) terms. A mission statement provides a path to realize the vision in line with its values. These statements have a direct bearing on the bottom line and success of the organization. 

Which comes first? The mission statement or the vision statement? That depends. If you have a new start up business, new program or plan to re engineer your current services, then the vision will guide the mission statement and the rest of the strategic plan. If you have an established business where the mission is established, then many times, the mission guides the vision statement and the rest of the strategic plan. Either way, you need to know your fundamental purpose - the mission, your current situation in terms of internal resources and capabilities (strengths and/or weaknesses) and external conditions (opportunities and/or threats), and where you want to go - the vision for the future. It's important that you keep the end or desired result in sight from the start.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} .

Features of an effective vision statement include:

* Clarity and lack of ambiguity
* Vivid and clear picture
* Description of a bright future
* Memorable and engaging wording
* Realistic aspirations
* Alignment with organizational values and culture

To become really effective, an organizational vision statement must (the theory states) become assimilated into the organization's culture. Leaders have the responsibility of communicating the vision regularly, creating narratives that illustrate the vision, acting as role-models by embodying the vision, creating short-term objectives compatible with the vision, and encouraging others to craft their own personal vision compatible with the organization's overall vision.
In addition, mission statements need to conduct an internal assessment and an external assessment.  The internal assessment should focus on how members inside the organization interpret their mission statement.  The external assessment -- which includes all of the businesses stakeholders -- is valuable since it offers a different perspective.  These discrepancies between these two assessments can give insight on the organization's mission statement effectiveness.

Strategic management is a combination of three main processes which are as follows:

===Strategy formulation===
* Performing a situation analysis, self-evaluation and competitor analysis: both internal and external; both micro-environmental and macro-environmental.
* Concurrent with this assessment, objectives are set. These objectives should be parallel to a timeline; some are in the short-term and others on the long-term. This involves crafting vision statements (long term view of a possible future), mission statements (the role that the organization gives itself in society), overall corporate objectives (both financial and strategic), strategic business unit objectives (both financial and strategic), and tactical objectives.
*  These objectives should, in the light of the situation analysis, suggest a strategic plan. The plan provides the details of how to achieve these objectives.
This three-step strategy formulation process is sometimes referred to as determining where you are now, determining where you want to go, and then determining how to get there. These three questions are the essence of strategic planning.  I/O Economics for the external factors and RBV for the internal factors.

===Strategy implementation===
* Allocation and management of sufficient resources (financial, personnel, time, technology support)
* Establishing a chain of command or some alternative structure (such as cross functional teams)
* Assigning responsibility of specific tasks or processes to specific individuals or groups
* It also involves managing the process. This includes monitoring results, comparing to benchmarks and best practices, evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the process, controlling for variances, and making adjustments to the process as necessary.
* When implementing specific programs, this involves acquiring the requisite resources, developing the process, training, process testing, documentation, and integration with (and/or conversion from) legacy processes.
Thus this type of problem can  occur in strategy

In order for a policy to work, there must be a level of consistency from every person in an organization,  including from the management. This is what needs to occur on the tactical level of management as well as strategic.

===Strategy evaluation===
*Measuring the effectiveness of the organizational strategy, it's extremely important to conduct a SWOT analysis to figure out the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (both internal and external) of the entity in question. This may require to take certain precautionary measures or even to change the entire strategy.

In corporate strategy, Johnson and Scholes present a model in which strategic options are evaluated against three key success criteria:

* Suitability (would it work?)
* Feasibility (can it be made to work?)
* Acceptability (will they work it?)

====Suitability====
Suitability deals with the overall rationale of the strategy. The key point to consider is whether the strategy would address the key strategic issues underlined by the organisation's strategic position.

* Does it make economic sense?
* Would the organisation obtain economies of scale, economies of scope or experience economy?
* Would it be suitable in terms of environment and capabilities?

Tools that can be used to evaluate suitability include:

* Ranking strategic options
* Decision trees
* What-if analysis

====Feasibility====
Feasibility is concerned with the resources required to implement the strategy are available, can be developed or obtained. Resources include '''funding''', '''people''', '''time''' and '''information'''.

Tools that can be used to evaluate feasibility include:

* cash flow analysis and forecasting
* break-even analysis
* resource deployment analysis

====Acceptability====
Acceptability is concerned with the expectations of the identified stakeholders (mainly shareholders, employees and customers) with the expected performance outcomes, which can be return, risk and stakeholder reactions.

* '''Return''' deals with the benefits expected by the stakeholders (financial and non-financial). For example, shareholders would expect the increase of their wealth, employees would expect improvement in their careers and customers would expect better value for money.
* '''Risk''' deals with the probability and consequences of failure of a strategy (financial and non-financial).
* '''Stakeholder reactions''' deals with anticipating the likely reaction of stakeholders. Shareholders could oppose the issuing of new shares, employees and unions could oppose outsourcing for fear of losing their jobs, customers could have concerns over a merger with regards to quality and support.

Tools that can be used to evaluate acceptability include:

* what-if analysis
* stakeholder mapping

== General approaches ==
In general terms, there are two main approaches, which are opposite but  complement each other in some ways, to strategic management:
* '''The Industrial Organizational Approach'''
** based on [[macroeconomics|economic theory]] &amp;mdash; deals with issues like competitive rivalry, resource allocation, economies of scale
** assumptions &amp;mdash; rationality, self discipline behaviour, profit maximization
* '''The Sociological Approach'''
** deals primarily with human interactions
** assumptions &amp;mdash; bounded rationality, satisfying behaviour, profit sub-optimality. An example of a company that currently operates this way is Google

Strategic management techniques can be viewed as bottom-up, top-down, or collaborative processes. In the bottom-up approach, employees submit proposals to their managers who, in turn, funnel the best ideas further up the organization. This is often accomplished by a capital budgeting process. Proposals are assessed using financial criteria such as return on investment or cost-benefit analysis. Cost underestimation and benefit overestimation are major sources of error. The proposals that are approved form the substance of a new strategy, all of which is done without a grand strategic design or a strategic architect. The top-down approach is the most common by far. In it, the CEO, possibly with the assistance of a strategic planning team, decides on the overall direction the company should take. Some organizations are starting to experiment with collaborative strategic planning techniques that recognize the emergent nature of strategic decisions.

==The strategy hierarchy==
In most  corporations there are several levels of management. Strategic management is the highest of these levels in the sense that it is the broadest - applying to all parts of the firm - while also incorporating the longest time horizon. It gives direction to corporate values, corporate culture, corporate goals, and corporate missions. Under this broad corporate strategy there are typically business-level competitive strategies and functional unit strategies.

'''Corporate strategy''' refers to the overarching strategy of the diversified firm.  Such a corporate strategy answers the questions of &quot;in which businesses should we compete?&quot; and &quot;how does being in these business create synergy and/or add to the competitive advantage of the corporation as a whole?&quot;

'''Business strategy''' refers to the aggregated strategies of single business firm or a strategic business unit (SBU) in a diversified corporation.  According to Michael Porter, a firm must formulate a business strategy that incorporates either cost leadership, differentiation or focus in order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage and long-term success in its chosen arenas or industries.

'''Functional strategies''' include marketing strategies, new product development strategies, human resource strategies, financial strategies, legal strategies, supply-chain strategies, and information technology management strategies. The emphasis is on short and medium term plans and is limited to the domain of each department’s functional responsibility. Each functional department attempts to do its part in meeting overall corporate objectives, and hence to some extent their strategies are derived from broader corporate strategies.

Many companies feel that a functional organizational structure is not an efficient way to organize activities so they have reengineering|reengineered according to processes or SBUs. A '''strategic business unit''' is a semi-autonomous unit that is usually responsible for its own budgeting, new product decisions, hiring decisions, and price setting. An SBU is treated as an internal profit centre by corporate headquarters.

An additional level of strategy called '''operational strategy''' was encouraged by Peter Drucker in his theory of management by objectives (MBO).  It is very narrow in focus and deals with day-to-day operational activities such as scheduling criteria. It must operate within a budget but is not at liberty to adjust or create that budget.  Operational level strategies are informed by business level strategies which, in turn, are informed by corporate level strategies.

Since the turn of the millennium, some firms have reverted to a simpler strategic structure driven by advances in information technology. It is felt that knowledge management systems should be used to share information and create common goals. Strategic divisions are thought to hamper this process.  This notion of strategy has been captured under the rubric of '''dynamic strategy''', popularized by Carpenter and Sanders's textbook [http://www.prenhall.com/carpenter/].  This work builds on that of Brown and Eisenhart as well as Christensen and portrays firm strategy, both business and corporate, as necessarily embracing ongoing strategic change, and the seamless integration of strategy formulation and implementation.  Such change and implementation are usually built into the strategy through the staging and pacing facets.

==Historical development of strategic management==
===Birth of strategic management ===
Strategic management as a discipline originated in the 1950s and 60s. Although there were numerous early contributors to the literature, the most influential pioneers were Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., Philip Selznick, Igor Ansoff, and Peter Drucker.

'''Alfred Chandler''' recognized the importance of coordinating the various aspects of management under one all-encompassing strategy. Prior to this time the various functions of management were separate with little overall coordination or strategy. Interactions between functions or between departments were typically handled by a boundary position, that is, there were one or two managers that relayed information back and forth between two departments. Chandler also stressed the importance of taking a long term perspective when looking to the future. In his 1962 groundbreaking work ''Strategy and Structure'', Chandler showed that a long-term coordinated strategy was necessary to give a company structure, direction, and focus. He says it concisely, “structure follows strategy.”&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Alfred ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the history of industrial enterprise'', Doubleday, New York, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- Today we recognize that this is only half the story: strategy also follows from structure (see Tom Peters ''Liberation Management''). THAT COMMENT DOESN'T FIT HERE IN TIME. --&gt;

In 1957, Philip Selznick introduced the idea of matching the organization's internal factors with external environmental circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Selznick, Philip ''Leadership in Administration: A Sociological Interpretation'', Row, Peterson, Evanston Il. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; This core idea was developed into what we now call SWOT analysis by Learned, Andrews, and others at the Harvard Business School General Management Group. Strengths and weaknesses of the firm are assessed in light of the opportunities and threats from the business environment.

Igor Ansoff built on Chandler's work by adding a range of strategic concepts and inventing a whole new vocabulary. He developed a strategy grid that compared market penetration strategies, product development strategies, market development strategies and horizontal integration|horizontal and vertical integration and diversification strategies. He felt that management could use these strategies to systematically prepare for future opportunities and challenges. In his 1965 classic ''Corporate Strategy'', he developed the gap analysis still used today in which we must understand the gap between where we are currently and where we would like to be, then develop what he called “gap reducing actions”.&lt;ref&gt;Ansoff, Igor ''Corporate Strategy'' McGraw Hill, New York, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Drucker was a prolific strategy theorist, author of dozens of management books, with a career spanning five decades. His contributions to strategic management were many but two are most important. Firstly, he stressed the importance of objectives. An organization without clear objectives is like a ship without a rudder. As early as 1954 he was developing a theory of management based on objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter ''The Practice of Management'', Harper and Row, New York, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolved into his theory of '''management by objectives''' (MBO). According to Drucker, the procedure of setting objectives and monitoring your progress towards them should permeate the entire organization, top to bottom. His other seminal contribution was in predicting the importance of what today we would call intellectual capital. He predicted the rise of what he called the “knowledge worker” and explained the consequences of this for management. He said that knowledge work is non-hierarchical. Work would be carried out in cross-functional team|teams with the person most knowledgeable in the task at hand being the temporary leader.

In 1985, Ellen-Earle Chaffee summarized what she thought were the main elements of strategic management theory by the 1970s:&lt;ref&gt;Chaffee, E.  “Three models of strategy”, ''Academy of Management Review'', vol 10, no. 1, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Strategic management involves adapting the organization to its business environment.
* Strategic management is fluid and complex. Change creates novel combinations of circumstances requiring unstructured non-repetitive responses.
* Strategic management affects the entire organization by providing direction.
* Strategic management involves both strategy formation (she called it content) and also strategy implementation (she called it process).
* Strategic management is partially planned and partially unplanned.
* Strategic management is done at several levels: overall corporate strategy, and individual business strategies.
* Strategic management involves both conceptual and analytical thought processes.'''

=== Growth and portfolio theory===
In the 1970s much of strategic management dealt with size, growth, and portfolio theory.
The PIMS study was a long term study, started in the 1960s and lasted for 19 years, that attempted to understand the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies (PIMS), particularly the effect of market share. Started at General Electric, moved to Harvard in the early 1970s, and then moved to the Strategic Planning Institute in the late 1970s, it now contains decades of information on the relationship between profitability and strategy. Their initial conclusion was unambiguous: The greater a company's market share, the greater will be their rate of profit. The high market share provides volume and economies of scale. It also provides experience and learning curve advantages. The combined effect is increased profits.&lt;ref&gt;Buzzell, R. and Gale, B. ''The PIMS Principles: Linking Strategy to Performance'', Free Press, New York, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The studies conclusions continue to be drawn on by academics and companies today: &quot;PIMS provides compelling quantitative evidence as to which business strategies work and don't work&quot; - Tom Peters.

The benefits of high market share naturally lead to an interest in growth strategies. The relative advantages of horizontal integration, vertical integration, diversification, Franchising|franchises, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and organic growth were discussed. The most appropriate market dominance strategies were assessed given the competitive and regulatory environment.

There was also research that indicated that a low market share strategy could also be very profitable. Schumacher (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F. ''Small is Beautiful: a Study of Economics as if People Mattered'', ISBN 0061317780 (also ISBN 0881791695)&lt;/ref&gt; Woo and Cooper (1982),&lt;ref&gt;Woo, C. and Cooper, A. “The surprising case for low market share”, ''Harvard Business Review'', November&amp;ndash;December 1982, pg 106&amp;ndash;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Levenson (1984),&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, J.C. ''Guerrilla Marketing, Secrets for making big profits from your small business'', Houghton Muffin Co. New York, 1984, ISBN 0-396-35350-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and later Traverso (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Traverso, D. ''Outsmarting Goliath'', Bloomberg Press, Princeton, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.

By the early 1980s the paradoxical conclusion was that high market share and low market share companies were often very profitable but most of the companies in between were not. This was sometimes called the “hole in the middle” problem. This anomaly would be explained by Michael Porter in the 1980s.

The management of diversified organizations required new techniques and new ways of thinking. The first CEO to address the problem of a multi-divisional company was Alfred Sloan at General Motors. GM was decentralized into semi-autonomous “strategic business units” (SBU's), but with centralized support functions.

One of the most valuable concepts in the strategic management of multi-divisional companies was '''portfolio theory'''. In the previous decade Harry Markowitz and other financial theorists developed the theory of modern portfolio theory|portfolio analysis. It was concluded that a broad portfolio of financial assets could reduce specific risk. In the 1970s marketers extended the theory to product portfolio decisions and managerial strategists extended it to operating division portfolios. Each of a company’s operating divisions were seen as an element in the corporate portfolio. Each operating division (also called strategic business units) was treated as a semi-independent profit center with its own revenues, costs, objectives, and strategies. Several techniques were developed to analyze the relationships between elements in a portfolio. B.C.G. Analysis, for example, was developed by the Boston Consulting Group in the early 1970s. This was the theory that gave us the wonderful image of a CEO sitting on a stool milking a '''cash cow'''. Shortly after that the G.E. multi factoral analysis|G.E. multi factoral model was developed by General Electric. Companies continued to diversify until the 1980s when it was realized that in many cases a portfolio of operating divisions was worth more as separate completely independent companies.

===The marketing revolution===

The 1970s also saw the rise of the marketing orientation|marketing oriented firm. From the beginnings of capitalism it was assumed that the key requirement of business success was a product (business)|product of high technical quality. If you produced a product that worked well and was durable, it was assumed you would have no difficulty selling them at a profit. This was called the production orientation and it was generally true that good products could be sold without effort, encapsulated in the saying &quot;Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door.&quot;  This was largely due to the growing numbers of affluent and middle class people that capitalism had created. But after the untapped demand caused by the second world war was saturated in the 1950s it became obvious that products were not selling as easily as they had been. The answer was to concentrate on selling. The 1950s and 1960s is known as the sales era and the guiding philosophy of business of the time is today called the sales orientation. In the early 1970s Theodore Levitt and others at Harvard argued that the sales orientation had things backward. They claimed that instead of producing products then trying to sell them to the customer, businesses should start with the customer, find out what they wanted, and then produce it for them. The customer became the driving force behind all strategic business decisions. This marketing orientation, in the decades since its introduction, has been reformulated and repackaged under numerous names including customer orientation, marketing philosophy, customer intimacy, customer focus, customer driven, and market focused.

By the late 70s people had started to notice how successful Japanese industry had become. In industry after industry, including steel, watches, ship building, cameras, autos, and electronics, the Japanese were surpassing American and European companies. Westerners wanted to know why. Numerous theories purported to explain the Japanese success including:
* Higher employee morale, dedication, and loyalty;
* Lower cost structure, including wages;
* Effective government industrial policy;
* Modernization after WWII leading to high capital intensity and productivity;
* Economies of scale associated with increased exporting;
* Relatively low value of the Yen leading to low interest rates and capital costs, low dividend expectations, and inexpensive exports;
* Superior quality control techniques such as Total Quality Management and other systems introduced by W. Edwards Deming in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;Schonberger, R. ''Japanese Manufacturing Techniques'', The Free Press, 1982, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although there was some truth to all these potential explanations, there was clearly something missing. In fact by 1980 the Japanese cost structure was higher than the American. And post WWII reconstruction was nearly 40 years in the past. The first management theorist to suggest an explanation was Richard Pascale.

In 1981 Richard Pascale and Anthony Athos in ''The Art of Japanese Management'' claimed that the main reason for Japanese success was their superior management techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Pascale, R. and Athos, A. ''The Art of Japanese Management'', Penguin, London, 1981, ISBN 0-446-30784-x.&lt;/ref&gt; They divided management into 7 aspects (which are also known as McKinsey 7S Framework): Strategy, Structure, Systems, Skills, Staff, Style, and Supraordinate goals (which we would now call shared values). The first three of the 7 S's were called hard factors and this is where American companies excelled. The remaining four factors (skills, staff, style, and shared values) were called soft factors and were not well understood by American businesses of the time (for details on the role of soft and hard factors see Wickens P.D. 1995.) Americans did not yet place great value on corporate culture, shared values and beliefs, and social cohesion in the workplace. In Japan the task of management was seen as managing the whole complex of human needs, economic, social, psychological, and spiritual. In America work was seen as something that was separate from the rest of one's life. It was quite common for Americans to exhibit a very different personality at work compared to the rest of their lives. Pascale also highlighted the difference between decision making styles; hierarchical in America, and consensus in Japan. He also claimed that American business lacked long term vision, preferring instead to apply management fads and theories in a piecemeal fashion.

One year later ''The Mind of the Strategist'' was released in America by Kenichi Ohmae, the head of McKinsey &amp; Co.'s Tokyo office.&lt;ref&gt;Ohmae, K. ''The Mind of the Strategist'' McGraw Hill, New York, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; (It was originally published in Japan in 1975.) He claimed that strategy in America was too analytical. Strategy should be a creative art: It is a frame of mind that requires intuition and intellectual flexibility. He claimed that Americans constrained their strategic options by thinking in terms of analytical techniques, rote formula, and step-by-step processes. He compared the culture of Japan in which vagueness, ambiguity, and tentative decisions were acceptable, to American culture that valued fast decisions.

Also in 1982 Tom Peters and Robert Waterman released a study that would respond to the Japanese challenge head on.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, T. and Waterman, R.  ''In Search of Excellence'', HarperCollins, New york, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Peters and Waterman, who had several years earlier collaborated with Pascale and Athos at McKinsey &amp; Co. asked “What makes an excellent company?”. They looked at 62 companies that they thought were fairly successful. Each was subject to six performance criteria. To be classified as an excellent company, it had to be above the 50th percentile in 4 of the 6 performance metrics for 20 consecutive years. Forty-three companies passed the test. They then studied these successful companies and interviewed key executives. They concluded in ''In Search of Excellence'' that there were 8 keys to excellence that were shared by all 43 firms. They are:
*A bias for action &amp;mdash; Do it. Try it. Don’t waste time studying it with multiple reports and committees.
*Customer focus &amp;mdash; Get close to the customer. Know your customer.
*Entrepreneurship &amp;mdash; Even big companies act and think small by giving people the authority to take initiatives.
*Productivity through people &amp;mdash; Treat your people with respect and they will reward you with productivity.
*Value-oriented CEOs &amp;mdash; The CEO should actively propagate corporate values throughout the organization.
*Stick to the knitting &amp;mdash; Do what you know well.
*Keep things simple and lean &amp;mdash; Complexity encourages waste and confusion.
*Simultaneously centralized and decentralized &amp;mdash; Have tight centralized control while also allowing maximum individual autonomy.

The basic blueprint on how to compete against the Japanese had been drawn. But as J.E. Rehfeld (1994) explains it is not a straight forward task due to differences in culture.&lt;ref&gt;Rehfeld, J.E. ''Alchemy of a Leader: Combining Western and Japanese Management skills to transform your company'', John Whily &amp; Sons, New York, 1994, ISBN 0-471-00836-2.&lt;/ref&gt; A certain type of alchemy was required to transform knowledge from various cultures into a management style that allows a specific company to compete in a globally diverse world. He says, for example, that Japanese style kaizen (continuous improvement) techniques, although suitable for people socialized in Japanese culture, have not been successful when implemented in the U.S. unless they are modified significantly.

The Japanese challenge shook the confidence of the western business elite, but detailed comparisons of the two management styles and examinations of successful businesses convinced westerners that they could overcome the challenge. The 1980s and early 1990s saw a plethora of theories explaining exactly how this could be done. They cannot all be detailed here, but some of the more important strategic advances of the decade are explained below.

Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad declared that strategy needs to be more active and interactive; less “arm-chair planning” was needed. They introduced terms like '''strategic intent''' and '''strategic architecture'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G. &amp; Prahalad, C.K.  “Strategic Intent”, ''Harvard Business Review'', May&amp;ndash;June 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G. &amp; Prahalad, C.K. ''Competing for the Future'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Their most well known advance was the idea of core competency. They showed how important it was to know the one or two key things that your company does better than the competition.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G. &amp; Prahalad, C.K.  “The Core Competence of the Corporation”, ''Harvard Business Review'', May&amp;ndash;June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Active strategic management required active information gathering and active problem solving. In the early days of Hewlett-Packard (H-P), Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett devised an active management style that they called '''Management By Walking Around''' (MBWA). Senior H-P managers were seldom at their desks. They spent most of their days visiting employees, customers, and suppliers. This direct contact with key people provided them with a solid grounding from which viable strategies could be crafted. The MBWA concept was popularized in 1985 by a book by Tom Peters and Nancy Austin.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Peters|Peters, T. and Nancy Austin|Austin, N. ''A Passion for Excellence'', Random House, New York, 1985 (also Warner Books, New York, 1985 ISBN 0-446-38348-1)&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese managers employ a similar system, which originated at Honda, and is sometimes called the 3 G's (Genba, Genbutsu, and Genjitsu, which translate into “actual place”, “actual thing”, and “actual situation”).

Probably the most influential strategist of the decade was Michael Porter. He introduced many new concepts including; 5 forces analysis, generic strategies, the value chain, strategic groups, and Porter's cluster|clusters. In Porter 5 forces analysis|5 forces analysis he identifies the forces that shape a firm's strategic environment. It is like a SWOT analysis with structure and purpose. It shows how a firm can use these forces to obtain a sustainable competitive advantage. Porter modifies Chandler's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: Organizational structure follows strategy, which in turn follows industry structure. Porter's Porter generic strategies|generic strategies detail the interaction between '''cost minimization strategies''', '''product differentiation strategies''', and '''market focus strategies'''. Although he did not introduce these terms, he showed the importance of choosing one of them rather than trying to position your company between them. He also challenged managers to see their industry in terms of a value chain. A firm will be successful only to the extent that it contributes to the industry's value chain. This forced management to look at its operations from the customer's point of view. Every operation should be examined in terms of what value it adds in the eyes of the final customer.

In 1993, John Kay (economist)|John Kay took the idea of the value chain to a financial level claiming “ Adding value is the central purpose of business activity”, where adding value is defined as the difference between the market value of outputs and the cost of inputs including capital, all divided by the firm's net output. Borrowing from Gary Hamel and Michael Porter, Kay claims that the role of strategic management is to identify your core competencies, and then assemble a collection of assets that will increase value added and provide a competitive advantage. He claims that there are 3 types of capabilities that can do this; innovation, reputation, and organizational structure.

The 1980s also saw the widespread acceptance of positioning (marketing)|positioning theory. Although the theory originated with Jack Trout in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until Al Ries and Jack Trout wrote their classic book “Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind” (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating a position in the mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques were applied to positioning theory, some newly invented but most borrowed from other disciplines. Perceptual mapping for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. Multidimensional scaling (in marketing)|Multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis (in marketing)|discriminant analysis, factor analysis, and conjoint analysis (in marketing)|conjoint analysis are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. Preference regression (in marketing)|Preference regression can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and cluster analysis (in marketing)|cluster analysis can identify clusters of positions.

Others felt that internal company resources were the key. In 1992, Jay Barney, for example, saw strategy as assembling the optimum mix of resources, including human, technology, and suppliers, and then configure them in unique and sustainable ways.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. (1991) “Firm Resources and Sustainable Competitive Advantage”, ''Journal of Management'', vol 17, no 1, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Not sure if this is the right reference.--&gt;

Michael Hammer and James Champy felt that these resources needed to be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, M. and Champy, J. ''Reengineering the Corporation'', Harper Business, New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; This process, that they labeled reengineering, involved organizing a firm's assets around whole processes rather than tasks. In this way a team of people saw a project through, from inception to completion. This avoided functional silos where isolated departments seldom talked to each other. It also eliminated waste due to functional overlap and interdepartmental communications.

In 1989 Richard Lester and the researchers at the MIT Industrial Performance Center identified seven '''best practices''' and concluded that firms must accelerate the shift away from the mass production of low cost standardized products. The seven areas of best practice were:&lt;ref&gt;Lester, R. ''Made in America'', MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity, Boston, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simultaneous continuous improvement in cost, quality, service, and product innovation
* Breaking down organizational barriers between departments
* Eliminating layers of management creating flatter organizational hierarchies.
* Closer relationships with customers and suppliers
* Intelligent use of new technology
* Global focus
* Improving human resource skills
The search for “best practices” is also called benchmarking.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, R. ''Benchmarking: The search for industry best practices that lead to superior performance'', American Society for Quality Control, Quality Press, Milwaukee, Wis., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; This involves determining where you need to improve, finding an organization that is exceptional in this area, then studying the company and applying its best practices in your firm.

A large group of theorists felt the area where western business was most lacking was product quality. People like W. Edwards Deming,&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W.E. ''Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position'', MIT Center for Advanced Engineering, Cambridge Mass., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph M. Juran,&lt;ref&gt;Juran, J.M. ''Juran on Quality'', Free Press, New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; A. Kearney,&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, A.T. ''Total Quality Management: A business process perspective'', Kearney Pree Inc, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Crosby,&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, P. ''Quality is Free'', McGraw Hill, New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and Armand Feignbaum&lt;ref&gt;Feignbaum, A. ''Total Quality Control'', 3rd edition, McGraw Hill, Maidenhead, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested quality improvement techniques like Total Quality Management (TQM), kaizen|continuous improvement, lean manufacturing, Six Sigma, and Return on Quality (ROQ).

An equally large group of theorists felt that poor customer service was the problem. People like James Heskett (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Heskett, J. ''Managing in the Service Economy'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not sure if this is the right reference --&gt; Earl Sasser (1995), William Davidow,&lt;ref&gt;Davidow, W. and Uttal, B. ''Total Customer Service'', Harper Perennial Books, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Len Schlesinger,&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, L. and Heskett, J. &quot;Customer Satisfaction is rooted in Employee Satisfaction,&quot; ''Harvard Business Review'', November&amp;ndash;December 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; A. Paraurgman (1988), Len Berry,&lt;ref&gt;Berry, L. ''On Great Service'', Free Press, New York, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Kingman-Brundage,&lt;ref&gt;Kingman-Brundage, J. “Service Mapping” pp 148&amp;ndash;163 In Scheuing, E. and Christopher, W. (eds.), ''The Service Quality Handbook'', Amacon, New York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Hart, and Christopher Lovelock (1994), gave us fishbone diagramming, service charting, Total Customer Service (TCS), the service profit chain, service gaps analysis, the service encounter, strategic service vision, service mapping, and service teams. Their underlying assumption was that there is no better source of competitive advantage than a continuous stream of delighted customers.

Process management uses some of the techniques from product quality management and some of the techniques from customer service management. It looks at an activity as a sequential process. The objective is to find inefficiencies and make the process more effective. Although the procedures have a long history, dating back to Taylorism, the scope of their applicability has been greatly widened, leaving no aspect of the firm free from potential process improvements. Because of the broad applicability of process management techniques, they can be used as a basis for competitive advantage.

Some realized that businesses were spending much more on acquiring new customers than on retaining current ones. Carl Sewell,&lt;ref&gt;Sewell, C. and Brown, P. ''Customers for Life'', Doubleday Currency, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick F. Reichheld,&lt;ref&gt;Reichheld, F. ''The Loyalty Effect'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; C. Gronroos,&lt;ref&gt;Gronroos, C. “From marketing mix to relationship marketing: towards a paradigm shift in marketing”, ''Management Decision'', Vol. 32, No. 2, pp 4&amp;ndash;32, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and Earl Sasser&lt;ref&gt;Reichheld, F. and Sasser, E.  “Zero defects: Quality comes to services”, ''Harvard Business Review'', Septemper/October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; showed us how a competitive advantage could be found in ensuring that customers returned again and again. This has come to be known as '''the loyalty effect''' after Reicheld's book of the same name in which he broadens the concept to include employee loyalty, supplier loyalty, distributor loyalty, and shareholder loyalty. They also developed techniques for estimating the lifetime value of a loyal customer, called customer lifetime value (CLV). A significant movement started that attempted to recast selling and marketing techniques into a long term endeavor that created a sustained relationship with customers (called relationship selling, relationship marketing, and customer relationship management). Customer relationship management (CRM) software (and its many variants) became an integral tool that sustained this trend.

James Gilmore and Joseph Pine found competitive advantage in mass customization.&lt;ref&gt;Pine, J. and Gilmore, J. “The Four Faces of Mass Customization”, ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol 75, No 1, Jan&amp;ndash;Feb 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Flexible manufacturing techniques allowed businesses to individualize products for each customer without losing economies of scale. This effectively turned the product into a service. They also realized that if a service is mass customized by creating a “performance” for each individual client, that service would be transformed into an “experience”. Their book, ''The Experience Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;Pine, J. and Gilmore, J. (1999) ''The Experience Economy'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the work of Bernd Schmitt convinced many to see service provision as a form of theatre. This school of thought is sometimes referred to as customer experience management (CEM).

Like Peters and Waterman a decade earlier, James Collins (management theorist)|James Collins and Jerry Porras spent years conducting empirical research on what makes great companies. Six years of research uncovered a key underlying principle behind the 19 successful companies that they studied: They all encourage and preserve a '''core ideology''' that nurtures the company. Even though strategy and tactics change daily, the companies, nevertheless, were able to maintain a core set of values. These core values encourage employees to build an organization that lasts. In ''Built To Last'' (1994) they claim that short term profit goals, cost cutting, and restructuring will not stimulate dedicated employees to build a great company that will endure.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, James and Porras, Jerry ''Built to Last'', Harper Books, New York, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Collins coined the term  “built to flip” to describe the prevailing business attitudes in Silicon Valley. It describes a business culture where technological change inhibits a long term focus. He also popularized the concept of the '''BHAG''' (Big Hairy Audacious Goal).

Arie de Geus (1997) undertook a similar study and obtained similar results. He identified four key traits of companies that had prospered for 50 years or more. They are:

* Sensitivity to the business environment &amp;mdash; the ability to learn and adjust
* Cohesion and identity &amp;mdash; the ability to build a community with personality, vision, and purpose
* Tolerance and decentralization &amp;mdash; the ability to build relationships
* Conservative financing
A company with these key characteristics he called a '''living company''' because it is able to perpetuate itself. If a company emphasizes knowledge rather than finance, and sees itself as an ongoing community of human beings, it has the potential to become great and endure for decades. Such an organization is an organic entity capable of learning (he called it a “learning organization”) and capable of creating its own processes, goals, and persona.

=== The military theorists ===

In the 1980s some business strategists realized that there was a vast knowledge base stretching back thousands of years that they had barely examined.  They turned to military strategy for guidance. Military strategy books such as ''The Art of War'' by Sun Tzu, ''On War'' by Carl von Clausewitz|von Clausewitz, and ''The Red Book'' by Mao Zedong became instant business classics. From Sun Tzu they learned the tactical side of military strategy and specific tactical prescriptions.  From Von Clausewitz they learned the dynamic and unpredictable nature of military strategy.  From Mao Zedong they learned the principles of guerrilla warfare.  The main marketing warfare strategies|marketing warfare books were:
* ''Business War Games'' by Barrie James, 1984
* ''Marketing Warfare'' by Al Ries and Jack Trout, 1986
*[http://www.attilascamp.com/ Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun] by Wess Roberts, 1987
Philip Kotler was a well-known proponent of marketing warfare strategy.

There were generally thought to be four types of business warfare theories.  They are:

* Offensive marketing warfare strategies
* Defensive marketing warfare strategies
* Flanking marketing warfare strategies
* Guerrilla marketing warfare strategies

The marketing warfare literature also examined leadership and motivation, intelligence gathering, types of marketing weapons, logistics, and communications.

By the turn of the century marketing warfare strategies had gone out of favour. It was felt that they were limiting.  There were many situations in which non-confrontational approaches were more appropriate.  The “Strategy of the Dolphin” was developed in the mid 1990s to give guidance as to when to use aggressive strategies and when to use passive strategies. A variety of Aggressiveness strategies (business)|aggressiveness strategies were developed.

In 1993, J. Moore used a similar metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J. “Predators and Prey”, ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol. 71, May&amp;ndash;June, pp 75&amp;ndash;86, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using military terms, he created an ecological theory of predators and prey (see ecological model of competition), a sort of Darwinian management strategy in which market interactions mimic long term ecological stability.

In 1970, Alvin Toffler in ''Future Shock'' described a trend towards accelerating rates of change.&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin ''Future Shock'', Bantom Books, New York, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated how social and technological norms had shorter lifespans with each generation, and he questioned society's ability to cope with the resulting turmoil and anxiety. In past generations periods of change were always punctuated with times of stability. This allowed society to assimilate the change and deal with it before the next change arrived. But these periods of stability are getting shorter and by the late 20th century had all but disappeared. In 1980 in ''The Third Wave'', Toffler characterized this shift to relentless change as the defining feature of the third phase of civilization (the first two phases being the agricultural and industrial waves).&lt;ref&gt;Toffler, Alvin ''The Third Wave'', Bantom Books, New York, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the dawn of this new phase will cause great anxiety for those that grew up in the previous phases, and will cause much conflict and opportunity in the business world. Hundreds of authors, particularly since the early 1990s, have attempted to explain what this means for business strategy.

In 1997, Watts Waker and Jim Taylor called this upheaval a &quot;500 year delta.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wacker, W. and Taylor, J. ''The 500 Year Delta'', Capstone Books, Oxford, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed these major upheavals occur every 5 centuries. They said we are currently making the transition from the “Age of Reason” to a new chaotic '''Age of Access'''. Jeremy Rifkin (2000) popularized and expanded this term, “age of access” three years later in his book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, J. ''The Age of Access'', Putnum Books, New York, 2000 ISBN 1-58542-018-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Peter Drucker (1969) coined the phrase '''Age of Discontinuity''' to describe the way change forces disruptions into the continuity of our lives.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter ''The Age of Discontinuity'', Heinemann, London, 1969 (also Harper and Row, New York, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; In an age of continuity attempts to predict the future by extrapolating from the past can be somewhat accurate. But according to Drucker, we are now in an age of discontinuity and extrapolating from the past is hopelessly ineffective.  We cannot assume that trends that exist today will continue into the future. He identifies four sources of discontinuity: new technologies, globalization, cultural pluralism, and knowledge capital.

In 2000, Gary Hamel discussed '''strategic decay''', the notion that the value of all strategies, no matter how brilliant, decays over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamel, Gary 2002&quot;&gt;Hamel, Gary ''Leading the Revolution'', Plume (Penguin Books), New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1978, Dereck Abell (Abell, D. 1978) described '''strategic windows''' and stressed the importance of the timing (both entrance and exit) of any given strategy.  This has led some strategic planners to build planned obsolescence (business)|planned obsolescence into their strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Abell, Derek “Strategic windows”, ''Journal of Marketing'', Vol 42, pg 21&amp;ndash;28, July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Charles Handy identified two types of change.&lt;ref&gt;Handy, Charles ''The Age of Unreason'', Hutchinson, London, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Strategic drift''' is a gradual change that occurs so subtly that it is not noticed until it is too late. By contrast, '''transformational change''' is sudden and radical. It is typically caused by discontinuities (or exogenous shocks) in the business environment. The point where a new trend is initiated is called a '''strategic inflection point''' by Andy Grove. Inflection points can be subtle or radical.

In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell discussed the importance of the '''tipping point''', that point where a trend or fad acquires critical mass and takes off.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm (2000) ''The Tipping Point'', Little Brown, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Noel Tichy recognized that because we are all beings of habit we tend to repeat what we are comfortable with.&lt;ref&gt;Tichy, Noel ''Managing Strategic Change: Technical, political, and cultural dynamics'', John Wiley, New York, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that this is a trap that constrains our creativity, prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full complexity of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and corporate culture.

In 1990, Richard Pascale (Pascale, R. 1990) wrote that relentless change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Pascale, Richard ''Managing on the Edge'', Simon and Schuster, New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” by which he means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse to let go of what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. In order to avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self renewal based on constructive conflict.

In 1996, Art Kleiner (1996) claimed that to foster a corporate culture that embraces change, you have to hire the right people; heretics, heroes, outlaws, and visionaries&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Art ''The Age of Heretics'', Doubleday, New York, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;. The conservative bureaucrat that made such a good middle manager in yesterday’s hierarchical organizations is of little use today. A decade earlier Peters and Austin (1985) had stressed the importance of nurturing champions and heroes. They said we have a tendency to dismiss new ideas, so to overcome this, we should support those few people in the organization that have the courage to put their career and reputation on the line for an unproven idea.

In 1996, Adrian Slywotsky showed how changes in the business environment are reflected in value migrations between industries, between companies, and within companies.&lt;ref&gt;Slywotzky, Adrian ''Value Migration'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that recognizing the patterns behind these value migrations is necessary if we wish to understand the world of chaotic change. In “Profit Patterns” (1999) he described businesses as being in a state of '''strategic anticipation''' as they try to spot emerging patterns. Slywotsky and his team identified 30 patterns that have transformed industry after industry.&lt;ref&gt;Slywotzky, A., Morrison, D., Moser, T., Mundt, K., and Quella, J. ''Profit Patterns'', Time Business (Random House), New York, 1999, ISBN 0-8129-31118-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Clayton Christensen (1997) took the position that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right since the capabilities of the organization also defines its disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton &quot;The Innovator's Dilemma&quot;, Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen's thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with '''disruptive technology'''. He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies '''agnostic marketing''', i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one - not the company, not the customers - can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used before they have experience using it.

A number of strategists use scenario planning techniques to deal with change. Kees van der Heijden (1996), for example, says that change and uncertainty make “optimum strategy” determination impossible. We have neither the time nor the information required for such a calculation. The best we can hope for is what he calls “the most skillful process”.&lt;ref&gt;van der Heyden, Kees ''Scenarios: The art of strategic conversation'', Wiley, New York, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The way Peter Schwartz put it in 1991 is that strategic outcomes cannot be known in advance so the sources of competitive advantage cannot be predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;Schartz, Peter ''The Art of the Long View'', Doubleday, New York, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The fast changing business environment is too uncertain for us to find sustainable value in formulas of excellence or competitive advantage. Instead, scenario planning is a technique in which multiple outcomes can be developed, their implications assessed, and their likeliness of occurrence evaluated. According to Pierre Wack, scenario planning is about insight, complexity, and subtlety, not about formal analysis and numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Wack, Pierre “Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead”, ''Harvard Business review'', September October, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Henry Mintzberg looked at the changing world around him and decided it was time to reexamine how strategic management was done.&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry “Crafting Strategy”, Harvard Business Review, July/August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry and Quinn, J.B. ''The Strategy Process'', Prentice-Hall, Harlow, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He examined the strategic process and concluded it was much more fluid and unpredictable than people had thought. Because of this, he could not point to one process that could be called strategic planning. Instead he concludes that there are five types of strategies. They are:

* Strategy as plan - a direction, guide, course of action - intention rather than actual
* Strategy as ploy - a maneuver intended to outwit a competitor
* Strategy as pattern - a consistent pattern of past behaviour - realized rather than intended
* Strategy as position - locating of brands, products, or companies within the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders - strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm
* Strategy as perspective - strategy determined primarily by a master strategist

In 1998, Mintzberg developed these five types of management strategy into 10 “schools of thought”. These 10 schools are grouped into three categories. The first group is prescriptive or normative. It consists of the informal design and conception school, the formal planning school, and the analytical positioning school. The second group, consisting of six schools, is more concerned with how strategic management is actually done, rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are the entrepreneurial, visionary, or great leader school, the cognitive or mental process school, the learning, adaptive, or emergent process school, the power or negotiation school, the corporate culture or collective process school, and the business environment or reactive school. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, an hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or “episodes”.&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, H. Ahlstrand, B. and Lampel, J. ''Strategy Safari : A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Strategic Management'', The Free Press, New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Constantinos Markides also wanted to reexamine the nature of strategic planning itself.&lt;ref&gt;Markides, Constantinos “A dynamic view of strategy” ''Sloan Management Review'', vol 40, spring 1999, pp55&amp;ndash;63.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes strategy formation and implementation as an on-going, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and reformation. Strategic management is planned and emergent, dynamic, and interactive.  J. Moncrieff (1999) also stresses strategy dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Moncrieff, J. “Is strategy making a difference?” ''Long Range Planning Review'', vol 32, no2, pp273&amp;ndash;276.&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned. The unplanned element comes from two sources: '''emergent strategies''' (result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment) and '''Strategies in action''' (ad hoc actions by many people from all parts of the organization).

Some business planners are starting to use a complexity theory approach to strategy. Complexity can be thought of as chaos with a dash of order. Chaos theory deals with turbulent systems that rapidly become disordered. Complexity is not quite so unpredictable. It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear. Axelrod, R.,&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, R. and Cohen, M. ''Harnessing Complexity : Organizational implications of a scientific frontier'' The Free Press, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Holland, J.,&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J. ''Hidden Order: How adaptation builds complexity'' Addison-Wesley, Reading Mass., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kelly, S. and Allison, M.A.,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, S. and Allison, M.A. ''The Complexity Advantage'', McGraw Hill, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; call these systems of multiple actions and reactions '''complex adaptive systems'''. Axelrod asserts that rather than fear complexity, business should harness it. He says this can best be done when “there are many participants, numerous interactions, much trial and error learning, and abundant attempts to imitate each others' successes”. In 2000, E. Dudik wrote that an organization must develop a mechanism for understanding the source and level of complexity it will face in the future and then transform itself into a complex adaptive system in order to deal with it.&lt;ref&gt;Dudik, E. ''Strategic Renaissance'', Amacon, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Drucker had theorized the rise of the “knowledge worker” back in the 1950s. He described how fewer workers would be doing physical labor, and more would be applying their minds. In 1984, John Nesbitt theorized that the future would be driven largely by information: companies that managed information well could obtain an advantage, however the profitability of what he calls the “information float” (information that the company had and others desired) would all but disappear as inexpensive computers made information more accessible.

Daniel Bell (1985) examined the sociological consequences of information technology, while Gloria Schuck and Shoshana Zuboff looked at psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, Gloria “Intelligent Workers: A new predagogy for the high tech workplace”, ''Organizational Dynamics'', Autumn 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Zuboff, in her five year study of eight pioneering corporations made the important distinction between “automating technologies” and “infomating technologies”. She studied the effect that both had on individual workers, managers, and organizational structures. She largely confirmed Peter Drucker's predictions three decades earlier, about the importance of flexible decentralized structure, work teams, knowledge sharing, and the central role of the knowledge worker. Zuboff also detected a new basis for managerial authority, based not on position or hierarchy, but on knowledge (also predicted by Drucker) which she called “participative management”.&lt;ref&gt;Zuboff, Shoshana ''In the Age of the Smart Machine'', Basic Books, New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Peter Senge, who had collaborated with Arie de Geus at Dutch Shell, borrowed de Geus' notion of the '''learning organization''', expanded it, and popularized it. The underlying theory is that a company's ability to gather, analyze, and use information is a necessary requirement for business success in the information age. (See organizational learning.) In order to do this, Senge claimed that an organization would need to be structured such that:&lt;ref&gt;Senge, Peter''The Fifth Discipline'', Doubleday, New York, 1990; (also Century, London, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
* People can continuously expand their capacity to learn and be productive,
* New patterns of thinking are nurtured,
* Collective aspirations are encouraged, and
* People are encouraged to see the “whole picture” together.
Senge identified five components of a learning organization. They are:
* Personal responsibility, self reliance, and mastery &amp;mdash; We accept that we are the masters of our own destiny. We make decisions and live with the consequences of them. When a problem needs to be fixed, or an opportunity exploited, we take the initiative to learn the required skills to get it done.
* Mental models &amp;mdash; We need to explore our personal mental models to understand the subtle effect they have on our behaviour.
* Shared vision &amp;mdash; The vision of where we want to be in the future is discussed and communicated to all. It provides guidance and energy for the journey ahead.
* Team learning &amp;mdash; We learn together in teams. This involves a shift from “a spirit of advocacy to a spirit of enquiry”.
* Systems thinking &amp;mdash; We look at the whole rather than the parts. This is what Senge calls the “Fifth discipline”. It is the glue that integrates the other four into a coherent strategy. For an alternative approach to the “learning organization”, see Garratt, B. (1987).

Since 1990 many theorists have written on the strategic importance of information, including J.B. Quinn,&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, J.B. ''Intelligent Enterprise'', The Free Press, New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; J. Carlos Jarillo,&lt;ref&gt;Jarillo, J. Carlos ''Strategic Networks: Creating borderless organizations'', Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; D.L. Barton,&lt;ref&gt;Barton, D.L. ''Wellsprings of Knowledge'', Harvard Business school Press, Boston, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Castells,&lt;ref&gt;Castells, Manuel ''The Rise of the Networked Society :The information age'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge Mass, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; J.P. Lieleskin,&lt;ref&gt;Liebeskind, J. P. “Knowledge, Strategy, and the Theory of the Firm”, ''Strategic Management Journal'', vol 17, winter 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Stewart,&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Thomas ''Intellectual Capital'', Nicholas Brealey, London, 1997, (also DoubleDay, New York, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; K.E. Sveiby,&lt;ref&gt;Sveiby, K.E. ''The New Organizational Wealth : Managing and measuring knowledge-based assets'', Berrett-Koehler Publishers, San Francisco, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert J. Probst,&lt;ref&gt;Probst, Gilbert, Raub, S. and Romhardt K. ''Managing Knowledge'', Wiley, London, 1999 (Exists also in other languages)&lt;/ref&gt; and Shapiro and Varian&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, C. and Varian, H. (1999) ''Information Rules'', Harard Business School Press, Boston, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; to name just a few.

Thomas A. Stewart, for example, uses the term '''intellectual capital''' to describe the investment an organization makes in knowledge. It is comprised of human capital (the knowledge inside the heads of employees), customer capital (the knowledge inside the heads of customers that decide to buy from you), and structural capital (the knowledge that resides in the company itself).

Manuel Castells, describes a '''network society''' characterized by: globalization, organizations structured as a network, instability of employment, and a social divide between those with access to information technology and those without.

Stan Davis and Christopher Meyer (1998) have combined three variables to define what they call the '''BLUR equation'''. The speed of change, Internet connectivity, and intangible knowledge value, when multiplied together yields a society's rate of BLUR. The three variables interact and reinforce each other making this relationship highly non-linear.

Regis McKenna posits that life in the high tech information age is what he called a “real time experience”. Events occur in real time. To ever more demanding customers “now” is what matters. Pricing will more and more become variable pricing changing with each transaction, often exhibiting price discrimination|first degree price discrimination. Customers expect immediate service, customized to their needs, and will be prepared to pay a premium price for it. He claimed that the new basis for competition will be '''time based competition'''.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, Regis ''Real time: Preparing for the age of the Never Satisfied Customer'', Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Moore (1991) and R. Frank and P. Cook&lt;ref&gt;Frank, R. and Cook, P. ''The Winner Take All Society'', Free Press, New York, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; also detected a shift in the nature of competition. In industries with high technology content, technical standards become established and this gives the dominant firm a near monopoly. The same is true of networked industries in which interoperability requires compatibility between users. An example is word processor documents. Once a product has gained market dominance, other products, even far superior products, cannot compete. Moore showed how firms could attain this enviable position by using E.M. Rogers five stage diffusion (business)|adoption process and focusing on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries and pragmatists (See Crossing the Chasm). If successful a firm can create a bandwagon effect in which the momentum builds and your product becomes a de facto standard.

Evans and Wurster describe how industries with a high information component are being transformed.&lt;ref&gt;Evens, P. and Wurster, T. “Strategy and the New Economics of Information”, ''Harvard Business Review'', Sept/Oct 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite Encarta's demolition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (whose sales have plummeted 80% since their peak of $650 million in 1990). Many speculate that Encarta’s reign will be short-lived, eclipsed by collaborative encyclopedias like Wikipedia that can operate at very low marginal costs. Evans also mentions the music industry which is desperately looking for a new business model. The upstart information savvy firms, unburdened by cumbersome physical assets, are changing the competitive landscape, redefining market segments, and disintermediation|disintermediating some channels. One manifestation of this is personalized marketing. Information technology allows marketers to treat each individual as its own market, a market of one. Traditional ideas of market segments will no longer be relevant if personalized marketing is successful.

The technology sector has provided some strategies directly. For example, from the software development industry agile software development provides a model for shared development processes.

Access to information systems have allowed senior managers to take a much more comprehensive view of strategic management than ever before. The most notable of the comprehensive systems is the balanced scorecard approach developed in the early 1990s by Drs. Robert S. Kaplan (Harvard Business School) and David Norton (Kaplan, R. and Norton, D. 1992). It measures several factors financial, marketing, manufacturing|production, organizational development, and new product development in order to achieve a 'balanced' perspective.

Several psychologists have conducted studies to determine the psychological patterns involved in strategic management.  Typically senior managers have been asked how they go about making strategic decisions.  A 1938 treatise by Chester Barnard, that was based on his own experience as a business executive, sees the process as informal, intuitive, non-routinized, and involving primarily oral, 2-way communications. Bernard says “The process is the sensing of the organization as a whole and the total situation relevant to it.  It transcends the capacity of merely intellectual methods, and the techniques of discriminating the factors of the situation. The terms pertinent to it are “feeling”, “judgement”, “sense”, “proportion”, “balance”, “appropriateness”. It is a matter of art rather than science.”&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Chester ''The function of the executive'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge Mass, 1938, page 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Henry Mintzberg found that senior managers typically deal with unpredictable situations so they strategize in ''ad hoc'', flexible, dynamic, and implicit ways. He says, “The job breeds adaptive information-manipulators who prefer the live concrete situation. The manager works in an environment of stimulous-response, and he develops in his work a clear preference for live action.”&lt;ref&gt;Mintzberg, Henry ''The Nature of Managerial Work'', Harper and Roe, New York, 1973, page 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, John Kotter studied the daily activities of 15 executives and concluded that they spent most of their time developing and working a network of relationships from which they gained general insights and specific details to be used in making strategic decisions. They tended to use “mental road maps” rather than systematic planning techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, John ''The general manager'', Free Press, New York, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Isenberg's 1984 study of senior managers found that their decisions were highly intuitive. Executives often sensed what they were going to do before they could explain why.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Daniel “How managers think”, ''Harvard Business Review'', November&amp;ndash;December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed in 1986 that one of the reasons for this is the complexity of strategic decisions and the resultant information uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Daniel ''Strategic Opportunism: Managing under uncertainty'', Harvard Graduate School of Business, Working paper 9-786-020, Boston, January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoshana Zuboff (1988) claims that information technology is widening the divide between senior managers (who typically make strategic decisions) and operational level managers (who typically make routine decisions). She claims that prior to the widespread use of computer systems, managers, even at the most senior level, engaged in both strategic decisions and routine administration, but as computers facilitated (She called it “deskilled”) routine processes, these activities were moved further down the hierarchy, leaving senior management free for strategic decision making.

In 1977, Abraham Zaleznik identified a difference between leaders and managers. He describes leaders as visionaries who inspire. They care about substance. Whereas managers are claimed to care about process, plans, and form.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleznik, Abraham “Managers and Leaders: Are they different?”, ''Harvard Business Review'', May&amp;ndash;June, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed in 1989 that the rise of the manager was the main factor that caused the decline of American business in the 1970s and 80s. Lack of leadership is most damaging at the level of strategic management where it can paralyze an entire organization.&lt;ref&gt;Zaleznik, Abraham ''The Managerial Mistique'', Harper and Row, New York, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats,&lt;ref&gt;Corner, P. Kinicki, A. and Keats, B. “Integrating organizational and individual information processing perspectives on choice”, ''Organizational Science'', vol. 3, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; strategic decision making in organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They have developed a model of parallel strategic decision making. The model identifies two parallel processes both of which involve getting attention, encoding information, storage and retrieval of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome, and feedback. The individual and organizational processes are not independent however. They interact at each stage of the process.

Although a sense of direction is important, it can also stifle creativity, especially if it is rigidly enforced. In an uncertain and ambiguous world, fluidity can be more important than a finely tuned strategic compass. When a strategy becomes internalized into a corporate culture, it can lead to group think. It can also cause an organization to define itself too narrowly. An example of this is marketing myopia.

Many theories of strategic management tend to undergo only brief periods of popularity.  A summary of these theories thus inevitably exhibits survivorship systemic bias|bias (itself an area of research in strategic management). Many theories tend either to be too narrow in focus to build a complete corporate strategy on, or too general and abstract to be applicable to specific situations. Populism or faddishness can have an impact on a particular theory's life cycle and may see application in inappropriate circumstances. See business philosophies and popular management theories for a more critical view of management theories.

In 2000, Gary Hamel coined the term '''strategic convergence''' to explain the limited scope of the strategies being used by rivals in greatly differing circumstances. He lamented that strategies converge more than they should, because the more successful ones get imitated by firms that do not understand that the strategic process involves designing a custom strategy for the specifics of each situation.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, Gary 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram Charan, aligning with a popular marketing tagline, believes that strategic planning must not dominate action.  &quot;Just do it!&quot;, while not quite what he meant, is a phrase that nevertheless comes to mind when combatting analysis paralysis.

===The Linearity Trap===

It is tempting to think that the elements of strategic management – (i) reaching consensus on corporate objectives; (ii) developing a plan for achieving the objectives; and (iii) marshalling and allocating the resources required to implement the plan – can be approached sequentially.  It would be convenient, in other words, if one could deal first with the noble question of ends, and then address the mundane question of means.

But in the world in which strategies have to be implemented, the three elements are interdependent.  Means are as likely to determine ends as ends are to determine means.&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, Charles E., &quot;The Science of Muddling Through,&quot; ''Public Administration Review'', Vol. 19 (1959), No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;   The objectives that an organization might wish to pursue are limited by the range of feasible approaches to implementation.  (There will usually be only a small number of approaches that will not only be technically and administratively possible, but also satisfactory to the full range of organizational stakeholders.)  In turn, the range of feasible implementation approaches is determined by the availability of resources.

And so, although participants in a typical “strategy session” may be asked to do “blue sky” thinking where they pretend that the usual constraints – resources, acceptability to stakeholders , administrative feasibility – have been lifted, the fact is that it rarely makes sense to divorce oneself from the environment in which a strategy will have to be implemented.  It’s probably impossible to think in any meaningful way about strategy in an unconstrained environment.  Our brains can’t process “boundless possibilities”, and the very idea of strategy only has meaning in the context of challenges or obstacles to be overcome.  It’s at least as plausible to argue that acute awareness of constraints is the very thing that stimulates creativity by forcing us to constantly reassess both means and ends in light of circumstances.

The key question, then, is, &quot;How can individuals, organizations and societies cope as well as possible with ... issues too complex to be fully understood, given the fact that actions initiated on the basis of inadequate understanding may lead to significant regret?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward J. and David Collingridge, &quot;Incrementalism, Intelligent Trial-and-Error, and the Future of Political Decision Theory,&quot; in Redner, Harry, ed., ''An Heretical Heir of the Enlightenment:  Politics, Policy and Science in the Work of Charles E. Limdblom'', Boulder, C): Westview Press, 1993, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; 

The answer is that the process of developing organizational strategy must be iterative.  It involves toggling back and forth between questions about objectives, implementation planning and resources.  An initial idea about corporate objectives may have to be altered if there is no feasible implementation plan that will meet with a sufficient level of acceptance among the full range of stakeholders, or because the necessary resources are not available, or both.

Even the most talented manager would no doubt agree that &quot;comprehensive analysis is impossible&quot; for complex problems&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;.   Formulation and implementation of strategy must thus occur side-by-side rather than sequentially, because strategies are built on assumptions which, in the absence of perfect knowledge, will never be perfectly correct.  Strategic management is necessarily a &quot;repetitive learning cycle [rather than] a linear progression towards a clearly defined final destination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Elcock, Howard, &quot;Strategic Management,&quot; in Farnham, D. and S. Horton (eds.), ''Managing the New Public Services'', 2nd Edition, New York: Macmillan, 1996, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;   While assumptions can and should be tested in advance, the ultimate test is implementation.  You will inevitably need to adjust corporate objectives and/or your approach to pursuing outcomes and/or assumptions about required resources.  Thus a strategy will get remade during implementation because &quot;humans rarely can proceed satisfactorily except by learning from experience; and modest probes, serially modified on the basis of feedback, usually are the best method for such learning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse and Collingridge, 1993. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  

It serves little purpose (other than to provide a false aura of certainty sometimes demanded by corporate strategists and planners) to pretend to anticipate every possible consequence of a corporate decision, every possible constraining or enabling factor, and every possible point of view.  At the end of the day, what matters for the purposes of strategic management is having a clear view – based on the best available evidence and on defensible assumptions – of what it seems possible to accomplish within the constraints of a given set of circumstances.  As the situation changes, some opportunities for pursuing objectives will disappear and others arise.  Some implementation approaches will become impossible, while others, previously impossible or unimagined, will become viable.

The essence of being “strategic” thus lies in a capacity for &quot;intelligent trial-and error&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid., passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; rather than linear adherence to finally honed and detailed strategic plans.  Strategic management will add little value -- indeed, it may well do harm -- if organizational strategies are designed to be used as a detailed blueprints for managers.  Strategy should be seen, rather, as laying out the general path - but not the precise steps - by which an organization intends to create value.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Mark H., ''Creating Public Value: Strategic Management in Government'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;Strategic management is a question of interpreting, and continuously reinterpreting, the possibilities presented by shifting circumstances for advancing an organization's objectives.  Doing so requires strategists to think ''simultaneously'' about desired objectives, the best approach for achieving them, and the resources implied by the chosen approach.  It requires a frame of mind that admits of no boundary between means and ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Compressed Air: Technology Primer ==
*The goal of this section is to familiarize you with the equipment and terms you will usually encounter in compressed air systems. The section is divided into three sub-sections:

[[/Compressed Air Equipment/]]
*How to identify key components of industrial compressed air systems and associated equipment.

[[/Compressor Performance Relationships/]]
*This section provides performance relationships for the different types of system controls. Performance profiles are included which graphically show the relationship between airflow and power.

*Definitions:
**ACFM: Actual airflow delivered after compressor losses
**ACFM-FAD: Airflow before filter (Free Air Delivery)
**CFM: Cubic Feet per Minute of airflow
**ICFM: Airflow at inlet flange
**Modulation Control: Method of reducing airflow to match part load requirements, includes throttle, turn, spiral, or poppet valve.    
**Psi: Pressure in pounds per square inch
**Psig: Psi gauge, referenced to atmospheric pressure
**Psia: Psi absolute, which is 14.7 psi at sea level
**SCFM: Equivalent airflow at Standard Conditions (2 different standards, CAGI and ASME, use this same term)

[[/Standard Conditions/]]
*CAGI (Compressed Air &amp; Gas Institute0: 14.7 psiz, 60 F, 0% rh (relative hunidity)
*ASME: 14.7 psia, 68 F, 36% rh
*Unloading and Unload Point: Pressure at which compressor unloads

[[/Compressed Air Equipment/]]
*To evaluate equipment air systems it is important to be able to identify the type of equipment in use, and understand generally how that equipment works. The following section presents common equipment you are likely to encounter in a compressed air system along with important details. 

[[/Compressors/]]
*Reciprocating and Screw compressor are the most common types of air compressors. Other types of compressors are described in the appendix. Air compressors usually require ancillary equipment to dry the air, remove oil and to buffer pressure fluctuations.

[[/Reciprocating compressors/]]
*Reciprocating compressors, use pistons to compress air in cylinders. Their operation is similar to automotive engines. Small reciprocating compressors use a single action compression stroke, while larger ones use double acting pistons. Double acting pistons compress air on both the up and the down stroke. Reciprocating compressors offer good efficiencies over a wide range of operating conditions and are quite efficient for low-pressure applications. However, reciprocating compressors require more maintenance than screw compressors. In the northwest reciprocating compressors are less common than screw compressors. A more complete description of a reciprocating compressor is given in the appendix.

[[/Screw Compressors/]]
*Screw compressors are the most prevalent types of compressor in the northwest. Screw compressors use two mated screws. These turn, forcing air between them. As air progresses through the screws the volume of the gap between the screws decreases thereby compressing the air.

[[/Air Dryer/]]
*Air dryers are included in most compressed air systems. Many industrial applications require air with low moisture content. For examples, pneumatic controls typically require dry air. In colder climates moisture-laden air can lead to ice which blocks or breaks the lines. High moisture content can also lead to corrosion in any compressed air system. Drying requirements and the volume of the air dictate the type and size of air dryer required. Typical air dryers either use refrigeration or desiccant remove moisture from the air. 
**'''Aftercoolers''' provide initial cooling of hot compressed air from over 150 degrees F. Water cooling can be more effective by using cooling tower water near the wet bulb temperature. Air from the compressor room is often warmer than outside air. Aftercoolers condense some water vapor in the compressed air, but usually not adequately for air tools or pneumatic controls. Consider uses for the waste heat. Avoid city water cooling flowing down the drain. 
**'''Refrigerated Air Dryers''' are able to drop the dew point (the temperature at which the air becomes completely saturated and moisture in the air beings to liquefy) of compressed air to 35-50 degrees F. Often these are all that is required and are typically the most economical means of drying air. Refrigerated air dryers work by cooling the compressed air with a refrigeration system. Moisture condenses out of the cooled air and is captured at the dryer. Operating costs are roughly $5.00 to $8.00 per million cubic feet of air. This associated with 130 kWh per million cubic feet of air.
**'''Desiccant Air Dryers''' can reach a lower dew point than refrigerated dryers; down to -150 degrees F. Desiccant air dryers consist of two desiccant bends through which the compressed air flows. A control system of two desiccant beds through which the compressed air flows. A control system channels all of the air through one bed while the other is regenerated. The regeneration process varies among desiccant dryers and has a large impact on operating costs. All systems blow dry compressed air across the desiccant bed to regenerate it and then purge the air and moisture to the atmosphere. Some models heat the dried air first to increase its capacity to absorb moisture. Heat types have better efficiencies because the energy required to heat the air to 300 degrees F is less than the energy required to compress and dry the additional air that would otherwise be necessary to dry the bed. Heated air dryers require only about 1-7% of the total compressed air to purge the desiccant bed, while non-heated dryers require 15% or more. Desiccant dryers are more expensive to purchase, maintain and operate than refrigerated air dryers, but to achieve lower dew points. These are often the only option. Operating costs range from $15 to $30 million cubic feet of compressed air. This is associated with 300 to 500kWh per million cubic feet of air. This cost of the compressed air used to regenerate the dryer. The extra compressed air required can be huge cost. 
**'''Membrane Dryers''' are relatively new to the marketplace. They use a semi-permeable membrane that allows dry air to pass through holding back the water vapor. These dryers are easy to maintain the achieve dew points as low as 35 degrees F, however, they cause a 9-10% drop in system capacity as much compressed air is lost along with the water vapor in the membrane system. The operating costs for this type of air-drying are minimal, as the membranes need to be replaced infrequently.

[[/Receiver Tank/]]
*Compressors with unloading or on-off controls require a receiver tank to store a volume of compressed air to later use. Receiver tanks should be large enough to limit the amount of compressor cycling to minimum. A common rule-of-thumb is a gallon of receiver space per SCFM of output, however, like in Texas, bigger is better since it lengthens the compressor on-off cycles.

[[/Oil Separator/]]
*In screw compressors the two screws that mesh to compress air would wear quickly without oil. The oiling procedure employed by many screw compressors introduces oil into the compressed air. Oil separators remove this oil after the compression process. An oil separator is essential a coalescing filter mated with a metal baffle. A coalescing filter traps microscopic oil particles in its consumable elements. As air moves through the filter the entrained oil coalesces and drops out. Any oil remaining in the air would shorten tool life so it pays to keep the separator working. A poorly maintained oil separator often indtroduces an excessive pressure drop into the compressed air system. The pressure drop should not be more than 5 psi across the separator. When the pressure drops is greater than 5 psi maintenance is required. 

[[/Air Reheater/]]
*Some air compressors are equipped with an air reheater to heat the air after it is dried. The heated air exapnds, increasing the pressure and reducing the work the compressor had to do to achieve a given pressure. The degree of the heating and effectiveness of the system varies from one situation to another. A reheater does not help if heat is lost in the distribution system, which is why the strategy is not used or recommended often. 

[[/Compressor Performance Relationships/]]
*Following is an introduction to the relationship between power and airflow. This relationship is central to all the calculations used in analyzing potential savings. 
**'''Power''' (%P) refers to compressor power expressed as a percentage of full load power (FLP). For example, if a compressor's full load power is 100 kW and at a particular load the compressor uses 74 kW then its percent power for that load is 74% (74/100).
**'''Airflow''' (%C) refers to air delivered by the compressor expressed as a percent of capacity. For example if a compressor's capacity is 200 acfm and at a particular lad it delivers 120 acfm its percent capacity is 60% (120/200)&gt;    
*Power and airflow can be compared to create a compressor performance curve. The relationship between power and airflow depends on the strategy used for matching compressor output with the load. The following section presents power and airflow relationships for different control strategies. 
*'''Information on each tyep of control includes:'''
**A brief explanation of the control strategy.
**Equations relating power (%P) and airflow (%C).
**Advantages and disadvantages
**Compressor performance charts showing the relationship between power and airflow.

'''1)Throttle Control'''
*Compressor Type: Screw
*'''Operation'''
**Throttle control works by using a slide or butterfly valve to create a partial vacuum at the compressor inlet. The partial vacuum limits the air mass that enters the compression chamber, lowering the amount of air that is compressed.
*'''Power and airflow relationships:
**Power: %P = (Full load %P - No load %P) x Load %C + NO Load %P
**Airflow: %C = (Load %P - No load %P)/(Full Load %P - No load %P)
*'''Advantages:'''
**Constant Discharge Pressure
**Good high load efficiency
*'''Disadvantages:'''
**Poor Low Load Efficiency
*'''Typical No Load Power Consumption:''' 60-72% of Full Load Power

'''2) Turn Valve or Poppet Valve Control'''
*Compressor Type: Screw
*'''Operation:'''
**Turn valve controls vary the amount of air that is compressed by varying the effective length of the compression chamber. A threaded shaft rotates to open ports in the compressor housing. Air compression cannot begin in rotor sectors with open ports. This changes the chamber length experienced by the air and changes the volumetric compression ratio. Poppet valves work similarly to turn the valves. Instead of a rotating valve, a series of valves, similar to automotive engine valves, at discrete positions along the length of the screws allow the air to exit without further compression. In both cases, the valves are operated to match compressor output with plant air demand.
*'''Power and Airflow Relationships'''
**Power: %P = (Full Load %P - No Load %P) x Load %C^2 + No Load %P
**Airflow: %C = ((Load %P -No load %P)/(Full load %p - No Load %p))1/2
*'''Advantages:'''
**Good High Load Efficiency
**Low Receiver Capacity Requirement
**Constant Discharge Pressure
*'''Disadvantages:'''
**Power Low Load Efficiency
*'''Power Consumption:''' 55-60% of Full Load Power

'''3) On-Off Control'''
*Compressor type: Screw, Reciprocating
*'''Operation:'''
**On-Off controls turn the compressor on and off as needed. The compressor works at full lad until it reaches maximum pressure, then turns off. Starting and stopping larger compressors can be hard on both the compressor and the motor, and therefore is more common on smaller compressors. On-Off controls can also be coupled with other modulation strategies to reduce or eliminate energy use at low or no air demand. 
*'''Power and Airflow relationships:'''
**Power = Airflow
*'''Advantages:'''
**Maximum Efficiency at all loads
*'''Disadvantages:'''
**High receiver capacity requirement
*'''Typical No Load Power Consumption:''' 0% of Full Load Power

'''4) Unloading Controls'''
*A compressor will typically be modulated by one of the above controls, however, unloading controls may be added to a compressor to increase part load efficiencies. Unloading controls allow the compressor to spend unloaded time at reduced power. There are two types of unloading strategies, Load-Unload and Low-Unload

*'''A. Load-Unload Control'''
**Compressor Type: Screw, Reciprocating
**'''Operation:'''
***Load-Unload controls operate in a manner similar to On-Off controls. Instead of turning off the compressor unloads. When the compressor reaches maximum pressure a solenoid valve opens, reducing the discharge to atmospheric or at least lower pressure. The compressor then with lower pressure difference from the intake to the discharge side. A check valve prevents back-flow of air at system pressure. The compressor uses less energy while unloaded. 
**'''Power and Airflow relationships:'''
***Power: %P = (Full Load %P -No Load %P) x Load %C + No Load %P
***Airflow: %C = ((Load %P - No Load %P)/(Full Load %P - No Load %P))
**'''Advantages:'''
**Good Efficiency at all Loads
**'''Disadvantages:'''
***High receiver capacity requirement
***Small air loss during unloading
**'''Typical No Load Power Consumption:'''20% of Full Load Power

*'''B. Low - Unload Control'''
**Compressor Type: Screw
**'''Operation:'''
***Low-Unload controls are a combination of load-unload and modulation controls. They modulate the compressor at higher loads and unload the compressor at lower loads. Low-Unload controls have a set unload point about which the compressor modulates and below the compressor unloads.
**'''Power and Airflow relationships:'''
***a) Above the Unload Point
****The modulating power and airflow formulas depend on the type of control the compressor employs. (see earlier descriptions)
***b) Below the Unload Point
****Power: %P = (Unloading %P - No Load %P) x Load %C + No load %P
****Airflow: %C = ((Load %P - No Load %P)/(Full Load %P - No Load %P))
**'''Advantages:'''
***Good High Load Efficiency
***Requires less receiver capacity &amp; pressure range for reasonable operation
**'''Disadvantages:'''
***Not as efficient as load unload
***Small air loss during unloading
**'''Typically No Load Power Consumption:''' 20% of Full Load Power

Though business plans have many different presentation formats, business plans typically cover five major content areas:

#Background information
#A marketing plan
#An operational plan
#A financial plan
# A discussion of the decision-making criteria that should be used to approve the plan.

Some of these content areas may be more or less important depending on the kind of business plan.  There is no fixed content for a business plan. Rather the content and format of the business plan is determined by the goals and audience. A business plan should contain whatever information is needed to decide whether or not to pursue a goal.

Once a business plan has been developed, the key decision making points are usually summarized in an #Executive Summary|executive summary.

== Executive Summary ==
The executive summary summarizes the key points of the business plan.  It should define the decision to be made and the reasons for approval. The specific content will be highly dependent on the core purpose and target audience. To get a sense of the difference the purpose and target audience can make, here are three different sets of key points for an executive summary - one for a loan request, one for a start-up seeking venture finance, and one for an internal plan.  Items unique to a particular kind of plan are highlighted in bold:

A loan request executive summary might contain the following information {{Fact|date=March 2007}}:
* Company information: name of company, '''years in business''', legal structure, minority and majority owners
* Brief description of project
* '''Amount and length of loan'''
* Objective reasons why the bank should be confident that the loan will be paid back.  This likely will include
** Financial track record
** The future revenue stream
** Any contracts in place that might guarantee the revenue stream is more than just a forecast.

For a new venture, the executive summary might contain:
* Company information: name of company, '''proposed legal structure''', current legal structure, minority and majority investors.
* '''Amount of investment requested'''
* '''Expected terminal value'''
* '''Description of market opportunity'''
* '''Objective reasons why the market opportunity can be exploited by this particular team'''

For an internal project plan, the executive summary might look like this{{Fact|date=March 2007}}:
* Company information:  '''not applicable'''
* Description of project
* '''Project mandate: who requested the proposal, who is being assigned to carry it out'''
* '''Strategic''', '''tactical''' and financial justifications
* Summary of resources needed: '''staff''', funds, '''facilities'''

In some cases information will overlap. For example, some of the reasons why a loan is likely to be repaid might equally as well be used as justification for the kind of extraordinary return expected by venture capitalists.

In some cases the business plan as a whole contains similar information, but for one type of plan it is mere detail and for another it is a key decision making factor.  For instance, both start-ups and internal projects need staff and facilities. However the staffing and facilities needs are considered details in a plan for start-up financing.  In a plan for internal projects they are key elements and, in fact, may be the only resources needed.

== Organizational Background ==
In a written plan information may appear in a separate section, an appendix, or may be  omitted all together depending on the nature of the plan.  If the plan is directed at people outside of the company, a brief synopsis may appear in the executive summary.  This will be supplemented with a more detailed discussion elsewhere in the plan.

=== Mission Statement and business model===
To create a quality, online learning experience for students through an interactive learning environment. 
- As an example.

For a commercial organization, the business model sums up also how the business or project will satisfy customers and bring profitability

=== Current Status ===
* Number of Employees
* Annual sales figures
* Key product lines
* Location of facilities
* Current stage of development (start-ups)
* Corporate structure (options are): 
** Sole proprietors
** Partnership
** Joint Venture
** Publicly traded corporation
** Corporation|Private corporation
** Limited liability company
** Public utility
** Non-profit organization
* Names of the majority investor, if any

=== History ===
* Founding date
* Major successes
* Strategically valuable learning experiences

=== Management Team ===
* Board members
* Owners
* Senior managers
* Managing partners
* Head scientists and researchers

== Marketing Plan ==
The marketing plan has five objectives: If the product is a new product with no existing market, one must identify all substitute products. For each significant substitute product one must explain:
* Name, features, why substitute, why proposed product better
* Switching costs and why new product justifies switching
* Expected adoption dynamics
* Expected role once market begins to develop (see above for existing products)

=== Pricing ===
* Chosen price points
* Proposed Pricing|Pricing strategy

=== Demand Management ===
In economics, Demand management|demand management is the art or science of controlling economic demand to avoid a recession. The term is also used to refer to management of the distribution of, and access to goods and services on the basis of needs. An example is social security and welfare services. Rather than increasing budgets for these things, governments may develop policies that allocate existing resources according a hierarchy of need.

=== Distribution ===
* Distribution (business)|Distribution strategy 
* List of major distributors
* Current status of negotiations

=== Promotion and Brand Development ===
* Promotion (marketing)|Promotion strategy

== Operational Plan ==
The plan outlines how we will service our clients cost effectively

=== Research and Development Plan ===

=== Manufacturing/Deployment Plan ===
* Supply chain requirements
* Production inputs
* Facility requirements - size, layout, capacity, location
* Equipment requirements
* Warehousing needs for raw materials, finished goods
** Space requirements

=== Information and Communications Technology Plan ===
* Systems needed
** Operations: Billing, HR, SCM, CRM, Knowledge bases, etc.
** Websites: internal, public
* Security and privacy requirements
* Hardware requirements
* Off-the-shelf software needed
* Custom development requirements

=== Staffing Plan ===
==== Staffing Needs ====
* List of roles
* Management structure
* For each role

==== Hiring Time Table ====

==== Staffing Budget ====
=== Business Process Outsourcing Plan ===
=== Asset Development Plan ===
==== Intellectual Property Plan ====
* Intellectual property inventory
* Portfolio development plan

==== Acquisition Plan ====
Some business plans gain competitive advantage by buying companies up and down the value chain.  Some gain competitive advantage by buying up companies and consolidating them.  Sometimes a business plan will seek to earn a superior return by adding superior management talent to an existing weak company.

For more information see Mergers and Acquisitions.

When acquisitions form a major part of the business strategy, the acquisition plan needs to be included in the business plan.

* Acquisition strategy
* Proposed acquisition targets
* Effect on market structure (if consolidation plan is being proposed)
 
Also, some acquisition plan will explain the basis of appointing the Liquidator of the acquisition procedures

==== Organizational Learning Plan ====
The organizational learning plan discusses what lessons will be learned from the marketing, operational, and finance plans and how those lessons will be consolidated to gain strategic advantage.

* Market sensing - organization's method for collecting information about customers (George Day)
* Strategic Staircase - the accumulation of future competencies by building on existing competencies. (Michael Hays, Costas Markides)

=== Cost Allocation Model ===
If variable costs play an important role in the business plan, it may be helpful to include a cost allocation model.  This is particularly true if one has a unique business model that creates competitive advantage by transforming traditionally fixed costs into variable costs{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.
     
* Fixed cost
* Variable costs

== Financial Plan ==
For more information, see Financial plan.

=== Current Financing ===
* Key investors or owners
* Angels, friends, and family
* Existing loans and liabilities
** Terms, obligations

=== Funding Needs ===
=== Funding Plan ===
* IMF
* World Bank

=== Financial History ===
=== Financial Forecasts ===
* Sometimes called pro formas
** Balance sheet
** Income statement
** Cash flow statement
* 1-3-5-7 year projections (depends on length of project)
** For loans, repayment period determines length of projections, i.e. a six month loan doesn't need seven year forecasts
** For investments point at which returns stabilize (terminal value) determines length of forecast
* Annual, quarterly, and monthly versions should be provided
* Graphs of key values often helpful: gross revenue, EBITDA, NPV, etc.
* Financial portions of the marketing, asset development, and operations are often placed in this section rather than in the section discussing the plan.  They are viewed as elaboration on the various line items in the pro-formas.



=== Valuation ===

== Risk analysis ==
For more information, see risk analysis.

=== Risk Evaluation ===
* Market risks - lack of surgeons; large geographical area so that we don't compete against our own clients; 
** New entrants to market
*** Ease of entry
*** Potential threat to market share- advertising companies
** Slower than expected adoption
* Operational risks
* Staffing risks- embedding the right candidate for the right surgeon
** Availability of skilled workforce- x-pharma reps, x-equipment reps
** Union issues
* Financing risks
** Liabilities
** Poorly worded investor contracts at risk for litigation
** Investor pull-out
** Lack of follow-on funding to complete project
* Managerial risks
** Poor board or investor dynamics
** Agency risk particular to the venture

=== Risk Management Plan ===
Detailed plans are more often found as part of internal plans. 
Plans written for funders may need to include a high level of description if there are significant controllable risks.

* Methods and procedures to limit liabilities
* Reserve funds
* Continuity of operations plan

== Decision Making Criteria ==
* Break even analysis
* NPV
* IRR

A '''marketing plan''' is a written document that details the necessary actions to achieve one or more marketing objectives. It can be for a product or Service (economics)|service, a brand, or a product line. Marketing plans cover between one and five years. 

A marketing plan may be part of an overall business plan. Solid marketing strategy is the foundation of a well-written marketing plan. While a marketing plan contains a list of actions, a marketing plan without a sound strategic foundation is of little use.

==The marketing planning process ==
[[Image:Marketing process model.png|thumb|500px|The marketing process model based on the publications of Philip Kotler. It consists of 5 steps, beginning with the market &amp; environment research. After fixing the targets and setting the strategies, they will be realised by the marketing mix in step 4. The last step in the process is the marketing controlling.]]
In most organizations, &quot;strategic planning&quot; is an annual process, typically covering just the year ahead. Occasionally, a few organizations may look at a practical plan which stretches three or more years ahead.
  
To be most effective, the plan has to be formalized, usually in written form, as a formal &quot;marketing plan.&quot; The essence of the process is that it moves from the general to the specific; from the overall objectives of the organization down to the individual Objective (goal)|action plan for a part of one marketing program. It is also an interactive process, so that the draft output of each stage is checked to see what impact it has on the earlier stages - and is amended.

==Marketing planning aims and objectives==

Behind the corporate objectives, which in themselves offer the main context for the marketing plan, will lay the &quot;corporate mission&quot;; which in turn provides the context for these corporate objectives. This &quot;corporate mission&quot; can be thought of as a definition of what the organization is; of what it does: &quot;Our business is …&quot;.
  
This definition should not be too narrow, or it will constrict the development of the organization; a too rigorous concentration on the view that &quot;We are in the business of making meat-scales,&quot; as IBM was during the early 1900s, might have limited its subsequent development into other areas. On the other hand, it should not be too wide or it will become meaningless; &quot;We want to make a profit&quot; is not too helpful in developing specific plans.
  
Abell suggested that the definition should cover three dimensions: &quot;customer groups&quot; to be served, &quot;customer needs&quot; to be served, and &quot;technologies&quot; to be utilized &lt;ref&gt;Abell, &quot;Defining the Business: The Starting Point of Strategic Planning&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, the definition of IBM's &quot;corporate mission&quot; in the 1940s might well have been: &quot;We are in the business of handling accounting information [customer need] for the larger US organizations [customer group] by means of Punch card|punched cards [technology].&quot;
 
Perhaps the most important factor in successful marketing is the &quot;corporate vision.&quot; Surprisingly, it is largely neglected by marketing textbooks; although not by the popular exponents of corporate strategy - indeed, it was perhaps the main theme of the book by Peters and Waterman, in the form of their &quot;Superordinate Goals.&quot; &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; said: &quot;Nothing drives progress like the imagination. The idea precedes the deed.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Marketing Imagination&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; If the organization in general, and its chief executive in particular, has a strong vision of where its future lies, then there is a good chance that the organization will achieve a strong position in its markets (and attain that future). This will be not least because its strategies will be consistent; and will be supported by its staff at all levels. In this context, all of IBM's marketing activities were underpinned by its philosophy of &quot;customer service&quot;; a vision originally promoted by the charismatic Watson dynasty. 

The emphasis at this stage is on obtaining a complete and accurate picture. In a single organization, however, it is likely that only a few aspects will be sufficiently important to have any significant impact on the marketing plan; but all may need to be reviewed to determine just which &quot;are&quot; the few.
    
  
A &quot;traditional&quot; - albeit product-based - format for a &quot;brand reference book&quot; (or, indeed, a &quot;marketing facts book&quot;) was suggested by Godley more than three decades ago:
  
#Financial data --Facts for this section will come from management accounting, costing and finance sections.
#Product data --From production, research and development.
#Sales and distribution data - Sales, packaging, distribution sections.
#Advertising, sales promotion, merchandising data - Information from these departments.
#Market data and miscellany - From market research, who would in most cases act as a source for this information.
  
His sources of data, however, assume the resources of a very large organization. In most organizations they would be obtained from a much smaller set of people (and not a few of them would be generated by the marketing manager alone). It is apparent that a marketing audit can be a complex process, but the aim is simple: &quot;it is only to identify those existing (external and internal) factors which will have a significant impact on the future plans of the company.&quot;
  
It is clear that the basic material to be input to the marketing audit should be comprehensive. Accordingly, the best approach is to accumulate this material continuously, as and when it becomes available; since this avoids the otherwise heavy workload involved in collecting it as part of the regular, typically annual, planning process itself - when time is usually at a premium. Even so, the first task of this &quot;annual&quot; process should be to check that the material held in the current &quot;facts 
book&quot; or &quot;facts files&quot; actually &quot;is&quot; comprehensive and accurate, and can form a sound basis for the marketing audit itself.
  
The structure of the facts book will be designed to match the specific needs of the organization, but one simple format - suggested by Malcolm McDonald - may be applicable in many cases. This splits the material into three groups:
  
#&quot;Review of the marketing environment.&quot; A study of the organization's markets, customers, competitors and the overall economic, political, cultural and technical environment; covering developing trends, as well as the current situation.
#&quot;Review of the detailed marketing activity.&quot; A study of the company's marketing mix; in terms of the 7 Ps - (see below)
#&quot;Review of the marketing system.&quot; A study of the marketing organization, marketing research systems and the current marketing objectives and strategies.
  
The last of these is too frequently ignored. The marketing system itself needs to be regularly questioned, because the validity of the whole marketing plan is reliant upon the accuracy of the 
input from this system, and `garbage in, garbage out' applies with a vengeance.

*&quot;Portfolio planning.&quot; In addition, the coordinated planning of the individual products and services can contribute towards the balanced portfolio. 

*&quot;80:20 rule.&quot; To achieve the maximum impact, the marketing plan must be clear, concise and simple. It needs to concentrate on the 20 per cent of products or services, and on the 20 per cent of customers, which will account for 80 per cent of the volume and 80 per cent of the profit.
  
*&quot;7 P's&quot;: Product, Place, Price and Promotion, Physical Environment, People, Process. The 7 P's can sometimes divert attention from the customer, but the framework they offer can be very useful in building the action plans.


  
It is only at this stage (of deciding the marketing objectives) that the active part of the marketing planning process begins'.
  
This next stage in marketing planning is indeed the key to the whole marketing process. The &quot;marketing objectives&quot; state just where the company intends to be; at some specific time in the future. James Quinn succinctly defined objectives in general as: &quot;Goals (or objectives) state 'what' is to be achieved and 'when' results are to be accomplished, but they do not state 'how' the results are to be achieved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quinn&quot;&gt;J. B. Quinn, &quot;Strategies for Change: Logical Incrementalism&quot; (Richard D. Irwin, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
They typically relate to what products (or services) will be where in what markets (and must be realistically based on customer behavior in those markets). They are essentially about the match between those &quot;products&quot; and &quot;markets.&quot; Objectives for pricing, distribution, advertising and so on are at a lower level, and should not be confused with marketing objectives. They are part of the marketing strategy needed to achieve marketing objectives.
  
To be most effective, objectives should be capable of measurement and therefore &quot;quantifiable.&quot; This measurement may be in terms of sales volume, money value, market share, percentage penetration of distribution outlets and so on. An example of such a measurable marketing objective might be &quot;to enter the market with product Y and capture 10 per cent of the market by value within one year.&quot; As it is quantified it can, within limits, be unequivocally monitored; and Corrective Action|corrective action taken as necessary.

The marketing objectives must usually be based, above all, on the organization's financial objectives; converting these financial measurements into the related marketing measurements.

He went on to explain his view of the role of &quot;policies,&quot; with which strategy is most often confused: &quot;Policies are rules or guidelines that express the 'limits' within which action should occur.&quot;

Simplifying somewhat, marketing strategies can be seen as the means, or &quot;game plan,&quot; by which marketing objectives will be achieved and, in the framework that we have chosen to use, are generally concerned with the 7 P's. Examples are:
  
Price- The amount of money needed to buy products

Product- The actual product

Promotion (advertising)- Getting the product known

Placement- Where the product is located

People- Represent the business

Physical environment- The ambiance, mood, or tone of the environment

Process- How do people obtain your product

In principle, these strategies describe how the objectives will be achieved. The 7 P's are a useful framework for deciding how the company's resources will be manipulated (strategically) to achieve the objectives. It should be noted, however, that they are not the only framework, and may divert attention from the real issues. The focus of the strategies must be the objectives to be achieved - not the process of planning itself. Only if it fits the needs of these objectives should you choose, as we 
have done, to use the framework of the 7 P's.

The strategy statement can take the form of a purely verbal description of the strategic options which have been chosen. Alternatively, and perhaps more positively, it might include a structured list of the major options chosen.

One aspect of strategy which is often overlooked is that of &quot;timing.&quot; Exactly when it is the best time for each element of the strategy to be implemented is often critical. Taking the right action at the wrong time can sometimes be almost as bad as taking the wrong action at the right time. Timing is, therefore, an essential part of any plan; and should normally appear as a schedule of planned activities.

Having completed this crucial stage of the planning process, you will need to re-check the feasibility of your objectives and strategies in terms of the market share, sales, costs, profits and so on which these demand in practice. As in the rest of the marketing discipline, you will need to employ judgment, experience, market research or anything else which helps you to look at your conclusions from all possible angles.

===Detailed plans and programs===

At this stage, you will need to develop your overall marketing strategies into detailed plans and program. Although these detailed plans may cover each of the 7 P's, the focus will vary, depending upon your organization's specific strategies. A product-oriented company will focus its plans for the 7 P's around each of its products. A market or geographically oriented company will concentrate on each market or geographical area. Each will base its plans upon the detailed needs of its customers, and on the strategies chosen to satisfy these needs.
  
Again, the most important element is, indeed, that of the detailed plans; which spell out exactly what programs and individual activities will take place over the period of the plan (usually over the next year). Without these specified - and preferably quantified - activities the plan cannot be monitored, even in terms of success in meeting its objectives.

It is these programs and activities which will then constitute the &quot;marketing&quot; of the organization over the period. As a result, these detailed marketing programs are the most important, practical outcome of the whole planning process. These plans should therefore be:
  
*'''Clear''' - They should be an unambiguous statement of 'exactly' what is to be done.
  
*'''Quantified''' - The predicted outcome of each activity should be, as far as possible, quantified; so that its performance can be monitored.
  
*'''Focused''' - The temptation to proliferate activities beyond the numbers which can be realistically controlled should be avoided. The Pareto principle|80:20 Rule applies in this context too. 
  
*'''Realistic''' - They should be achievable.
  
*'''Agreed''' - Those who are to implement them should be committed to them, and agree that they are achievable.
  
The resulting plans should become a working document which will guide the campaigns taking place throughout the organization over the period of the plan. If the marketing plan is to work, every 
exception to it (throughout the year) must be questioned; and the lessons learned, to be incorporated in the next year's planning.

==Measurement of progress==
  
The final stage of any marketing planning process is to establish targets (or standards) so that progress can be monitored. Accordingly, it is important to put both quantities and timescales into the marketing objectives (for example, to capture 20 per cent by value of the market within two years) and into the corresponding strategies.
  
Changes in the environment mean that the forecasts often have to be changed. Along with these, the related plans may well also need to be changed. Continuous monitoring of performance, against 
predetermined targets, represents a most important aspect of this. However, perhaps even more important is the enforced discipline of a regular formal review. Again, as with forecasts, in many cases the best (most realistic) planning cycle will revolve around a quarterly review. Best of all, at least in terms 
of the quantifiable aspects of the plans, if not the wealth of backing detail, is probably a quarterly rolling review - planning one full year ahead each new quarter. Of course, this does absorb more planning resource; but it also ensures that the plans embody the latest information, and - with attention focused on them so regularly - forces both the plans and their implementation to be realistic.
  
Plans only have validity if they are actually used to control the progress of a company: their success lies in their implementation, not in the writing'.

==Performance analysis==
  
The most important elements of marketing performance, which are normally tracked, are:
  
===Sales analysis===
  
Most organizations track their sales results; or, in non-profit organizations for example, the number of clients. The more sophisticated track them in terms of 'sales variance' - the deviation from the target figures - which allows a more immediate picture of deviations to become evident.. `Micro-
analysis', which is a nicely pseudo-scientific term for the normal management process of investigating detailed problems, then investigates the individual elements (individual products, sales territories, customers and so on) which are failing to meet targets.

===Market share analysis===
  
Few organizations track market share though it is often an important metric. Though absolute sales might grow in an expanding market, a firm's share of the market can decrease which bodes ill for future sales when the market starts to drop. Where such market share is tracked, there may be a number of aspects which will be followed:
  
*overall market share
*segment share - that in the specific, targeted segment
*relative share -in relation to the market leaders
*annual fluctuation rate of market share

===Expense analysis===
  
The key ratio to watch in this area is usually the `marketing expense to sales ratio'; although this may be broken down into other elements (advertising to sales, sales administration to sales, and so on).

===Financial analysis===
  
The `bottom line' of marketing activities should at least in theory, be the net profit (for all except non-profit organizations, where the comparable emphasis may be on remaining within budgeted costs). There are a number of separate performance figures and key ratios which need to be tracked:
  
*gross contribution&lt;&gt;net profit
*gross profit&lt;&gt;return on investment
*net contribution&lt;&gt;profit on sales
  
There can be considerable benefit in comparing these figures with those achieved by other organizations (especially those in the same industry); using, for instance, the figures which can be 
obtained (in the UK) from `The Centre for Interfirm Comparison'. The most sophisticated use of this approach, however, is typically by those making use of PIMS (Profit Impact of Management Strategies), initiated by the General Electric Company and then developed by Harvard Business School, but now run by the Strategic Planning Institute. 
  
The above performance analyses concentrate on the quantitative measures which are directly related to short-term performance. But there are a number of indirect measures, essentially tracking customer attitudes, which can also indicate the organization's performance in terms of its longer-term marketing strengths and may accordingly be even more important indicators. Some useful measures are:
  
*market research - including customer panels (which are used to track changes over time)
*lost business - the orders which were lost because, for example, the stock was not available or the product did not meet the customer's exact requirements
*customer complaints - how many customers complain about the products or services, or the organization itself, and about what

===Use of marketing plans===
  
A formal, written marketing plan is essential; in that it provides an unambiguous reference point for 
activities throughout the planning period. However, perhaps the most important benefit of these plans is the planning process itself. This typically offers a unique opportunity, a forum, for information-rich and productively focused discussions between the various managers involved. The plan, together with the associated discussions, then provides an agreed context for their subsequent management activities, even for those not described in the plan itself.

==Budgets as managerial tools==
  
The classic quantification of a marketing plan appears in the form of budgets. Because these are so rigorously quantified, they are particularly important. They should, thus, represent an unequivocal projection of actions and expected results. What is more, they should be capable of being monitored accurately; and, indeed, performance against budget is the main (regular) management review process.
  
The purpose of a marketing budget is, thus, to pull together all the revenues and costs involved in marketing into one comprehensive document. It is a managerial tool that balances what is needed to be spent against what can be afforded, and helps make choices about priorities. It is then used in 
monitoring performance in practice.
  
The marketing budget is usually the most powerful tool by which you think through the relationship between desired results and available means. Its starting point should be the marketing strategies and plans, which have already been formulated in the marketing plan itself; although, in practice, the two will run in parallel and will interact. At the very least, the rigorous, highly quantified, budgets may cause a rethink of some of the more optimistic elements of the plans.

==Key part of the general corporate strategy ==

A marketing strategy is most effective when it is an integral component of corporate strategy, defining how the organization will successfully engage customers, prospects, and competitors in the market arena. Strategic management|corporate strategies, corporate missions, and corporate goals. As the customer constitutes the source of a company's revenue, marketing strategy is closely linked with sales.  A key component of marketing strategy is often to keep marketing in line with a company's overarching mission statement&lt;REF&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/REF&gt;.

Basic theory: 1) Target Audience  2) Proposition/Key Element  3) Implementation

== Sectorial tactics and actions ==
A marketing strategy can serve as the foundation of a marketing plan. A marketing plan contains a set of specific actions required to successfully implement a marketing strategy. For example: &quot;Use a low cost product to attract consumers. Once our organization, via our low cost product, has established a relationship with consumers, our organization will sell additional, higher-margin products and services that enhance the consumer's interaction with the low-cost product or service.&quot;

A strategy consists of a well thought out series of tactics to make a marketing plan more effective.  Marketing strategies serve as the fundamental underpinning of marketing plans designed to fill market needs and reach marketing objectives&lt;ref&gt; Marketing basics [http://perso.orange.fr/pgreenfinch/mkting/mkting3.htm Marketing strategy based on market needs, targets and goals].&lt;/ref&gt;. Plans and objectives are generally tested for measurable results.

A marketing strategy often integrates an organization's marketing goals, policies, and action sequences (tactics) into a cohesive whole. Similarly, the various strands of the strategy , which might include advertising, channel (marketing)|channel marketing, internet marketing, promotion (marketing)|promotion and public relations can be orchestrated. Many companies cascade a strategy throughout an organization, by creating strategy tactics that then become strategy goals for the next level or group.  Each one group is expected to take that strategy goal and develop a set of tactics to achieve that goal.  This is why it is important to make each strategy goal measurable.

Marketing strategies are dynamic and interactive. They are partially planned and partially unplanned. See strategy dynamics.

==Types of strategies==
Marketing strategies may differ depending on the unique situation of the individual business. However there are a number of ways of categorizing some generic strategies. A brief description of the most common categorizing schemes is presented below:

* Strategies based on market dominance - In this scheme, firms are classified based on their market share or dominance of an industry. Typically there are three types of market dominance strategies:
** Leader
** Challenger
** Follower
* Porter generic strategies - strategy on the dimensions of strategic scope and strategic strength. Strategic scope refers to the market penetration while strategic strength refers to the firm’s sustainable competitive advantage.
** Product differentiation
** Market segmentation
* Innovation strategies - This deals with the firm's rate of the new product development and business model innovation. It asks whether the company is on the cutting edge of technology and business innovation. There are three types:
** Pioneers
** Close followers
** Late followers
* Growth strategies - In this scheme we ask the question, “How should the firm grow?”. There are a number of different ways of answering that question, but the most common gives four answers:
** Horizontal integration 
** Vertical integration
** Diversification 
** Intensification
: A more detailed scheme uses the categories:
:* Prospector
:* Analyzer
:* Defender
:* Reactor
* Marketing warfare strategies - This scheme draws parallels between marketing strategies and military strategies.

==Strategic models==
Marketing participants often employ strategic models and tools to analyze marketing decisions. When beginning a strategic analysis, the 3C's|3Cs can be employed to get a broad understanding of the strategic environment. An Ansoff Matrix is also often used to convey an organization's strategic positioning of their marketing mix. The 4P's|4Ps can then be utilized to form a marketing plan to pursue a defined strategy.
 
Marketing in Practice

The Consumer-Centric Business

There are a many companies especially those in the Consumer Package Goods (CPG) market that adopt the theory of running their business centered around Consumer, Shopper &amp; Retailer needs. Their Marketing departments spend quality time looking for &quot;Growth Opportunities&quot; in their categories by identifying relevant insights (both mindsets and behaviors) on their target Consumers, Shoppers and retail partners. These Growth Opportunities emerge from changes in market trends, segment dynamics changing and also internal brand or operational business challenges.The Marketing team can then prioritize these Growth Opportunities and begin to develop strategies to exploit the opportunities that could include new or adapted products, services as well as changes to the 7Ps. 
 
Real-life marketing primarily revolves around the application of a great deal of common-sense; dealing with a limited number of factors, in an environment of imperfect information and limited resources complicated by uncertainty and tight timescales. Use of classical marketing techniques, in these circumstances, is inevitably partial and uneven.
 
Thus, for example, many new products will emerge from irrational processes and the rational development process may be used (if at all) to screen out the worst non-runners. The design of the advertising, and the packaging, will be the output of the creative minds employed; which management will then screen, often by 'gut-reaction', to ensure that it is reasonable. 
 
For most of their time, marketing managers use intuition and experience to analyze and handle the complex, and unique, situations being faced; without easy reference to theory. This will often be 'flying by the seat of the pants', or 'gut-reaction'; where the overall strategy, coupled with the knowledge of the customer which has been absorbed almost by a process of osmosis, will determine the quality of the marketing employed.  This, almost instinctive management, is what is sometimes called 'coarse marketing'; to distinguish it from the refined, aesthetically pleasing, form favored by the theorists.

== What are transitions? Types of transitions ==   

Consider the following example to think about the reason why the students were upset. 

: There were only 10 minutes left in the class. The teacher rushed to put all the rules and examples on the board. The students took out their notebook to copy the rules down. They were a little upset. The students had an assignment with the transitions. They weren't sure they would be able to do the assignment correctly. They didn't have enough written practice with transitions.

Now read another version.
 
: There were only 10 minutes left in the class, so the teacher rushed to put all the rules and examples for transitions on the board. The students took out their notebook to copy the rules down. However, they were a little upset because they had an assignment with the transitions for the next day, and they weren't sure they would be able to do it correctly. In addition, they were upset because they hadn't had enough written practice with transitions.

What made the students upset? And which one of the example can deliver a clear meaning? 
Words 'however' and 'in addition' in B are called logical connectors or transitions.

== Why we use transitions? Functions of transitions ==

Consider the following sentences to see if the meaning can be changed.

# Jill isn't in town. So Jack isn't here.
# Jill isn't in town. After all, Jack isn't here.
# Jill isn't in town. Moreover, Jack isn't here.
# Jill isn't in town. However, Jack isn't' here

The use of transitions alone may not lead to text cohesion and coherence; however, their role is substantial because they establish the implied relationships between sentences, presupposing the presence of other components in the discourse. 

== How we use transitions? Issues about transitions ==

Previous studies have demonstrated how the use of sentence transitions can contribute to quality writing and how student writers have employed transitions. They observe the three issues of misuse, overuse, and underuse of sentence transitions: the erroneous, repetitive, and insufficient use of transitions may mislead the audience. Undoubtedly, the use of transitions correspond to improved writing skills, yet many students at the higher levels still repeatedly use a limited stock of transitions. This suggests that writers need to have a better understanding of how to use, when to use, as well as when not to use the sentence transitions.

I welded once when I was about 18, but that was nearly 30 years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The official Trainzdev guide is here:

http://www.trainzdev.com/components/com_mambowiki/index.php/Updating_Steam_Locos_to_TC3_Standards

First the Engine specs:

Find the installed locomotive or download it
Then open up Content Creator Plus and the asset details will be shown and you can change them. Find the enginespec tag and click the ...
button. Then a 'KUIDBrowser' should come up. Choose the category enginespec and then find the 3F engine spec if you want a small tank
loco, for larger ones use maybe a 5MT of Britannia spec. Then hit select, and do the same on the enginesound tag, except use the
enginesound category. Use the 3cylinder obviously for a 3 cylinder loco, for a small 2 cyl tank loco it's best to use the 2 cylinder
Stephenson included in the TC3 patch. For other locos, change it to the plain 2 cylinder sounds. Then, if you want to change the whistle,
press the ... button in the hornsound tag and find the whistle you think would suit it. Then, using the list on the left hand side, click
in the button that says 'Kuid-table'. Then simply click on the X sign next to the things displayed on the screen which show a KUID number
instead of a name.
Then click file, save then exit. When that's done, go back into CMP and commit the loco (Ctrl+M) and go for a drive in it!This method
should work for any steam loco you want to convert.

The bogey will need the line 

direct-drive        1

adding anywhere.

next the running number problem:

For the running numbers in TC3 and 2009 I think you may have to add the following line into the config.

fonts-path &quot;9f_doublechimney&quot;

The fonts-path tag points to the root directory folder of the model, The above is taken for the TC3 built in double chimney 9F. Below is an
example from one of the Class 40 models

fonts-path &quot;BR_Green_Full_Yellow_Class40_splitcode&quot;

This will also need to be accompanied by

fonts 1

This value for this tag will need to adjust for the different amount of fonts used on the loco. To find out the number to put for this
value look in the alpha numbers directory and if it has files named alphanumber_0a and alphanumber_0b then the value wants to be 2 due to
2 types of font in use. If its just alphanumber_0 then you want a value of 1. The fonts tag should already be present though on the
models as this is required for alpha numbers to work in 2004 upwards.

===Overview===

Vertebrates that use salt lakes include birds, fish, reptiles and bats and other mammals. To develop an understanding of the food web interdependencies of your lake, it is necessary to know what species use the lake and the use they make of it - be it for feeding, breeding or resting.


===Observational surveys===

The simplest and least invasive method of collecting vertebrate fauna information is the observational survey. Observational methods of survey include the following activities:
#dawn and dusk bird point counts,
#dusk bat walks (with or without bat detectors),
#&quot;scats, tracks and traces&quot; observations for terrestrial vertebrates,
#&quot;active search&quot; (sometimes called &quot;checklist&quot;) or &quot;pollard walk&quot; for reptiles,
#audio recording of bat and nocturnal bird calls,
#hair tubes for mammals,
#the recording of opportunistic sightings,
#photography, and
#evening spotlighting.


It may be difficult to decide whether you have conducted sufficient observations and the following advice may assist:  
#For point counts, active search, recordings etc, make a note of the time you spend observing and the new species recorded, to construct a species accumulation curve (Smith, 1996). 
#Where a 'pollard walk' is set up, ensure that it passes through all the habitat patches on the site and traverses the landscape perpendicular to the slope at least once. For organisms that are sedentary, one walk may be sufficient. For mobile organisms, determine whether new species are detected on a second walk. If they are, consider further walks.

===Comprehensive (trapping) fauna surveys=== 

Trapping methods include:
#cage and elliott traps for medium and small mammals, 
#dry pitfalls with drift fencing for small mammals and reptiles,  
#small traps for fish (minnow traps, opera traps, small nets.

Invasive survey methods such as vertebrate trapping usually require a permit from regional authorities. Always ensure that you have the correct permit and that you are aware of all the licence and reporting conditions that apply to the permit. Given the invasive nature of trapping, it is important that you do not impact on the population more than you need to (overtrapping). It is equally important that you do not subject the population to this stress only to produce data that is too scant to be statistically useful (undertrapping). In South Australia, the Biological Survey of SA has published &quot;Guidelines for Vertebrate Surveys in South Australia&quot;, which may be downloaded from [http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/biodiversity/pdfs/vertebrate_survey_manual.pdf] The manual provides information on the layout of traplines, numbers of specific types of traps per trapline, appropriate numbers of trap nights, OH&amp;S requirements, equipment lists, animal handling and ethics considerations.  

===Specimen records=== 

Some records must be made in the field. Other determinations may wait until a laboratory is available (audio record analysis, hair samples, scats and remains). Record field determinations on field data sheets or in filed books, using a soft pencil (ink runs when wet). Sometimes a secondary record (eg a photograph or an audio tape) can be made to be returned to base for further consideration.  The records most usefully made in the field include:  
#Locational details (remember to record the datum you are using)
#Birds - names, photographs of indeterminate species, audio recordings 
#Mammals and reptiles - names, body weights, body length, tail length, sex (if easily determined), photographs of indeterminate species (as appropriate: overall view, face side on and full face, front and rear feet, head scale pattern, ventral and dorsal views of scales or patterns), audio recordings
#Fish - names, photographs of indeterminate species (ensure a scale is present in all photographs)
 
===Vouchering===

Vertebrate species should only be vouchered if strictly necessary. The authority that issues you with any necessary permit will specify whether there are species that they wish you to voucher. Unknown (new to science) species should be vouchered for provision to the appropriate taxonomic authority. 

Vouchering vertebrates requires the use of a prescription drug to euthanise the animal, and you may require a veterinary licence to use this.  If you trap a vertebrate that should be vouchered (a new species, or a species where a voucher has been requested by the authorities and you do not have the appropriate drug to euthanise the animal you will need to return the animal alive, to the permitting authority, where appropriately licenced staff will euthanise it.

===Overview===
Salt lakes share some common hydrologic, soil, and vegetative characteristics. Beyond these general similarities, however, there is a very wide variation in terms of their size, complexity, physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and functional processes. Attempts to develop a simple classification for lakes abound in the literature (Timms, 1992). Most definitions start with the geological origin of the lake then move on through the geomorphology of the lake basin to the ionic composition of the waters, permanance of the waters, depth of the waters etc.

===Hydrogeomorphic classification===

The hydrogeomorphic classification approach developed by Brinson (1993) to identify groups of wetlands that function similarly has relevance when applied to salt lakes. The hydrogeomorphic classification is based on three fundamental factors that influence how wetlands function:
#	geomorphic setting (landform elements, geologic evolution, position in landscape), 
#	water source (rain, runoff, groundwater), and 
#	hydrodynamics (energy level of any moving water, direction of flow)

Examples of how these three factors influence the wetland types can be seen in the examples shown in the table below.

[[File:Hydrogeomorphic.jpg|centre|thumb|800px|Hydrogeomorphic summaries of some types of Australian wetlands (based on Smith ''et al'', 1995)|centre]]

The objective of the characterisation stage of a salt lake study is to document existing conditions, thus providing a reference point for comparing future conditions and a better understanding of the processes occurring in the lake. To meet this objective a description of the climate (including BoM climate averages where available), landform and geomorphic setting, apparent hydrology, vegetation, soils, groundwater features, surficial geology, and other relevant characteristics can be used to develop a hydrogeomorphic classification the lake. 

===Mapping===

It is also useful to develop a base map of your lake and its surrounding landscape. Multiple maps or overlays, keyed to the base map, may be used to show features of interest. The map should display the following information:
#	Topographic contour lines in the project area and surrounding landscape,
#	Infrastructure (e.g., roads, fences, buildings, railroad grades, and bridges),
#	Surface water features (e.g., streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, and springs),
#	North arrow (true north), legend or key, and distance scale, and
#	Title block with the project name, investigators, dates, and information sources.

Overlays may be developed from work conducted in other phases of the project, and these may include:
#	Soil types,
#	Plant communities, and
#	Location of potential impacting asapects.


===The water regime===

The period salt lakes remain inundated varies from a few days at a time to permanent. The pattern of wetting and drying is called the '''hydropoeriod''' and is an important driver of processes within the lake. 

To determine the seasonal variations in hydrology, a series of depth posts may be placed perpendicular to the lake's edge, at several locations around the lake. This will allow the recording of water depth (from an arbitrary datum point) and extent of inundation over the seasons. The height of water on these pegs should be recorded at regular intervals.

Another method of assessing regular changes in inundation patterns is to review historic aerial photography.

During site visits in dry season, measuring the depth to free water and depth to saturated soil in a pit is informative.

The chemistry (composition and concentration) of the overlying brines impacts on the '''evaporation rate''' from the surface and may therefore influence on the hydroperiod. [[/Effects of salinity on evaporation rate/]]

Salts dissolved in the brine become saturated at different stages, allowing '''sequential crystallisation''' of brine salts as a salt lake dries up. [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Methods_Manual_for_Salt_Lake_Studies/Sequential_crystallisation_of_brine_salts]]

===Overview===

The brines in salt lakes are made up of a variety of dissolved salts derived from the environment in which the lake is located. Salt lakes, even those in extremely cold places such as Antarctica, are usually found in semi arid areas of the earth with low rainfall and high evaporation. Sources of salts to salt lakes are various: they may be the result of the stranding of marine areas in the geological past, or they may be the result of dissolution of nearby rocks over eons into a terminal lake system.

===What &quot;type&quot; of lake is it?===

Marine-derived brines are characterised by the presence of calcium and magnesium salts. Salt lakes formed from local dissolution may have very different salt compositions.

Sodium chloride is present in all salt lakes. Most lakes fall into four major groups if you are classifying them by their salt composition:
# Sulfate type lakes that derive their salts from surrounding rocks that contain sodium sulfate
# Carbonate type lakes (marl, or flos ferri lakes) are alkaline lakes which contain sodium carbonate in addition to sodium chloride and sodium sulfate (gypsum and anhydrite). 
# Bittern lakes like the Dead Sea contain more magnesium than sodium.
# Sodium chloride type lakes such as the Great Salt Lake of USA and most Australian salt lakes are similar in composition to sea brine of an identical density.

===Crystallisation sequence in marine-derived lakes===

In sodium chloride type lakes, the crystallisation pattern of the different salts is very similar to that of evaporating seawater brines and occurs as follows (Baseggio 1974, Venkatesh Mannar 1982):
# The least soluble salts are the ferric oxides, which precipitate out of solution between 30g/L TDS and 70g/L TDS.
# Calcium carbonate (calcite or flos ferri) starts to deposit at the same salinity as ferric oxide but continues precipitating up to a salinity of about 170g/L TDS.
# Calcium sulfate, as gypsum or selenite (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)starts to precipitate at a salinity of about 143g/L TDS. At about 191g/L TDS the form of calcium sulfate changes and it deposits as anhydrite (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). While most of the calcium sulfate is precipitated before sodium chloride starts to precipitate, a small quantity continues to crystallise out of solution up to a salinity of 385g/L TDS.
# Sodium chloride (common salt) begins to crystallise at a salinity of 318g/L and precipitates rapidly in brines with a salinity up to 360g/L. Thereafter the quantity of common salt precipitating reduces, although some common salt has still been recorded precipitating from seawater-derived brines with a salinity of about 440g/L TDS (Chitnis &amp; Sanghavi, 1993).
# Magnesium sulfate (epsom salts), potassium sulfates and chlorides, and sodium sulfates (glaubers salts), start to precipite when seawater-derived brines reach a salinity of 390g/L TDS, and finally magnesium chloride and bromine salts will precipitate when salinities exceed 400g/L TDS.

I edited the section on Anorexia. I added the section that that says how when people have an eating disorder it is not strictly limited to one. One of my former teachers taught that it is usually a combination of bullimia and anorexia and that is partly why it is such a difficult disease because the person isn't just fighitng one.

I added treatment options to the section on the Dhat syndrome. [[Carr7805]]

I changed the initial definition of Dhat syndrome that stated that the syndrome was premature ejaculation, when in reality a more accurate description would be the preoccupation with excessive loss of semen.

== Prokaryotes ==

Could you quickly shed some light on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cell_Biology/Cell_types/Prokaryotes&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1426846 your edit] to the [[Cell Biology/Cell types/Prokaryotes]] page. Sources seem to vary on the size, but that &quot;&lt;math&gt;x+345&lt;/math&gt;&quot; edit seems a bit strange. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:28, 26 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Compressed Air: Walkthrough Checklist ==
This section provides a checklist of things to look for while at the plant. It provides an overview of the major compressor savings opportunities. It is designed to help assure that major savings opportunities are addressed, and to help identify areas on which to focus more detailed analysis. 

During a site evaluation, it is important to record gauge readings on air compressors, other equipment, and at other locations where it can be obtained throughout the plant. Many air compressors include airflow and pressure gauges, while other equipment often includes pressure gauges, making it possible to measure pressure drop across the oil separator and dryer. Look for high pressure drops through equipment and lines. Look for intentional pressure reductions, such as with valves and pressure regulators. More detailed aids for recording and analyzing compressor data are provided in later chapters. 

See Reference &amp; Data Collection sections for more detail on opportunities identified.

'''Major Savings Opportunities:'''
*Large compressor serving minimal system needs in off hours (e.g. fire suppression system).
**Install small dedicated air compressor to serve minimal after hour need such as a fire suppression system and isolate from main plant air system. 
***It is common to leave a larger compressor on continuously - 7 days a week - to serve a small use such as a dry fire suppression system. The compressor may operate for long periods at an extremely inefficient part load condition. System leaks also consume air and energy continually. It is generally cost effective to install a separate dedicated compressor for such a need and separate it from the main compressed air system to avoid losing air and energy to system leaks during non-production times. 
*Multiple compressors operation at part load.
**When more than one compressor is operating, all but one should operate at full capacity and maximum efficiency. A final trim compressor can match output to system requirements. In the best case, the &quot;trim&quot; compressor can have more sophisticated controls for greater efficiency at part load operation.
***''Manually sequence multiple compressors:'' Set existing controls to load compressors sequentially so that unneeded compressors can be turned off manually or automatically. The downside of this option is the increase in pressure variations unless electronic controls are installed.
***''Install automatic compressor sequencing controls:'' Sequence compressors to avoid operating several compressors at part load. Fewer compressors will operate more efficiently at higher loads. The largest savings come from the sequencer turning unneeded compressors off.
*Throttle controlled screw compressor operating at partial capacity for large part of time.
**Generally: A throttle-controlled compressor should not operate below 70-80% capacity for much of the time. A throttle-controlled compressor consumes approximately 70% of its full load power when delivering no air and 85% power at half capacity.
***Install load-unload controls for more efficient air compressor operation. Load unload control allows a compressor to operate either at full output and maximum efficiency or unloaded. Because the compressor does not turn off, the motor is not damaged. However, load-unload control requires larger receiver capacity and a significant variation in system pressure to create an acceptable cycle time. An unloaded screw compressor with the discharge pressure reduced to near atmosphere consumes approximately 17% to 26% of the energy required for the compressor to operate at full capacity. When the compressor discharge pressure drops to an intermediate pressure,  such as 40-50 psig, there are fewer savings. This recommendation does not work everywhere because:
****Some processes are too sensitive to allow the variation in pressure required.
****The load/unload cycle can make maintenance personnel uncomfortable. It is often set to unload at low load causing the compressor to operate at inefficient part loads. Potential savings are lost. A small amount of compressed air is released to atmosphere when the compressor unloads. If the compressor cycles too often this air loss can be significant.

    • The definition and purpose of portfolios
    • Who and what is involved in the implementation process of portfolios

    • The disadvantages of portfolios 
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Introduction&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

Educators are becoming more and more frustrated with the pressures of standardized tests and how they are used as a method of assessment. Teachers must center their instruction around these standards because they are accountable for their students’ preparation of these tests (Blackbourn et al., 2004). In the end, are standardized tests truly a justified method of measuring each student’s progress? Are there alternative approaches to assess those students who do not perform well on tests?

Portfolio-based assessment was designed as an evaluation that centers around each individual student (Blackbourn et al., 2004). The definition of a portfolio is a collection of a student’s work over a period of time. They are used as a performance-based assessment tool to demonstrate what the student is learning and to track their progress (Abrenica). They also allow the student to reflect on his or her strengths and weaknesses and then apply these skills to improve their performance (Valdez, 2001). Let’s take a more in-depth look at the structure, evaluation, and pros and cons of portfolio assessment.


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Portfolio Implementation&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

Implementing a portfolio uses a constructivist approach because it “deeply involves the students in the task assigned to them” (Valdez, 2001, p. 1) Portfolios should be designed by both the teacher and student. Specific goals and objectives need to be set to not only reflect the teacher’s standards, but the interests and learning styles of the student (Blackbourn et al., 2004). Portfolios should not only be a collection of test results, journal entries, and homework. They should also include written reflections to accompany each entry that demonstrate the student’s knowledge, skills, and application of what they have learned (Valdez, 2001).


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Electronic Portfolios&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

[[Image:messy_portfolio.jpg|100px|right]]
Portfolio assessment began by collecting student work samples and organizing them in folders or binders so that the teacher, students, and parents could monitor student progress. Oftentimes these portfolios can become bulky and begin to take up space. There is also the problem with documents that are too large to be kept in a folder or binder (Abrenica).

Because of the digital age we are living in, electronic portfolios, or e-folios, have proven to be more popular and practical. Information and documents can easily be scanned and stored on a computer hard drive, floppy disk, CD, DVD, or any other storage media. This method takes up much less space and can be easily accessed. An electronic portfolio provides endless possibilities, which include voice recordings of a student reading, video recordings of student presentations, and pictures taken from a Science Fair awards presentation.

Once the portfolio entries have been chosen and organized, the electronic portfolio can be presented as a slideshow or uploaded as a website. This is where creating a portfolio becomes an active learning strategy because the students are encouraged to use their creativity (Valdez, 2001). The electronic portfolios can be enhanced with sound clips, music, graphics, and pictures, thus making it more appealing to those viewing the presentation. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC99FF;

-Penelope Valdez&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

An electronic portfolio not only encourages students to use their creativity, but also enhances their computer and technology skills. Students will be introduced to the use of computers, scanners, digital cameras, multimedia software programs, and web authoring programs. In the end, students will “feel a sense of accomplishment and empowerment by displaying, sharing and presenting their electronic portfolios to teachers, fellow classmates and parents” (Abrenica, p.1).



[http://seuss.wcs.sad40.k12.me.us/ep/samples/toc.htm[[Sample Electronic Portfolios]]]
These electronic portfolio examples provide entries from all subject areas on the elementary level. These are excellent examples of different types of media. Each student created their own personal website that reflects their personality. While I thought these were creatively and visually excellent electronic portfolio examples, I was disappointed that not every entry provided a personal written reflection from the student. I think a written reflection should be a requirement for every portfolio entry so that the students can analyze and reflect on their strengths and weaknesses.


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Portfolio Assessment Example&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

[[Image:portfolio_scoring.jpg|300px|right]]
Penelope Valdez is a seventh grade science teacher in Los Angeles, California. She requires her students to turn in monthly portfolio entries so that by the end of the school year they will have a total of ten entries in their portfolio. Her students may choose any of the topics covered during the given month and do the following:

“State and explain in detail what concept they have learned. Students should write this section in their own words, and it should be about a page long. Statements should always begin with
“I learned that . . . ” or “I learned how to . . .” Some examples include: I learned that high blood pressure afflicts African Americans more than people from other ethnic backgrounds; I
learned that HIV is called a genetic disease, not because it is a disease transmitted by inheritance, but because it is a disease that afflicts DNA, which is the building blocks of our genes; or I
learned how to use, handle, care, and store microscopes properly. . 
Create a product applying the concept they have learned with the purpose of presenting the science concept in an easy-to-understand way. For example, students could make a family tree
showing incidence of high blood pressure among relatives or have someone take photographs of the student properly using, caring for, and storing a microscope; and evaluate, judge, and critique a popular magazine article, print or TV advertisement, or overheard quote from the news or media. They must base their evaluations on the concepts learned, determine if the science in their selection is accurate or not, and explain their appraisal. (Valdez, 2001, p.2)”

Ms. Valdez is able to easily assign grades by basing her evaluation on the outline of what needs to be included in each entry. Figure I illustrates a sample of her scoring guide. For the first part she looks for “accuracy of the concept written about and makes sure the explanation of the concept is written in the student’s own words. The extent and depth of any extra research is also considered. For the second part of the entry, the level of originality and creativity is evaluated. For the third part, I look for originality in the student’s choice of an article or other media example, while also evaluating the role science plays in the student’s choice and the soundness of the student’s critique of the piece. (Valdez, 2001, p.2)”


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Disadvantages of Portfolios&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

While portfolios are beneficial to both the teacher and students by having a positive effect on student learning, there are some disadvantages. A large amount of a teacher’s time is consumed to plan, organize, and grade each portfolio. Penelope Valdez states that she often finds herself spending as much as ten minutes grading each portfolio entry and writing comments on how the students can improve their entries (Valdez, 2001). There is also another time issue if the students are not used to using computers and technology. They must learn to use and manipulate digital media in order to complete their portfolio (Abrenica). This certainly takes time away from instruction in the classroom.


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Conclusion&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

Portfolio-based assessment offers an alternative to traditional, standardized testing. They allow the students to demonstrate their own skills of what they have learned rather than specific skills determined by test constructors (Blackbourn et al., 2004). Although portfolios are a lot of work and take longer to evaluate than a test, results reveal that portfolio assessment is well worth the investment. 


==&lt;font color=&quot;#800080&quot; face=&quot;Century Gothic&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Questions&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

I appreciated this article. I had no clue what portfolio assessment was before I read this article, but I'm glad I did because it sounds effective. You did a good job at explaining what a portfoloi assessment was and how it works. You provided clear examples as well. You showed your audience how it could be effective if implemented.

&lt;font style=&quot;font-weight: bold; font-size: 25pt; color: Orange; font-family: arial; letter-spacing: 1pt;&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;


Wouldn't it be great if a student could look inside their teacher's head and see exactly what is expected of them in order to get an A+ on a particular assignment or project?  Students actually can come quite close to doing this, all thanks to rubrics!  Many parents and students have probably heard the term &quot;rubric&quot; before without really knowing what it meant.  In this article, not only will this term be defined, but also the pros and cons associated with rubrics will be laid out.












&lt;font style=&quot;font-weight: bold; font-size: 25pt; color: Orange; font-family: arial; letter-spacing: 1pt;&quot;&gt;What is a Rubric?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;



If out of curiosity someone were to look up &quot;rubic&quot; in a source such as wikipedia, they would find that rubric comes from the Latin word ''rubrica'', which means red ochre or red chalk, and also that it has something to do with Medieval illuminated manuscripts.  But if one was wondering what is a rubric in today's sense of the word and in relation to education, then that probably is not going to be helping out much.  According to Heidi Goodrich, an expert on the subject, a rubric is &quot;a scoring tool that lists the criteria for a piece of work or 'what counts.' &quot; (What is a Rubric?, 2008)  Essentially, a rubric is a checklist that the student can use to make sure they are accomplishing what is expected of them, as well as help teachers grade much more efficiently. Rubrics are typically used as a scoring tool for constructed response items, as well as performance-based tasks. (Scoring Rubrics, 2006)  Rubrics can be categorized as holistic or analytic and generic or task-specific, and some even combine aspects from more than one.  Holistic rubrics judge the student work as a whole and are less specific. Teachers find these much quicker and easier, but they give less feedback. Analytic rubrics look much closer at specific parts of the students work and are more precise. (Kidd, J. 2008)  These rubrics are very helpful to students because they give very specific feedback, but are more time consuming for teachers to produce.  Generic rubrics are rubrics that can be applied to a variety of assignments, as long as they fall under the same objective or objectives. (Scoring Rubrics, 2006).  They can be very helpful in observing student progress over time and with formative assessment.  Task- specific rubrics are designated to certain tasks and have more specific criteria that is to be met by the student.  This type of rubric is best with specific knowledge or skill targets that are not going to be assessed regularly. (Kidd, J. 2008)

•Helps the grading process become more efficient

•Helps faculty grade/score more accurately, fairly and reliably

•Requires faculty to set and define more precisely the criteria used in the grading process

•Supports uniform and standardized grading processes among different faculty members

•Clarifies quality expectations to students about their assignments

•Students are able to self-assess their own work prior to submitting it

•Students can understand better the rationale and the reason for grades

•Helps communicating grade between faculty and students

•Helps improve student performance, because they know what to focus on

(Advantages and Disadvantages of Rubrics, 2005).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 


Using rubrics have many advantages. Many experts believe that student work is much better when a rubric is made available to them.  Students know what is expected of them before hand, so it is easier for them to meet the objectives.  Rubrics are also beneficial for teachers.  They can make grading much quicker and also much more fair.  Teachers can also use a rubric they create on several assignment.  A teacher can also refer a student back to the rubric if they are not satisfied with a particular grade so the student can under why that grade was given to them.

•Development of rubrics can be complex and time-consuming

•Using the correct language to express performance expectation can be difficult

•Defining the correct set of criteria to define performance can be complex

•Rubrics might need to be continuously revised before it can actually be usable in an easy fashion

(Advantages and Disadvantages of Rubrics, 2005).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; 


Rubrics also come with some disadvantages.  Rubrics can be very time consuming to create and time is not something that most teachers have an excess of.  It also can be difficult for teachers to come up with the appropriate language for the rubric so that the expectations are very clear.  Sometimes, rubrics require much revision in order to use them easily.















&lt;font style=&quot;font-weight: bold; font-size: 25pt; color: Orange; font-family: arial; letter-spacing: 1pt;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;



In conclusion, rubrics come in many forms and can help both teachers and students greatly.  For teachers, rubrics can speed up the grading process as well as give them the opportunity to show students what they are expecting of them.  For students, rubrics can help clarify what they must achieve in order to get a good grade.  Creating rubrics can sometimes be difficult and time consuming, but overall, teachers and students both benefit greatly from them.

== Elementary Language Arts: Alternative Assessments ==
&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;Felix Titling&quot;&gt; by: Lauren Carson lcars003
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC &quot; face=&quot;Cambria&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;Cambria&quot;&gt;
Assessment is an important part of the United States school system. Tests are generally used to gather statistical data on how well students are doing and how well teachers are teaching material. The state, parents, teachers, and even students themselves want to be tested to know where they stand on a particular subject. The main focus of assessment should be that of helping all students acquire a better understanding of literacy and learning and not simply to evaluate if students have learned or if teachers are teaching correctly(IRA/NCTE). Through assessment students are able understand where they lack understanding, are having difficulties and know where they excel in academics. From a teacher’s perspective assessment helps him or her change their teaching style on a particular subject to meet the needs of students or confirm that a technique is beneficial to students. Let us take a look at two alternatives for Language Arts assessment at the elementary level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC &quot; face=&quot;Cambria&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Portfolios&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;Cambria&quot;&gt;
Portfolios are simply a collection of student works. In elementary setting students may be required to keep writing samples such as short journal entries and tests. This method of assessment is often considered a more concise method for the language arts because it gives an insight to student progression (Willson, Wright and Stallworth). Through portfolios give administrators and teachers an insight to students learning style and what specific goals the student may have in mind. According to Yih-Fen and Michael A. Martin a portfolio should be a joint effort of the child, teacher and parent. The student’s involvement should include selections of what he or she wants placed as an indicator of his or her work. Through this hand on selection the student is able to obtain an excitement for learning through the involvement. The teacher’s role in portfolio assessment includes note taking and field assessment. Teacher input in the portfolio process helps to back up the content of the portfolio chosen by the child. Assuming that work is sent home and completed outside of the school setting, parents need to understand what is being assessed  and placed into the portfolio so they can aid in the development of the child’s educational experience ( Chen, Maritin).
The disadvantages of portfolios can often be the same aspect that makes them beneficial. While allowing students to choose his or her work there is no standard to compare portfolios with, especially for those students not from the same school or state. Time also plays a factor into the disadvantages of portfolios. In order for a portfolio to be successful it must encompass work over a certain time span. If a student is expected to have a portfolio as a form of evaluation and has not been keeping work then a portfolio cannot be adequately formed or graded (Cullian, Galda, Strickland).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0066CC &quot; face=&quot;Cambria&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;u&gt;Performance&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;font color=&quot;#000099&quot; face=&quot;Cambria&quot;&gt;
Performance assessment requires student to actively show understanding of a subject through such mediums as plays, group activities or projects. For the language arts performance assessment can be very effective. As with any written language the spoken language must be evaluated as well. Through performance methods students are able to show that he or she can not only write or understand grammar in a written form but is capable of conveying what he or she knows orally. Through Oral assessment teachers are able to listen to how a student uses grammar, easily take note of problems with vocabulary that may not be as easily testable via paper and pencil (Cullian, Galda, Strickland).
Alongside the pros of performance assessment there also cons.  Performance grading can be very time consuming to observe each child rather than all students being assessed at a given time. As there is often few precise guidelines for performance, bias can easily become integrated in the assessment process ( Chen, Maritin).&lt;br&gt;

== '''Performance Assessment—Elementary Math''' ==

'''By Taylor Smith'''


== Learning Targets: ==

1.  After reading this article the student will have a better understanding of how to implement Performance-Based Assessment in an Elementary Mathematics lesson.

2.  After reading this article the student will have a better understanding of a holistic rubric vs. an analytic rubric.

== What is Performance-Based Assessment? ==

Performance Assessment is especially important in mathematics as there are many processes involved in coming to a correct answer.  There are many levels in mathematics to build on.  For example understanding addition helps you understand subtraction Understanding multiplication helps you better understand division and so on.  Students must always “show their work” so the teacher knows they understand the process to getting there.  

The best way to decide how to implement performance assessment in a mathematics lesson is to fully understand performance assessment. 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;“Performance-based assessments ‘represent a set of strategies for the…application of knowledge, skills, and work habits through the performance of tasks that are meaningful and engaging to students’”(Brualdi, 1998). .&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


This sort of assessment helps the teacher by providing information about how the student applies knowledge as well as creating “additional learning experiences for the students (Brualdi, 1998)”

== Steps to take when implementing Performance-based assessment ==

The first step in implementing performance-based assessment is to define the purpose of the assessment.  The skill to be assessed, the level at which students should be performing, and the type of knowledge to be assessed are some of the things that need to be defined initially (Brualdi, 1998).  

The next step is choosing an activity with which to assess.  The two types of assessment that could be used are formal and informal (Brualdi, 1998).  During an informal assessment the student does not realize they are being assessed (Brualdi, 1998).  For example, if a unit on long division was being taught, after instruction, the teacher would give some problems to be worked on in the classroom.  While students are working on these problems the teacher would walk around and check their work to see how well they understood the lesson.  In doing this the teacher would either write down or make a mental note of what students did not understand so it could be reviewed.

During a formal assessment the student is aware they are being assessed (Brualdi, 1998).  For example, during a unit on long division the teacher could give a pre-test after instruction.  Students would complete the pre-test and then they could exchange papers and be graded by their peers.  After grading the teacher could ask what questions were missed and then go over those problems step by step.  

The next step would be to create a performance rubric (Brualdi, 1998).  “As opposed to most traditional forms of testing, performance-based assessments don’t have clear-cut right or wrong answers.  Rather, there are degrees to which a person is successful or unsuccessful (Brualdi, 1998)”.  This is especially true for mathematics.  Once again we will use long division as an example.  If the student understands the process of long division but in doing the problem makes a multiplication or subtraction error, does that make the answer 100% incorrect?  No it does not.  This is where designing scoring rubrics for your classroom comes into play.


== Holistic vs. Analytic Rubrics ==


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;“Rubrics are…formally defined as scoring guides, consisting of specific pre-established performance criteria, used in evaluating student work on performance assessments (Mertler, 2001)”. .&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

There are two types of rubrics which can be used: holistic and analytic (Mertler, 2001).  A holistic rubric scores the process as a whole where the analytic rubric scores separate parts or steps of a problem and then totals the score (Mertler, 2001).  

Holistic rubrics are normally used when there is room for error as long as the overall outcome is correct.  They can be used when there the answer is somewhat definitive (Mertler, 2001).  Holistic rubrics provide limited feedback to the student as it is an overall answer that is required and are mostly used for summative purposes (Mertler, 2001).  

“Analytic rubrics are usually preferred when a fairly focused type of response is required; that is, for performance tasks in which there may be one or two acceptable responses and creativity is not an essential feature of the students’ responses (Mertler, 2001)”.  The use of analytic rubrics can result in several scores which can slow down the grading process (Mertler, 2001).  Click this link to see a general example of an analytic mathematics rubric.[http://web.archive.org/web/20060221073502/http://www.exemplars.com/rubrics/math_rubric.html] This generic math rubric is a great example of something that could be re worked to use for a specific math subject.

== Conclusion ==

In elementary mathematics it is imperative students are assessed formatively as well as summatively.  Once again, there are so many facets of math that build on to one another.  Something that is not understood or missed by a student can affect them throughout life.  During my elementary years I did not grasp measurement and to this day, at almost thirty years old I still have trouble with measurement.  It is minor but if something important is missed it could have a dangerous domino effect on your student’s future education.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The reasons for needing alternative assessment for students
&lt;li&gt; Advantages of using performance assessment in the classroom
&lt;li&gt; Learning the differences between homemade performance assessments and retail boxed cirriculums.&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



As a teacher-in-training, I often imagine myself leading my future students through the curriculum.  Before beginning any formal teacher preparation classes, I intended to use many of the same techniques in my classroom that were used by my grade school teachers, including lecturing, the occasional pop quiz, and end of chapter testing.  However, as Michael Kamen describes the transformation that elementary school science teacher Virginia made, other student teachers and I soon realize that the traditional assessment method of “teaching first and assessing second” may not give the best opportunity for all students to express their knowledge for credit(Kamen, 1998).  


Coursework for elementary science has changed over the past few decades, specifically the past 10 years after U.S. students continue to fall below the high scores of Asian students in math and science on standardized tests (Ramirez).  During his campaigning in 2008, President Obama expressed his desire to make math and science education a priority during his term in office, with some schools already trying to accomplish this by using text books from Singapore (Ramirez).  High emphasis has been placed on students' math and science scores.  For these reasons, researches are looking for ways to assess students’ science achievement in the classroom that is different from the measurements taken by national, state, and local associations (Baxter).  


Old fashioned scoring methods of science achievement have several problems in modern science education.  While students need to be familiar with and know strategies for selective response testing due to the many standardized tests they are subjected to in public schools, many children have a difficult time taking these tests.  Multiple choice tests often limit students to choose one of four options that are written in a different language than what the student can understand or relate to (Kamen).  


One way to better measure achievement of science students is for teachers and school administrators to implement alternative assessment practices in the classroom.  Alternative assessments to measure student achievement in elementary science can include creative drama, student portfolios, oral presentations, and performance assessments.  Teachers watch students performing experiments as individuals or in small groups or during presentations and assign them a grade or points based on certain criteria.  


Alternative assessments benefit teachers and students in a classroom by acting as a “bridge between content areas”, such as assigning writing projects in science class (Kamen).  Another major advantage is the “interplay” between student assessment and teaching techniques (Kamen).  

There are two ways to implement performance assessment in the classroom:  1)homemade techniques that are individualized by the teacher and customized to his or her students abilities and 2)out-of-the-box pre-developed classroom cirriculums.

Homemade assessment techniques require minimal cost. Examples of homemade assessments are student-written notebooks or laboratory journals or logs, oral presentations, and student-written questions for traditional tests.  

Out-of-the-box cirriculums can be expensive when purchased, but some are available to all for free, such as[http://www.lhsfoss.org FOSS: Full Option Science System].  FOSS has two major studies occurring including ASK Project:  Assessing Science Knowledge and FAST Project:  Formative Assessment for Science through Technology.

&lt;font color=#C35817&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
- Parents and concerned citizens, like Toni Jenkins of TX who commented to U.S. News and World Report's online newsstory ''Study: U.S. Trails Asian Countries in Math and Science,'' are bitter towards the large amount of standardized testing given to public school students.

== Learning Targets ==
Readers will be able to identify different assessments used for  physical education

== Introduction ==

Assessments are very important to the learning process.  With the use of assessments it allows for teachers and students to see how they are progressing in particular subject areas.  Is the student learning the correct information and retaining it well? And is the teacher giving effective lessons that allow the student to learn and understand? These are two of the main questions that revolve around the idea of assessments. 

When looking at subjects other than the basic math, English, history, and science, how do teachers assess their students?  As for physical education there are a few assessments used to see how well their students are doing with specific motor skills or sport activities. 

== Physical Education Assessments ==


In physical education it is very important for students to be assessed by the teacher and themselves. This way students and teachers can see where the student may be physically with different skills and activities.  “The most widely-used assessment in PE are fitness test”. (Jefferies, Jefferies, and Mustain, 1997)  With fitness test teachers take the scores from each student and compare them to a table of norms and from that students are given a rating. (Jefferies, Jefferies, and Mustain, 1997) Many teachers have their students perform fitness test at the beginning and end of the school year to see what progress the student has made throughout the year.  Along with that main assessment, there are other assessments that are used for other motor skills and sport activities.  According to Melograno, in his article “Integrating Assessment into Physical Education Teaching,” the author goes into the different techniques for assessment that a physical education teacher can consider using for their class.  

The different assessment techniques are good when assessing other aspects of a physical education class.  The techniques are as followed: teacher directed, peer, self, and portfolio assessments.  For the purpose of elementary students the best techniques to assess their performance is teacher directed assessments and self-assessments.  Peer and portfolio assessments would work better for secondary schools, because they require more responsibility than most elementary students would be capable of doing. 

The teacher directed assessment is split into achievement test which “are usually designed to measure perceptual motor skills, motor ability, physical fitness, and sport skills, observational inventories- which provide a record of students’ cognitive motor and affective behavior through checklists and rating scales, and written test- which provides a direct measure of knowledge and higher order abilities like application and synthesis.” (Melograno, 1997)

The self-assessment, “students make critical and valid assessments of their own abilities. Performance is compared to individual target goals, peer standards, teacher established criteria, or all of these.” (Melograno, 1997)  Here students have the opportunity to critique themselves on their performance and set goals they would like to reach. 

These assessments are mainly based on performance, where teachers “require students to demonstrate specific skills and competencies rather than simply selecting one of several predetermined answers to a question.” (Hensley, 1997) By using performance-based assessment the students are able to exhibit their skills learned and they can assess themselves as can the teacher, by using both techniques mentioned above. 


== How to use Assessments==

These assessments are also used to not only work on the progress of students but to improve the teaching of the different motor skills and sports.  There are a few steps in using assessments to help with program structure and they are “ Step 1: Identify what students are expected to achieve as a result of instruction in each grade, Step 2: Standardize assessment procedures and instruments, Step 3: Validate assessments, Step 4: Aggregate results, and Step 5: Act on results.” (Allen, 2002) And as teachers take these steps at the end of the year they themselves are able to assess how their instruction went and from there improve on it.   Setting certain standards for the different grade levels and putting together a rubric to follow helps with this process.  

As a teacher you want to make sure you are able to break down the steps of different skills just enough that you and the student are able to record/follow the progress. (Jeffries, Jeffries, and Mustain, 1997)

&lt;th&gt;Generic Scoring Rubric&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Score&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demonstrate mastery of sport specific skills and ability to consistently perform with little or no conscious effort resulting in few errors.  Extensive knowledge base and understanding of sports or activity. Employs effective strategy specific to the task or situation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5-Excellent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demonstrates competency and ability to perform basic skills without making many errors.  Complete understanding of rules and strategies of the specific sport or activity.  Usually selects appropriate strategy and skill for situation and generally displays consistent performance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4-Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Displays basic knowledge of sport or activity and ability to perform fundamental skills adequately to be able to play game. Performance is frequently inconsistent, resulting in numerous errors being made. Understands basic strategies, but lacks ability to effectively employ.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3-Satisfactory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demonstrates inability to perform more than the basic skills. Has difficulty in executing even the basic skills, making frequent errors, some critical, during performance.  Generally inconsistent performance with only a minimal understanding or strategies and rules.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2-Fair&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rarely, if ever performs skills well enough to be able to play a meaningful game.  Demonstrates little understanding of sport or activity and inability to execute skills without making significant and frequent errors. Makes little attempt to adjust performance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1-Poor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
(Hensley, 1997)

Using a model such as this would be good for a PE teacher assessing skills and even knowledge.  For example a PE teacher can have his or her students  play a game of baseball and pay attention to how each student responds to the different task and skills of the game.   When batting, the student knows where to place their hands on the bat, how to stand, and where to place the bat.  The students understand the concept of a strike and ways that's players get out. Each of these areas can be assessed by using a rubric.  Some students may understand a little more or a little less than what is expected.  By using a generic rubric such as this one helps the teacher have a good idea of how and what the students are taking in.

Assessing students in physical education is important and there are many ways to assess, its up to you as a teacher to choose which assessment is best for the activity.

'''Why We Teach Art ?''' 

In order to assess art you must first understand why we teach and make art. Art is a means to engage all students senses
for learning and expression. Creating art helps children express their imaginative and emotional personal development. Art lessons contribute to the cognitive development and their critical thinking skills. Art is crucial in helping students to understand and explore their world  and develop their own abilities to function in it. Art exposes students to world cultures, individual expressions, visual symbols, and it helps them to develop their own preferences, and it makes them aware of influences in society. Art has the ability to integrates all major subjects : Math, Science, Social Studies, History, Language Art, and Technology. Students enjoy art classes because it allows them to touch on experiences not addressed in any other classes. In art, students can express opinions and ideas that are uniquely different then their peers.In art there is always more than one way to achieve excellence. According to Elliot Eisner
&quot;the arts teaches children: to make good judgement, that problems can have more than one answer, the arts celebrate multiple perspectives,the art teaches that in complex forms of problem solving are seldom fixed, the arts makes vivid facts that neither words in their literal form nor numbers exhaust what we know, the art teaches students that small differences can have large effects, the art teaches students to think through and within a material, the art enables us to have experiences no other source has the capability of.&quot;(Eisner,2006)

'''&quot; Learning to draw will put you in touch with a long respected tradition that begins in Prehistoric times. Drawing remains a natural way for creative people to visually express their attitudes about the world around them. 
'''Wayne Enstice and Melody Peters&quot;'''''



'''Art Evaluations'''

Creating art objectives and evaluations usually consist of two parts examining artwork during the process and after artwork is completed. There are several ways a teacher can monitor the students progress, which might include : examining the students projects in art portfolios, engaging students in written and verbal critiques about their artworks and their peers artwork, and assessing learning in student and in art journals. Art Portfolios are a collection of student artwork representing  a selection of different performances. Art portfolios showcase students accomplishments and progress through various stages of art production. Art Journals are like mini art diary's they contain sketches, art thought process,  and students own views and interpretation of certain lessons and art vocabulary.Portfolios are a great way to assess and demonstrate improvement over time.


 The website below has examples of art Evaluations www.mmwindowtoart.com/evaluations.html


'''&quot;Defined Objectives&quot;''''''

Defined objectives are important to meet standards and provide assessments of performance. All students need to be clearly informed of objectives and grading rubrics on every lesson. A Rubric is a grading chart it has specific details on what is be evaluated. For example most art rubrics give you: O is for Outstanding artwork done with no help 100-95% , V is for Very Good Work with little help from Teacher 90-86% ,S is for Satisfactory basic artwork 85-76% no real thrills , N is for Needs Improvement 75-69% did just enough to get by , U is for Unsatisfactory 68% and lower did not master much of the lesson. A art rubric usually states specific goals of the project. For example student will learn to mix paint from dark to light within a grid. You can look at the grid and tell if the students have the same five to six colors you gave them, or if they experimented and made some shades and tints of those colors by mixing the paints with white or black.Stating specific objectives allow students the ability to achieve these goals.The Following website list art rubrics http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/rubric3.html .Many state and local systems set broad goals. These goals are set by the National Art Education Association that are recommended for standard based art instructions.The following website has the National Standards for Dance, Music, Theater, and Visual Arts 
http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/teach/standards.cfm .


'''Art Objectives and Assessments'''

There are many different ways to evaluate art lessons. Many teachers objectives reflect their personal values about art education,their teaching styles and their students age and ability. All art teachers teach a specific skills that you build upon and expand into more quality artwork.Too many directions at once may confuse younger students and students with ADHD or special education requirements. Wise art teachers expand lessons to cover more than one class meeting. By expanding class lessons you gives students the opportunity and time to build up and reflect in order to master the skills. Mastery of skills builds confidence giving them a great piece as a end result in which they are proud of.No  teacher teaches with the hopes of students to become failures . Many art teachers use performance-based assessments.Performance based assessments require students to perform or demonstrate a task. Most art grades are based on artwork , art learning  and can be based on some extent on test results. ''There are five main art objectives 1.Production 2. Perception 3. Critcism 4. Aesthetics and 5. Art History.'' Art Production is the process of making or producing art. Art Perception is how students see and digest what they are doing , looking at, or learning. Art Criticism is the students ability to point out evidence and make connections to the artwork that supports their perception. Art Aesthetics in the students questioning &quot; Why&quot; . For example if you show students a pieces of artwork that they find to be ugly or weird ? Why do you think this is ugly ? Why do you think this is weird ? This is a example Aesthetics. Art History is the study of past art masters, ancient civilizations, valuable objects from various cultures,and artifacts.


'''Types Of Formal and Informal Assessments'''

&quot;Through educators often think the primary purpose of assessments is grading, a thorough assessment plan ,consist of a variety of eveidence on student acquisition of learning&quot; (Rohrer,2009) Informal assessments is the teacher assessing who is grasping a lesson and who is not. As a class progress a teacher can tell who is engaged in art production and who not by looking at students. Teachers can quietly talk to students and give them some encouraging words, demonstrate a technique they can try, and also make mention of the overall rubrics and goals and objective timewise. For example by the end of this class we should all have our background sky painting in, when we meet again we will be filling in details of the landscape and will not have any sky colored paint available. Formal assessments are vital to gain information for educational decision making to revise programs and increase grades.&quot;In recent years, policymakers have been reassessing their conception of teacher quality by beginning to focus attention on examining the relationship between the assessment of the teacher competence and student achievement.&quot;(Randall,2005) Verification of student learning is the main reason for formal assessment. Assessments help teachers evaluate their programs, diagnose learning,revise,compare,and anticipate educational needs and determine if needs have been achieved.These assessments also help determine how to  adjust lessons to increase student learning. Assessment informs teachers if they need to shift instruction strategies to reach more students.&quot; Instead of using traditional assessment,such as standardized test, many teachers are choosing to use performace based, authentic assessment to measure the quality of an eduaction program by comprehensively examining the individuals performance&quot;(Yauying,2004).


'''Conclusion'''

We teach art to help students explore the world around them and find their place in society . Art asessments have been performance based and are starting to influence other subjects to include more performance based activities instead of just quizzes and test.By reflection on different types of art assessments, and how teachers can use art portfolios and art journals to see what students have digested the lesson or not. Assessments are not just used for grades but also needed to inform students and teachers of progress and what may need to be retaught or reworked strategy wise to close the gap between successful students and unsuccessful students.In conclusion good assessments evaluates and summarize both student learning and teachers effectiveness.Art mimics much of society it is constantly changing and evolving.

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==
Secondary English is definitely not one of the easier subjects to assess. There could be several different answers for one assignment and it is up to the teacher to decipher those answers according to his or her rubric. History, science and math are easier in the sense that there is always one answer. English, especially secondary, allows for multiple answers, all differing. Although memorization and comprehension is used in all subjects, it lends itself more to the sciences and history compared to secondary English. Reading comprehension, interpretation and writing are somewhat harder to assess because students create the pieces of work and that work is graded via a general rubric the teacher has created.

(Classroom Assessment: Basic Concepts, 2009)
'''&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are three common assessments used by educators in the classroom; summative, formative and performance. Summative assessments are usually given periodically throughout a school year to determine at a particular point in time what students know and do not know. A lot of students and educators reference standardized testing, end-of-unit tests and end-of-chapter tests with summative assessments. The teacher is informed of the students' progress and learning at the end of a lesson plan with the summative assessment. They help evaluate the effectiveness of programs, alignment of curriculum, or student placement in specific programs. They are too far down the road to be used in classroom learning adjustment. Summative assessments are typically used after the classroom has taken a number of formative assessments. 

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Formative assessments inform both teachers and students about student understanding at a point when timely adjustments can be made, unlike summative assessments. They are typically associated with practice tests, quizzes and group work. They require a lot of student-teacher communication and interaction to ensure the student is learning and understanding the curriculum before they take the summative assessment. According to Robert Stake, &quot;When the cook tastes the soup, that’s formative; when the guests taste the soup, that's summative,&quot; (Earl, Lorna, 2003). 

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The third most common assessment used in education today is called the performance assessment. Teachers use this type of assessment to discover how a student, &quot;understands and applies knowledge,&quot; (Coyle, G., 2009). &quot;They can be used to evaluate reasoning, products, and skills that can be observed and judged using specific criteria. Tasks that have more than one acceptable solution often lend themselves well to a performance based assessment,&quot; (Coyle, G., 2009). Performance based assessments are being utilized more and more with students who show ineffective progression on standardized testing. A student who doesn't perform well on the SAT and ACT, isn't necessarily behind in education; they just might not test well. &quot;Many states are incorporating performance-based assessments into their standardized tests or adding assessment vehicles such as student portfolios and presentations as additional measures of student understanding. These rigorous, multiple forms of assessment require students to apply what they're learning to real world tasks,&quot; (How Should We Measure Student Learning?: The Many Forms of Assessment, 2008). 

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Listed below are other well-known assessments used in education today; the objective assessment, subjective assessment, self assessment and interactive assessment.

:::::*&quot;'''Objective assessments:''' Usually multiple choice, true false, short answer, have correct answers. These are good for testing recall of facts and can be automated.
:::::*'''Subjective assessments:''' The teacher's judgment determines the grade; essay tests. Essay tests take longer to answer, longer to grade and therefore only include a small number of questions, focusing on complex concepts.
:::::*'''Self assessments:''' Assignments that provide for quick student feedback. They help the learner check if they have mastered a topic, provide opportunity to measure learning progress, are usually voluntary and may allow multiple attempts, inform the learner, but not the teacher.
:::::*'''Interactive assessments:''' Designed to allow learner's to perform a task. Can be graded or not. Examples: students could conduct a virtual experiment rather than an experiment in a physical laboratory, language software might have sophisticated speech recognition software to provide feedback about pronunciation, creation of an online tool, such as a virtual instrument. Students could perform a song, and the software provides feedback about accuracy and timing.&quot;
:::::*(MSU, Virtual University Design and Technology, 2007). 

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Ways to assess Secondary English&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

English teachers are advised to always give encouraging feedback along with their suggestions. Handing back a student's work with red marks scribbled all over their assignment isn't encouraging for future assignments. &quot;Informative feedback should be provided rather than just a mark or grade. In addition to identifying areas where improvement should be made, teachers can write constructive and encouraging comments, as these motivate students to do well,&quot; (Curriculum Development Council and the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2007). There is no one &quot;universal&quot; way to grade an English assignment, each assignment is different. 

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Different works equals different grading:
:::::*&quot;When assessing an oral presentation, the emphasis can be put primarily on content and fluency.
:::::*When going through book reports, the focus can be upon learners’ ideas and personal responses.
:::::*When marking compositions, it is advisable to provide learners with comprehensive feedback on content, accuracy, appropriateness, presentation and organization.&quot;
:::::*(Curriculum Development Council and the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2007).

Teaching secondary English is an everyday challenge. Educators are constantly creating new ways to assess the children in their classes. Why? Because they want to involve their students and ensure that everyone is learning. Students in high school today are children of the Digital Age; they expect everything fast and are very hands-on learners. In the article, &quot;Beyond Reading Check Quizzes,&quot; by Diane Vanaskie Mulligan, a veteran high school English teacher in Massachusetts, we are given several examples of creatively assessing a high school English class. Mulligan says, &quot;By shifting the focus from making students prove they've done their homework to helping them engage with texts, teachers can set students up for success,&quot; (2008). Participation in structured discussions, one paragraph responses and &quot;the old-fashioned&quot; reading journal are just a couple of ways to heighten student interaction and grades without quizzes and tests, (Mulligan, 2008). Not only does this aid the teacher in the amount of work they are required to grade, it also gives the students the ability to learn creatively. 

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Calibri;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Another great way to assess a student in secondary English is through student portfolios and their development. A portfolio can be started at a young age; either in middle school and carried through high school or as a freshmen in high school. A portfolio can show a teacher and a student the progression and learning curve over a number of years. It's good for either short or long term use in the classroom and should include all written work, written assessments and published work, (Streich, 2008). &quot;Properly maintained portfolios contain student work that assists curricular evaluation, demonstrates individual student progress, and can be used in student placement,&quot; (Streich, 2008). Students can also use their portfolios to gain admittance into advanced placement classes in college along with entrance into that university.

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Secondary English Assessment vs Math &amp; Science Assessment&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==
Assessing a student in English class is much different than assessing a student in math or science. The biggest difference between English, math and science assessments is the ability to list one or more answers. In English you are expected to use your mind creatively. Students are expected to overly develop the plotline in an essay and are authorized to act dramatic while reading a Shakespeare play outloud in class. In math and science there is almost always one single answer, never any grey area. Unlike math and science, English allows students to cross into a lot of grey area depending on the type of assignment. Another key point that differentiates the two areas is &quot;do-over's.&quot; In a typical English class, students are allowed to turn in rough drafts and outlines of projects or assignments before receiving a final grade. In science and math, students are taught the lesson, they may have one or two homework or class work assignments and then they are tested. There are no &quot;do-over&quot; chances.

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==
No matter the subject you are assessing, assessment is always hard. Your job as a teacher is to honestly assess each student in your classroom. Teachers must have the ability to differentiate between their students and the types of assessments that work for them and that particular assignment. Assessing secondary English is definitely a challenge, but so is math and science assessment. They differ in the types of assessments used and how a teacher assess the assignment.

== Introduction ==


Mathematics can be a dangerous subject to teach.  It carries with it the connotation of being a cold and objective subject, with black and white answers.  People rarely tend to think of math as an art form or an adventure.  Teachers and students alike are guilty of this impropriety, neglecting math's mysterious and elegent nature.  The glory of math bravado and intense mental gymnastics gets traded for cold methodologies and mindless repetition.  Students fail to exclaim eureka and great scott as they conquer concepts and self.  Teachers fail to glow or shed tears when whispering delicious formulas and sacred teachings.  The goal of the math teacher must be to once again move the student to tremble with awe and excitement over this great subject.  But with growing pressure to meet the rigorous demands of quantitative standardized testing, how can one achieve this end?  How can one implement assessments so that they kindle a passion for math instead of smothering it?  The goal of this article is to help equip the motivated secondary teacher with tools that promote the understanding and appreciation of mathematics.



== General Guidelines for Creating and Using Assessments ==


Before going into specific methods and strategies of assessment, it is important to make a few notes.  Effective assessment does not come about by throwing together random assessment events as an after thought to lesson planning.  Assessment is an integral part of the teaching and learning process, and should be deeply interwoven into all classroom processes.  It can be used before, during, and after units and the course in general.  The vast majority of assessment need not be graded and may even given without the student ever having been aware of it.


Specific methods and strategies of assessment are also not beneficial in and of themselves, but are tools that require the teacher to develop skill in both administering the assessment and using its results.  Assessments should be developed from defined purposes and with specific goals for their outcome.  They can be used not only for evaluating student progress and understanding, but also to get students to think critically about what they are learning.  They can be used purely for gaining feedback so that a teacher may adjust their instruction.  And if one desires, they can even be used to make students recognize their own personal biases and misconceptions about mathematics.  One should clearly define what is being assessed and how this may be done efficiently and accurately for a diverse collection of students.

== Specific Methods of Assessment and their Related Strategies ==

===The Importance of Writing Assessment in Math Class===


This tends to be a form of assessment that gets neglected in math classes.  Because it seems irrelevant or time consuming, many teachers dismiss it without considering its benefits.  But there have been numerous studies that show a distinct correlation between strong math performance and the consistent use of reflective writing assessment (Evans 2008).  The process of writing about math requires students to critically think about specific concepts and to organize them into a coherent flow.  This helps the student to internalize specific ideas and promotes long term retention.  It also allows them to evaluate their own understanding of concepts (Stepanek 1997).  And since the students will have a better ability to express math verbally, they are likely to see improvements in reading math problems as well.


There are a variety of ways to implement this method.  There are a wide range of topics.  The students could be asked to write what they had learned at the end of the day, to explain how the concepts being discussed are used or reflected in every day life, or to compare and contrast current lessons with previous ones.  They could also be asked to reflect on what they enjoy about the material, what they find difficult about it, or to describe areas where the teacher is being effective or ineffective.  The style of writing can vary.  Journals, essays, and some open-ended questions are a few of the ways this can be administered (Stepanek 1997).


When using this method, it is important to be consistent and to provide feedback.  Consistency will help students become efficient in the writing process as well as promoting the processing of material as they learn since they will expect to have to write about it later.  Feedback is important to show that you are reading their articles and that you care about their opinions and ideas (Stepanek 1997).



===Making Math Practical===


Math has many practical and real-life applications.  There are two ways that this understanding can be beneficial to student learning and interest.  Many students already do math operations subconsciously in their daily lives without realizing it.  By expressing math concepts in everyday situations that students encounter, some of the fear that is tied to unfamiliar math terminology and symbols can be diminished by providing associations that will encourage retention.  Also, by polling students to find out common interests, lessons can be adjusted to present material in light of subjects that interest students.  Examples presented in this way develop an appreciation of the usefulness of the subject as well as improving interest and retention (Stepanek 1997).
[[Image:Konkretismus_(DSC04014).jpg|250px|right ]]

One of the challenges of teaching math is that one must overcome stereotypes such as math isn't useful in the real world.  Encouraging students to think about their future careers and explaining the usefulness of math within those fields can help combat a mentality of doing math simply to pass and graduate.  Math has applications in every field, including art, sports, the military, and most white and blue collar jobs to name a few.

===Observation===


Observations within the classroom setting can be very useful for getting feedback on student strengths and weaknesses.  This can be done in a variety of ways, such as checking individual students as they work, observing group work, and having students perform problems in front of the class (Stepanek 1997).

===Oral Assessment===


Oral assessment is strategy many teachers use, consciously or unconsciously.  Often it is simply asking students in a class for guidance while performing a problem in front of the class.  Oral assessment has the advantage of providing more information than a standard test normally will.  It gives real time feedback of student comprehension, helps diagnose misunderstandings and misconceptions of the material, reveals students' attitudes towards the subject, and effectively shows student comprehension of the material (Stepanek 1997).


Teachers can perform oral assessments through class discussions, individual interviews, focus groups, and student presentations to name a few methods.  Topics can include those listed for writing assessments as well as a range of questions with quick or obvious answers.  The teacher should have an idea of the questions that will be asked ahead of time, while leaving room to expand more into specific areas that prove valuable.  It is important that students feel comfortable and safe to speak openly and make mistakes.  The more routinely this style of assessment is administered, the more comfortable students will be with it.  Common mistakes to avoid when performing this assessment are giving students answers or suggestions, posing leading questions, excessive talking/teaching by the teacher, and interrupting the student(Stepanek 1997).

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


Getting students to do math homework has always been difficult.  One strategy to encourage students to complete homework is having open-homework quizzes, where students may use homework assignments as help on quizzes.  Without announcing which quizzes will be given this way, students are more likely to complete random homework assignments they might not do otherwise.

===Computer Administered Assessment===


Some schools administer the SOL test on computers only.  Students doing math problems on the computer for the first time tend to experience a great deal of difficult compared to solving the same problem on paper.  It can be extremely helpful to get students familiar with doing math problems on the computer before this kind of complication occurs.



===Portfolio Assessment===


Portfolios are collections of student work demonstrating student comprehension of material.  They can be put together from existing assignments as a sample demonstrating student strengths and weaknesses.  Or they can be a selection of works from among a number of assignments for the purposes of grading.  Portfolios may be done as a supplement to normal classroom grading systems but can also be done in place of them (Stepanek 1997).



===Non-Standard Grading Techniques===


Another method of math assessment involves modifying the common grading system.  Graded tests require that material on the test is such that the student will recognize and be able to complete the problems given.  Unique and challenging problems that push students abilities too far would be unfair.  Also, if a student does poorly on a few tests, even if by the end of the course they comprehend the material they cannot get a good grade in the class.  Since the goal of the course is for the student to learn the material, some modifications can be made to the grading system that can have a variety of effects.  For example, if students know they can retake a test they did poorly on, there will be less testing anxiety to get a high score the first time around.  Testing anxiety can cause a student to do poorly on a test they are actually capable of doing well on.  Another option is flexible grading, where students are graded on different assignments that they can choose from to accommodate different learning styles.  This type of system could also accommodate self learning because students would have more freedom to work far ahead of the rest of the class (Murphy 1999).

== A Sample Math Assessment ==


[http://www.math.siu.edu/finals/086-fall08/107webfnl-086.pdf]Intermediate Algebra Final Exam


The sample provided is a final exam for intermediate algebra.  It consists of almost all short answer questions, allowing for partial credit based on work shown.  At the end it provides several problems from which the taker can choose three.  This is a good assessment because it tests accurately whether or not the student knows the information.  If this were not a final and it was being given back before the end of the course, the teacher would be able to provide useful and specific feedback to the student, as well as being able to shape lesson plans based on how the class had done as a whole.

&lt;u&gt;'''Traditional Assessment'''&lt;/u&gt;

Traditional assessment is the evaluation of student learning using traditional methods of achievement collection.  Most traditional assessments are developed to determine a students understanding and recollection of events after the instruction has been delivered.  Typical traditional assessment tools consist of fill-in-the-blanks, true-false, multiple-choice tests, matching and other similar mechanisms.  Students typically are required to select an answer or recall information to complete the assessment. These tests may be standardized, such as the Stanford 10, NAEP, Benchmark, AP and SAT tests as well as the Virginia SOLS.  Traditional assessment tests do not, by definition need to be as structured or inflexible as these more familiar state and national tests.  Teachers can create their own evaluation tools that follow the traditional methods of assessment.

'''&quot;Whenever the people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government;... whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they may be relied on to set them right.&quot; --Thomas Jefferson'''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The driving force behind traditional assessment is the theory that the primary goal of schools is to help shape and develop productive citizens.  This theory is used to formulate objectives whose goal is to develop historically literate individuals who are able to identify historical figures, events and dates.  Many traditions assessment tools do not focus on the subject of history.  The Stanford 10 is a traditional assessment tool that focuses on Reading vocabulary and comprehension, data analysis and math problem solving.  SAT scores also focus on math, reading, and writing fundamentals.  The NAEP, however is a national assessment that focuses not only on math, reading and science; but also civics and US history.  A copy of the recent US history results can be found at: &lt;u&gt;''http://nationsreportcard.gov/ushistory_2006/''&lt;/u&gt;.  The Virginia Standards of Learning have elements of history and in 4th grade Virginia history is assessed.  
&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#B22222&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;u&gt;Performance Assessment: Goals and Advantages&lt;/u&gt;'''
&lt;BR&gt;

Performance assessments, which are also often called &quot;authentic assessments&quot;, provide for a teacher to evaluate knowledge through the use of engaging activities.  Students are not forced to complete multiple choice questions, instead they are asked to construct, record, display or explore topics through presentations and writing.  Those instructors who use performance assessments require students to not only memorize information, but more importantly encourages them to synthesize knowledge through data collection, reflection and constructive assignments.  Students are asked to analyze and explain historical events through research and the development of journals, projects, and other demonstrable means.

Students are often asked to use their current knowledge to come up with theories or solutions to hypothetical situations.  Typical questions may include, &quot;How would life in the South after the Civil War been different if President Abraham Lincoln had survived his assassination?&quot;  The students may be asked to create a journal as a southerner in the years following the Civil War under President Lincoln's reconstruction policies.  An Instructor may ask the students, &quot;How did Pasteur and Lister change how doctors performed medicine?&quot;  The students could create a play of a debate between doctors of the 18th century and late 19th century.

Often performance assessments include extended tasks and assignments that require ongoing research and collection of data that is carried out over several hours or weeks.  This form of assessment is widely used to develop a students ability to synthesize information into creative writing assignments.  Journals and portfolios are often created by the students to demonstrate their learning acquisition as well as allowing for presentations to their classmates.

Where traditional assessments may ask multiple choice questions about a particular subject matter, performance assessments allow teachers to assess not only acquired knowledge, but also the ability of students to create brochures, oral presentations and essays.  Unlike traditional assessment, students are fully aware of how they will be assessed and what they need to accomplish to be successful.  This allows the students to judge their own work as they create their projects.  Performance assessments are based on the particular curricula of a specific school system and classroom.  Unlike traditional assessment whose tests are created by anonymous administrators and test producers, performance assessments are created and developed by the teachers in the classroom.  Performance assessments allow for scaffolding of knowledge and not simply learning random facts without context. 

Instructors that use performance assessments need to create a rubric with which to judge the students successful completion of the assignments.  One of the criticisms of performance assessments is the random nature of the grading.  Traditional assessments are often created and graded by national or state organizations.  To effectively use performance assessments the rubric needs to be created, explained to the students, and adhered to during the grading process.

'''&lt;u&gt;Performance Assessments in the Social Studies Classroom&lt;/u&gt;'''

Performance assessments can easily be incorporated into history and social studies classes.  Unlike math and science courses writing and presentation assignments are easily interwoven into the curriculum.  Some examples of how one might use performance assessments in an American history course might include splitting the students into groups.  Each group would be given the names of eight US Presidents.  The group would be given the opportunity to do independent research through the computer lab and library to determine the success of their assigned Presidents.  The rubric for assessment would clarify to the students that they should judge each President on specific qualities such as accomplishments, crisis management, political Skill, appointments, character and integrity.  With this information the students would rate their eight Presidents and create a presentation to deliver explaining how they came to their conclusions.  Through this activity the students escape simply know which President was the 12th or 14th, or which President was in power during war.  The students add context and synthesis to simple memorization requirements.  The students will learn how to create presentations, respect differing opinions, and determine how to narrow, edit and refine their findings to support their opinions.  Each student in the class will learn more through the other classmates research then they would learn by memorizing book information alone.

Another example of performance assessment in American history would be to give the students the opportunity to describe how North America and the World would have been different if the South would have won the Civil War.  The essay and presentation would be judged on a rubric of content, clarity, continuity, creativity, and correct use of grammar.  This activity would promote the research skills of the students as well as their English writing proficiency.

If you give yourself a moment you could probably come up with hundreds of ways to use performance assessments in the classroom.  These assessments take a little more time in that you must create a rubric and explain the requirements to the class, but these assessments allow the students to develop their research, writing and presentation skills.  This benefits them much more than simply developing multiple choice and fill in the blank test taking skills.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt; '''Performance Assessment for Spanish''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;By: Brian Breshears&lt;/center&gt;


== Introduction ==

While studying a language there are a myriad of ways that a student may be assessed. Testing students on their knowledge of vocabulary or placement of accent marks by way of a written response test or a research paper are just a couple of options. The unique thing about learning a language is that it is meant to be performed. Reading and writing are important aspects of the language, but its true purpose is verbal communication. This chapter will explore options for performance assessment as it pertains to the Spanish language. 


== Learning targets ==

Reader will be able to identify two methods of assessing a Spanish student by way of performance.  


== What is Performance Assessment? ==

According to the Alverno College, which implemented assessments for its students in 1973, assessment is defined as the following:

• a process integral to learning 

• involving observation and judgment of each student's performance 

• based on public criteria 

• with self assessment 

• with feedback for student improvement of learning and faculty improvement of teaching 
(Albromeit, Accessed on 18, March 2009)

More specifically they define performance assessment as “Demonstration of abilities in action in the kind of integrated situation in which students would use them in their life beyond campus” (Albromeit, Accessed on 18, March 2009).

MS&quot;&gt;http://depts.alverno.edu/saal/ Performance Assessments are founded in a curriculum based on eight abilities &lt;center&gt;- &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

              
== Types of performance assessments ==

Getting students to speak the language is probably the most challenging thing about being a Spanish teacher. To get students started on a path to proficiency, a teacher must be able to remove the obstacles standing in front of them. One major obstruction facing the students is a fear of speaking in front of others. The easiest way to overcome this is through group conversation.
 
In group conversation the teacher splits the class into groups of two or three. In order to make the students feel comfortable about speaking another language in front of their peers, the teacher will create a template from which the students should follow in order to create their conversation. The groups are then responsible for creating a conversation in Spanish in their own words, but using the template as a road map for their conversation.  They will then present the final conversation in front of the class. Each student must use the vocabulary they have studied leading up to the presentation. 

This task promotes self education by allowing the students to speak about things that interest them, but also keeps them focused on a specific format for their conversation. A student is more likely to look up and retain words he/she doesn’t know when talking in front of his/her peers.  

Another assessment is an extended oral presentation. The teacher can give the student a written test in Spanish, have them memorize it and then present it in front of the class.  The Spanish teacher at Hugo Owen’s Middle School, Laura Agudelo, gives an example of this, “I find the Pledge of Allegiance works perfectly.  It’s short enough that it’s not too intimidating to memorize and it’s a text that is familiar to them” (Agudelo, 2009). According to Mrs. Agudelo the rubric by which she assesses her students is based on correct pronunciation and fluidity of speech.  The students feel comfortable with the text and it is also something they can practice in their homeroom every morning.


== Conclusion ==

Performance assessment can be very rewarding for both the teacher and students when used properly. It can also give students confidence to speak in front of others.

a. Ask them questions in the language and grade their competency.

b. Have them memorize the pledge of allegiance and grade their pronunciation

c. Assign them conversations and grade their fluency

d. All of the above


4. What would be an effective way for Mrs. Agudelo to reinforce a vocabulary list?

a. Have the students write them repeatedly.

b. Have students create conversations using the vocabulary list.

c. Stand in front of the class and yell the words until they get them

'''''The student will be able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of multiple-choice tests'''''


'''''The student will be able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of essay tests'''''


'''''The student will be able to provide an example of why multiple-choice or essay tests are used'''''


'''''The student will be better informed of the results produced by multiple-choice, essay, and other tests'''''



== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Throughout school, teachers and other education officials use tests to assess how much information that the students have absorbed.  This can be important in different ways depending on how the results will be used.  


Figuring out what students have learned in the classroom is an important issue in the education field (Swartz, 2006).  Teachers want to know that when they assess what their students have learned that the teachers are using an accurate assessment strategy that will mesh with their learning targets.  In the following information, the focus will be on affects of using multiple-choice, essay, or other tests along with why they are used.


== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''Advantages and disadvantages of multiple-choice tests'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Multiple-choice testing became popular in the 1900's because of the efficiency that it provided (Swartz, 2006).  According to Matzen and Hoyt, &quot;Beginning in 1901, the SAT was a written exam, but as the influence of psychometricians grew in 1926, the SAT became a multiple-choice test&quot; (2006).  Until recently, multiple-choice have been favored especially for SAT and ACT testing.  For many years now, the SAT test was used for mostly multiple-choice questions and has changed in the past few years so that it now includes an essay section. 


Other advantages of multiple-choice tests include how quickly tests can be graded compared to others.  There are machines that can quickly grade scantrons as well as bubble sheets that show right and wrong answers quickly for teachers when grading.  It is much more cost efficient than having to read over written answers which take time and possibly training depending on who is employed to grade them (Holtzman, 2008).     


Others may say that multiple-choice tests are hard.  In college, students have said that multiple-choice question tests are long, filled with many words, and very complicated (Holtzman, 2008).  Some argue that multiple-choice question  tests are based on testing the level of knowledge only and do not show a student's level of comprehension and application of information (Holtzman, 2008).  It is hard to judge on a multiple-choice test whether the student guesses the right answer or didn't get the answer right because they were confused and chose one of the other answers (Swartz, 2006).

== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''Advantages and disadvantages of essay tests'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Essay tests have started to become more dominant because of the results that come along with it.  Essay format questions contain a level of information quality that exceeds that of multiple-choice (Swartz, 2006).  According to Swartz (2006), &quot;They provide the opportunity to assess more complex student attributes and higher levels of attribute achievement&quot;.  Another advantage of an essay is that the teacher can clearly see what the student knows instead of being misconstrued with multiple-choice tests were students can guess the right answers.  A student that doesn't do well with test taking may find writing an essay to much more efficient rather than testing knowledge through multiple-choice.           


There are also problems associated with essay tests.  Administering essay test can be harder and be less cost efficient.  There is technology already available for grading multiple-choice tests that take up much less time then grading essay tests.  Essays cannot be ran through a bubble sheet optical reader machine that quickly grades scantrons used for multiple choice questions tests.  For a professor with over three hundred students, it is much more efficient to use multiple-choice tests than grade three hundred essays.  Communication is an important factor as well.  For a student that can not write well, they may feel at a disadvantage when being graded by writing an essay.  This could be true for someone with a learning disability.

== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''Other Factors to Consider'''&lt;/font&gt; ==

Bill Goodling, chair of House Education Committee 


  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



Multiple-choice and essay tests are not the only test out there.  The recently modified SAT test states that if you put the wrong answer you will have points taken off in the multiple-choice section.  This is an incentive to not fill in the circle unless the student knows the answer or is pretty sure of themselves.  There are also short answer tests and fill in the blank, but the most popular are the ones mentioned before.  


Other tests may show an excess of seven different multiple-choice answers to choose from.  The first three would be regular answers (A, B, or C).  The next three answers will be where a student can get half credit for the answer by choosing D (&quot;A or B&quot;), E (&quot;B or C), or F (&quot;A or C&quot;).  Then the student will not get full credit by choosing D, E, or F but half credit by being able to narrow the answer down to the two answers they are certain of.  The last choice would be G (I don't know).  There the student would get a one-third of the credit for being honest rather than no points for guessing a wrong answer (Swartz, 2006).

== &lt;font color=#009933&gt;'''Conclusion''' &lt;/font&gt; ==

In conclusion there are many advantages and disadvantages to both multiple-choice and essay tests.  The teacher should pick out what is more suitable according to the classroom.  Factors that would favor multiple-choice may be large class size, large amount of knowledge, technology already available for scantrons, less time for grading, and students with low writing scores.  Factors that would favor essay tests could include smaller class sizes, many student teacher aides to help grade, assessment of application and comprehension, and students with high writing scores.  Other tests are also being developed to bring the most from assessing students comprehension of information.

== &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;3399FF&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/font&gt;uestioning Questions ==

&lt;Font Color=&quot;3399FF&quot;&gt;Learning Targets and Goals&lt;/Font&gt;
* Identify types of multiple choice questions
* Define some guidelines for creating multiple choice questions. .

== &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;M&lt;/font&gt;ultiple choice questions ==


Multiple choice questions are questions with multiple specific choices.  The questions may have multiple correct answers or only one. 

&lt;Font Color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/Font&gt;

There are many positive points to multiple choice questions.  The questions are easy to grade and can even be done by a computer using a scantron system. Even with out a computer a teacher can grade a large amount of tests in a short amount of time allowing more time for teaching and planning.  They reduce bias as there is a finite right and wrong answer, all questions are graded on the same scale. Tests can even be graded with out any knowledge of who the student is. Questions can be formatted to asses a large amount of knowledge in a short time. The questions easily asses knowledge while allowing for application and reasoning questions as well.


&lt;Font Color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/Font&gt;

There are also negatives associated with multiple choice questions. The questions can be hard to form, and time consuming to create.  The questions have to be written to where every student can understand and come up with the answer.  Questions can leave no room for students to extend their answers. 


&lt;Font Color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;In the End&lt;/Font&gt;

Due to large class sizes and limited teaching resources multiple choice questions are the tests of the future.  It is very important for educators to learn how to create multiple choice questions that can test a wide range of student abilities.

== &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;990066&quot;&gt;C&lt;/font&gt;lassifying Questions ==
 
Multiple choice questions are classified in two ways. The first way is  how a question is asked, the second is what the question is asking.

&lt;Font Color=&quot;990066&quot;&gt;Form&lt;/Font&gt;

According to the teaching effectiveness program form the University of Oregon there are five types of multiple choice questions used to elicit critical thinking. 

*problem/solution evaluation - show how a student has responded to a problem and then choose if the response is appropriate.

*incomplete scenario - using a diagram or writing leave parts out of the whole and ask to fill in the blanks.

*case study - using an elaborate example or chart multiple questions can be created. 

*analogy - using two different elements to compare things.

*premise-consequence - requires students to determine outcome of a given problem.
(Cooper, 2000)


&lt;Font Color=&quot;990066&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/Font&gt;

Blooms taxonomy describes different learning targets physiological definitions as to what kind of information the question is asking. 

*Knowledge - the ability to memorize and recall.

*Comprehension - the ability to comprehend the jest of the material.

*Application - the ability to use knowledge in novel situations.

*Analysis - the ability to divide things into parts.

*Synthesis - the ability to create a novel idea from analysis parts.

*Evaluation - the ability to judge material.
(Carneson, Delpierre, and Masters, 1996)
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF99CC;
border: solid 10px #990066; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs List http://www.teachervision.fen.com/tv/printables/misc07/BloomsTaxonomyVerbs.pdf &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Each question style elicits different understandings of the material. Multiple choice questions Bloom found were mainly knowledge.  Educators looking to enrich students ability to problem solve and apply knowledge to everyday situations should focus on a more diverse testing. Synthesis by definition does not lean its self towards multiple choice questions.

== &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;660099&quot;&gt;A&lt;/font&gt;pplication ==

&lt;Font Color=&quot;9900FF&quot;&gt;Why is knowing how to ask questions and what questions ask important?&lt;/Font&gt;

A good test will have variety in the questions it asks as well as having questions that test the students skills. If a test is all knowledge questions than a student that has little knowledge of the topic but can recognize words might still be able to pass.  By mixing in application, reading, and analysis questions a teacher can more adequately reward students for their knowledge on the topic. In the box above there is a chart of Bloom's verbs can help teachers determine what a level of question a teacher has written.

A question should only have one answer that can be determined correct. When there are multiple right answers it can confuse even knowledgeable students.  Putting answers in alphabetical order will help limit patterns in correct answers. 

&lt;Font Color=&quot;9900FF&quot;&gt;Example &lt;/Font&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF99FFF;
border: solid 10px #9900FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;1. What caused World War One?

*a. Assassination of Franz Ferdinan.
*b. Democratic nations fear of Communism.
*c. Treaties of nations.
*d. Trade in global economy. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

All of the answers in the question can be considered causes of World War One making the question difficult to answer. If the question asked instead &lt;Font Color=&quot;9900FF&quot;&gt;What event sparked World War One? &lt;/Font&gt; it would lead student to pick A as the correct answer. 



&lt;Font Color=&quot;9900FF&quot;&gt;'''Carnet Reference system lists ten golden rules for writing multiple choice questions.'''&lt;/Font&gt;
*1. Examine only the important facts!
Questions should be geared towards the learning targets.

*2. Use simple language!
Errors can confuse students, the test should test the material not the students vocabulary.

*3. Make the questions brief and clear!
Getting rid of the fluff helps students understand what the question is asking.

*4. Form the questions correctly!
Bad grammar can set students off to a wrong answer. 

*5. Take into consideration the independence of questions!
Questions should not be able to be used to answer another question.

*6. Offer uniform answers!
Uniform answers in length prevents students from using answer construction from picking the right answer. 

*7. Avoid asking negative questions!
If you must use a negative question make sure to &lt;Font Color=&quot;9900FF&quot;&gt;'''''Emphasis NOT'''''&lt;/Font&gt; so as not to confuse the student.

*8. Avoid distracters in the form of &quot;All the answers are correct&quot; or &quot;None of the answers is correct&quot;!

*9. Distracters must be significantly different from the right answer (key)!
Wrong answers only a little different from the correct answer can confuse even intelligent students. 

*10. Offer an appropriate number of distracters!
More wrong answers means its harder to pick the right answer out randomly.

== &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;FF9900&quot;&gt;C&lt;/font&gt;onclusion ==

Due to large classrooms and limited numbers of teachers multiple choice questions are here to stay. Writing a question can require time and skills but there are a few important things to keep in mind when it comes to writing questions. It is important to keep questions simple, grammatically correct and aimed at the learning targets.


== &lt;font size=&quot;7&quot; face=&quot;Georgia, Arial&quot; color=&quot;0000CC&quot;&gt;42&lt;/font&gt;and the question is ==

1. Rules of writing a good answer includes all of the following &lt;Font Color=&quot;3399FF&quot;&gt;'''except'''&lt;/Font&gt; which answer?
*a. Always make sure the right answer varies throughout tests.
*b. Follow grammar rules for all answers when not testing grammar.
*c. Gear all questions to the learning targets.
*d. Use uniform construction to all answers. 

2. Questions involving splitting material into parts require what kind of thought according to Bloom's Taxonomy?
*a. About.
*b. Analysis.
*c. Knowledge
*d. Understanding


3. The question in the box below contains what kind of question.

----


&lt;font color=&quot;#005CB9&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Learning Targets

1. Readers should be able to fully understand what a rubric is.  

2. Readers will start to understand how rubrics can be assessed.  

3. Readers will learn how to use portfolios in a variety of class subjects.  
&lt;/font&gt;


== What is a Portfolio? ==
A portfolio has been defined as &quot;a purposeful collection of student work that exhibits the student's efforts, progress, and achievements in one or more areas, the collection must include student participation in selecting contents, and show evidence of self-reflection (Paulson 1991).  Rubrics have been used for several years in classes such as english and art, however are becoming more popular and are gaining more support in terms of assessment.  A portfolio is basically a way for a student to reflect work done, and perhaps see growth building learning provided by the student himself.  Portfolios are also used to be sent into some colleges or jobs, it provides an example of your current values and the way you make choices, without you even knowing it (Paulson 1991)! Assessment is becoming harder and harder with pressure on scaffolding and building learning for each individual.  A portfolio allows &quot;staff and students to understand the educational process at the level of the individual,&quot;  making the learning and assessment based on the individual and not the general class such as a test (Paulson 1991).  By learning more about portfolio and portfolio assessment, we as educated teachers can decide how they might be used in our own classrooms.    


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&quot;Portfolios allow students to assume ownership in ways that few other instructional approaches allow, it requires students to collect and reflect on examples of their work, providing both an instructional component to the curriculum and offering the opportunity for authentic assessments&quot; (Paulson 1991)  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;






&lt;/font&gt;

== Guidelines for Realizing the Power of Portfolios ==
Portfolios include the power to reveal a lot about their creator and their learning in a formal way (Paulson).  This power would not be useful if several key characteristics mentioned in the article &quot;What makes a Portfolio a Portfolio&quot; are not kept in mind.  First, the portfolio must allow the student to learn about learning, this makes them involved and actively aware of the process.  Second, the portfolio must be done &quot;by the student and not to the student,&quot; this helps the student to &quot;value themselves as learners&quot;.  Third, the portfolio is not a cumulative folder, the student must be concise in deciding what will go into the portfolio, not everything should be in there.  Fourth, the portfolio must contain the following parts, the rationale, intents of the student, contents, standards, and judgements as well as a reflection.  This will allow students to &quot;bring understandings and applications to the surface, thus encouraging metacognitive and reflective thinking (King 2008).  Fifth, work should be kept throughout the year with the portfolio in mind but may be sorted through before producing the final portfolio. This is a great chance for students to keep up with unfinished work.  Sixth, a portfolio may have multiple purposes but they should never conflict.  Seventh, the portfolio should have information that shows growth within the class period.  If there is no growth in a full year this may be a sign that learning did not occur.  And finally, these portfolios will not happen themselves, be sure to guide the students and give proper instruction to make this a learning tool and not a punishment or stressful activity.  

== The impact of Portfolios as a tool of Assessment ==
Portfolios are different than standardized tests.  Some argue that they are better, some argue they are worse.  Naturally two sides will occur.  The best we can do is to examine the characteristics of assessment and make the choice ourself.  Achievement tests can give outcomes which can be &quot;counted and accounted,&quot; yet &quot;portfolio assessment offers the opportunity to observe students in a broader context: taking risks, developing creative solutions, and learning to make judgements about their own performances. (Paulson 1991).  One of the problems of assessments such as tests or rubrics is that the student is only allowed statistics to be produced of their work, portfolio assessment is different.  The student puts so much into the portfolio, the teacher is almost an outsider looking in when they grade it, on tests or rubrics, the teacher is looking for something they wrote down to look for.  Portfolios allow a teacher to be taught on what might come out of the portfolio.  &quot;Portfolios provide an intersection between instruction and assessment and a means for the student to value themselves as learners, (King 2008) this helps students to be more positive and creative when turning in their portfolio which will thus produce a more satisfying grade.  Since a student may not know what to put into the portfolio, teachers can guide the student by giving them &quot;key assignments,&quot;  these allow students to &quot;write a metacognitive description explaining their thinking on how they showed the connections among theories&quot; (King 2008).  The key assignments are basically just main subjects from which a student can pick one of their works to relate to.  Using portfolios can strongly help assessment in the classroom.

== Ways to use Portfolios in a variety of classes. ==
Up to this point, you may have been thinking a portfolio is only useful in art.  But portfolios have been effectively used in many different subject areas.  There are different kinds of portfolios and perhaps by looking at them we can get ideas of which ones we might be able to use for which subjects.  A showcase portfolio &quot;displays the candidate's depth of knowledge and is a compilation of successfully completed work&quot; (King 2008).  A great example of this kind of portfolio would be an art portfolio including several pieces of work, or maybe a history portfolio containing maps or other related works, or perhaps a Spanish portfolio of different Spanish speaking countries and information about each.  Next there is a formative portfolio which &quot;illustrates a student's learning processes over time and demonstrates growth&quot; (King 2008).  An example of this type of portfolio might be an English portfolio containing papers, poems or other forms of literature.  Also, a math portfolio containing several examples of the main points of each chapter and how to do the problems step by step with the students comments on the best way to learn how to do this problem.  Either way you look at it, showcase or formative, a portfolio can be used in any classroom in multiple ways but still holds the same benefits of the assessment of it.  

== Example Portfolio Assessment ==
This is an example of a perfect portfolio assessment sheet/rubric.  By scrolling down to the &quot;Content Assessment Rubric&quot; we can see an assessment of a portfolio. (Click the one to go to the link) [http://www.samford.edu/ctls/Portfolio_Assessment_Rubrics.doc]  (Gonzalez 2004).  This is an example of a rubric to grade a portfolio keeping in mind the student's process of creating the portfolio and the individual.  It shows how a portfolio might be graded for not only completion but elements required for the full learning through using the portfolio to occur.  This is a good example because it does not only grade on content but also on what the student did to further their learning and how effective the assignment was and it even goes as far as showing the effectiveness of the learning outcomes.  This is a strong rubric with high expectations of learning to have happened in making the portfolio, a perfect assessment for this type of assignment.

== Conclusion ==
Portfolios have &quot;become a mechanism to guide our own individual practices,&quot; the students are learning how to learn and the teachers are being taught by what the students have learned.  By reflection on what a portfolio is, how it can be used, and its relationship to assessment, we as teachers can now start to form our opinion about using portfolios.  The way we use a portfolio will vary from class to class and subject to subject, but one thing will always remain the same, &quot;a portfolio provides a forum that encourages students to develop the abilities needed to become independent, self-directed learners,&quot; (Paulson 1991) and when they have done this, is our job of assessment not already half over?

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''By Lauren Kathryn Crawford'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Preparation, sweaty palms, anxiety over the results, these could all either be symptoms of a hot date, or of the dreaded t-word, test. In particular standardized testing which causes anxiety to everyone in the educational system from the President of the United States, to school boards, principals, teachers and students.

In the following article we are going to discuss the standardized testing, its' criticisms, the necessity for its' existence, and how to use the results as an instructor to help narrow achievement gaps.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;A principal from an Appalachian school in eastern Kentucky, 

&quot;There's a school eighteen miles down the road that has 80% 

of the kids on free and reduced lunch... and they are at a

Higher absolute rank,&quot; to his teaching staff, &quot;Don't bring up

to me about how our kids are disadvantaged. 'That dog won't 

hunt!'&quot;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Learning Targets'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;1. The student will be able to identify basic subject areas of standardized testing and understand how it is scored.

2. The student will be able to identify the arguments against standardized testing.

3. The student will be able to identify the benefits of standardized testing.

4. The student will be able to recognize some ways that results can help him/her as an instructor to help narrow achievement gaps in their classroom.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;Standardized Testing==

&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Since the 1970's, standardized tests have been the aim of much criticism in the United States, but their basic purpose is to serve as a measure or rule of preparedness in the early grades and mastery of core subject matter in later grades (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

School entry test  like the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised and The Stanford Binet- Intelligence tests are intended to determine the readiness levels of kindergartners entering schools (Rock, Stenner, 2005). These tests measure  the vocabulary and cognitive ability of a child(Rock, Stenner, 2005). Similar tests are conducted in groups or individually throughout the year and many of these tests are adaptive and measure progress,they are not static measures that result in either a passing or failing grade (Rock, Stenner, 2005). An adaptive test instead uses what is known as a floor/ceiling rule (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  This rule means that (in the case of vocabulary testing) a group of words will be easy for the student, falling below the floor, while a group of words will be more difficult for the student, above the ceiling (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  Throughout the year progress will dictate what level the ceiling and floor will move to (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

Other tests, like the SOL used in Virginia are used to determine mastery of core subject matter taught throughout the year (Bagin, 1994).  Generally, these tests measure understanding in mathematics, science, reading and writing (Bagin, 1994).  Some tests, the SOL is an example, are given at a predetermined time and scoring is based on either multiple choice, short answer or open response (Bagin,Stenner 1994). Another type of testing, used in states like Kentucky uses a portfolio system that students add to all year long in conjunction with a time allotted test at another time of the year (Wolf, Borko, Elliot, 2000).

All of these tests are graded on a percentile system (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  That is, how well the student does on the test in comparison with other students tested at the same grade level (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  For example, a student who scores in the 90th percentile has done better than 90 percent of other students taking the test (How Standardized Testing, 2009).  A student that test in the 10th percentile has only done better than 10 percent of his/her peers (How Standardized Testing, 2009).

Scores on these tests are used in a number of ways. Collectively, nation-wide these scores tell our president how well our students are doing as a whole and at the state level (Bagin, 1994). States allocate funding based on test results and individual schools determine which programs need more improvement (King, Houston, Middleton, 2000).  Teachers use these scores to evaluate their teaching methods and yes, these scores are also used at times to determine the readiness of students to continue to the next grade level (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;Criticisms of Standardized Testing==
&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;Opponents to current standardized testing techniques dislike test like the Peabody and the SOL for a number of reasons, but the two main arguments are against their reliability and what they see as racial bias existing in the questions themselves.

In order for a test to be deemed useful, it must above all else be reliable (Rock, Stenner, 2005). That is that results should be consistent (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  One way tests are measured for consistency is by doing sample runs with panels of a representative sample of students (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  Sample runs of the tests are conducted in two different ways:

1.  Two versions of the test with like questions are run.  If the test is reliable similar results should be yielded by both groups of test takers (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

2.  A single test is randomly and equally divided (Rock, Stenner, 2005).  This test is ran and reliability is determined by the similarity of these results (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

The results of these sample runs are measured in much the same way that standardized tests results are measured.  A rating of 90% means a test yields similar results 90 percent of the time while a rating of 10% would mean that the test yields similar results only ten percent of the time.

Because it is generally accepted that the range of achievement cannot be accurately predicted; a reliability rating of eighty-percent or more is seen as acceptable by national standards and critics disagree (Thernstrom, 1992).

Critics believe that if a test yields dissimilar results even only twenty percent of the time that the test could not possibly be measuring what it is intended to (Thernstrom, 1992(.

Other critics of the tests believe that they are racially biased for a number of reasons (King ''et al.'', 2000).  One basis for this belief is that the achievement gap between students of European heritage typically score much higher than minorities do (Thernstrom, 1992). One test for scholastic readiness showed that when test results were compared between students of European heritage and those of African descent, the former group scored higher seventy-six percent of the time, while the latter only scored higher twenty-four (Rock, Stenner, 2005).

On the other hand,some questions are viewed as being racially biased because they are deemed as culturally irrelevant (Thernstrom, 1992).  For example,  a question that asks &quot;What is the name of a baby cow?&quot;, is more relevant to someone growing up in a rural area than someone living in an urban one (Thernstrom, 1992).  Some critiques even believe that language tests are racially biased because they see one form of spoken language as correct while another form of the same language as incorrect (Thernstrom, 1992).

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;A Need For Change: The Case for Standardized Testing==
&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt; While both critiques and proponents of standardized testing could debate their sides all day, the need to assess students to determine both their progress and the progress of their teachers and schools is undeniable.

Standardized testing evaluates students early in their education on their readiness both scholastically and behaviorally (Rock, Stenner, 2005). Students and their parents are able to measure at least generally their progress and areas in which they need improvement (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

In older grades standardized testing measures where students rate in comparison with their peers and thus how the student and his teachers are doing (Bagin, 1994).  While these test do rate students according to how well they do on these tests, some schools have used these scores to reform their systems and in turn drastically improve their methods (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

Schools in economically devastated areas like the ones in eastern Kentucky, have under the strong leadership of their principals and the dedication of their teachers achieved higher ratings (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  One principal of such a school stated, &quot;there's a school 18 miles down the road that has 80% of their kids on free and reduced lunch... and they have made progress and are at a higher absolute rank.&quot; To his teachers this same principal would say, &quot; Don't bring up to me about how our kids are disadvantaged. That dog won't hunt.&quot; The latter part of the statement is a local expression he used in this case to mean that excuses would not help their school improve (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

Instead of making excuses, schools that have taken poor standardized testing results and used them to improve their schools, have used them more in how one principal put it, as &quot;stock market quotes.&quot;  They see poor results in one area as a flag to improve that department (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  They have teachers take classes in new teaching methods and they work together to see that their children improve (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

While the jury is still out on whether or not there is a better method of determining individual student progress.  The need for a common measure to compare students to bring about change is still more present than ever.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;How to use Standardized Testing Results to Bridge Achievement Gaps==
&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;So the question is, is if these test are not completely reliable, and if they are irrelevant to some students, how do we change that?

The answer: Be Innovative Forward Thinking Teachers!

The best teachers, one principal, stated were teachers that were in fact themselves learners (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  Actively seeking out new methods to add to and modify their instruction (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000). The teachers that work together with parents and their fellow students as well as counselors to understand individual needs (Wolf ''et al.''). Lastly the teachers that ignore the pessimism of others and raise expectation levels of their students and make the material relevant for those it might not other wise be ( Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

Several companies currently travel from state to state and hold seminars and lesson demos (Wolf, ''et al.'', 2000).  These seminars cover an array of matter from core areas like writing and math to how to incorporate technology into their lessons (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000). The attitude today is to work smarter not harder (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000). Teachers that attend these continuing education generally report positive feedback (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  One teacher reported after a lesson demo on writing where they had students add a reflection to a narrative assignment, &quot;I think what I've learned here is not something completely different from what I've been doing all together but adding to it. I'm really excited about this!&quot; Other lessons show teachers how to incorporate technology into their daily activities to make planning easier and to tie lessons together (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).

Also, schools seemed to do better when the idea of community was present.(Wolf ''et al.'', 2000)  At one school where major improvements have been said to occur a teacher spoke of how there was a concept of the students being the schools responsibility and not just the particular teacher that they happened to have that year (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000).  Dedicated teachers attend meetings sometimes daily with other teachers and counselors of the students to better grasp their backgrounds and particular predicaments (Wolf ''et al.'', 2000). 

Lastly, despite criticisms of standardized testing, the proficient teachers of today do not accept that their students have limitations, or are incapable of learning any given concept. Instead these teacher work hard everyday to make material relevant for their children and develop lesson plans that speak to individual lesson plans.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Tips to Narrow Achievement Gaps'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;
 
1. Ask parents to talk to their kids and explain 
the importance of education to them; that education is a 
necessary step to professional success in America.(In a 
study high achievers commonly had parents that expressed 
these views.)(Lee, 1994)

2. Assess students often to keep track of their progress 
and give encouragement throughout the school year.

3. Understand that poor assessments might be the result 
of language barriers or a stressful home environment, 
have a plan to address these types of issues(Lee, 1994).&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003300&quot;&gt;Questions==
&lt;font color=&quot;#006600&quot;&gt;1. A student that scores in the 90th percentile on a standardized test like the SOL has scored how?
     a)Better than 90 percent of his/her peers.
     b)Worse than 90 percent of his/her peers.
     c)Worse than 90 of his/her peers.
     d)Better than 90 of his/her peers.

2. Which of these is NOT a criticism of standardized testing?
     a)It is unreliable.
     b)Its' results can be used by teachers and the educational system as a whole to improve their methods.
     c)It is racially biased because it asks questions that are unrelated to some students' culture.
     d)It puts unreasonable pressure on students and teachers to do well.

3. A teacher has just reviewed the results from this years SOL.  She notices that even her students who received high scores in both the math and verbal seemed to fail to grasp long division. She should...
     a)Focus on verbal instruction since the students did well in that area.
     b)Use the same verbal instruction method year after year since that seemed to work and reform her long division plans.
     c) Reteach the lesson in long division and find a reliable teacher whose students did well on that part of the test for some ideas on how to improve her instruction.
     d) Give up, these disadvantaged kids are incapable of learning anything anyway!

4. A quiet, hard working young Asian student Chris Young is getting farther and farther behind in his studies and has done poorly on the reading portion of his SOL.  He refuses to go to after school help sessions and only socializes with other Asian students. All of the following might encourage this student to do better EXCEPT...
     a)Give Chris a sheet of resources that offer online help to students with language barriers.  Being online might reduce any embarrassment he may have in learning English as a second language if this is a problem he is encountering.
     b)Discuss his progress with his family. In some Asian cultures failure is seen as an embarrassment and Chris might not admit that he is having difficulty before it is too late.
     c)Create lesson plans that allow for group work so that Chris has a chance to socialize with different types of students and might be more comfortable with getting help.
     d)Ignore the issue Asian kids ALWAYS do better on things like standardized testing, this is obviously a failure of the test!

      <text xml:space="preserve">US submarines, as well as some British and Dutch vessels, operating from bases at Cavite, in the Philippines (1941–42) Fremantle and Brisbane in Australia; Pearl Harbor; Trincomalee, Ceylon; Midway; and later Guam, played a major role in defeating Japan. This was the case even though submarines made up a small proportion of the Allied navies — less than two percent in the case of the US Navy. Submarines strangled Japan by sinking its merchant fleet, intercepting many troop transports, and cutting off nearly all the oil imports essential to weapons production and military operations. By early 1945 the oil tanks were dry. The Japanese military claimed its defenses sank 468 Allied subs. Only 42 US submarines were sunk in the Pacific, with 10 others going down in accidents or as the result of friendly fire.


The torpedoed Japanese destroyer, Yamakaze, as seen through the periscope of an American submarine, Nautilus, in June 1942.
US submarines accounted for 56% of the Japanese merchantmen sunk; most of the rest were destroyed by mines or aircraft. US submariners also claimed 28% of Japanese warships destroyed. Furthermore, they played important reconnaissance roles, as at the battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf (and, coincidentally, at Midway), when they gave accurate and timely warning of the approach of the Japanese fleet. Submarines also rescued hundreds of downed fliers.
The Allied submarines did not adopt a defensive posture and wait for the enemy to attack. Within hours of Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt ordered a new doctrine into effect: unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. This meant sinking any warship, commercial vessel, or passenger ship in Axis controlled waters, without warning and without help to survivors. Allied submarine bases were well-protected by surface fleets and aircraft.
While Japan had a large number of submarines, they did not make a significant impact on the war. In 1942, the Japanese fleet subs performed well, knocking out or damaging many Allied warships. However, Imperial Japanese Navy (and pre-war US) doctrine stipulated naval campaigns are won only by fleet battles, not guerre de course (commerce raiding). So, while the US had an unusually long supply line between its west coast and frontline areas, and was vulnerable to submarine attack, Japan's submarines were instead primarily used for long range reconnaissance and only occasionally attacked US supply lines. The Japanese submarine offensive against Australia in 1942 and 1943 also achieved little. As the war turned against Japan, IJN submarines were increasingly used to resupply strongholds which had been cut off, such as Truk and Rabaul. In addition, Japan honored its neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union and ignored US freighters shipping millions of tons of war supplies from San Francisco to Vladivostok much to the consternation of its German ally.


The Japanese submarine I-400. The Sen Toku I-400 class were the largest non-nuclear submarines ever constructed. Japanese submarines were not used to their full potential during the Pacific War.
The US Navy, by contrast, relied on commerce raiding from the outset. However, the problem of Allied forces surrounded in the Philippines, during the early part of 1942, led to diversion of boats to &quot;guerrilla submarine&quot; missions. As well, basing in Australia placed boats under Japanese aerial threat while en route to patrol areas, inhibiting effectiveness, and Nimitz relied on submarines for close surveillance of enemy bases. Furthermore, the standard issue Mark 14 torpedo and its Mark VI exploder were both defective, problems not corrected until September 1943. Worst of all, before the war, an uninformed US Customs officer had seized a copy of the Japanese merchant marine code (called the &quot;maru code&quot; in the USN), not knowing Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) had broken it; the Japanese government promptly changed it, and the new code was not broken again until 1943.
Thus, it was not until 1944 the US Navy began to use its 150 submarines to maximum effect: effective shipboard radar was installed, commanders lacking in aggression were replaced, and faults in torpedoes were fixed. Japanese commerce protection was &quot;shiftless beyond description,&quot; and convoys were poorly organised and defended compared to Allied ones, a product of flawed IJN doctrine and training — errors concealed by American faults as much as Japanese overconfidence. The number of U.S. submarines patrols (and sinkings) rose steeply: 350 patrols (180 ships sunk) in 1942, 350 (335) in 1943, and 520 (603) in 1944. By 1945, sinkings had decreased because so few targets dared to move on the high seas. In all, Allied submarines destroyed 1,200 merchant ships for about five million tons of shipping. Most were small cargo carriers, but 124 were tankers bringing desperately needed oil from the East Indies. Another 320 were passenger ships and troop transports. At critical stages of the Guadalcanal, Saipan, and Leyte campaigns, thousands of Japanese troops were killed or diverted before they arrived where they were needed. Over 200 warships were sunk, ranging from many auxiliaries and destroyers to one battleship and no fewer than eight carriers. Underwater warfare was especially dangerous; of the 16,000 Americans who went out on patrol, 3,500 (22%) never returned, the highest casualty rate of any American force in World War II. The Japanese losses, 130 submarines in all, were even higher.
A single German submarine, U-862, operated in the Pacific Ocean during the war, patrolling off the Australian east coast and New Zealand in December 1944 and January 1945. It sank one ship in the Pacific before it was recalled to Batavia.
Japanese Naval and Merchant Marine losses 1941-1945 can be found here at US Submarine claims of sunk/damaged ships 1941-1945 can be found at The Joint Army Navy Assessment Committee has assessed US Submarine credits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please explain the formula.  The process of evaluating seems to lead to nothing:

(Infinity)=1=0 is either true or false.

It is false unless you redefine '=:' I will assume you have a way to.

Then you get the mathematical logic statement:

0/2 OR 1/2.

It means nothing except maybe (emptiness)/2 OR (form)/2, which also has little/no meaning except they can have similar terms.

If you explain the possibly contradictory meaning for 0/2 (in which the numerator is false,) then you get the mathematical statement:

0/2 AND 1/2.

However, you still have not explained why you put infinity in the numerator.  Did you want to use Aleph-null and Aleph-one or something?  You would still have to show what it meant.  Why have '2' in the denominator?

Infinity was sort of not in the quote, but the previous AND says the preceding OR has both conditions true.  If both are true it describes symmetry in infinity.  When you evaluate whether that is true or not you probably get a subjective answer.

I checked out some Buddhist logic texts but did not get far into them, and I doubt many people reading this will have read through them or mathematical logic.  I recall reading Eastern logic has not just true and false, but binary states of combinations of those.  Then evaluating &quot;0 AND 0.5 &quot; could give 4 different answers:

0 AND (NOT 1)

0 AND 1

(NOT 0) AND (NOT 1)

(NOT 0) AND 1

Each can be simplified to 0 (false) or 1 (true,) but the idea may have been that would be too simple, so it would be good to allow non-false numbers other than 1, which if Boole did not suggest, others do now.

You still did not explain any of that or where such a mathematical statement is in Buddhism or perennial Philosophy--because if it is true it has to make sense in all reasonable Philosophy which esoterically agrees with Buddhism and vice-versa.  Pythagoras or at least Socrates would not try to argue numbers-based proofs.  Pythagoras probably would not want you to be restricted to any number, and Socrates would see little reason to try to make statements with unnecessary numbers instead of plainly--or perhaps with a formal grammar/logic system--which can explain numbers but does not rely on them (though they can be shorthand for 'truth values or degrees.')--[[User:Dchmelik|Dchmelik]] ([[User talk:Dchmelik|talk]]) 04:07, 27 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

No, the Techniques are real and valid, however the source of these techniques is questionable. It is highly unlikely that the techniques are Vedic in origin. e.g. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Bharati_Krishna_Tirtha's_Vedic_mathematics&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Modern scientific approach is very far from finding out the truth behind existence and explaining it'''

Truth is unchanging and beyond the visible world. Its relationship with the visible changing world is like that of the spirit and the body or the Divine laws of nature and natural things and events. For example the force of growth which is a universal Divine law is innate in living things.

While this law is unchanging a tree or a man undergoes incessant changes. Likewise human beings no matter how their dress or dwellings or means of transport have changed during the course of history remain unchanged in respect of the essential purposes they serve and the impact of those purposes on their lives and environment. As human beings we all share certain general conditions of life and value: we are all born mature marry have children and face death; we all possess some degree of will and common desires we share also certain values—we all know the meaning of honesty kindness justice courage and so on.

'''Modern scientific approach searches for truth in changing nature'''

Despite this fact the modern scientific approach searches for truth in changing nature and in its search it bases itself on the impressions of senses. However these impressions are relative changing from person to person and deceptive. Also people defer in respect of their capacity of reasoning. So it is impossible to arrive at one certain conclusion by deductive or inductive or analytical reasoning of the data received by senses. It is because of this that the modern scientific approach resorts to experiment to arrive at facts. However without pre-established axioms or 'premises' it is not possible to establish a fact through experiments. Since David Hume it has been generally accepted that it is not inevitable that because an event has happened twice or a million times in two or a million different places it must happen again. For this reason since the collapse of classical physics. Western epistemologists speak not of seeking the truth itself but only of seeking approximations to it. Karl Raymond Popper says that we consider the theories of both Newton and Einstein as science... both of them cannot be true at the same time; rather both may be false.

'''Through empirical methods science will not be able to find the truth which concerns the essence of existence'''

Therefore as Guenon puts it science or scientists have two alternatives before them: either they will acknowledge that the findings of science are of no value other than as suppositions about truth and therefore not recognize any certainty higher than sense-perception or they will blindly believe as true in whatever is taught in the name of science. Doubting the findings of science modern scientists try to find a way out in agnosticism or pragmatism thus confessing the inability of science to find truth.

'''Science should recognize its limits and concede that truth is unchanging and lies in the realm above the visible world'''

When it can do that it will find its real value. Evidently without the absolute it is impossible for the relative to exist; what is changing can be possible through the existence of the unchanging and multiplicity is impossible without the existence of unity. It is only when any knowledge reaches the point of immutability that it acquires permanence and stability. What is unchangeable and permanent is above the human realm. Truth is not something the human mind produces. Truth exists independently of man and man's task is to seek it.

      <comment>/* Motivation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want the view portion of your form to add formatting information to numbers.  For example you want your US currency to be stored in the model as 12345.6789 but the view to display at $12,345.68.  Note that the dollar sign is used as a prefix, commas are added and the decimal is rounded to two digits.

Ideally, we would like to use a simple CSS function to indicate that all currency should be formatted using the standard number picture formats such as &quot;$#,###.##&quot;.

== Method ==
If all browsers supported the XPath 2.0 format-number() function, this would be trivial.  Till then the developer will need to resort to workaround such as using JavaScript and the XML Binding language (XBL).

== Sample Code ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:bind nodeset=&quot;instance('invoice')/Total&quot; calculate=&quot;round((instance('invoice')/Tax + instance('invoice')/SubTotal) * 100) div 100&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This sequence of opening moves are not an effective way for white to maintain any advantage. White's development of two piece are not in harmony. In particular the Bishop on c4 is prone to being attacked.

Making a normal map from a photograph picture or any image used for UV mapping. You will need the freeware graphics program Gimp2 to make the normalmap with. &quot;Gimp 2.6.4&quot; found at http://gimp.org/downloads/. Gimp 2.6.5 is at http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html. Gimp 2.6 help files are located at http://docs.gimp.org/.  I prefer version 2.6.4 because 2.6.5 tends to freeze the computer up. The normalmap generator for Gimp can be downloaded from http://nifelheim.dyndns.org/~cocidius/normalmap/ look for win32 binaries (.zip) and click on that. Open the zip file and read the readme.txt file for installation instructions.

The texture file was created from an original photograph by Paul Bartlett who retains copy write but is used with his permission.

In this tutorial you will take an image that you used to UV texture a mesh in your favorite 3D object maker program. (ie 3DSmax, Blender, gmax, ect.) I like using Blender cause it's powerful like 3DSmax and the best part is.......it's free.
In Gimp2, you will make a copy of the texture file, convert it to grayscale and work it for conversion to a normalmap using Gimp2's own normalmap generator plugin.
In my next tutorial...You will learned how to implement the normalmap with a texture map for the 3d shadow affect you will see in trainz using the Blender 3D object program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you take the texture you used for UV mapping and load it into Gimp. After it is loaded, click on the word &quot;Image&quot; [[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map1.jpg]]  and choose Duplicate. The shortcut is (ctrl-D). Close the original image to keeps it safe from changes.
[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map2.jpg‎]] 


Next delete any alpha masks from the copy by clicking Layer, Mask, and Delete Layer Mask.(Circled in image below).     We won't need it for the normalmap since texture or opaque maps will handle that for us.
 
[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map3.jpg]]

Change to greyscale by using Image, Mode, Grayscale.
   
[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map4.jpg]]


Save the copy by clicking file, save-as. The save dialog below will pop up. Name the file &quot;textureName_grayscale.tga&quot; or any name that helps you remember what this image is for. Click save. 

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map5.jpg]]
 
Uncheck RLE compression checkbox in the upper left corner of the popup box, and then click save to complete the process.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map6.jpg]] 
 
NOTE: For all textures used in Trainz always uncheck the RLE compression checkbox. Trainz will compress the image itself and doesn't liked pre-compressed textures.

After you saved the file we will start preparing it for normalmap conversion. Start by making all of the backgrounds (the parts that are not used in the UV mapping) and make it pure white. This is because white will be the deepest points in the picture and darker shades are higher points. White is further away from you, blacks closer to you.  Any shades laid on the UV textures will have the edges rounded back like the egde of a box instead of beveled like the lip of a cup. Also the shades of greys are relative in references. This means if you use a medium grey color any lighter shades will be further back and any darker shades will be closer to you. (using the color picker a shade value &quot;V&quot; of 65 in the middle of a shade 60 and 70 is the same relevance as 90 between 85 and 95). I'll explain more as we get into details.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map7.jpg]] 

      

Next, we start finding all the flat parts of the picture and select those areas. The area marked in red can be selected just don't select the diagonal bar yet. You can also work these spots one at a time, til you get a better feel of using the selection tools. The selection tools are the first 4 brushes in the top row of toolbox pictured below.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map8.jpg]] 
 

After the selection use the paint sprayer tool and set it to the following specs.
[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map8a.jpg]]
 

Then click color picker

 
 
and choose a nice medium shade of gray. ie. 50 to 70.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map11.jpg]]
 

Then spray paint the selected areas to that shade of gray. Note: the shade value can be anywhere from 1 to 99 but this gives you rooms to go up and down with.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map12.jpg]] 


Now for detailing.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map13.jpg]] 
 

In the above picture you see &quot;1's&quot; as the lowest areas and 7's as the highest area. By selecting each area and shading them to their relative shade you'll create the different heights you'll need for the 3D effect in Trainz. Before you start, you need to work out the shade values you'll need in the color picker. If we made &quot;1&quot; a value of 50 then to set a higher plane we need to pick a darker shade value. You can use 49 for &quot;2's&quot; area; and it will work; but it's hard for ours eyes to see the difference. So, I like using values of  3 to 5 points differences. It makes seeing the differences in the shades easier so you don't get lost. The actual height spread is controlled in the normalmap generator. So, lets set 2's at 47 , 3's at 44 and so forth. If it's a bigger jump in height like number 7, then use a difference of 7 to 10 or more. In this case a jump of 7 relative to 6's area  will suffice.

Next, we start to select each of these parts and allow for rivets. At first glance that seems like a lot of work. But, it really isn't too bad and is a whole lot easier than making a Hi LOD mesh and a Low LOD mesh to bake a normalmap with. Plus, this way it is a lot easier to correct mistakes.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map14.jpg]] 

Now select one of the number 3's areas and de-select the approximate centers of where the rivets will go. Indicated by the red arrows. Do this by holding ctrl while left-click and dragging with the mouse. Pressing + plus sign and - minus sign on the 10 key pad will zoom in and out the image. Holding the middle mouse button and dragging will pan the image. Make the de-selection just large enough to see. 4 pixels is usually good.  Be sure to get all the rivets along the area you selected. Now would be a good time to save. Remember to save often so you don't lose too much in case of power outs or a crash. So, far I have be quite please with the stability of Gimp.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map15.jpg]]  

Now,  we will simulate the heights of the rivets. Pick the circle selector. Indicated by the red circle in the following picture.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map16.jpg]]  
 
And go back to the image and zoom in on one of the rivet spots. With the circle selector, outline a 2x2 circle around the spot like in the right hand image just below. If you don't get it just right, you can mouse over and a move cross arrow will appear and you can drag into place. Also, on the sides you will see size changers just grab one and adjust to you liking. Now without clicking again on the image go to the toolbox and pick the pencil image. Indicated with the blue circle in the above picture. Set the specs as indicated above and click the color picker. Rivets come out well if set 3 and 6 shade points higher then it's surrounding shade. Since the shade value for our &quot;3s&quot; area was 44 on our list, we want to set the outer 8 pixels to value 41 and the center 4 pixels to 38. Remember darker is a lower shade value and it causes the plane to be higher in the &quot;bump map&quot;. Thus the rivet will be higher than the plate it's fasten to. Select each value in turn and; with the pencil; color each pixel in the selected area.


[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map17.jpg]] [[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map18.jpg]]

    
Now with the area still selected right click and choose edit then choose copy. Shortcut key is ctrl-c. Pick the circle selector again and outline the next rivet spot. This time just right click choose edit and then choose paste. Shortcut is ctrl-v. If it is not in the right spot you can now use the cursor arrow keys to nudge it to the right spot. Always remember the rivets are relative to its own plane. So, if your working on area 2 which we determined to be a value of 47 then the rivet will be set to 44 for the outer 8 pixels and 41 for the 4 center pixel.(value 3 and 6 again). The values being the same as a plane in another area is irrelevent to the current rivet.

Now on to another detailing trick.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map19.jpg]]
 
In the picture above we have a sloping plane. &quot;A&quot; is high value about 21 and  B is low value about 38. We will use a blend brush to create the slope values needed. In the toolbox select the blend brush, Circled in red. Click on the gradient button mark with green.  Select gradients editor marked with orange in the 2nd image. Select &quot;New&quot; marked with a blue circle in the 3rd image. In the last image rename the new gradient to a name like, &quot;slope&quot; in the name slot marked by pink. Click the arrow marked by yellow to bring up the editor dialog in the lower image.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map24.jpg]]

            

Choose &quot;left Endpoints Color&quot; marked by red.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map25.jpg]]
  
Set the &quot;V&quot; value to 21, our high point shade. Click OK.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map26.jpg]]
 
Choose &quot;Right Endpoints Color&quot; marked with blue and set the &quot;V&quot; value to our low point of 38. Click OK. Save slope in the Gradient Editor (4th pic at the top) and close the editor and each popup back to the main toolbox. Make sure the gradient &quot;slope&quot; is picked and go back to our picture.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map19.jpg]] [[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map28.jpg]]

    
Click just inside the selected area at point A and drag the mouse to the bottom of the area next to point B. Release the  mouse button and you have a smooth slope for the normalmap generator to use. Remember to save often. Continue working on the other parts until your satified. Do not leave any untouched areas, it will stand out like a sore thumb. By the way, in the dark deep area across from &quot;B&quot;, I used a near white value because it sets under the car quite a way's. So near white would create the deep area in the normalmap. Always remember darker is closer to you, lighter is further away.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map29.jpg]]

 

Now the fun part........

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map30.jpg]]
 

Right click on the image and mouse over map then choose Normalmap; as in the image above.

In the generator popup window below, set the following specs.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map31.jpg]]
 

Set filter to Sobel 3x3, set scale to 3, (negative numbers cause inversion of height), Check Invert X and check Invert Y. (leaving these unchecked cause the shadows to fall towards the sun instead of away from it). Set &quot;Conversion:&quot; to Colorspace. 

Then click the 3D Preview button to see the result.

[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map33.jpg]] 
 
When you're done examining it, close the previewer and click OK in the generator window. You should have a normalmap instead of the grayscale map now. See image below. If it's not right or you hit OK when you meant to cancel, just hit ctrl-z to undo the normalmap and continue working; if need be; on the grayscale map. Notice that the image seems to be backsward. I do it this way because trainz uses it backwards. (High and low inverted.)


[[File:Tutorial_how_to_normal_map34.jpg]]
 

Now, you're ready to save it. Save it in the folder your original UV texture file is in and name it something like &quot;Original_name_Normal.tga&quot;. Click save and remember to UNCHECK the RLE compression checkbox. Then click save to finish.

That's it!! You now have a normalmap in less time it would take to create 2 meshes , line them up, set the distances, bake it. Not to mention you don't have to create a high detailed LOD mesh and a low LOD mesh.

Now, you can use my next tutorial for incorporating normalmaps using Blender.

==Introduction==

Modern public-key (asymmetric) cryptography is based upon a branch of mathematics known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Theory ''number theory''], which is concerned solely with the solution of equations that yield only integer results. These type of equations are known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation ''diophantine equations''], named after the Greek mathematician [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantos Diophantos] of Alexandria (ca. 200 CE) from his book [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetica ''Arithmetica''] that addresses problems requiring such integral solutions.

One of the oldest diophantine problems is known as the ''Pythagorean problem'', which gives the length of one side of a right triangle when supplied with the lengths of the other two side, according to the equation

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c \ &lt;/math&gt; is the length of the hypotenuse. While two sides may be known to be integral values, the resultant third side may well be irrational. The solution to the Pythagorean problem is not beyond the scope, but is beyond the purpose of this chapter. Therefore, example integral solutions (known as ''Pythagorean triplets'') will simply be presented here. It is left as an exercise for the reader to find additional solutions, either by brute-force or derivation.

==Prime Numbers==

===Description===

Asymmetric key algorithms rely heavily on the use of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Number prime numbers], usually exceedingly long primes, for their operation. By definition, prime numbers are divisible only by themselves and 1. In other words, letting the symbol | denote divisibility (i.e. - &lt;math&gt;a | b&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; divides into &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;&quot;), a prime number strictly adheres to the following mathematical definition

:&lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; | &lt;math&gt; b \ &lt;/math&gt; Where &lt;math&gt;b = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; only&lt;/center&gt;

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Theorem_of_Arithmetic ''Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic''] states that all integers can be decomposed into a ''unique'' prime factorization. Any integer greater than 1 is considered either ''prime'' or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_Number ''composite'']. A composite number is composed of more than one prime factor

:&lt;math&gt;c \ &lt;/math&gt; | &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; where ultimately &lt;math&gt;b =  p^{e_0}_{0} p^{e_1}_{1} \cdot \cdot \cdot p^{e_n}_{n} \ &lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;p_n \ &lt;/math&gt; is a unique prime number and &lt;math&gt;e_n \ &lt;/math&gt; is the exponent.

==== Numerical Examples====

 543,312 = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
 553,696 = 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 7&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 13&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

As can be seen, according to this systematic decomposition, each factorization is unique.

In order to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_computation deterministically] verify whether an integer &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; is prime or composite, only the primes &lt;math&gt;p \le \sqrt c \ &lt;/math&gt; need be examined. This type of systematic, thorough examination is known as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_exhaustion ''brute-force''] approach. Primes and composites are noteworthy in the study of cryptography since, in general, a ''public key'' is a composite number which is the product of two or more primes. One (or more) of these primes may constitute the ''private key''.

There are several types and categories of prime numbers, three of which are of importance to cryptography and will be discussed here briefly.

===Fermat Primes===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_number Fermat numbers] take the following form

:&lt;math&gt;F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

If ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is prime, then it is called a ''Fermat prime''.

====Numerical Examples====

 &lt;math&gt;F_0 = 2^{2^0} + 1= 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;F_1 = 2^{2^1} + 1= 5 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;F_2 = 2^{2^2} + 1= 17 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;F_3 = 2^{2^3} + 1= 257 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;F_4 = 2^{2^4} + 1= 65,537 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;F_5 = 2^{2^5} + 1= 4,294,967,297 \ &lt;/math&gt;


The only Fermat numbers known to be prime are &lt;math&gt;F_0-F_4 \ &lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the primality of all Fermat numbers was disproven by Euler, who showed that &lt;math&gt;F_5 = 641 \cdot 6,700,297&lt;/math&gt;.

===Mersenne Primes===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Prime Mersenne primes] - another type of formulaic prime generation - follow the form 

&lt;math&gt;M_p = 2^p - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; is a prime number. The [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4th+Mersenne+Prime] Wolfram Alpha engine reports Mersenne Primes, an example input request being &quot;4th Mersenne Prime&quot;.

====Numerical Examples====

The first four Mersenne primes are as follows

 &lt;math&gt;M_2 = 2^2 - 1 = 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;M_3 = 2^3 - 1 = 7 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;M_5 = 2^5 - 1 = 31 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;M_7 = 2^7 - 1 = 127 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 

Numbers of the form ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; without the primality requirement are called ''Mersenne numbers''.  Not all Mersenne numbers are prime, e.g. ''M''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;1 = 2047 = 23&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;89.

===Coprimes (Relatively Prime Numbers)===

Two numbers are said to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime coprime] if the largest integer that divides evenly into both of them is 1. Mathematically, this is written

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b) = 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gcd \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Common_Divisor ''greatest common divisor''].  Two rules can be derived from the above definition

:If &lt;math&gt;ab \ &lt;/math&gt; | &lt;math&gt;c \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gcd(b,c) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; | &lt;math&gt;c \ &lt;/math&gt;

:If &lt;math&gt;ab = c^2 \ &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then both &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; are squares, i.e. - &lt;math&gt;a = a^2_{0} \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b = b^2_{0} \ &lt;/math&gt;

===The Prime Number Theorem===

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Number_Theorem ''Prime Number Theorem''] estimates the probability that any integer, chosen randomly will be prime. The estimate is given below, with &lt;math&gt;\pi (x) \ &lt;/math&gt; defined as the number of primes &lt;math&gt;\le x \ &lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;\pi (x) \approx \frac {x}{\ln x} \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\pi (x) \ &lt;/math&gt; is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;\frac {x}{\ln x} \ &lt;/math&gt;, that is to say &lt;math&gt;\quad\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac {\pi (x)}{\ln x} = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;. What this means is that generally, a randomly chosen number is prime with the approximate probability &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{x} \ &lt;/math&gt;.

==The Euclidean Algorithm==

===Introduction===

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_Algorithm ''Euclidean Algorithm''] is used to discover the greatest common divisor of two integers. In cryptography, it is most often used to determine if two integers are coprime, i.e. - &lt;math&gt;\gcd (a,b) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

In order to find &lt;math&gt;\gcd (a,b) \ &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a &gt; b \ &lt;/math&gt; efficiently when working with very large numbers, as with cryptosystems, a method exists to do so. The Euclidean algorithm operates as follows - First, divide &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt;, writing the quotient &lt;math&gt;q_1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, and the remainder &lt;math&gt;r_1 \ &lt;/math&gt;. Note this can be written in equation form as &lt;math&gt;a = q_1b + r_1 \ &lt;/math&gt;. Next perform the same operation using &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;'s place: &lt;math&gt;b = q_2r_1 + r_2 \ &lt;/math&gt;. Continue with this pattern until the final remainder is zero. Numerical examples and a formal algorithm follow which should make this inherent pattern clear.

===Mathematical Description===

 &lt;math&gt;a = q_1b + r_1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;b = q_2r_1 + r_2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;r_1 = q_3r_2 + r_3 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;r_2 = q_4r_3 + r_4 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\cdot \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\cdot \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\cdot \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;r_{n-2} = q_nr_{n-1} + r_n \ &lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;r_n = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;, stop with &lt;math&gt;\gcd (a,b) = r_{n-1} \ &lt;/math&gt;.

===Numerical Examples===

Example 1 -
To find gcd(17,043,12,660)

 17,043 = 1 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 12,660 + 4383
 12,660 = 2 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 4,383 + 3894
  4,383 = 1 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 3,894 + 489
  3,894 = 7 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 489 + 471
    489 = 1 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 471 + 18
    471 = 26 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 18 + 3
     18 = 6 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 3 + 0

gcd (17,043,12,660) = 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;

Example 2 - 
To find gcd(2,008,1,963)

 2,008 = 1 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 1,963 + 45
 1,963 = 43 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 45 + 28
    45 = 1 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 28 + 17
    28 = 1 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 17 + 11
    17 = 1 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; 11 + 6

==The Extended Euclidean Algorithm==

In order to solve the type of equations represented by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezout%27s_identity Bézout's identity], as shown below

:&lt;math&gt;au + bv = \gcd (a,b) \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u \ &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v \ &lt;/math&gt; are integers, it is often useful to use the ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm  extended Euclidean algorithm]''. Equations of the form above occur in public key encryption algorithms such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA RSA] (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) in the form &lt;math&gt;ed + w(p-1)(q-1) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gcd (e,(p-1)(q-1)) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;. There are two methods in which to implement the extended Euclidean algorithm; the ''iterative method'' and the ''recursive method''.

As an example, we shall solve an RSA key generation problem with ''e'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; + 1, ''p'' = 3,217, ''q'' = 1,279. Thus, 62,537''d'' + 51,456''w'' = 1.

===Methods===

====The Iterative Method====

This method computes expressions of the form &lt;math&gt;r_i = ax_i+by_i&lt;/math&gt; for the remainder in each step &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; of the Euclidean algorithm.  Each [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation modulus] can be written in terms of the previous two remainders and their whole quotient as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;r_i = r_{i-2} - \left \lfloor \frac{r_{i-2}}{r_{i-1}} \right \rfloor \cdot r_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;

By substitution, this gives:
:&lt;math&gt;r_i = (ax_{i-2} + by_{i-2}) - \left \lfloor \frac{r_{i-2}}{r_{i-1}} \right \rfloor \cdot (ax_{i-1} + by_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_i = a(x_{i-2} - \left \lfloor \frac{r_{i-2}}{r_{i-1}} \right \rfloor \cdot x_{i-1}) + b(y_{i-2} - \left \lfloor \frac{r_{i-2}}{r_{i-1}} \right \rfloor \cdot y_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;

The first two values are the initial arguments to the algorithm:
:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = a = a(1) + b(0) \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_2 = b = a(0) + b(1) \ &lt;/math&gt;

The expression for the last non-zero remainder gives the desired results since this method computes every remainder in terms of ''a'' and ''b'', as desired.

Putting the equation in its original form &lt;math&gt;ed + w(p - 1)(q - 1) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;(65,537)(403,937) + (-6,441)(3,217 - 1)(1,279 - 1) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, it is shown that &lt;math&gt;d = 403,937 \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w = -6,441 \ &lt;/math&gt;. During the process of key generation for RSA encryption, the value for ''w'' is discarded, and ''d'' is retained as the value of the private key In this case

 ''d'' = 0x629e1 = 01100010100111100001

====The Recursive Method====

This is a direct method for solving Diophantine equations of the form &lt;math&gt;au + bv = \gcd (a,b) \ &lt;/math&gt;. Using this method, the dividend and the divisor are reduced over a series of steps. At the last step, a trivial value is substituted into the equation, and is then worked backward until the solution is obtained.

=====Example=====

Using the previous RSA vales of &lt;math&gt;(p - 1)(p - 1) = 4,110,048 \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e = 2^{16} + 1 = 65,537 \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Euler's Totient Function==

Significant in cryptography, the ''totient function'' (sometimes known as the ''phi function'') is defined as the number of nonnegative integers &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; that are coprime to &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt;. Mathematically, this is represented as

:&lt;math&gt;\phi (n) = \left | \bigg\{ 0 \le a \le n | \gcd (a, n) = 1 \bigg\} \right |&lt;/math&gt;

Which immediately suggests that for any prime &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi (p) = p - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

The totient function for any exponentiated prime is calculated as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\phi (p^\alpha) \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= p^\alpha - p^{\alpha - 1} \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= p^\alpha \left ( 1 - \tfrac{1}{p} \right ) \  &lt;/math&gt;

The Euler totient function is also multiplicative

:&lt;math&gt;\phi (ab) = \phi (a) \phi (b) \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gcd (a,b) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

==Finite Fields and Generators==

A ''field'' is simply a set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt; which contains numerical elements that are subject to the familiar addition and multiplication operations. Several different types of fields exist; for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, the field of real numbers, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, the field of rational numbers, or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the field of complex numbers. A generic field is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Finite Fields===

Cryptography utilizes primarily ''finite fields'', nearly exclusively composed of integers. The most notable exception to this are the ''Gaussian numbers'' of the form &lt;math&gt;a + bi \ &lt;/math&gt; which are complex numbers with integer real and imaginary parts. Finite fields are defined as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \right) = \mathbb{Z}_n \  &lt;/math&gt; The set of integers modulo &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left( \mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z} \right) = \mathbb{Z}_p \  &lt;/math&gt; The set of integers modulo a prime &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt;

Since cryptography is concerned with the solution of diophantine equations, the finite fields utilized are primarily integer based, and are denoted by the symbol for the field of integers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

A finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_n \ &lt;/math&gt; contains exactly &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; elements, of which there are &lt;math&gt;n - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; nonzero elements. An extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n \ &lt;/math&gt; is the ''multiplicative group'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n \ &lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;\left( \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z} \right)^* = \mathbb{Z}^*_n \ &lt;/math&gt;, and consisting of the following elements

:&lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{Z}^*_n \ &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gcd (a,n) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

in other words, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_n \ &lt;/math&gt; contains the elements coprime to &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt;

Finite fields form an ''abelian group'' with respect to multiplication, defined by the following properties

 &lt;math&gt;\centerdot&lt;/math&gt; The product of two nonzero elements is nonzero &lt;math&gt;\left( ab = c | c \ne 0 \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\centerdot&lt;/math&gt; The associative law holds &lt;math&gt;\left( \left( ab \right) c = a \left( bc \right) \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\centerdot&lt;/math&gt; The commutative law holds &lt;math&gt;\left( ab = ba \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\centerdot&lt;/math&gt; There is an identity element &lt;math&gt;\left( I \cdot a = a \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\centerdot&lt;/math&gt; Any nonzero element has an inverse &lt;math&gt;\left( a \cdot a^{-1} = 1 \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;

A subscript following the symbol for the field represents the set of integers modulo &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt;, and these integers run from &lt;math&gt;0 \ &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; as represented by the example below

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{12} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \} \ &lt;/math&gt; 

The ''multiplicative order'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is represented &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_n&lt;/math&gt; and consists of all elements &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gcd (a,n) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;. An example for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is given below

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_{12} = \{ 1, 5, 7, 11 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; is prime, the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_p&lt;/math&gt; consists of all integers &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;1 \le a \le p \ &lt;/math&gt;. For example

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
! Composite ''n'' !! Prime ''p'' 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_9 = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{11} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_9 = \{ 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 \}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_{11} = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===Generators===

Every finite field has a ''generator''. A generator &lt;math&gt;g \ &lt;/math&gt; is capable of generating all of the elements in the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; by exponentiating the generator &lt;math&gt;g\,\bmod\,n \ &lt;/math&gt;. Assuming &lt;math&gt;g \ &lt;/math&gt; is a generator of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_n&lt;/math&gt; contains the elements &lt;math&gt;g^i\,\bmod\,n \ &lt;/math&gt; for the range &lt;math&gt;0 \le i \le \phi (n) - 1&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_n&lt;/math&gt; has a generator, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be cyclic.

The total number of generators is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\phi \left( \phi \left( n \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

====Examples====

 For &lt;math&gt;n = p = 13 \ &lt;/math&gt; (Prime)
 
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{13} = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 \}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_{13} = \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 \}&lt;/math&gt;
 
 Total number of generators &lt;math&gt;\phi \left( \phi \left( 13 \right) \right) = \phi \left( 12 \right) = 4&lt;/math&gt; generators
 
 Let &lt;math&gt;g = 2 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g = \{ 2,4,8,3,6,12,11,9,5,10,7,1 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g = 2 \ &lt;/math&gt; is a generator
 
 Since &lt;math&gt;2 \ &lt;/math&gt; is a generator, check if &lt;math&gt;\gcd (i, p - 1) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;2^2 = 4 \ &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i = 2 \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gcd \left( 2, 12 \right) = 2 \ne 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, therefore, &lt;math&gt;4 \ &lt;/math&gt; is not a generator
 &lt;math&gt;2^3 = 8 \ &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i = 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gcd \left( 3, 12 \right) = 3 \ne 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, therefore, &lt;math&gt;4 \ &lt;/math&gt; is not a generator
 
 Let &lt;math&gt;g = 6 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g = \{ 6,10,8,9,2,12,7,3,5,4,11,1 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g = 6 \ &lt;/math&gt; is a generator
 Let &lt;math&gt;g = 7 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g = \{ 7,10,5,9,11,12,6,3,8,4,2,1 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g = 7 \ &lt;/math&gt; is a generator
 Let &lt;math&gt;g = 11 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g = \{ 11,4,5,3,7,12,2,9,8,10,6,1 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g = 11 \ &lt;/math&gt; is a generator
 
 There are a total of &lt;math&gt;4 \ &lt;/math&gt; generators, &lt;math&gt;\left( 2,6,7,11 \right)&lt;/math&gt; as predicted by the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi \left( \phi \left( n \right) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

 For &lt;math&gt;n = 10 \ &lt;/math&gt; (Composite)
 
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_9 = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^*_9 = \{ 1,3,7,9 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;
 
 Total number of generators &lt;math&gt;\phi \left( \phi \left( 10 \right) \right) = \phi \left( 4 \right) = 2 \ &lt;/math&gt; generators
 
 Let &lt;math&gt;g = 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g = \{ 3,9,7,1,3,9,7,1,3 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g = 3 \ &lt;/math&gt; is a generator
 Let &lt;math&gt;g = 7 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g = \{ 7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1,7 \} \ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g = 7 \ &lt;/math&gt; is a generator
 
 There are a total of &lt;math&gt;2 \ &lt;/math&gt; generators &lt;math&gt;\left( 3,7, \right) \ &lt;/math&gt; as predicted by the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi \left( \phi \left( n \right) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Congruences==

===Description===

Number theory contains an algebraic system of its own called the ''theory of congruences''. The mathematical notion of congruences was introduced by Karl Friedrich Gauss in ''Disquisitiones'' (1801).

===Definition===

If &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; are two integers, and their difference is evenly divisible by &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt;, this can be written with the notation

:&lt;math&gt;\left( a - b \right) | m \ &lt;/math&gt;

This is expressed by the notation for a congruence

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

where the divisor &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; is called the ''modulus of congruence''. &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; can equivalently be written as

:&lt;math&gt;a - b = mk \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k \ &lt;/math&gt; is an integer.

Note in the examples that for all cases in which &lt;math&gt;a \equiv 0\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;, it is shown that &lt;math&gt;a | m \ &lt;/math&gt;. with this in mind, note that

&lt;math&gt;a \equiv 0\,\bmod\,2&lt;/math&gt; Represents that &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; is an even number.

&lt;math&gt;a \equiv 1\,\bmod\,2&lt;/math&gt; Represents that &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; is an odd number.

====Examples====

{|class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;a - b = mk \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;14 \equiv 5\,\bmod\,3&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;14 - 5 = 3 \cdot 3 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;-13 \equiv 7\,\bmod\,4&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(-13) - 7 = 4 \cdot (-5) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;90 \equiv 0\,\bmod\,18&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;90 - 0 = 18 \cdot 5 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

===Properties of Congruences===

All congruences (with fixed &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt;) have the following properties in common

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv a\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;b \equiv a\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

:If &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \equiv c\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a \equiv c\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,1&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;a = b \ &lt;/math&gt;

:Given &lt;math&gt;a \equiv a\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; 0 \le b \le m - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

These properties represent an ''equivalence class'', meaning that any integer is congruent modulo &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; to one specific integer in the finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m&lt;/math&gt;.

===Congruences as Remainders===

If the modulus of an integer &lt;math&gt;m &gt; 2 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then for every integer &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a = mk + r \, \left( r \in \mathbb{Z}_m \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which can be understood to mean &lt;math&gt;r \ &lt;/math&gt; is the remainder of &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; divided by &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt;, or as a congruence 

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv r\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

Two numbers that are incongruent modulo &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; must have different remainders. Therefore, it can be seen that any congruence &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; holds if and only if &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; are integers which have the same remainder when divided by &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt;.

====Example====

 &lt;math&gt;10 \equiv 3\,\bmod\,7&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to
 &lt;math&gt;10 = \left( 7 \cdot 1 \right) + 3 \ &lt;/math&gt; implies
 &lt;math&gt;3 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the remainder of &lt;math&gt;10 \ &lt;/math&gt; divided by &lt;math&gt;7 \ &lt;/math&gt;

===The Algebra of Congruences===

Suppose for this section we have two congruences, &lt;math&gt;a \equiv a\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c \equiv d\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;. These congruences can be added or subtracted in the following manner

:&lt;math&gt;a + c \equiv b + d\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a - c \equiv b - d\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

If these two congruences are multiplied together, the following congruence is obtained

:&lt;math&gt;ac \equiv bd\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

or the special case where &lt;math&gt;c = d \ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ac \equiv bc\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

Note: The above does not mean that there exists a division operation for congruences. The only possibility for simplifying the above is if and only if &lt;math&gt;c \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; are coprime. Mathematically, this is represented as

:&lt;math&gt;ac \equiv bc\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gcd \left( c,m \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The set of equivalence classes defined above form a ''commutative ring'', meaning the residue classes can be added, subtracted and multiplied, and that the operations are associative, commutative and have additive inverses.

===Reducing Modulo ''m''===

Often, it is necessary to perform an operation on a congruence &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;b &gt; m \ &lt;/math&gt;, when what is desired is a new integer &lt;math&gt;d \ &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0 \le d \le m - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; with the resultant &lt;math&gt;d \ &lt;/math&gt; being the ''least nonnegative residue modulo m'' of the congruence. Reducing a congruence modulo &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; is based on the properties of congruences and is often required during exponentiation of a congruence.

====Algorithm====

 Input: Integers &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;b &gt; m \ &lt;/math&gt;
 Output: Integer &lt;math&gt;d \ &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0 \le d \le m - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 
 1. Let &lt;math&gt;q = \left \lfloor \tfrac{b}{m} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
 2.     &lt;math&gt;c = qm \ &lt;/math&gt;
 3.     &lt;math&gt;d = b - c \ &lt;/math&gt;
 4. Output &lt;math&gt;d \ &lt;/math&gt;

====Example====

 Given &lt;math&gt;289 \equiv 49\,\bmod\,5&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;9 = \left \lfloor \tfrac{49}{5} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;45 = 9 \cdot 5 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;4 = 49 - 45 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 
 &amp;there4; &lt;math&gt;289 \equiv 49 \equiv 4\,\bmod\,5&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;4 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the least nonnegative residue modulo &lt;math&gt;5 \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Exponentiation===

Assume you begin with &lt;math&gt;a \equiv b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;. Upon multiplying this congruence by itself the result is &lt;math&gt;a^2 \equiv b^2\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;. Generalizing this result and assuming &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; is a positive integer

:&lt;math&gt;a^n \equiv b^n\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

====Example====

 &lt;math&gt;9 \equiv 4\,\bmod\,13&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;81 \equiv 16\,\bmod\,13&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;729 \equiv 64\,\bmod\,13&lt;/math&gt;
 
 This simplifies to
 
 &lt;math&gt;81 \equiv 16\,\bmod\,13&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;16 \equiv 3\,\bmod\,13&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;729 \equiv 64\,\bmod\,13&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;256 \equiv 9\,\bmod\,13&lt;/math&gt;

===Repeated Squaring Method===

Sometimes it is useful to know the least nonnegative residue modulo &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; of a number which has been exponentiated as &lt;math&gt;a^2 \equiv\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;. In order to find this number, we may use the ''repeated squaring method'' which works as follows:

 1. Begin with &lt;math&gt;a \equiv\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;
 2. Square &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;a^2 \equiv b^2\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;
 3. Reduce &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;a^ \equiv b_1\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;
 4. Continue with steps 2 and 3 until &lt;math&gt;a^{2^n} \equiv b_n\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; is obtained.
    Note that &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; is the integer where &lt;math&gt;2^{n+1} \ &lt;/math&gt; would be just larger than the exponent desired
 5. Add the successive exponents until you arrive at the desired exponent
 6. Multiply all &lt;math&gt;b_i \ &lt;/math&gt;'s associated with the &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;'s of the selected powers
 7. Reduce the resulting &lt;math&gt;b\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; for the desired result

====Example====

 To find &lt;math&gt;6^{149}\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;:
 
 &lt;math&gt;6 \equiv 6\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;6^2 = 36 \equiv 3\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;6^4 \equiv 9\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;6^8 \equiv 81 \equiv 4\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;6^{16} \equiv 16 \equiv 5\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;6^{32} \equiv 25 \equiv 3\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;6^{64} \equiv 9\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;6^{128} \equiv 81 \equiv 4\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 
 Adding exponents:
 
 &lt;math&gt;128 + 16 + 4 + 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 
 Multiplying least nonnegative residues associated with these exponents:
 
 &lt;math&gt;4 \cdot 5 \cdot 9 \cdot 6 = 1080 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;1080\,\bmod\,11 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
 
 Therefore: 
 
 &lt;math&gt;6^{149} \equiv 2\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverse of a Congruence===

====Description====

While finding the correct symmetric or asymmetric keys is required to encrypt a plaintext message, calculating the inverse of these keys is essential to successfully decrypt the resultant ciphertext. This can be seen in cryptosystems Ranging from a simple affine transformation

:&lt;math&gt;C \equiv aP + b\,\bmod\,N&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;P \equiv a^{-1}C + b^{-1}\,\bmod\,N&lt;/math&gt;

To RSA public key encryption, where one of the deciphering (private) keys is

:&lt;math&gt;d_A = e^{-1}_A\,\bmod\,\phi \left( n_A \right)&lt;/math&gt;

====Definition====

For the elements &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb Z_m&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gcd \left( a, m  \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;b \in \mathbb Z_m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab \equiv 1\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; is said to be the ''inverse'' of &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;a^{-n}\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n^{th} \ &lt;/math&gt; power of the integer &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;ab \equiv 1\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;.

=====Example=====

 Find &lt;math&gt;633^{-1}\,\bmod\,2801&lt;/math&gt;
 
 This is equivalent to saying &lt;math&gt;633b \equiv 1\,\bmod\,2801&lt;/math&gt;
 
 First use the Euclidean algorithm to verify &lt;math&gt;\gcd \left( 633, 2801 \right) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;.
 Next use the Extended Euclidean algorithm to discover the value of &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt;.
 In this case, the value is &lt;math&gt;177 \ &lt;/math&gt;.
 
 Therefore, &lt;math&gt;633^{-1}\,\bmod\,2801 = 177&lt;/math&gt;
 
 It is easily verified that &lt;math&gt;\left( 633 \right) \left( 177 \right) \equiv 1\,\bmod\,2801&lt;/math&gt;

===Fermat's Little Theorem===

====Definition====

Where &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; is defined as prime, any integer will satisfy the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt;a^p \equiv a\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt;

====Example====

When &lt;math&gt;a = 2 \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p = 19 \ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2^2 \equiv 23\,\bmod\,19&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2^4 \equiv 529 \equiv 16\,\bmod\,19&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2^8 \equiv 256 \equiv 9\,\bmod\,19&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2^{16} \equiv 81 \equiv 5\,\bmod\,19&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;16 + 2 + 1 = 19 \ &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;5 \cdot 23 \cdot 2 = 230 \equiv 2\,\bmod\,19&lt;/math&gt;

====Conditions and Corollaries====

An additional condition states that if &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; is not divisible by &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt;, the following equation holds

:&lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv 1\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt;

Fermat's Little Theorem also has a corollary, which states that if &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; is not divisible by &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n \equiv m\,\bmod\,\left( p - 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;a^n \equiv a^m\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt;

====Euler's Generalization====

If &lt;math&gt;\gcd \left( a, m \right) = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^{\phi \left( m \right)} \equiv 1\,\bmod\,m&lt;/math&gt;

===Chinese Remainder Theorem===

If one wants to solve a system of congruences with different moduli, it is possible to do so as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_1\,\bmod\,m_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_2\,\bmod\,m_2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_k\,\bmod\,m_k&lt;/math&gt;

A simultaneous solution &lt;math&gt;x \ &lt;/math&gt; exists if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gcd \left( m_i, m_j \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\left( i \ne j \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;, and any two solutions are congruent to one another modulo &lt;math&gt;M = m_1m_2 \ldots m_k \ &lt;/math&gt;.

The steps for finding the simultaneous solution using the Chinese Remainder theorem are as follows:

:1. Compute &lt;math&gt;M \ &lt;/math&gt;
:2. Compute &lt;math&gt;M_i = M / m_i \ &lt;/math&gt; for each of the different &lt;math&gt;i \ &lt;/math&gt;'s
:3. Find the inverse &lt;math&gt;N \ &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M_i\,\bmod\,m_i&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;i \ &lt;/math&gt; using the Extended Euclidean algorithm
:4. Multiply out &lt;math&gt;a_iM_iN_i \ &lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;i \ &lt;/math&gt;
:5. Sum all &lt;math&gt;a_iM_iN_i \ &lt;/math&gt;
:6. Compute &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^k a_iM_iN_i\,\bmod\,M&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the least nonnegative residue

====Example====

 Given:
 
 &lt;math&gt;x \equiv 1\,\bmod\,11&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;x \equiv 2\,\bmod\,7&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;x \equiv 3\,\bmod\,5&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;x \equiv 4\,\bmod\,9&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;M = 3465 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;M_{11} = 315 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;M_7 = 495 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;M_5 = 693 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;M_9 = 385 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 
 Using the Extended Euclidean algorithm:
 
 &lt;math&gt;315N \equiv 1\,\bmod\,11\,\,\,N = -3&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;315N \equiv 1\,\bmod\,7\,\,\,N = 3&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;315N \equiv 1\,\bmod\,5\,\,\,N = 2&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;315N \equiv 1\,\bmod\,9\,\,\,N = 4&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i = 1}^4  = \begin{cases} 1 \cdot 315 \cdot \left( -3 \right) = -945 \\
                                    2 \cdot 495 \cdot 3 = 2970 \\
                                    3 \cdot 639 \cdot 2 = 4158 \\
                                    4 \cdot 385 \cdot 4 = 6160
                      \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt; \sum = 12343&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;x = 12343\,\bmod\,3465 = 1948&lt;/math&gt;

==Quadratic Residues==

If &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; is prime and &lt;math&gt; &gt; 2 \ &lt;/math&gt;, examining the nonzero elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z_p = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , p - 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;, it is sometimes important to know which of these are squares. If for some &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb Z_p^*&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a square such that &lt;math&gt;b^2 = a \ &lt;/math&gt;. Then all squares for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z_p^*&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by &lt;math&gt;b^2\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;b = 1, 2, \ldots , \left( p - 1 \right) / 2 \ &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb Z_n^*&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; if there exists an &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb Z_n^*&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \equiv x^2\,\bmod\,n&lt;/math&gt;. If no such &lt;math&gt;x \ &lt;/math&gt; exists, then &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic non-residue modulo &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;is a quadratic residue modulo a prime &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a^{\tfrac {p - 1}{2}}\,\mod\,p = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===

 For the finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z_{19}&lt;/math&gt;, to find the squares &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z_{19} = \{ 1, 2, \ldots , 9 \},&lt;/math&gt;, proceed as follows:
 
 &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 1^2 = 1 &amp; 2^2 = 4 &amp; 3^2 = 9 \\
                      4^2 = 16 &amp; 5^2 = 6 &amp; 6^2 = 2 \\
                      7^2 = 11 &amp; 8^2 = 7 &amp; 9^2 = 5
       \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
 
The values above are ''quadratic residues''. The remaining (in this example) 9 values are known as ''quadratic nonresidues''. the complete listing is given below.

 &lt;math&gt;p = 19 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 Quadratic residues: &lt;math&gt;1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 16 \ &lt;/math&gt;
 Quadratic nonresidues: &lt;math&gt;3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Legendre Symbol===

The Legendre symbol denotes whether or not &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo the prime &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; and is '''only''' defined for primes &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; and integers &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;. The Legendre of &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; is represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt;L \left( \tfrac{a}{p} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this does not mean &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; divided by &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;L \left( \tfrac{a}{p} \right)&lt;/math&gt; has one of three values: &lt;math&gt;0, 1, -1 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;L \left( \tfrac{a}{p} \right) \begin{cases}
     0, &amp; \mbox{if }p\mbox{ divides }a\mbox{ evenly} \\
     1, &amp; \mbox{if }a\mbox{ is a quadratic residue modulo }p \\
     -1, &amp; \mbox{if }a\mbox{ is a quadratic nonresidue modulo }p
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

===Jacobi Symbol===

The Jacobi symbol applies to all odd numbers &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 3 \ &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \ldots p_m^{e_m} \ &lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt;J \left( \tfrac{a}{n} \right) = L \left( \tfrac{a}{p_1} \right)^{e_1} L \left( \tfrac{a}{p_2} \right)^{e_2} \ldots L \left( \tfrac{a}{p_m} \right)^{e_m}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; is prime, then the Jacobi symbol equals the Legendre symbol (which is the basis for the Solovay-Strassen primality test).

==Primality Testing==

===Description===

In cryptography, using an algorithm to quickly and efficiently test whether a given number is prime is extremely important to the success of the cryptosystem. Several methods of primality testing exist (Fermat or Solovay-Strassen methods, for example), but the algorithm to be used for discussion in this section will be the Miller-Rabin (or Rabin-Miller) primality test. In its current form, the Miller-Rabin test is an unconditional probabilistic (Monte Carlo) algorithm. It will be shown how to convert Miller-Rabin into a deterministic (Las Vegas) algorithm.

===Pseudoprimes===

Remember that if &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; is prime and &lt;math&gt;gcd \left( b, m \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, Fermat's Little Theorem states:

:&lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv 1\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt;

However, there are cases where &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; can meet the above conditions and be nonprime. These classes of numbers are known as &lt;i&gt;pseudoprimes&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;m \ &lt;/math&gt; is a pseudoprime to the base &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;gcd \left( a, m \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the least positive power of &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; that is congruent to &lt;math&gt;1 \bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt; evenly divides &lt;math&gt;p - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;.

If Fermat's Little Theorem holds for any &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; that is an odd composite integer, then &lt;math&gt;p \ &lt;/math&gt; is referred to as a pseudoprime. This forms the basis of primality testing. By testing different &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt;'s, we can probabilistically become more certain of the primality of the number in question.

The following three conditions apply to odd composite integers:

:I. If the least positive power of &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; which is congruent to &lt;math&gt;1\,\bmod\,n&lt;/math&gt; and divides &lt;math&gt;n - 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; which is the order of &lt;math&gt;a \ &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z_n^*&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; is a pseudoprime.
:II. If &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; is a pseudoprime to base &lt;math&gt;a_1 \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2 \ &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; is also a pseudoprime to &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2\,\bmod\,n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2^{-1}\,\bmod\,n&lt;/math&gt;.
:III. If &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; fails &lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv 1\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt;, for any single base &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb Z_p^*&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;n \ &lt;/math&gt; fails &lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv 1\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt; for at least half the bases &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb Z_p^*&lt;/math&gt;.

An odd composite integer for which &lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv 1\,\bmod\,p&lt;/math&gt; holds for &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb Z_p^*&lt;/math&gt; is known as a &lt;i&gt;Carmichael Number&lt;/i&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TODO|todonote=Finish! Add history, kernel details, and explanations distributions that use it. Brief install/use help is probably good.|A Neutral Look at Operating Systems}}
'''GNU Hurd''' is an operating system based on the GNU Hurd kernel. It is intended to supplement the GNU userspace utilities. Currently there are only a limited number of distributions that include it as the kernel, as it is not ready for production. It is built on top of a microkernel, GNU Mach, with daemons running on top of it.

== Distributions that include Hurd ==
There are versions of the Arch and Debian operating systems that use the Hurd kernel instead of the Linux kernel.

{{closed|Closed as '''delete'''. Unresolved copyrights status for over a week. No support for keep. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:21, 28 February 2009 (UTC)}}
Looks like a copy off http://www.johana.com/~lynn/financial.htm.

== [[Computer Information Systems in Education]]? ==
Could you clarify your plans for the content linked to from [[Wikibooks:Collections/Computer Information Systems in Education /Ed 1]]. The collections aren't book, themselves but just a way to create printable versions. Thanks, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:46, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

: This was an error on my part. I am new to the Wikibook making and intended to make this a book. Thanks for following up. [[User:Basiyr|Basiyr]] ([[User talk:Basiyr|talk]]) 14:26, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

:: You're welcome. I noticed that you seem to have placed the book on a sub-page named &quot;/Ed 1&quot; which I assume stands for &quot;edition one&quot;. The [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] recommends placing the main contents on the main page, placing the cover on a separate sub-page (such as &quot;/Cover&quot;). The MoS also recommends using descriptive page-names (instead of &quot;Chapter x&quot; or &quot;Page y&quot;. Semantically more correct, this makes pages easier to search for and renders the titles properly (which is particularly important for printing).
:: As a final note, there shouldn't be a need for editions as all versions are stored in edit histories. Editions are counter to the collaborative aim of the wiki and do not serve the reader. Static editions can always be compiled into static documents such as PDFs. See [[Wikibooks:Forking policy]] for more.
:: I wish you and your students all the best. Please feel free to contact me or bring up issues in the relevant [[Wikibooks:reading room|reading room]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:16, 28 February 2009 (UTC)


I just found the time to read through this and think about improvements. If I wish to follow the MoS and alter the wikibook. What do I need to do. Just make a new one and ask that these old pages be deleted? [[User:Basiyr|Basiyr]] ([[User talk:Basiyr|talk]]) 15:41, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

Hi Margrét,

A file you recently uploaded, [[File:Blondun Lita.pdf]], appears to be [[WB:WIW|inappropriate]] for English Wikibooks. Perhaps you would care to contribute it to [[:is:|Icelandic Wikibooks]]. I would, furthermore, encourage you to upload the text on a normal page, rather than in a PDF format. [[:is:Litahringur]] may be a useful page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:02, 28 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

===Blender Modeling Terminology===
*'''Quad ''n.''''' - A face with four sides.
*'''Mesh ''n.''''' - A collection of faces, edges, and vertices which can be modeled and manipulated in Edit Mode.
*'''Vertex ''(pl. vertices) n.''''' - A 3-dimensional coordinate, which in groups comprise a polygon. With default settings, it is represented in Blender by a purple dot when unselected, or a yellow dot when selected.
*'''Edge ''n.''''' - A wire-like line representing the boundary of 2 adjacent vertices.
*'''Face ''n.''''' - A planar connection of edges representing a boundary, field, or solid surface. Identified individually in Edit Mode as a black box in the middle of the corresponding face.
*'''Icosphere ''n.''''' - A sphere composed of ''n'' triangular faces composed in a manner to give the best &quot;smoothness&quot; for the lowest memory consumption.
*'''UVSphere ''n.''''' - A sphere composed of ''n'' square faces arranged in rings to allow the smoothest application of real-time movement of vertices/faces and application of images onto the spectrum of faces.
*'''Lamps''' - Category of 5 light-emitting objects:
**Lamp - Light is emitted in the scene with a uniform spherical output which fades with distance, decreasing eventually to 0. The distance can be specified in its options.
**Sun - Light is emitted in the scene with a uniform spherical output and remains uniform regardless of the distance from it.
**Spot - Light is emitted in the scene in a predetermined conical area with light properties similar to lamp and also initially calculates the shadow (lack of light) present behind an object (Known as ray shadow).
**Hemi - Sun-like light emitted in a 180 degree arc. Works just like a Sun lamp, but with less functionality. Best used for quick, broad illumination.
**Area - Light which works similar to a Spot lamp but shape of the cone is definable.
*'''Ray shadows ''n.''''' - Method of generating shadows cast by light by calculating the angle and faces of the interfering object to create a smooth, sharp and complete shadow. Memory-intensive, best quality.
*'''Buffer Shadows ''n.''''' - Method of generating shadows cast by light by calculating the angle of a mesh's edge and creating a set amount of shadow &quot;squares&quot; on the shadow-receiving objects which are calculated from a set buffer-ratio. Memory-friendly, while possibly lower quality.
*'''Camera ''n.''''' - An object which acts as the viewpoint (when active) for the scene when the scene is to be rendered.
*'''Armature ''n.''''' - An object which contains 'bones'. Bones are sub-objects which are connected with each other in a chain, each bone-link is parented to the bone before it. The purpose is to parent any objects to the bone, and also you may parent a mesh to the entire armature and have selected vertices of the mesh parented to bone(s) percentage-wise (0% means no effect, 50% means vertices copy half the transformation value, 100% means vertices transformed as full child of bone.)
*'''Empty ''n.''''' - An object with no mesh or relating object data. It is useful for using in object input fields where the object needs no specific properties e.g. parenting it to an object for organisational purposes.

== Welcome! ==

First of all, we will learn what a model is. Make sure you first complete the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Thinking_in_3D|Thinking in 3-D]] and [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Blender_Interface|Beginner Tutorials]] tutorial chapters before this one--you will need it here.

'''This tutorial was made with Blender 2.48.  Your version may vary slightly.'''

== The View ==
[[File:Blender Screenshot for Beginner Tutorial.jpg|thumb|500px|''Your Blender will look different as this is a custom color scheme.'']]

First, take a look at your screen.  Seems like a lot of stuff there, doesn't it?  So let's break everything down step-by-step, identifying each object as described.

=== Identifying the 3D-View ===
*'''''Red-White 3D Cursor (Crosshairs):''''' This is your first important 'artifact'.  This object is the Blender-User cursor.  It is where objects are placed when you &quot;Add&quot; an object.  Blender also uses it for all actions and references relating to the &quot;Cursor&quot;.  Whenever you see any references to the &quot;Cursor&quot;, this is the object.
**In the Blender-World, it is non-interactive/non-existent -- it will not interact with any objects, emit anything, or show up in Renders; it is simply a User-Interface tool for working in Blender.
**This artifact can be placed (by default settings) by left-clicking anywhere on the 3D-View window.  However, moving the cursor in 3D-View can be a little confusing until you've done it a few times.  Here's why: You're attempting to specify a point in 3-Dimensional space using a 2-Dimensional (or flat) screen.  Therefore, you will only move the cursor on the 2D plane as you are currently viewing the scene or object. This means the cursor will retain its &quot;Window -Z-&quot; (or 'depth') coordinate.  To change the third coordinate, you must either: 1) rotate the 3D-View 90 degrees, left, right, up or down, (choose only one) or 2) change views (e.g. move to top-, side-, or front-view.)  (While this may seem confusing now, with a little practice it will all make sense and you'll easily get the hang of it.)
*'''''Camera (displayed as a black, lopsided pyramid in above picture):''''' This is the eye that Blender uses to &quot;View&quot; the world. (It will be discussed in a later tutorial.)
**In the Blender-World, it is limited-interactive/non-existent -- it will not initially interact with objects, emit anything, or show up in Renders.
*'''''Lamp (displayed as a black orb with a black circle and dash marks around it):''''' This is the default light that Blender uses to illuminate mesh objects. It will be discussed in greater detail in a later section.
**In the Blender-World, it is limited-interactive/non-existent -- it will not initially interact with objects or show up in Renders, but does emit &quot;light&quot; to make objects visible/&quot;lit&quot; within the distance set.
*'''''Mesh (displayed as a gray box with a blue dot at the center):''''' When you first load Blender, this &quot;default cube&quot; is the initial model loaded. It will be discussed in this tutorial. 
**In the Blender-World, it is interactive/existent -- it will interact with objects, show up in Renders, and be registered in the Blender-Universe in many different ways.

=== The View's Options ===
So now you're familiar with the view, next let's look at your different options. In this view, the Camera, Lamp, and Mesh are selectable. Selecting them will cause an outline to appear around the object or change its color altogether. You just have to remember which objects do what when you select them. 

Each object has its own set of options when you select it. To select an object, move the mouse cursor over the object in the 3D-View and '''Right-Click.''' It should then be outlined with a pink color. 
[[File:Blender 3D-View Bottom Border.JPG|thumb|600px]]
The 3D-View has a lower border which houses its own set of options. It is visible directly below the 3D View in the snapshot above as well as in the thumb to the right. Identify the given overview of each option (each option is listed from left-to-right):

*'''''3D-View (only described by a drop-down menu with a grid in it):'''''This option is in the border of every window. The drop-down menu changes the category in which this window is working. The Grid in the menu means the window will be displaying 3D View. The other selections will be discussed in later tutorials.
'''''Of the following options, the next three are visible only as long as the little gray arrow next to the &quot;Current Window Type&quot; is pointing down (if pointing right, click it to change)'''''
*'''''View:''''' This option will yield many options that change how you are viewing the scene in the 3D view. Do not mess with it much now or you may not be able to get out of an odd view and might even have to restart Blender to restore view.
*'''''Select:''''' This option will yield lots of options which you can use to change which objects are selected in the 3D view. Many options will be discussed in later tutorials.
*'''''Object:''''' This option will display several options which you can use to change certain properties of the object which is selected. It is visible if the next drop-down menu is in &quot;Object Mode&quot; and will change with respect to the Mode selected in that drop-down. Many options will be discussed in later tutorials.
*'''''______ Mode (Menu):''''' Depending on the selected type of object, this menu will yield anywhere from 1 to ''n'' options. When a mesh is selected, there are 5 options to start with in this menu. The two options you will be taught in this section are &quot;Object Mode&quot; and &quot;Edit Mode&quot;.
*'''''Draw-Type Menu (shown only as a tan box next to the &quot;______ Mode&quot; Menu)''''': This option displays the objects in the 3D Viewport in different ways. For example, it can show them shaded or textured. (Note: called the &quot;Viewport Shading&quot; button in version 249.2) 
*'''''Pivot Type (shown only as a menu directly right of the Draw-Type Menu, usually with assorted dot symbols):''''' Changes where the rotation/scale pivot point will be located for the selected object(s) when transformed.
*'''''3D Transform Manipulator (shown as a button with a hand pointing, which also has a drop-down menu connected to the right and, when depressed, will yield 3 more buttons): Very Important--'''''The triangular button will create 3 colored arrows at the pivot-point of the selections.  These colored arrows can be selected to change the location of the selected objects. The circle button creates 3 colored rings with an outer &quot;window-facing&quot; ring which can be selected to rotate selected objects at the pivot point. The block button will change the scale (size) of the selections at the pivot point along the 3 colored blocks presented in the 3D view. In each case, you can ''' LMB-drag ''' the guide arrows, circles or lines to affect the transformation.  The menu next to that is used to determine on which axes these transformations will take place.
*'''''Layer Buttons (shown as rows of buttons to the right of 3D Transform Manipulator):''''' Changes the layer you are viewing (when objects are created they are set on a layer).
*'''''Magnet Button (shown as a button with a magnet picture on it):''''' When selected will snap transformations of object(s) to selected integral values instead of &quot;free&quot; (multi-decimal) values.
*'''''Render Image Button (shown as a button with a scene picture on it):''''' Will take a picture of the 3D scene as you currently see it from your view.
Oh yes, it is a lot to review, but don't fret--all we are doing now is working with modeling an object.  We will only really utilize the transforming aspects and, in the buttons window below, the Editing View.

== Edit View ==
First, if anything is &quot;selected&quot; (edges and/or vertices highlighted with color), press '''A''' to -DeSelect- everything to prevent accidentally editing something.  If nothing is selected, do not press '''A''' (as this will -Select- everything.)  Next, zoom in and change the camera angle, preferably to one where the cube is in a 3D-View and nearly filling the whole screen.  Next, switch to the '''Edit Mode''' by pressing '''Tab''' or selecting it from the '''Mode''' menu.  Now the cube has a black outline and new options are available.

[[File:BlenderExampleEditingScreenshot.JPG]]

If you look at the bottom border in this example, you can see four new buttons to the right of the magnet button. As you saw in the previous section, a mesh has Vertices, Edges, and Faces.  Each button corresponds to the button's picture. In '''Edit Mode''', you can manipulate and transform these three types as you choose, using the transformation buttons.  Try it.  Just free-wheel it for now, making sure to select with '''RMB'''.  Now '''RMB-drag''' to move the selection. (You can let go of '''RMB''' once you start the movement.  Finally, either click '''LMB''' to keep the change, or click '''RMB''' to ignore the change.  Change the selection types by pressing the Vertices, Edges, or Faces buttons in the bottom border area so you can choose the parts of the cube you want to select.  Also you can select with these different ways, so practice them:
*'''Shift + RMB-Click''' -- Selects or deselects multiple objects, vertices, edges, or faces. Just hold and click what you want.
*'''A''' -- Selects/Deselects all objects, vertices, edges, or faces.
*'''Ctrl + Z''' -- Undoes your last action.
Now that you can transform a given face or edge, you may want to work with something more complex than a six-sided cube. If you want to add more detail, then check out the window directly below the 3D View.  It is called the Buttons Window.

== Add More Detail ==

Using the controls in the Buttons Window, you can revise the mesh to make it more detailed by subdividing and extruding, somewhat like a sculptor subtracts or adds clay to a starting, undefined lump.

Try subdividing first. Select the face(s) or edge(s) ('''RMB-Click''', '''SHIFT + RMB-Click''', or '''AKEY''') that you want to work with. Next, hit the '''Subdivide''' button in the '''Mesh Tools''' tab (on lower right side of Buttons Window above). The selected face splits into many new, smaller faces. These new faces can now be selected and subdivided and so on. Play around by selecting another face and subdividing it.  Hit '''CTRL-Z''' to Undo back to the original square.

Another method for adding detail is to use the &quot;Extrude&quot; function. Select the top face of the cube and either hit the '''Extrude''' button in Mesh Tools or the '''EKEY'''. Without pressing anything else, move your mouse up. You should see your selected segment pull out from the rest of the surrounding mesh, in this case turning a square into a rectangle. Hitting the '''LMB''' will finalize the extrusion; hitting the '''RMB''' will cancel the extrusion and return the face to where it was.
 
Subdividing and extruding in this way allow you to transform shapes. Try it!

== Finally, Beginnings are Over! Or Not. ==

Done playing already? Well, you should at least have an understanding of how modeling works. If not, don't worry.  This is a very basic overview and more explanation will appear in the next sections. While it may seem like it would be super time-consuming to model this way, you will learn how to model better and more efficiently soon. Just master these techniques for now.

== Information Systems for Learning and Instruction ==

In Discovering Computers 2007 a Gateway to Information, a computer based information system is described as the  &quot;collection  of hardware, software, data, people, and procedures that work together to produce quality information&quot;. These information systems provide opportunities to improve student learning by providing alternate ways for learners to use technology in learning environments (Shelly, Cashman, Vermaat, Discovering Computers 2007), and they enhance management capabilities of teachers as well as school administrators. For example, in many schools today student management systems are being implemented which allow parents to view their child's report card online, to observe classroom behavior over streaming videos and to go online to access their child's lesson plan and or their homework assignments. These exciting and modern applications of computer based information systems not only gain popularity in the schools but in the home environment as well.  

 
Computer based information system has implications for student learning, classroom teaching, school administration as well as parental involvement.

== Information Systems for Student Access ==
Use of computer based information systems gives students access to information through the Internet, as well as  by  different methods of communication.  A good example of an internet communication system is a distant learning class. This method of learning, allows students, especially the working class to take a class online, over the internet, instead of sitting in an actual classroom. This type of learning,  provides a fun and innovative process for providing instruction over the World Wide Web and it gives people who work a more relaxed atmosphere where they can work at their own pace, at their home. Learning improves with the use of technology (Shelly, Cashman, Vermaat, Discovering Computers 2007). The learning environment does not stay in the classroom but opens up to the world.  New ideas and new techniques can be used to make old curriculum seem new in the eyes of a student.  

== Information Systems for Student Learning ==
Although Information Systems can improve student learning, their use can sometimes lead to information overload. Sometimes we use so many sources of technology and switch from program to program that we don't allow the students a chance to develop a level of confidence in using various tools. For example: In Mr. Watkins’ 9th grade class computer based information systems are in constant use. Mr. Watkins' has students use Windows Movie Maker to demonstrate their knowledge of social studies concepts. In this information system, Mr. Watkins communicates to students by publishing assignments in their online folders. Students then use the software to develop their movies. Students also integrate other applications such as spreadsheets. Student movies are then published to a school portfolio for later showcase in the school social studies fair. Even though the students are being exposed to a variety of information, they may not have enough time or skill to develop the information. (figure 1).

Figure 1      Mr. Watkins, 9th grade teacher, St. Louis MO says, “Some students won't have a problem using the various programs to develop their project, but other students might not have the skill or the comfort level to make a quality product”. (Mr. Watkins, 9th grade teacher, St. Louis MO,  (personal communication, January 20, 2009)

== Information Systems for Classroom Teaching ==
In classroom teaching students use computers and software to assist with learning. A computer information system, will enhance classroom learning, by allowing the teachers to find more creative ways to teach, such as using electronic worksheets, in which students use the computer to research information and answer questions about their lesson.  Scores can be recorded immediately and teachers can follow up with misunderstandings at the same time.  In some situations teachers encourage students to computer based applications such as online tutorials because they focus on a particular skill. 
 

== Information Systems for Teacher Productivity == 	
One advantage to using a computer information system  is that it can automate tasks for teachers and administrators allowing them to spend time on other important tasks (such as writing lesson plans,  grading papers, completing reports, etc.) Another advantage of using a CIS is that it can help you to save data that is collected  and then store it in one centralized place. This will allow anyone (administrators as well as state monitors) to view the data.  For example: Ms. Harris, a 2nd grade teacher from Columbia, SC reports that: At our school we take surveys from our advisory board members, from the students, teachers and administrators.  This data can be saved and at a later date be viewed or used in a comparison with other past or future data.  The data can also be processed in to information that can be printed in a report. Similar to this, CIS allows students grades to be posted where parents can view their grades.  This helps teachers to keep students accountable and parents informed. A disadvantage though to using a computer information system for this purpose is that it may cause frustration for educators that are not computer literate when new software is purchased and there is little or no time  given to learn the software. This leads to misuse of the software or no use of it at all.  Overall,  computers are a good tool for the classroom that teachers and students can use them to make the learning endless. (figure 2).

Figure 2         Computers are a good tool for use in the classroom for teachers and students and they make learning endless. (Ms. Harris, 2nd grade teacher, Columbia, SC  (personal communication, January 28, 2009)

== Information Systems for Administration ==
Educational administrations or schools, use computer information systems because they prove to be useful tools in learning environments. In addition, they are fast, reliable, can store a large amount of data, are able to connect to other computers on a networking system, therefore able to share information, allow the students and teachers access to the Internet, etc. CIS's are resourceful and have become a great learning tool in educational settings. The use of technology is absolutely beneficial to learning process. One major problem with computer information systems is that sometimes technology is relied upon too much. Teachers and students almost forget that there were other ways to add math problems, to create hands on science projects, to play a musical instrument by hand and so on. It can make a person lazy and dependent on computers. Also, other problems consist of &quot;broken&quot; or misused technology that may result in needing some repair. Some teachers use a lot of technology in their classroom and their educational administrations rely on them as well. It is important that teachers and students are trained on the proper way to use the computers and students when using the computers, should be supervised. As far as equipment is concerned, there are times when the systems or networks are down and computers either run slower or problems may cause the system to shut down and you may lose unsaved work. That's why it is always important to back up your hard drive, to have extra storage space and to have a warranty on your equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cursor manipulation ==

As you try to write your text editor, you may realize that you will need to place the cursor in a given location on the screen. This is performed using the &lt;tt&gt;LOCATE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

{{NOTE|Printing any character in the bottom-right corner of the screen will cause the display to scroll.}} 

== Color ==

To change the current printing color, use the &lt;tt&gt;COLOR&lt;/tt&gt; statement.  

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
  COLOR 7,0  'Uses the default white on black.
  COLOR 15,0 'Bright white on black.
  COLOR 0,1  'Black on blue
  Color 14,0 'Bright yellow.
&lt;/source&gt;

This can be used for title or status bars at the bottom.

== Formatted printing ==

The &lt;tt&gt;PRINT USING&lt;/tt&gt; statement allows you to output strings or numbers in a specified format.  With this statement, you can write numbers out to specified decimal places or perform advanced output. 

The most common format specifiers would be &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;, which reserve space for digits and decimal points respectively. You may also use the underscore to ensure that a given character is printed literally.

Note - PRINT USING is unable to add 'leading zeros' to a number (if you specify eg 3 digits (###) a two digit number will be output with leading spaces).

*This page predates the block log, however I don't understand why there was only one edit to the page ever. This leads me to believe it is not the original log page. Nevertheless, most blocks have long since expired. The users with indefinite blocks are long gone, and if they ever did request unblock, the information on that page would not be helpful. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:41, 28 October 2008 (UTC)
* '''Delete'''. This is a historical page with no potential use to us now, ''and'' it doesn't really serve as any kind of historical tool for us to gain insight into the early workings of this project. In short, this page is useless, and even though it was created by an exemplary Wikibookian, it is not worth keeping any longer. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:14, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

: Delete and Upload logs should be kept since Wikibooks' logs don't go that far back. The Bureaucrat log doesn't seem to include anyone who has access to admin or bureaucrat tools, so should be safe to delete. The rest can also be deleted because they are just lists rather than logs and are not as updated as the automatic lists. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:34, 22 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added to the tourism section about Thailand's tourism, and gave examples of inbound, outbound, and domestic tourism. [[User:Ringk2|Ringk2]] ([[User talk:Ringk2|talk]]) 01:29, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

I changed the example for ethnic tourism because I felt that it didnt fully follow the definition for this type of tourism. [[User:Brunerl|Brunerl]] ([[User talk:Brunerl|talk]]) 03:58, 1 May 2009 (UTC) 

I changed the words &quot;A lot of the workers are illegal immigrants...&quot; to &quot;It is believed that some of the workers are illegal immigrants...&quot; so that it is more respectful to the workers, and so taht this article does not convict them of anything.[[User:Marshan2|Marshan2]] ([[User talk:Marshan2|talk]]) 20:27, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I added to the tourism section of migration in order to clarify and expand the topic [[[User:Kirschk4|Kirschk4]] ([[User talk:Kirschk4|talk]]) 20:41, 29 April 2009 (UTC)]

Edited subject grammar in Trans-border States section[[User:clue1478|clues1478]]

I made minor prepositional and plural changes to the Diaspora section.[[User:clue1478|clues1478]]

Edits made to the Theories of Migration page. Fixed grammar, syntax and added to the bulk of the paragraphs. [[User:Torres7840|Torres7840]] ([[User talk:Torres7840|talk]]) 02:33, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the Globalization page a bit-made a Wiki. link for Theodore Levitt and fixed a few grammatical errors. (Scar8719)

Under the heading of Globalization and Migration I added an alternate use of the term 'migration' stating that the Holocaust was an example of forced migration for people of Jewish descent or religion. I added the term 'forced migration' because migration alone does not adequately describe the circumstance for Jewish people during the Holocaust because simply 'migration' does not show the dire necessity for Jewish people to move away.[[User:Monroa|Monroa]] ([[User talk:Monroa|talk]]) 21:39, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

I edited the tourism section, corrected grammar and helped the article flow better. --[[User:Alfred8599|Alfred8599]] ([[User talk:Alfred8599|talk]])

I made the heading of trans-border states under long-distance nationalism bigger so that it would be easier to read. [[User:Woodworth3702|Woodworth3702]] ([[User talk:Woodworth3702|Woodworth3702]])

I made the Cultural Imperialism vs. Cultural Hypbridization it's own section. [[User:Woodworth3702|Woodworth3702]] ([[User:Woodworth3702|talk]])

I made some grammatical changes to the Diaspora section. [[User:Woodworth3702|Woodworth3702]] ([[User talk:Woodworth3702|talk]])

I made the headings bold, in the Globalization's Affects on Modes of Production for uniformity.  [[User:Laurenhuff|Laurenhuff]] ([[User talk:Laurenhuff|talk]])

I made a few small changes (sentence flow, grammar) to the Migration section. [[User:Woodworth3702|Woodworth3702]] ([[User talk:Woodworth3702|talk]])

I added a more specific, ethnographic reference to my section on consumer culture. --[[User:Alfred8599|Alfred8599]] ([[User talk:Alfred8599|talk]])

I made some wording in the Globalization of Hip-Hop section more precise, and cleaned up the grammar a bit. [[User:Westa8|Westa8]] ([[User talk:Westa8|talk]]) 03:51, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

I added a reference to my section on cosmopolitanism. [[User:Woodworth3702|Woodworth3702]] ([[User talk:Woodworth3702|talk]])

I edited the How Globalization Affects the Five Modes of Production section, I fixed some grammatical errors and moved some things around. [[User:Whitee7|Whitee7]] ([[User talk:Whitee7|talk]]) 04:44, 8 March 2009

I cleaned up some grammatical errors and fixed some misspellings in the section about long distance nationalism. [[User:Laurenhuff|Laurenhuff]] ([[User talk:Laurenhuff|talk]])

Thank you for adding the paragraph about the risks of tourism, that is an aspect of tourism that I would not think of off the top my head, but after reading it I can see that it is important to the section!--[[User:Brown1147|Brown1147]] ([[User talk:Brown1147|talk]]) 19:12, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I clarified the section on pastoralism and added more information to it. --[[User:Brown1147|Brown1147]] ([[User talk:Brown1147|talk]]) 19:04, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

In the Migrant work section, I revised the statement,&quot;migrant workers are unskilled laborers&quot;, to 'migrant workers primarily focus on jobs that are most plentiful depending on the season'. I found the previous comment to be very general and discriminating. [[User:Monroa|Monroa]] ([[User talk:Monroa|talk]]) 04:46, 30 April 2009 (UTC)  (User name: Monroa) 

I edited the section about labor migrants for grammar. --[[User:Brown1147|Brown1147]] ([[User talk:Brown1147|talk]]) 07:49, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the section on Migration for grammar and for clarity --[[User:Brown1147|Brown1147]] ([[User talk:Brown1147|talk]]) 07:41, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the section on the effects of globalization on horticulture for accuracy. --[[User:Brown1147|Brown1147]] ([[User talk:Brown1147|talk]]) 07:26, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

The definitions for the five modes of production did not have a lot of detail, but instead of making the definition more complicated and packed full of information, I instead just added internal links to other wikipedia pages so that someone could find more information if necessary.- [[Hykal0597]]

In the How Globalization Affects section I revised the explanation for foraging. --[[User:Brown1147|Brown1147]] ([[User talk:Brown1147|talk]]) 03:23, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I added Diaspora under Migration and gave a brief description to fulfill ‘requirement 2a anthropological key term or concept’. --[[User:Thompson7425|Thompson7425]] ([[User talk:Thompson7425|talk]]) 02:09, 1 March 2009 (UTC)Thompson7425

I added Long-Distance Nationalism under the section Migration. --[[User:Thompson7425|Thompson7425]] ([[User talk:Thompson7425|talk]]) 02:13, 1 March 2009 (UTC)Thompson7425

In the Tourism section I edited the current paragraph for clarity and added further information about risks associated with tourism. --[[User:Lianalewis|Lianalewis]] ([[User talk:Lianalewis|talk]]) 10:24, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

In Trans-border states I edited the paragraph so the flow of the sentences and ideas were better.--[[User:Heerdt9575|Heerdt9575]] ([[User talk:Heerdt9575|talk]]) 06:56, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I added some more information on nations that discourage and encourage Trans-Border States and long-distance nationalism.--[[User:Heerdt9575|Heerdt9575]] ([[User talk:Heerdt9575|talk]]) 19:01, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

In the trans-border state section I really liked the examples of all the different countries you used to explain this topic. It was interesting how you tied 9-11 into this topic. It would be interesting to hear more about how long distance nationalism was discouraged in the US. --[[User:Hopperm1|Hopperm1]] ([[User talk:Hopperm1|talk]]) 19:14, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for adding the Long-Distance Tourism Bullet, I never would have thought to add such bullets. It then helped me to add Trans-Border states.--[[User:Heerdt9575|Heerdt9575]] ([[User talk:Heerdt9575|talk]]) 19:19, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks, and I also feel like I didn't explain 9-11 enough maybe I will do a little more research on the topic and how it relates to Long-Distance Nationalism--[[User:Heerdt9575|Heerdt9575]] ([[User talk:Heerdt9575|talk]]) 19:19, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

I added an example to the labor migrants section. Kim James

I changed the number list under Different Types of Migrants to bullets because the numbers were matching up weird and not in order. --[[User:Ironside3511|Ironside3511]] ([[User talk:Ironside3511|talk]]) 23:28, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I made all of the sub-sections of Different Types of Migrants bold text so that the sections can be idetified clearly. --[[User:Ironside3511|Ironside3511]] ([[User talk:Ironside3511|talk]]) 23:31, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

I linked globalization to the Wikipedia site --[[User:Mbutler07|Mbutler07]] ([[User talk:Mbutler07|talk]]) 00:45, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I added information about the two different types of modes of exchange: reciprocity and market exchange. I also edited the section of redistrobution to added more ethnographic examples of it. I also minorly edited the section about the Diaspora, adding clarity to the date and trying to make the paragraph more fluid. -- [[User: Gonzales7312|Gonzales7312]] ([[User talk:Gonzales7312|talk]]) 18:28, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks, the example you added to the redistribution section is a great addition, and it ties in the more recent information we are learning in class right now to a concept that we learned about earlier this year. [[User:Anne Forman|Anne Forman]] ([[User talk:Anne Forman|talk]]) 19:38, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I added the example of the Salvation Army to my own section on Redistribution to provie a medium-scale example, in comparison with my small-scale and large-scale examples. [[User:Anne Forman|Anne Forman]] ([[User talk:Anne Forman|talk]]) 20:04, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a link to the Wikipedia page for the Big Man/Big Woman example under Redistribution. [[User:Anne Forman|Anne Forman]] ([[User talk:Anne Forman|talk]]) 19:57, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I also added a reference page because we didn't have one, so our reference links led to nothing, and I had to add a quote from the textbook. -- [[User: Gonzales7312|Gonzales7312]] ([[User talk:Gonzales7312|talk]]) 18:28, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for adding the reference page! I was wondering why there wasn't one up earlier but I had no clue how to do it.--[[User:Ironside3511|Ironside3511]] ([[User talk:Ironside3511|talk]]) 07:41, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I linked the Holocaust to the wikipedia site. (under the Migration section)--[[User:Ironside3511|Ironside3511]] ([[User talk:Ironside3511|talk]]) 07:52, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I edited the Modes of Production description to make it flow better. [[User:Anne Forman|Anne Forman]] ([[User talk:Anne Forman|talk]]) 20:01, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I linked tourist destinations under the tourism section. [[User:Lianalewis|Lianalewis]] ([[User talk:Lianalewis|talk]]) [[User:Lianalewis|Lianalewis]] ([[User talk:Lianalewis|talk]]) 23:48, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I improved some grammar and punctuation errors as well as how some of the sentences flow throughout the Migration section. [[User:Gill4569|Gill4569]] ([[User talk:Gill4569|talk]]) 00:41, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I made some grammar changes in Globalization to make it flow better. [[User:Gongorh|Gongorh]] ([[User talk:Gongorh|talk]])

I changed some grammar on Tourism to make it flow better. [[User:Gongorh|Gongorh]] ([[User talk:Gongorh|talk]])

I changed some of the wording in Cultural Imperialism to make it flow better. [[User:Gongorh|Gongorh]] ([[User talk:Gongorh|talk]])

I changed the tense to make it all pass tense in Jewish Diaspora. [[User:Gongorh|Gongorh]] ([[User talk:Gongorh|talk]])

The heading for &quot;trans-boarder states&quot; was almost too small to read so I made it bigger and then had to make the heading above it &quot;long distance nationalism&quot; bigger as well. Troeppl0637

I made a few phrasing changes to the migration section to give it a better flow --[[User:Mallahp|Mallahp]] ([[User talk:Mallahp|talk]]) 05:17, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I also changed the wording in the refugee section --[[User:Mallahp|Mallahp]] ([[User talk:Mallahp|talk]]) 05:18, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I made some changes to globalization's effects on the modes of production. This was because the previous descriptions showed the effects to be all around positive on foraging and horticulture.--[[User:Whitcomb5739|Whitcomb5739]] ([[User talk:Whitcomb5739|talk]]) 02:47, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

The Cosmopolitanism section had cites within the text. These are in the wrong place. I changed a couple of small grammatical errors. [[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 02:37, 10 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

I added a small caveat to the end of the globalization section, mostly to add some balance to the proposed benefits of globalization with a sentence describing its possibility for negative outcomes.--[[User:Whitcomb5739|Whitcomb5739]] ([[User talk:Whitcomb5739|talk]]) 03:07, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I also added the ethnographic example of the diseases brought by Europeans in the 16th century and their devastation on native populations.--[[User:Whitcomb5739|Whitcomb5739]] ([[User talk:Whitcomb5739|talk]]) 03:20, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed the wording of the last two sentences of Market Exchange to clarify the content. Holmesa2

I added a photo and a bunch of links to the migrant worker section.  I also cleaned up some of the formating issues with the sources.([[User:JoelSheppard|talk]])

I changed &quot;mexicans&quot; to Latin American Hispanics&quot; because &quot;mexicans&quot; is a limiting inaccurate term. Not just Mexicans Come across the boarder for work. I also added more information on how immigration helps our society. [[User:Cryerd|Cryerd]] ([[User talk:Cryerd|talk]]) 02:35, 30 April 2009 (UTC)

I deleted some of the wordiness in the first section about migration, i then added another example with a source.[[User:Johns562|Johns562]] ([[User talk:Johns562|talk]]) 03:19, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stephen P Johnson Education is - AS Law Enforcement, BS Criminology, Photographic Craftsman(Photog,Cr,.), Juvenile Institute Graduate, Mentor, Lecturer and Teacher.  Mr. Johnson was born in February on the 5th day in the year of 1959.  He grew up in the small town of Foxborough, Massachusetts and spent his younger years fishing, hiking, biking, backpacking, hunting and spending time with his family.

Stephen has attained so much and created so many programs directed toward the youth of his town or any town he has live in.  He sees that &quot;children are our future and what we teach them today WILL Affect us tomorrow&quot;.  He also believes that children do not go wrong or bad by themselves, not at all, he believe's that ALL Problem stem from the childs home domestic life, or lack of!  There are of course exceptions with regards to medical conditions, but even with that if the family unit is strong and loving, even these type of cases can be overcome....  For a young man Mr Johnson has accomplished so much while enduring so very many hardships and a ten year totally unethical divorce.  He believes that parents who desire a divorce should both be placed in Jail for two days prior to initiating litigationl, why?  because it is a sin what both parents knowingly and unknowingly do to there children.  Divorce is between supposed two adult, yet it ends up as a no holds barred bar fight.  That's an all together seperate issue at this time.

Although two small paragraphs have been written, there is much, much more stimulating and inciteful context.</text>

===Overview===

An estimate of total biomass of planktonic algal species may be obtained by counting plankton in several samples of the brine. Microalgae are settled, and to a limited extent preserved, by the settling agent. A subsample of the cells in the concentrated algal mass is counted. This figure is extrapolated to give a rough idea of the total algal biomass and the main phyla present.

===Reagents and equipment required to settle algae and concentrate sample=== 

# Algae sample 
# Lugols Media for algae settling 
# Measuring cylinder and vacumn pump (or siphon) 
# Haemocytometer, cover slip and transfer pipette 
# Microscope

===Method of concentrating the sample===
    
Add approximately one millilitre of Lugol's Media to an empty 250 millilitre measuring cylinder. Fill the 250 mL measuring cylinder to the 200mL mark with a sample from the field. Make sure that the media and the sample are well mixed. This solution must sit undisturbed for a day before the next step. If too much sample is added, some of the solution can be poured out if the excess is less than 25 millilitres. If a larger amount has been added, pouring some away will upset the ratio of sample to Lugol's Media, so start again.

After the solution of sample and Lugol's Media has been left for a day the top 180 millilitres must be removed without disturbing the remaining 20 millilitres. This is done by using a vacuum pump attached to a water trap, a venturi pump, or by simple siphoning. It is important that the bottom 20 millilitres is not disturbed while the upper 180 millilitres is being removed.
  
Mix the remaining 20 mL of sample thoroughly and place a drop on a haemocytometer slide, using the following instructions, prior to viewing under the microscope.     


===Lugols Media for algae settling===
 
Chemicals needed: 
#Iodine I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 
#Potassium Iodide KI, 
#Acetic Acid (Glacial) 

Add 10g of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 20g of KI to a 500mL beaker. Add about 150mL of distilled water and mix well to dissolve the chemicals. Make up to 200mL and add 20gm of acetic acid and mix again. Store in a glass reagent bottle. Do not use until several several days have passed.
     

===Preparing the haemocytometer slide for viewing===

[[File:Haemocytometer 2 ISSLR.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Diagram 1 - Haemocytometer |left]] 
The haemocytometer is a glass slide normally used to count blood cells. It may be used to count algae cells in the same manner. The diagram shown here and discussed in this text is an Improved Neubauer Haemocytometer. Refer to diagram 1 for the general structure of the haemocytometer.

The two rails that support the slide coverslip are moistened with water to stop the coverslip from moving. The coverslip is placed on the rails equal distance between the two slides. The coverslip may tend to slide off the haemocytometer, so use your fingertip to hold it in place. 

The bottom 20 millilitres of the concentrated sample is then well mixed and, using a transfer pipette, a small sample of the concentrated algae is sucked into the the tube. A drop of this is placed on the small (2 by 4mm) half cone notch on the side of the haemocytometer. The sample will draw up the cone to fill the area between the raised platform of the haemocytometer and the coverslip.  Sometimes the drawing or capillary action does not start by itself, so move the coverslip slightly to start the action by pushing gently on the '''side''', not top, of the coverslip. Be careful as the coverslip is fragile and may crack if handled roughly. This process is repeated for the other side of the haemocytometer. This entire process should only take about one minute. There should be an even cover of brine across both raised platforms and no excess brine on the top of the coverslip.  

Not all haemocytometers have a notch in the side. In these, place a drop of the concentrated sample on each stage of the haemocytometer slide and gently slide the coverslip into place.  

 
===Viewing a haemocytometer slide===     

[[File:HaemocytometerISSLR.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Diagram 2 - Haemocytometer counting area |left]]
Haemocytometers have two main counting areas. A single counting area is shown in the diagram 2. Each counting area is divided into nine equal portions of 1mm by 1mm. These portions are referred to as CELLS.

To do a simple count, the number and type of microalgal cells present in a single haemocytometer cell is totalled and recorded in your laboratory daybook.

The number of counting cells examined is limited to a maximum of 18 cells. If too many algal cells are present counting all 18 cells may be too time consuming and less than 18 areas may be examined. So, the number of cell areas counted should always be scored and recorded in the neighbouring column to the count, for use in the final plankton density calculation. 
    
If you wish to know which groups of plankton are the dominant species, the algae may be identified with the aid of the literature to the taxonomic level you require and the groups counted separately. You may find drawing up a matrix with separate columns for each group of microalgae you are scoring simplifies this type of count.

   
===Calculation of the plankton count===

Once you have your microalgae counts, the number of counting area cells you counted and the concentration factor then:

&lt;math&gt;\text{plankton count} = \frac\text{1}\text{how many times concentrated} \times \frac\text{no of plankton}{10^{-4}}\times \frac\text{1}\text{no of cells (squares) counted}&lt;/math&gt;
 
The concentration factor is normally 1:10 and plankton cells are expressed as plankton x 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per mL

Therefore, more normally :

&lt;math&gt;\text{plankton count} = \frac\text{no of plankton}\text{no of cells} \times 10^3&lt;/math&gt;

 
===Calculating algal biomass===

[[File:Biomass.jpg|right|thumb|700px|Diagram 3 - Biomass calculations for various shaped plankton|left]] 
Wet algal biomass (biovolume) may be calculated (as a volume) from the shape and size of typical plankton present in your count, multiplied by the plankton count. Typical plankton volume calculations are illustrated in Diagram 3. Click on the thumbnail to obtain a larger version of the diagram. The groups of plankton illustrated in the diagram include those groups most commonly found in saline lakes.

The biovolume is reported as mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/L and is obtained by multiplying the calculated cell volume (in cubic micrometres) for each plankton group or species by the count for that group or species per millilitre, and summing all the groups/species (Eaton ''et al'', 1995):


&lt;math&gt;\text{V}_t = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\text{N}_i \times \text{V}_i)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt;\text{V}_t = \text{total plankton cell volume, mm}^3/\text{L}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\text{N}_i = \text{count of the i}^{th} \text{species/mL}&lt;/math&gt;, and

&lt;math&gt;\text{V}_i = \text{average volume of cells of the i}^{th} \text{species, }\mu m^3&lt;/math&gt;


===Alternative biomass methods===

Reference to methods manuals such as ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' (Eaton ''et al'', 1995) will provide information on:

# obtaining '''dry biomass''' using gravimetric methods, and
# measuring chlorophyll&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and multiplying by 67 to obtain an estimate of dry biomass. 

Should you be using samples of hypersaline brines, remember that you may need to wash any filter pads rather more thoroughly that you would for a similar sample of marine or freshwater origin. Poor rinsing will result in the inclusion of a mass of salts in your biomass, invalidating the results. 

Rinsing so thoroughly is not always appropriate. For example, the green Alga ''Dunaliella salina'' has no cellulose cell wall and is likely to lyse when exposed to fresh water. Filtering this species requires very gentle suction or even gravity filtration, and no exposure to deionised water. To correct for the inevitable quantity of salt that will be trapped in the filter, one could pass an equivalent quantity of filtered brine through a second filter and treat it in exactly the same manner as the filter used to concentrate the biomass sample.

===Overview===
Periphyton are those microalgae that grow on the benthic areas of a salt lake. They may be sampled by collecting materials that are immersed in the lake (rocks, large woody debris, sections of benthic mat communities) and scrubbing the coating microalgae off the surfaces for microscopic examination. Alternatively, artificial substrates may be placed into the lake for a period to be colonised by periphyton. The latter approach tends to produce a cleaner sample, which simplifies the process of identification.

Amongst the periphyton you are likely to commonly find diatoms, foraminifera, and colonial cyanobacteria. The last of these three form benthic mat communities in the base of shallow salt lakes and are discussed in more detail in a separate chapter. Diatoms occur through a very wide range of salinities and the persistence of their silica tests in the sediments of lakes allows for historic variations in salinity to be estimated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the horticultural sense, a '''tree ring''' is an area around the trunk of the tree that is maintained as a barrier between the surrounding lawn and the tree's base to avoid unintentional damage from mowing equipment. This area is generally kept mulched or planted with a ground cover or other ornamental plants. &quot;Tree ring&quot; is also a colloquial term for the annual growth rings found in a tree's wood.

Tree rings provide an important purpose in protecting the tree, since being bumped by mowers or hit by rotary weed trimmers can cause severe damage to the base of the tree by either crushing or removing the cambium layer (thus causing a dead area), or by simply exposing the cambium which makes the tree susceptible to infection or insect damage since the protective bark is removed. Eventually this can cause the parts of the tree above the damaged area to die, or in extreme cases the whole tree can die due to disease or unintentional [[../Girdling|girdling]]. 

Tree rings should at a minimum be at least 1 foot (30 cm) beyond the flare of the tree's base, though wider is better. If there are surface roots beyond the tree ring that are being hit by mowing equipment, the ring should be expanded to include those roots, since scarfing the roots also created open wounds and thus make the tree susceptible to infection. 

While tree rings are often maintained by simply maintaining a layer of mulch, the use of ground covers is a much better option in most cases, since the presence of a ground cover will discourage people from walking on the soil within the ring, and so helping to avoid soil compaction. Dense ground covers such as ''[[../Pachysandra terminalis/]]'', ''[[../Epimedium/]]'', and so on are the best choices, since they require less weeding and so less foot traffic within the ring.

In cases where surface roots continue to appear outside of an existing tree ring, [[../Vertical mulching|vertical mulching]] can be used to provide better air, water, and nutrient circulation within the deeper soil, which will encourage the tree to grow deep roots rather than surface roots.

Saw this one today while categorizing some books. Looks like it's some sort of project manager or organizational ledger for a restoration project. Definitely not a book, don't think it has any potential to become one either.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Quoted definitions in ch. 0 are excerpted or paraphrased from the (&lt;i&gt;Compact&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;COED&lt;/i&gt;) unless noted.

;grammar
: '...system and structure of a language [...] in general...'
;arithmology
: (numerology) 'the branch of knowledge that deals with the [esoteric] significance of numbers'
;esoteric
: '...likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest'
;science
: '...systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural...'
;physics
: '...science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy...'
;matter
: '...that which occupies space and possesses rest mass...'
;energy
: '...mass of a body when at rest' &amp; '...vitality required for sustained physical or mental activity' (''The Oxford Dictionary of English'')
;mass
: '...matter which a body contains, as measured by its acceleration under a given force or by the force exerted on it by a gravitational field'
;rest mass
: 'the mass of a body when at rest.'
;science
: '...intellectual and practical activity...'
;intellect
: '...reasoning or understanding objectively, especially with regard to abstract matters' (''The Oxford Dictionary of English'')
;mind
: 'element of a person that enables them to be aware [...,] to think, [...;] the faculty of consciousness and thought:'
;abstract
: (full &lt;i&gt;COED&lt;/i&gt; definition:) 'existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.'
;intelligence:
: 'ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.'

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Note the def. of science leads to implication of abstract, 'non-physical' reality.&amp;nbsp; That does not have to mean 'metaphysics' ('after physics') the title of a book by Aristotle that was written after his physics one; other scientific philosophers had a greater definition of physics before the term 'metaphysics,' meaning the same.&amp;nbsp; This book is about language, literature, mathematics, and the mathematical analysis of language.&amp;nbsp; It is not necessarily physics such as cosmology, but it may be ontology.

== Introduction ==

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Greek Pre-Socratic scientist-Philosopher Pythagoras learned numerology in a day that a literal meaning of magic was mathematics.  He studied in the East.&amp;nbsp; Greek and other languages used to use alphabets as numbers, and each number has a meaning.&amp;nbsp; Because of that, mathematical analysis of texts can find other meanings, particularly hidden (or forgotten) non-literal ones.&amp;nbsp; In Greek this science is &lt;i&gt;isopsephy&lt;/i&gt; (and the 'numerology' (Lat.) is &lt;i&gt;arithmology&lt;i&gt; (Gk..)

== The arithmology of the scientist Pythagoras ==

(Hexadecimal notation is used here: 'A' follows '9', and so forth until 'F' which is followed by '10'. The hexadecimal notation '10' is in decimal '16.')

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Zero may not have been used by Pythagoras but is here for completeness.  He may not have used some of these symbols--or at least not their names--but the symbols may be generally significant ones.

notes: 1. not 'root' in the sense of 'solution of an equation at 0,' but 'Mulaprakriti,' Skt., 'root Earth' (Platonic 'ideal form' of 'Earth element;' 'physical' universe) in infinite space--Blavatsky.

== The nature of symbolic grammar==

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One does not necessarily use the symbols in ch. 1 when a word or text is analyzed in a language such as Hebrew, Sanskrit, Greek, or Latin; one must be aware of other symbols such as ones more specific to the language: almost all languages (even with unnumbered alphabets) have their own structure&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;!--formative hyperlanguage--&gt; that with mathematics generate more words in the language that describe itself.  That is how the language and its literature can be interpreted.  A text may or may not have a deliberately hidden meaning.  One must use other scientific, preferably mathematical (probably as applied in a specific science, though a few may be abstract or social) symbolism to analyze the text.  In a few cases that has been done with several, mostly physical sciences applying various standard mathematics, and all of the isopsephy and particular scientific analysis of the resulting symbols implied one conclusion that had also been described elsewhere (long beforehand.)  Whether one understands or applies such conclusions is another matter.

notes: 1. 'structure' described in the rest of the sentence.  There is a citation from a website that may be anonymous research, but it is from primary Isopsephicy sources. (it will be cited when it is found out if the author uses a name: which is probably the case.)

== Exercises ==

1. Calculate gematria values of the following Greek words and check for any pattern.

a. επιθυμία&lt;br /&gt;
b. θυμος&lt;br /&gt;
c. φρήν&lt;br /&gt;
d. 'νοῦς;' 'νόος'

(hint: check if they were Koine.)


2. Calculate gematria values of the following Semitic or Hebrew words, and check for any pattern in the texts that have the first word in each pair compared with texts that have the second in each pair (&lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt;, etc.)
 
a. תֹ֙הוּ֙ and וָבֹ֔הוּ (find the relevant translation)&lt;br /&gt;
b. 'Tiamat' (look it up) and בְּהֵמוֹת


3*. The Wikipedia 'Tiamat' article says (apparently with incomplete citation) '... [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorkild Jacobsen] and [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter Burkert]... Burkert continues by making a linguistic connection to [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_(mythology)| Tethys]. ....'  Of course, try to verify that, but then try to see any connection to problem #1's answers.

&lt;nowiki&gt;* challenge problem (if you use arithmology for it, then do not assume a denotation solution exists.)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Re: clarification==

It is a start on a book about gematria, temurah, notarikon in the context of any language in which the alphabet traditionally doubled as numbers before the cultures had number characters, or at least their alphabets traditionally have numbers assigned to all letters so the 'value' of each word can be defined. That 'value' in text is evaluated in the context of both 'religion &amp; mythology' and Philosophy (at least the depth level of Theosophy.) Such arithmology is used to analyze both mythography (lit of religion of the masses except when the myths have reasonable--invariably esoteric--Philosophical scientific meaning) and 'Perennial Philosophy' (the few deep-thinking Philosophers agreeing across most/all eras and cultures, and who also analyze lit/mythography) the latter of who would have most use for this book, though neither the 'religious' nor 'scientific' masses have much/any use.  

I had written 1/2 more of the above paragraph and 2 more (in the previous edit of this page) but would like to know what was not clarified.  Perhaps the above is enough.--[[User:Dchmelik|Dchmelik]] ([[User talk:Dchmelik|talk]]) 13:20, 30 March 2009 (UTC)

== this entry is misclassified ==

I don't really think this should be on the linguistics page. It has nothing at all to do with the science of linguistics or the emprical study of language. It belongs in the same bin as numerology and other such things, wherever those are kept.[[Special:Contributions/68.149.172.95|68.149.172.95]] ([[User talk:68.149.172.95|discuss]]) 04:04, 11 June 2011 (UTC)
:Agreed! In the absence of a more suitable bin, I moved it to &quot;Folk religion&quot; for now. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 10:41, 11 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Sample XML File Using Standard XML Date Formats */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a timeline of event data.  Timelines show events in a horizontal scrolling view.

== Method ==
We will use the JavaScript client Timeline widgets provided by the [http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/wiki/Timeline Simile-Widgets project].  In this example we will be using the timeline 2.2.0 API calls.

To do this we need to transform a list of event dates into the proper formats and then create an HTML page that includes calls to the Simile JavaScript libraries.

Steps
# View sample Event XML File format
# View HTML template that loads XML file
# Create XQuery Function that generates the HTML template and loads the appropriate XML data file

Our first example will use a list of non-Duration Events (Instant Events).  We will explore duration events and other events in a future chapter.

We will then create a simple XQuery module with a single function that loads a simple timeline.

== Sample XML File Using Standard XML Date Formats ==
Most XML dates use ISO 8601 coding.  To use this format you must put in a date format attribute in the data file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;data date-time-format=&quot;iso8601&quot;&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2009-01-01&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
        First Day January, 2009
    &lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2009-01-01&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
        First Day of the Feb, 2009
    &lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the data file must specify the ISO8601 date formats that are used as the XML date format.

== HTML Driver Template ==

The sample HTML file shows how this XML file is loaded using the Timeline.loadXML() function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;http://static.simile.mit.edu/timeline/api-2.2.0/timeline-api.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script  type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
            &lt;![CDATA[
var tl;


function onLoad() {
   var eventSource = new Timeline.DefaultEventSource();
   var bandInfos = [
     Timeline.createBandInfo({
         eventSource:    eventSource,
         date:           &quot;Jan 01 2009 00:00:00 GMT&quot;,
         width:          &quot;70%&quot;, 
         intervalUnit:   Timeline.DateTime.MONTH, 
         intervalPixels: 100
     }),
     Timeline.createBandInfo({
         eventSource:    eventSource,

         intervalUnit:   Timeline.DateTime.YEAR, 
         intervalPixels: 200
     })
   ];
   bandInfos[1].syncWith = 0;
   bandInfos[1].highlight = true;
   
   tl = Timeline.create(document.getElementById(&quot;my-timeline&quot;), bandInfos);
   Timeline.loadXML(&quot;example-01.xml&quot;, function(xml, url) { eventSource.loadXML(xml, url); });
 }
 
 var resizeTimerID = null;
 function onResize() {
     if (resizeTimerID == null) {
         resizeTimerID = window.setTimeout(function() {
             resizeTimerID = null;
             tl.layout();
         }, 500);
     }
 }
 ]]&gt;
        &lt;/script&gt;  
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body onload=&quot;onLoad();&quot; onresize=&quot;onResize();&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Timeline Template&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;my-timeline&quot; style=&quot;height: 150px; border: 2px solid blue&quot;&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;noscript&gt;
            This page uses Javascript to show you a Timeline. Please enable Javascript in your browser to see the full page. Thank you.

Inappropriate user name.... an Admin might like to consider if it should be blocked now (currently no contributions)

&lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 12:17, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

== Collection loader fix ==

The message [[MediaWiki:Coll-bookscategory]] should be set to &quot;Collection&quot;.  This will fix the collection loader. Stored collection pages now automatically include a [[Template:saved_book]] at their beginning. Therefore you might also want to change [[MediaWiki:Coll-savedbook_template]].

== 24h block of [[User:Panic2k4]] ==

Panic has over the past ~5 months persisted in disruptive argumentation regarding [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?oldid=1382100#Request_for_administrative_action this request for administrative action] for which there is no consensus. In fact, it seems there is a consensus ''that there is no consensus about what action to take on that issue''. Several administrators have told him on several occasions that he should drop the issue until there ''is'' consensus among the book contributors and/or the wider community regarding what to do about the [[C++]] table of contents.

During those months, Panic has persistently argued contrary to consensus that administrative action is required (and bizarrely, that there is consensus to take administrative action - consensus is exactly the opposite), including un-archiving the section, and fooling our archive bot into leaving the section up ''long'' past it's normal lifespan (you can see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1382047 here] I undid that trick - since the bot relies on timestamps, the year 3008 means the section would never get archived).

Today, Swift tried to end this nonsense by closing the &quot;request&quot; and setting it to archive normally - Panic reverted this. I reverted, leaving him a clear message that this must end; he reverted again. I reverted, giving a final warning, which Panic failed to heed, so I've blocked him for 24h to prevent further disruption to this page.

This is for other administrators to review the block (though it is only 24h long), and to review the underlying issues of conduct (including my own, which involved minor edit warring). At this point, I have no opinion on whether the block should be removed, lengthened, or some other option - suggestions for ways forward are welcome. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:14, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

:Just an additional note that Panic has already placed an {{tlx|unblock}} request providing the reason &quot;Abuse of the categorization of disruptive behavior, I have the right to response calling or using the form of disruptive behavior to prevent objection to action or silence opposition is abuse of administrative power.&quot; I'd encourage discussion &amp; consensus here before further action. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:18, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

: I support the decision to block. In light of [[User:Panic2k4]]'s edits[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AReading_room%2FAdministrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1382002&amp;oldid=1381807][http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1382077&amp;oldid=1382047] I would suggest continuing the block until Panic2k4 agrees to leave the section alone. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 13:57, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

:My full support. This isn't anything new, it's classic bad-Panic behavior. He bullies and harasses his fellow editors until they leave in despair, and then he claims consensus because all people who have objected to his ideas have been forced to leave. You do not get what you want because you've harassed all the people who disagree with you until they leave. You cannot manufacture consensus though this type of guerrilla warfare. We have preious few editors and authors, and we should all be saddened when anybody is forced to leave this project through harassment and bullying like this. Beyond that issue, you cannot force an admin to take any action at all: we are not robots and we do not click our buttons when commanded to. If you ask an admin to unprotect a page and they choose not to, the discussion is over: you cannot force the admin to act, even if you harass them diligently over the course of several months. I support Mike's 24hr block, and I would support a significantly longer block as well if somebody felt the need to implement it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:03, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
::As stated below Mike.lifeguard is largely exaggerating and twisting the facts. I know there is no love lost between us Whiteknight, but indeed you seem to jump at every opportunity to suppress opposition to what is from the beginning a poisoned and indefensible issue, your lack of ability to recognize your limitation and even errors is appalling, in that I'm a better man here, since I did and do recognize my own errors. Our personal divergence is primarily based on core policy issues and procedures but your inability to recognize yours (and others) application of a dual standards as a weapon makes us antagonists, while I'm able to deal and contest your approach you seem impelled to disregard even common sense to get rid of me, this is not being inclusive and beneficial to the project. Even if you disagree with my viewpoints I deserve the same consideration than yourself. 
::&quot;He bullies and harasses his fellow editors until they leave in despair...&quot;, this is '''false statement''', if you are referring to Paddu his statement is still present on wikibooks, that didn't take during the arbitration also, in any case I'm here since 2004 if I'm such a pest I should already have lots of &quot;normal&quot; Wikibookians after my hide, since I do tend to provide the opportunity for anyone to support your claims, sadly what we see is that only a handful of admins that aren't even contributors (I mean of content), even Darklama has a bone to pick with me since I started to object to giving the him admin flag (you can calculate how sorry I am I changed my mind on that, on your request), since he used the tools to cause all this freaking mess...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:57, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

: I'm not sure about the first. Panic has persisted in argumentation. He has been disruptive[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AReading_room%2FAdministrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1382002&amp;oldid=1381807][http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1382077&amp;oldid=1382047], but maybe not persistently so throughout these five months.
: As for the second, the four participants who touched on the issue ([[User:Mike.lifeguard]], [[User:Darklama]], [[User:Whiteknight]] and [[User:Swift]]) all agreed that there wasn't a basis for the requested administrative action. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:39, 20 January 2009 (UTC)
::Didn't see your defense of Mike's actions (and don't fully understand why you are defending other people actions), but will  address it, btw this format is freaking hard to navigate and post due to the size of the thread. The points you make is about the present action 1 revert and an attempt to comment on the close action can't be defined as disruptive to the project. Not even to the discussion since it was stalled...
::Administrative Action is required on the basis that a proposal was advanced and formally approved and is up for implementation (whatever concerns are raised on the above discussion fall to ground since the proposal was first advanced to  resolve the inability of admins to fallow the same or similar rules they now claim necessary or best practice), this is an oblique approach to the problem, there are several other methods left to see the issue resolved, since no one seems to want to to deal with the issue directly.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

''&quot;...it seems there is a consensus that there is no consensus about what action to take on that issue.&quot;''&lt;br&gt; - This is a '''contradictory statement, nonsensical''' and in line with a post above by Mike.lifeguard ''&quot;I see a consensus among several administrators that the issue is ended - you're simply disrupting the project at this point.&quot;'', objection to this kind of logic seems obvious....&lt;br&gt;
This also makes the subsequent phrase null ''&quot;Panic has persistently argued contrary to consensus that administrative action is required...&quot;'' since there is no consensus to start with, more Mike.lifeguard seems to disregard that consensus is only archived by discussion or lack of it (but removing or silencing a party consensus is not archived). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:25, 18 January 2009 (UTC)
: The statement is not contradictory. The &quot;''no consensus about what action to take on that issue''&quot; refers to the issue raised by Panic on the C++ talk page. The &quot;it seems there is a consensus...&quot; refers to Panic's request to administrative assistance.
: I can't see any better than that Mike's comments are grammatically well formed and free of spelling errors. His opinion should be obvious to anyone willing to understand his point of view. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:39, 20 January 2009 (UTC)
:: The issues are one and the same in any case I haven't decontextualised the quotes. The nonexistence of consensus is be default a lack of consensus I don't blame you  for not making sense of the phrases I can't also  '''&quot;regarding this request for administrative action for which there is no consensus. In fact, it seems there is a consensus that there is no consensus about what action to take on that issue.&quot;''' clearly is referring to the request for administrative action. One could argue that Mike was attempting to state something on the lines of &quot;we agree to disagree&quot; but consensus implies more that an agreement it implies non disagreement...
:: I still feel funny replying to you reply to my reply to Mike's actions, thought processes and the utter mess he made of the issue. But you put me in a position on having to reply to you, and next probably to Mike.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 20 January 2009 (UTC)   

''&quot;...including un-archiving the section, and fooling our archive bot into leaving the section up long past it's normal lifespan...&quot;''&lt;br&gt;
- This is '''misleading''' there was no attempt to fool the bot (the bot is not a human) and my comment and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Swift#2008_-.3E_3008 further talk with Swift made it clear that I wasn't attempting to elude anyone], but working in good faith to preserve an open issue on the table.&lt;br&gt;PS: I strongly object that the Administrative Assistance page being automatically archived since the bot isn't capable of detecting open and closed issues, it only detects that posts have not been replied to in 30 days.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:40, 18 January 2009 (UTC)
: This may be a semantic difference. Not only people can be fooled. Nor is there an implicit allegation of malicious intent. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:39, 20 January 2009 (UTC)
:: I take &quot;fooling&quot; as implying malice, just because the root of the word &quot;fool&quot;, to make a fool of some one or indicating mischievous action for kicks or profit, and it is derogative to my person (not the bot), I can admit that it probably wasn't a conscious attempt of attack, and I didn't take it as such but it is indeed conductive to associations, that I was  attempting to elude or make some action illusive, a better wording could easily have been used.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

''&quot;Today, Swift tried to end this nonsense by closing the &quot;request&quot; and setting it to archive normally- Panic reverted this.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

I'm closing this. There is evidently no consensus.&quot; is correct but Swift shouldn't close unresolved issues, the only way to archive consensus is by discussion and the request is open ended it isn't only to present administrators but to future ones also, the request isn't the problem the problem is what lead to the request, extinguishing this request will not address the underlaying problem, and so I (again) reverted Swift edit.&lt;br&gt;PS: I've been talking to Swift privately on the issue and since this was the second &quot;reversion&quot; he understood my objection to the archival.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:52, 18 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
The sequence of revert actions and the taking part on those reversals by Mike.lifeguard isn't fully explained and is incorrectly stated, the last reversal wasn't a reversal (or the last two, whatever you count as a reversal, I didn't &quot;revert&quot; Mike.lifeguard's edits), but Mike.lifeguard prevented me to add a reply inside the boxed statement (1 reversal) I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AReading_room%2FAdministrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1382092&amp;oldid=1382080 made one outside of the box (2 reversal)], there was no real edit conflict (if we discount Mike.lifeguard's attempts to impede me to reply to his closing statement).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:01, 18 January 2009 (UTC)
: This is neither misleading nor does it make any assumptions of my motives beyond what I stated in my edit and summary.
: &quot;''Swift shouldn't close unresolved issues''&quot; It wasn't an unresolved issue. Every administrator that had touched this for five months had resolved that the request should not be granted.
: I think you're the only one who interprets this page that way. You are free to raise the issue with individual administrators or here again at a later date once you feel the atmosphere has changed.
::Even if I didn't noticed your post (and don't know if Mike saw it also, since we never restored it), and due to your own actions on the subject, and since someone just pointed that I may have been set up on all of this (again), '''I request that you make good on your own intentions to address the issue''', since there is yet again, a strange coordination of actions, you make the first edit, removing the lock on the bot, we reach an understanding that I don't what the issue closed undressed, you contact me privately (feel free to post our conversation, without personal information) stating a wish to attempt to resolve the issue, I agreed to give all information you may require from the beginning or the end of the underlaying issue (being the end the request for administrative action) and you came and close the issue without a further word to me, this seems to you normal or being in any way helpful? I now see it all as very bizarre even more after Mike's intervention in the extremes, the block and all this fuzz about a discussion that was stalled for so long, and now you are taking an active part defending not only Mike's over the top actions, abusive declaration and being yourself extremely confrontational with me, what is the response you expect of me in all this ?
::I'm calm and am able to address any issue, if you feel you need a timeout please take it and consider it all calmly, and if you wish to address the C++ Programming issue then I'll be available (even to admit to more errors on my part).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 20 January 2009 (UTC) 

There are several issues wrong with this block, things that were previously understood as bad practice on performing a block:
#) block comments should be extremely well thought, and carefully written since it goes into a permanent log, even if I object to the rational behind the action, this last block has an error on the comment, ''&quot;persistent disruption on WB:AN&quot;'' should be ''&quot;persistent disruption on WB:AA&quot;'', this is the stated reason for this bock action.
#) Mike.lifeguard block on what he interpreted as disruption is by default wrongly stated (as countered above) and was badly addressed, I did not engaged in any revert war (commonly established as a violation of the unwritten 3RR), I did &quot;revert&quot; Swift edit but the user (an admin himself) did not state any opposition to my action nor did he revert it back, if any, the actions of Mike.lifeguard should be themselves be classified as disruptive and uncalled for, ultimately an abuse of his admin flag.
#) I did not engage in blatant vandalism, uncivil action or any other reason the would require a block action without previous warning stating a block as a possible outcome, the above post that Mike.lifeguard seems to understand as a proper warning was done in parallel with the actions he seems to object but be partial to, and wrongly stated on the &quot;warning&quot;, the only time I unarchived the still open request was when the bot first archived the unclosed issue  making ''&quot;Continually bringing it back is disruptive.&quot;'' a twisted viewpoint of the facts, at most I have been exerting normal efforts to keep the request opened since the underlaying problem was not resolved and in reality causes problems to the project (since the book is among the  the most actively used works here), and several Wikibookians (users, not editors) have stated a wish to have the navigational/structural problem resolved, this is the goal of the request still pending...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:52, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

:#) Block comments should ideally be indicative of the block motive. I see no problem with this latest one. Both [[WB:AA]] and [[WB:AN]] redirect to the same page.
:#) The block statement isn't about a revert war, but a persistent disruption.
:#: The history of this is: After spotting that the [[Wikibooks:Administrators' discussion index]] wasn't being updated properly, I fixed what I thought was a mistake[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1371303&amp;oldid=1371016], Panic reverted that[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1371303] and contacted me about it[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASwift&amp;diff=1371765&amp;oldid=1369441]. We later discussed this and other related issues on IRC and I decided to look into this seemingly unresolved matter. After reviewing the issue and reading up on whatever relevant information I could find, I closed the issue with a summary of my findings[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1381807&amp;oldid=1380863]. Panic reverted this, removing my comment[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AReading_room%2FAdministrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1382002&amp;oldid=1381807]. Mike re-closed it more explicitly[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1382043] but Panic undid that as well[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1382077&amp;oldid=1382047]. So, it didn't start out as disruptive, but surely ended that way.
:#) I disagree with your notion that these efforts of yours are &quot;normal&quot;. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:39, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

:::You are right on point 1 I didn't open the page (the redirect is there), sorry about it, but it is nevertheless confusing.
:::On point 2 I never claimed it was a revert war (just to the contrary) and that it wasn't a disruption at least I don't think altering a single char (warning) is in any way a continued disruption of the project (sorry about your closing post, I've covered that below), or that I can't express my objections in or after the closing of an issue on the same thread (block). Do you agree with the disruption argument? Was I being disruptive (characterized by unrest or disorder or insubordination) to the project ? Not to him or you, I'm no subordinate and know of no any special authority possessed by admins, I'm not obligated to agree or silently comply with others actions, and we (Mike and me) haven't swamped a word on this more than it stated on that discussion. I'm however free to express my discontent and opposition to the action, this was what Mike blocked me from. 
:::On point 3 (Panic reverted this, removing my comment[10]) I hadn't seen your post at the bottom (only the change of the number and the edit's comment), nor was my intention to remove it, I've only noticed that I removed it now, it was indeed a mistake on my part and I acknowledge it. Had Mike talked to me or reverted my revert I probably would have noticed it (and would never revert a revert, without a deep discussion) but Mike's '''&quot;Not happening. Panic: this means you.&quot;''' edit (he also didn't restore your post at the end of the discussion, don't know if he noticed it also) just rose to my nose and I never checked back, in any case this doesn't invalidate that Mike's intervention was not called for, since you would have called me on it, or I would come to see it, anyway I was going to talk to you about it), if any disruptive action to the project occurred it was Mike's uncalled for and clearly over the edge intervention and the way he has gone about it.
:::In any case ''mea culpa'' on missing your post...
:::You also overstate somewhat my actions (but Panic undid that as well[12]), I didn't undo or revert, I moved his comment up and added my response, and you are missing two reverts of Mike, one to that (12) and another one after I added the reply to the bottom of the thread, this is just to be complete about the script. 
:::On point 3 how do you keep an issue on the table then? Would you have me adding to that thread each 28 days, or repost a request each 3 months ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:32, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

:::# &quot;Confusing&quot;? No, it's not. It's very simple to check what it was that Mike was referring to.
:::# Then you shouldn't have brought it up! Mike certainly didn't accuse you of any such behaviour. Stop this unrelated verbiage trying to paint yourself as some sort of victim of injustice.
:::# &quot;''mea culpa''&quot;?
:::: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 2em; color: red&quot;&gt;&quot;''mea culpa''&quot;?&lt;/span&gt;
:::: So the reason for this whole mess is that you made a mistake? And you think this is somehow a defence for your action? And this after the link to the diff has been presented four times already in relevant discussions[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1382475][http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1382480][http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1382496][http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1382972], even on your own userpage (where [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Panic2k4&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1382883 another comment] specifically refers to it and doesn't make sense if there wasn't one) and you're only noticing it now?!
:::: I'm starting to see the pattern here. You seem to go through these discussions living in some sort of a fantasy world where other people's opinions aren't worth paying any close attention to, at the same time writing your long-winded, often obscure dribble which numerous people have found misleading. Misleading because you don't seem to have a very firm grasp of what's going on around you.
:::: You had better take a long, hard look in the proverbial mirror, Panic. Unless you re-examine how you interact with others and take to heart some of the criticisms that have been raised against you this is bound to happen again. When it does, you'll find yourself without many friends to back you. And that is not because you've failed to play politics; paying homage to the almighty admins or trade favours. No, every person I know of that has interacted with you and observed how you work has independendly concluded that you're damaging the project. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:00, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

*reset so it is easier to read.

I didn't check (the link), I only read it and concluded that AN is different than AA (I'm not an admin so I'm not to familiar with the new names). I could have checked but didn't, but I didn't make a great deal out of it only pointed to it being an issue (and personally I do think it's confusing and don't see the advantage of pointing to a redirect)...&lt;br&gt;
I don't understand why you are doing such a grand production of this I do acknowledge your right to be as disgusted as you like by me having reverted your edit and having lost your post, I already acknowledged that error and expressed my regret for that loss, but I don't see it as a valid motive for Mike (or even you as the one I could have offended) to execute a block because of it...&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand you are again overstating my words «'''[[w:Mea culpa|&quot;mea culpa&quot;]] on missing your post...&quot;'''» is just that an acknowledgment of my error or guilt on that issue, maybe you are confusing it to &quot;mea ultima culpa&quot; but in any case I'm not acknowledging any special guilt or admitting that my actions validated in any way the exaggerations of Mike and now yours (even if you have a reason to be annoyed at me for that lapse, this is just going over the edge), even after I clearly admitted to the deeds and been clear about it (I said I would do it, I just human and this is not my full time job), but I will only go as far as promising to be more careful next time and consider giving your name to my first born but no further...&lt;br&gt;
&quot;every person I know of that has interacted with you and observed how you work has independendly concluded that you're damaging the project.&quot; this is a grave accusation, and I would like you to address that issue, I did have my bad moments (heck I've been here since 2004, I would be surprised if you haven't got into anyone bad side at times also, I know other people have), even so I don't see myself as special or particularly dangerous Wikibookian. beside engaging people on issues I think as important whatever they are, first was the need to support multiple books on the same subject, even book renames due to special chars and the colon and the other convention so yes I've been around and I do know exactly were things could have gone better (on my side of the argument and on the other users side). I doubt any other Wikibookian has had his actions as thoroughly examined as mine, they even got to Paddu (my first argument on Wikibooks), had the book in VfD, WK called all the stated copyright authors on it the full service one can get here. I have no problems looking at the mirror, I've always been consistent and as clear as I can, nothing to hide or second intentions, but I still think that you didn't act correctly on closing the unresolved issue and your support and encouragement of Mike's actions on this issue, especially after we talked about it, to fully comprehend my frustration about your action I remind your initial message to me as interested in resolving the core problem.&lt;br&gt;
Any sane person sees and I've stated many times before that this festering issue originated from a abusive action. An admin knowing that I objected to the action, unprotected the cover page, moved it and made changes the edit histories of both pages, this during a time I was being unlawfully blocked due in part to some interactions with the same admin on actions on the same book. Of note is that previously to this events I did object granting the admin flag to that same admin. I can't understand how those actions can and have been so long supported and my and other Wikibookians request for restoration ignored, but again as I stated before I'll drop the issue for another year or so...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:19, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

: Instead of guessing or assuming you know what Mike.lifeguard meant by &quot;there is consensus that there is no consensus&quot;, why not ask him for clarification? I think the intended meaning was that a) those who responded to your request all agreed that you had failed to prove that consensus had been established to change the state of the C++ book, b) by agreeing that you have failed to prove your request a valid one, consensus has been established to deny your request, c) by denying your request a decision has been reached and your request responded to in the negative as {{not done}}. No further response or action is required when a decision is that nothing is to be done, but don't respond to me, ask Mike.lifeguard, if you think I am wrong about what Mike.lifeguard meant. Undermining a decision is disruptive and that is what I (and probably others) see you as having done. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:23, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

::I do believe that he is reading (or ignoring this thread) he is free to do as he wishes, I don't see any reason to engage him personally, beside my first comments, specially since I'm a bit mad about his actions on this, a simple talk to me would have avoided it all, so I will avoid to talk to him on this subject too.
::On a) I have argued that consensus was archived by lack of opposition (I think you have argued otherwise but you and most community process have always worked as I describe it so the point is not defensible, I think you haven't argued contrary to this)&lt;br&gt;
::On b) if my request is in any way invalid no one stated where or how besides pointing a).
::On c) no one denied anything beside to act on the request, this is not the same as denied the request, to have the request denied one would have to prove something is wrong with the process that lead to the request (no argumentations concluded that), I wouldn't even require a consensus if someone pointed out a that the process was invalid (and acted on it, that includes any and all similar actions taken previous on the same mold, I don't see anyone wanting that or even sustainable therefore we have, this lets do nothing situation), and here we are because point b) and a) was never addressed beyond the introductory section or with any conviction (and support in practice and especially by actions of the Wikibookians defending them, another impossible situation), what we have here is a catch22 (the motivation for this state of things is even a greater problem for me, and what really motivates me on this issue more than the problem the situation causes to the book or the project), since your initial action was objectionable under the normal practices or you disagree with that point? If you can support or justify those actions with any valid logic I'll quit pushing for a solution. If not revert them and we are done that is all I'm requesting from the start. It all falls to you granting me the same right and respect you call to yourself, I objected and you forced the issue, strangely you got away with it... In any case at a personal level I do believe that you agree that the situation itself is of no benefit to anyone.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:57, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

:::I left you a note which you pointedly ignored while reverting the thread. At the time it was originally opened, several administrators, myself among them, told in no uncertain terms that we were not going to fulfil your request, and we gave our reasons. That several of us all concluded the exact same thing (that no action should be taken) constitutes a consensus which you have repeatedly failed to accept. The idea that you can simply propose the same thing multiple times without taking into account previous disagreement is a bizarre reversal of the concept of consensus.
:::The current situation regarding the book is a problem, however that doesn't necessitate doing &quot;something, anything&quot; - instead, it requires gaining consensus to do one particular thing (vs other possibilities). This has been exactly what multiple administrators have told you since you placed the request, and it hasn't changed. Bring me a conversation that shows appropriate consensus to do some particular thing about the situation, and I'll do it. Until then, asking for the same thing for which there is no consensus (and multiple administrators agree that there is no consensus to do it) is disruptive. Ultimately, this refusal to accept that you need to gain consensus on this issue, and persistence in making repeated requests contrary to consensus is the disruption that brought us here. I think you will find that the community has limited patience for this sort of nonsense. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:30, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

::::We all understood that all admins that expressed any opinion on the discussion refused to address the issue (not only the proposal itself but the problem behind the proposal, we all understood it and that is why it was stalled, I never refused to address the issue). I think I stated there, that this was an approach to the issue that would save face to all parties (if not directly here I stated that on Darklama's talk page I even reshaped the solution to cover James objection to the aborted VfD) the simple fact that we are talking about the issue demonstrates that nothing is closed or can remain unaddresse, since the issue does need of a solution, hence my opposition to closing the request.&lt;br&gt;
::::None of the reasons advanced for the refusals to take action were valid, just because people opted out from taking action or continue the dialog the problem still prevails, nor does it give any party an upper hand on the subject, since all arguments given to maintain the situation had any real merit, but that is stated above so I will nor rehash it here, no response was given to my last arguments (as can be seen above), since the positions taken are indefensible, if we do require a consensus to take action then the original sin was done without consensus (and we get to a circular logic based on dual standards, what should be valid now should have been valid since the beginning of the base problem). It isn't even my intention to establish blame since we all had a part on it. I do recognize my errors even on dealing with you on the speedy deletion issue and the way I attempted to corner you, by strong arguments into a indefensible situation were you wrongly but within your rights attempted to pass it along to a VfD (both agreed that it would cause more problem, especially due to James asynchronous participation on it and agreed to abort that procedure, even under objections of another Wikibookian), I fully understand, and I'm sorry to have caused you some stress at that time, and do recognize you did attempt to engage the issue even if you ultimately failed to act acordingly to normal procedure.
::::The problem can now be addressed only from the beginning or the backwards. 
::::#Was the initial action of Darklama consensual and in accordance to normal practice or in any way productive? Clearly not.
::::#Should the last book proposal to resolve the issue be considered valid? I do think so, it has been valid in the past, even Darklama used that same formal procedure in a very similar way (to remove the old navigational scheme for instance, were the other party was absent) since the normal decission process only requires objection not participation. The above advanced theory that users must state a position is not common practice.
::::Given those as the only approaches to the problem and they are mutually exclusive, since we must require consensus to implement the alteration and that makes action (1) unlawful or we accept the last proposal (2) as valid, but both lead to reestablishing the toc the it's original location, both do respect the only objection on the table that is not delete toc2, to what never objected as a concept, if Wikibookians working on the book in the future decide by the formal process or by exclusive consensus to alter the tocs so be it, I never opposed such outcome if done on those terms were all have a say.
::::If we ignore the issue again I can only envision two solutions on my part in the future (since there is no way to force a consensus with inexistent second party), to request the admin tools required to do the changes on the same grounds Darklama did it (even if I consider it distasteful, but it is being validated by the present inaction), and the tools are there to be requested on such needs by policy (and since there is no other active and constant contributor to the book to object to them) or I claim to be the only contributor to the work that can claim to have been actively and constantly contributing to it (since there isn't another contributor to the work in the same situation, or near it) and again request the changes, this solution is supported by common practice on Wikibooks. I personally don't like any of these options.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:32, 21 January 2009 (UTC)

: A new year and new attacks on Panic?  Or is it Panic up to his usual tricks and annoying administrators to the brink of long term blocks.  Panic has contributed to Wikibooks for a number of years and has benefited the Wikibooks community.  Considering his/her thousands of edits only a small percentage of these can be described as a nuisance.  I notice again that people are talking about 'long term blocks' and not unblocking until 'he has apologised / mended his ways / stopped trying to change things' or whatever.  This is all reminicent of the battles of 2008 (or was it 2007).  But as blocks seem to be attracted to Panic maybe he/she needs to address whatever s/he might be doing that is pissing people off so much.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:06, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

'''Hi Admins and complainants alike!'''&lt;br /&gt;
This lengthy fixated diatribe and its responses do little to engender confidence in the stability of the Wikibooks family.   Might I suggest that all of the parties cease, with a view to getting on with business?   An example of the business that I had in mind might include, but not necessarily be limited to, the removal of the foul user names from items elsewhere on this page.   These reading rooms are used by individuals of all ages and I am surprised that they continue to be displayed.   Perhaps such sensitive details could be handled at a different level, when the very obvious distraction and delay that this ''Panic'' issue poses can be put aside!   I thank you, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 15:22, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

: Hi Armchair. I assure you that few of those who have engaged in this discussion have done so lightly or drawn much pleasure from it. Feel free to read through this saga of the past several years and you'll see that proposing people just stop engaging in this discussion (which has actually been quite calm as of late) isn't as simple, or productive, as you may think. Simply ignoring it is a tried and failed approach in this case. Do not think for one moment that we've approached this lightly; nor that we think this reflects well on our community. Far from it. In fact, I entered this whole mess because I feel it is a poor stain on this community and would gladly see it mended. As a piece in road to that end, I proposed a solution to break the recent impasse so that we could move on.
: Which failed miserably.
: But not without a serious commitment; spending hours upon hours reading up on past issues, proposing solutions to moving things on and discussing the aftermath of all this. I found your {{tl|caution}} on this therefore offensive, though I'm sure it wasn't intended as such. I would possibly have proposed something similar myself, but now I know better. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;I have, not without any thought, reformatted [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AReading_room%2FAdministrative_Assistance&amp;diff=1404298&amp;oldid=1398308 it] as a regular comment. Feel free to revert that, but please consider how condecending it may come across as.&lt;/span&gt;

If there is a way to acknowledge other people's contribution, I am keen to have it done. I explained in more detail in [[:w:Talk:BKL singularity]] the reasons for having two articles: one in Wikipedia and one in Wikibooks. The main reason is that the article in Wikipedia became too long and too technical. I decided to shorten and make more accessible the Wikipedia article while providing the more advanced readers with the option to look for math and proofs in the Wikibooks article which I intend to expand and give intermediate calculations.

=Address=
==Internal==
Internal addresses describe the combinatorial structure of the Mandelbrot set.

===angled===
Angled internal address is an extension of internal address 

=Angle=

* &lt;math&gt; \Phi(c) \,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/boettcher | Boettcher function]]

=== external ===
The external angle is a angle of point of set's exterior. It is the same on all points on [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#External_ray|the external ray]]

===internal=== 
The internal angle is an angle of point of component's interior
* it is a rational number and proper fraction measured in turns 
* it is  the same for all point on [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Internal_ray|the internal ray]] 
* in a contact point ( root point ) it agrees with [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Rotation_number|the rotation number]]
* root point has internal angle 0


&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{p}{q} \in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;

===plain===
The plain angle is an agle of complex point = it's argument  &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Arg (mathematics)|argument of complex number]] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Units==
* turns
* degrees
* radians

==Number types==
Angle ( for example external angle in turns ) can be used in different [[Fractals/Mathematics/Numerical#Number_type|number types]]

&quot;In contrast to a phase portrait, the return map is a discrete description of the underlying dynamics. ....

Persson , C.D. Wagner]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;If x is a periodic point of period p for f and U is a neighborhood of x, the composition  &lt;math&gt;f^{\circ p}\,&lt;/math&gt;  maps U to another neighborhood V of x.

===Center of Siegel Disc===
Center of Siegel disc is a irrationally indifferent periodic point.

Mane's theorem : 

&quot;... appart from its center, a Siegel disk cannot contain any periodic point, critical point, nor any iterated preimage of a critical or periodic point. On the other hand it can contain an iterated image of a critical point.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~cheritat/Exposes/Rome.pdf Siegel disks by Xavier Buff and Arnaud Ch ́ritat e Univ.

==Critical point ==

A  critical point&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Critical point (mathematics)|wikipedia : Critical point (mathematics)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt; z_{cr} \,&lt;/math&gt; in the dynamical plane such that the [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Derivative|derivative]] vanishes:

: &lt;math&gt;f_c'(z_{cr}) = 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since

: &lt;math&gt;f_c'(z) = \frac{d}{dz}f_c(z) = 2z &lt;/math&gt;

implies

: &lt;math&gt; z_{cr} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

we see that the only (finite) critical point of &lt;math&gt;f_c \,&lt;/math&gt; is the point &lt;math&gt; z_{cr} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is an initial point for Mandelbrot set iteration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathesim.degruyter.de/jws_en/show_simulation.php?id=1052&amp;type=RoessMa&amp;lang=en Java program by Dieter Röß showing result of changing initial point of Mandelbrot iterations]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cut point''' k of set S is a point for which set S-k is dissconected ( consist of 2 or more sets).&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Cut-point|Cut point in wikipedia]] &lt;/ref&gt;
This name is used in a topology.

Examples :
* root points of Mandelbrot set
* Misiurewicz points of boundary of Mandelbrot set
* cut points of Julia sets ( in case of [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/siegel|Siegel disc]] critical point is a cut point )

These points are landing points of 2 or more external rays.

Point which is a landing point of 2 external rays is called '''biaccesible'''


'''Cut ray''' is a ray which converges to landing point of another ray. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www-gat.univ-lille1.fr/~roesch/Newt.pdf On local connectivity for the Julia set of rational maps : Newton’s famous example By P. Roesch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pinching points==
&quot;'''Pinching points'''  are found as the common landing points of external rays, with exactly one ray landing between two 
consecutive branches. They are used to cut M or K into well-defined components, and to build topological models for these sets in a combinatorial way. &quot; ( definition from Wolf Jung program Mandel )

&lt;math&gt;Q_2 = f_c^2(0) = c^2 + c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_3 = f_c^3(0) = (c^2 + c)^2 + c \,&lt;/math&gt;

These polynomials are used for finding :
* centers of period n Mandelbrot set components. Centers are roots of n-th critical polynomials &lt;math&gt;centers = \{ c : f_c^n(z_{cr}) = 0 \}\,&lt;/math&gt; ( points where [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Critical_curves|critical curve]] Qn croses x axis )

=Portrait=

There are two types of orbit portraits: primitive and satellite.  &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Orbit_portrait|wikipedia : Orbit portrait ]]&lt;/ref&gt;If  
&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the valence of an orbit portrait &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the recurrent ray period, then these two types may be characterized as follows:
* Primitive orbit portraits have &lt;math&gt;r = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v = 2&lt;/math&gt;.  Every ray in the portrait is mapped to itself by &lt;math&gt;f^n&lt;/math&gt;.  Each &lt;math&gt;A_j&lt;/math&gt; is a pair of angles, each in a distinct orbit of the doubling map.  In this case, &lt;math&gt;r_{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; is the base point of a baby Mandelbrot set in parameter space.
* Satellite ( non-primitive ) orbit portraits have &lt;math&gt;r = v \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, all of the angles make up a single orbit under the doubling map.  Additionally,  &lt;math&gt;r_{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; is the base point of a parabolic bifurcation in parameter space.

[[File:Target set for internal ray 0.ogv|right|thumb|How target set is changing along internal ray 0 ]]

===Elliptic case ===
[[File:Critical Orbit 0;3,2,1000,1... .png|right|thumb|Target set in elliptic case = inner circle]]
For [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/siegel|the  elliptic dynamics]], when there is a Siegel disc, the target set is [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/siegel#Inner_radius|an inner circle]]

===Hyperbolic case===
'''Infinity''' is allways hyperbolic attractor for forward iteration of polynomials. Target set here is an exterior of any shape containing all point of Julia set ( and it's interior). There are also other hyperbolic attractors.


In case of forward iteration '''target set''' &lt;math&gt;T\,&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary set on dynamical plane containing [[w:Point_at_infinity|infinity]] and not containing points of filled Julia set. 

For escape time algorithms target set determines the shape of level sets and curves. It does not do it for other methods.

====Exterior of circle====

This is typical target set. It is exterior of circle with center at [[w:Origin (mathematics)| origin]] &lt;math&gt;z = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; and radius =ER :


&lt;math&gt;T_{ER}=\{z:abs(z) &gt; ER \} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Radius is named '''escape radius''' ( ER ) or '''bailout value'''.

Circle of radius=ER centered at the origin is : &lt;math&gt; \{z:abs(z) = ER \} \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Exterior of square====

Here target set is exterior of [[w:square|square]] of side length &lt;math&gt;s\, &lt;/math&gt;  centered at [[w:origin|origin]] 

&lt;math&gt;T_s=\{z: abs(re(z)) &gt; s  ~~\mbox{or}~~  abs(im(z))&gt;s \} \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Parabolic case ===
In the [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/parabolic|parabolic case]] target set is a '''petal'''


==Trap==

Trap is an another name of [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Target_set|the target set]].
It is a set which captures any orbit tending to point inside the trap ( fixed / [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Periodic_point|periodic point]] ).

=Test=

==Bailout test==
[[File:Filled.jpg|right|thumb|Two sets after bailout test: escaping white and non-escaping black]]
[[File:DistanceToFixed.png|right|thumb|Distance to fixed point for various types of dynamics]]

It is used to check if point z on [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set|dynamical plane]] is escaping to infinity or not. It allows to find 2 sets : 
* escaping points ( it should be also the whole basing of attraction to infinity)&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Escaping set|wikipedia : Escaping set]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* not escaping points ( it should be the complement of basing of attraction to infinity)

In practice for given IterationMax and Escape Radius :
* some pixels from set of not escaping points may contain points that escape after more iterations then IterationMax ( increase IterMax )
* some pixels from escaping set may contain points from thin filaments not choosed by maping from integer to world  ( use DEM )
 

If &lt;math&gt;z_n&lt;/math&gt; is in the target set &lt;math&gt;T\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is escaping to infinity ( bailouts ) after n [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/q-iterations|forward iterations]] ( steps).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/bailout.html fractint doc : bailout]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''output''' of test can be :
* boolean ( yes/no)
* integer :  integer number (value of the last iteration)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Chickpea|Chickpea]]

This dish is a chickpea-vegetable [[Cookbook:Curry|curry]], which will make a full meal when served with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

==Ingredients==

Serves 6.

* 150 grams of dry or 500 grams of cooked [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]]

* 2-3 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] chopped to make 2-3 cups
* 2 cups of vegetable [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]

* Enough [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]], chopped, to make 2-3 cups
* 6-8 medium [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], chopped, or 2-3 cups of canned tomatoes
* 1 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], chopped
* 1 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]], finely chopped
* 4-6 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced

* 4 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]], crunchy, unsweetened
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] (Optional, can replace salt)

* (Optional for garnish) 2 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] sprig, finely chopped

== Procedure ==

* If using dry chickpeas, wash, then soak for 12 hours, then cook 40-50 minutes until soft or for 8-10 minutes in a pressure cooker. If using a pressure cooker, do not depressurize but let the cool down; depressurizing causes the chickpeas to break open.

* Prepare all vegetables.

* Cook onions in the broth until softened.
* Add all vegetables (zucchini, tomatoes, bell pepper, chili pepper, garlic) and cook for 10-15 minutes, until peppers and zucchini are soft.
* (During this time, start boiling the rice.)
* Add chickpeas, peanut butter and spices, soy sauce.
* Keep simmering for 5-10 more minutes.

* (Optional) sprinkle with cilantro garnish. 
* Serve immediately.

== Optional / Replacements ==

* If a very thick sauce is desired, cook longer. The zucchini will disintegrate, thickening the sauce.
* If you used dry chickpeas, use the cooking water and broth half and half, instead of pure broth.
* The [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] can be replaced by [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]] or completely omitted if a less spicy dish is desired.
* To get a stronger taste, use up to 2 tsp. each of coriander, turmeric, cumin.
* Add 2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|Garam masala]] for a more authentic taste.

}}

The 4007 integrated circuit contains three complementary enhancement-mode [[:en:MOSFET|MOSFET]] pairs. One pair has connections to the drain terminals, one to the source terminals and the commonned drains (i.e. it is wired as an inverter) and one allows access to all source and drain connections. All pairs have the gate terminals commonned and available. The bulk connections are to the power rails (V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; for the p-channel devices and V&lt;sub&gt;SS&lt;/sub&gt; for the n-channel devices).

The meanings of the abbreviations on the diagrams to the right are:
{|class=wikitable style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
!width=80|Pins!!Functions
|-
|S&lt;sub&gt;P2&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;P3&lt;/sub&gt; || Source terminals of 2nd and 3rd p-channel MOSFETs
|-
|D&lt;sub&gt;P1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;P2&lt;/sub&gt; || Drain terminals of 1st and 2nd p-channel MOSFETs

      <text xml:space="preserve">Myth: Drinking and Drug use make sex much more fun; Wrong. Drinking is bad... Worse then some other drugs; Illegal; Common side effect is disorientation, Increase in chance to contract an STD

Common Myth: Drinking and Drug Use make sexual Activity more fun

People under the effects of drugs and alcohol use generally do not know the difference between what is really fun, and what is dangerous. It is a commonly held fact that while under the influence of drugs a person often feels happier. The same goes for uncontrolled Drinking, as it is known to limit a persons ability to judge what is good for them, and what is bad for them. Though it is possible that drinking and drug use coupled with sexual activity may &quot;More Fun&quot; the repercussions of what could happen are highly hazardous. Invariably, at parties where there is no parental supervision, kids are sometimes faced with the problem of choosing to drink alcohol to fit in with the crowd, or not and face the peer pressure to drink anyhow later. This is the breeding ground where STDs and STIs are spread from person to person, as an impaired person will generally not make health conscious decisions, nor act as they normally do while not under the influence of said possible illegal substances. Many people suffer from multiple STDs and STIs just from this simple fact alone, that they went to a party, got drunk, made some regretful decisions, and now have to undergo antibiotic treatment, or worse, a lifetime living with some currently incurable disease, such as AIDS or HIV.

The embarrassment from having to attend both Drug/Alcohol rehabilitation, as well as having to take daily drugs for an STD alone will make most people decide not to try something so stupid again, but not all people know all the facts, or the possibilities of what their actions might do to them later. If people were to just slow down and think through what they were going to do, or even to drink the alcohol they're given sparingly so they don't become drunk to such an extent would help greatly in maintaining proper judgment, and allow them to later make decent, and health conscious, decisions. The same would go for recreational drug use, used legally, which is usually only in other countries, as there are very few, if any recreational drugs available in the U.S.</text>

* A username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* Your own personal user page and talk page.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

==Page Naming==
Please can you try and follow the page naming standards here and not create standalone pages - it means someone else has to sort the mess out later. You should be creating pages like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Physics Course/Sound]] not like [[Sound]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

== Copyrights ==

Thank you for your interest in Wikibooks. Note, however, that not all content on the Internet can be uploaded to Wikibooks without fulfilling licensing requirements. Some content cannot be uploaded at all.

[[Physics Course/Ultra Violet Waves]] seems to be a copy of portions of [[w:Electromagnetic spectrum]]. The same applies to several other of your contributions. Wikipedia employs the same license as Wikibooks, but since the article histories have to be preserved in some way, content cannot be copied from one to the other. Luckily, one can import the full edit histories from one to the other, thus fulfilling the licensing requirements.

Should you wish to import Wikipedia content to Wikibooks, please make a request at [[WB:RFI]] and it will be dealt with shortly. Happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:33, 10 January 2010 (UTC)

== Page move ==

Hi Bastie,

I noticed your [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=The_Performance_Guide:_project_summary&amp;diff=1430785&amp;oldid=1430604 page move]. Is this supposed to be the full title of the book? Please note that according to our [[Wikibooks:naming policy|naming policy]], sub-pages are denoted with a forward slash. Please take the time to read through some of the material linked to from the welcome message above. Thanks, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:01, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
:Hello Swift, thanks for information. In german wikibook we use the ':' for subpage not forward slah. --[[User:Bastie|Bastie]] ([[User talk:Bastie|talk]]) 18:46, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

:[May I add your statement above before my following reply that is also in the book's discussion page?] 

:It is a start on a book about [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/gematria gematria], [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/temurah temurah], [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/notarikon notarikon] in the context of any language in which the alphabet traditionally doubled as numbers before the cultures had number characters, or at least their alphabets traditionally have numbers assigned to all letters so the 'value' of each word can be defined.  That 'value' in text is evaluated in the context of both 'religion &amp; mythology' and  Philosophy (at least the depth level of [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy Theosophy].)  Such arithmology is used to analyze both mythography (lit of religion of the masses except when the myths have reasonable--invariably esoteric--Philosophical scientific meaning) and '[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/perennial_Philisophy Perennial Philosophy]' (the few deep-thinking Philosophers agreeing across most/all eras and cultures, and who also analyze lit/mythography) the latter of who would have most use for this book, though neither the 'religious' nor 'scientific' masses have much/any use.  Theosophy's founder (implying [erennial: its founder required both study of science and its various ideas cause-effect or 'causality' surely used in many liberal arts/sci wikibooks.  It also implies if you want to call 'cause-effect' something more subjective than causality (reason; 'logos' in Greek) such as the Classical Greek definitions, then that is okay and is reasonable for every culture.  That means if someone wants to equally call causality Logos in Hellenismos such as the Greek mythological Chaos or Cronos and the elemental forces they cause, or a more Germanic-language idea such as Hegel's 'Absolute,' and either Teutonic mythology's 'titans' or implied English physics forces (since I said the English Greek-based word 'physics,') then that is okay.  It turned out true from viewpoints: math of dynamic systems (math of chaos) and physics with time as a mere proper dimension (Einsteinian and newer.)

:Arithmology is of course inherent in astrology, most of which I think is nonsensical, except the astrophysics idea that all heavenly matter affects each other and we are in the 'heavens:' astrology just needs re-writing and the best is probably just in Philosophy of science of astronomy wherever the professors feel they need humour about the universe or their science.  Above are the reasons for reasonableness of this book, and following are further ones if you respect the origination of the term 'wiki' or the cultures in the area near/at its origination.  Then I will summarize how I try to write about arithmology conservatively for the use of anthropology/sociology/lit/communication scis., though other mathematicians may want to define arithmolgy as 'math' and delete the book.

:Philosophy as in schools above (main Western examples are above) also allows poorer cultures to speak of science their own way until they translate everything and develop a thriving higher academia system.  This book should allow one to analyze the religious &amp; spiritual Philosophy texts of any culture in the traditional literate way, rather than dismissing them and dismissing Philosophy, both of which are usually done at the same time 'scientists' dismiss other cultures and 'politicians' enable/encourage the exploitation of those cultures, at the same time those 'civilized' people probably unknowingly dismiss the core Philosophy of their own culture and enable the dismissal of the highest civilized standards: just verify history's cycles.  To uphold civil standards, Wikibooks should allow the most difficult and fundamental academia topic: Philosophy (I mean, what does the term 'Phd' entail?) which Classicaly emphasizes the most difficult and fundamental science topic: math.  Philosophers without a Phd or not being as well-read can say what they want about each book, but apparently we need more Phd or well-read Philosophers here to guide their topic here, which was non-existent here when I last checked.

:If they dislike non-Western mathematicians, and various atomists, Hermes Trismegistus, Pythagoras, Sokrates, Plato, Aristotle, Scholarch Plotinus, and how the latter reportedly would describe the ideas of Hegel, Kant, the 'reformers' of Kant (Quine?,) and Dr. Chomsky or any other modern grammar-dialectics-mathematics-algorithmics Philosophy of sci people. then they should delete my book at once (please notify me first: I would rather write a book that I do for education here, and if esoteric Philosophy that 'offends' most scientists--by either astounding or being good ideas with mediocre grammar--becomes prohibited by Phds and well-read people, then this book should clearly be deleted.)  I am not a Phd and am unfamiliar with much more than Classics and basics of aforementioned modernism.  Maybe in the West top Philosophy (of sci) scholars are beyond the ancient idea in this book and consider it wrong.  As far as I can tell it rests upon the math-Philosophers Plotinus and Dr. Chomsky, but maybe people disagree about both classical Logos (cause; vibration; sound/word) and Dr. Chomsky's ideas about logic-grammar-lit sci. integrated in academia without conflicting with all sciences.  I am just a comp. sci student that added math as a major in the last several years, and arithmology is my favourite rec.-math.  I am sure most mathematicians might laugh, but any fellow academic who requires the classical liberal art of grammar integrated into mathematics-algorithmics could see this as interesting: such integration seems to be a cause of Chomsky's ideas; I just hope I do not infuriate people more versed in those.  I will just say I have read some of but have only recently come across some of his language books.

:If I do not infuriate any other esoteric Philosopher-mathematician here, then I would like the section above to be the 1st 'back of the book' or 'inside dust jacket' or 'appendix: discussions on 1st. ed.' if necessary whether it gets to the point of being printable or not.--[[User:Dchmelik|Dchmelik]] ([[User talk:Dchmelik|talk]]) 08:40, 29 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">So you have managed to successfully install and boot Ubuntu. Congratulations.

==Gnome Display Manager (GDM)==
The first thing you will see when you boot your new operating system is the Gnome Display Manager (GDM), your login screen. In the box you should enter your username which is the name you chose during the installation process. After you have entered your name press the enter key. You will then have to enter your password which you also chose during the installation process. The password will appear as black circles so that nobody can see your password. After you have typed this press enter and voila, welcome to Ubuntu!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to your new system, in this section we will talk about the settings you can change in your new operating system which you can access from the menu's at the top of your screen.

==System==
=== Ubuntu 11.04 users ===
When you first logged in to your brand new system, you would have noticed that your applications are found on the left hand side of the screen at the launcher. It sort of resembles Windows 7, so if you just moved from Windows 7, congratulations! You don't have to learn a lot of new stuff.

When you have first logged in to your Ubuntu, you may be wondering where all your applications have went. Don't worry, they are just being stuffed into the applications directory. Simply click on the Ubuntu icon on your screen's top left corner and do a quick search for your favourite programs.

On the top right hand corner, you would find a clock ticking, your username, a quit button and a few others. They are just there to allow you to do the different maintenance tasks that you would usually do (like turning off your computer after a session using the quit button).

=== Ubuntu 10.10 or older users ===
If you have downloaded an old release of Ubuntu (Ubuntu 10.10 or older), you would need to follow the following guide below.

The system menu and its submenus 'Preferences' and 'Administration' are where you will do most of your configuration.

First lets talk about the entries in this menu before we talk about the submenus. 

*Help and Support
This option loads a program called 'yelp' which is similar to windows' Help center. You can type in a keyword into the search box of this program to see useful information, or follow its useful links for common help questions.

*About GNOME
This is just a dialog box which shows information about GNOME. GNOME is your Desktop Environment, it contains a suite of applications which include the panel bars you see and the games in the 'Applications' menu as well as many other applications

*About Ubuntu
This loads the 'yelp' program at a page specific to information about Ubuntu.

*Quit
This opens a window which allows you to shutdown, reboot, hibernate etc.

==Preferences==
This is the menu where you can change the majority of your settings. The features described in here are quite often user specific, this means that if another user logs in, features you've set here won't be in theirs. So consider these options superficial; you're much less likely to ruin your computer messing around with these, so I recommend having a play around with them to find out more about them. If you are using Ubuntu 11.04 or newer, most of the configuration settings are found in the Ubuntu Control Centre, do find the Control Centre in the applications directory.

*'''About Me''' - This is where the editing of personal details take place, it is also where you can change your password.
*'''Appearance''' - Visual effects are controlled from here, including themes, desktop background images, fonts, and how many visual effects are used.
*'''Assistive Technologies''' - Main concerning disabilities.
*'''Bluetooth''' - If your computer has bluetooth capabilities, then this is where you control them.
*'''Default Printer''' - When you have a system with multiple printers installed, it is possible to choose which one is used automatically from this window.
*'''Display''' - This option allows you to configure you monitors colour depth, resolution, and also allows you to set up multiple monitors.
*'''Keyboard''' - Configure your keyboard, such as layout accessibilities, mouse keys and even enforced typing breaks.
*'''Keyboard Shortcuts''' - Allows you to view and modify different key combinations that perform automated functions on the computer.
*'''Main Menu''' - Configure your main menu: show, hide, delete and move any program icons you wish.
*'''Mouse''' - Set the mouse's speed controls, double click timing, left handed mouse and other features
*'''Network Controls''' - Network configuration takes place here, deeper insight into this will come later
*'''Network Proxy''' - Used if your Internet is provided through a proxy, otherwise you should ignore
*'''Power Management''' - Useful if you use a laptop, this is where you can control things like what happens when you press the power button or how the computer reacts when it runs low on battery. 
*'''Preferred Applications''' - When you have a file with a certain extension (e.g. a *.jpg), you can choose what program that file is opened with.
*'''Remote Desktop''' - Allows a remote computer to view your desktop. 
*'''Screen Saver''' - Change what your computer displays when you've been idle for a while
*'''Sound''' - Configure your sound settings, such as hardware devices and specific sounds made by the OS
*'''Startup Applications''' - Choose which programs you want to run when Ubuntu boots up

==Administration==
This is where you will be able to find tools to adjust certain settings such as graphics card settings, partitions, printing, network settings etc. Modifications you make here are system wide, and sometimes potentially dangerous, I don't want to scare you away from here, but if you do want to change anything under the system menu, make sure you know what you're doing. If you are using Ubuntu 11.04 or newer, most of the configuration settings are found in the Ubuntu Control Centre, do find the Control Centre in the applications directory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a timeline using the creation and modification dates of a collection.

== Method ==
Many file systems and XML databases such as the eXist database automatically keep two dates associated with each resource.  One is the creation date and the other is the date the resource was last modified.  These dates are required for many systems that preform incremental backups of resources.

We can use these dates to automatically create a timeline report of one or more collections.  These reports can server as audit trails and can help you find out who changed what and when.

Here are two of the functions that we will use in these examples:
   xmldb:last-modified($collection as item(), $resource as xs:string) xs:dateTime?
   xmldb:created($collection as xs:string, $resource as xs:string) xs:dateTime

Note that you can also use the created function with a single parameter to see when a collection was created.

Our query will take a single parameter, the database path expression to the collection we wish to create a timeline for.  Our timeline will then display the creation and modification dates for this collection.

Here is a sample query fragment that lists all child of the resources in a collection and formats the data according to the timeline event XML structure.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $collection := '/db/test'
 
return
&lt;data date-time-format=&quot;iso8601&quot;&gt;{
   for $child in xmldb:get-child-resources($collection)
   return (
     &lt;event start=&quot;{xmldb:created($collection, $child)}&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;{$child} created&lt;/event&gt;,
     &lt;event start=&quot;{xmldb:last-modified($collection, $child)}&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;{$child} last-modified&lt;/event&gt;
     )
}&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This will return a file of in the following format:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;data date-time-format=&quot;iso8601&quot;&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2009-02-17T12:50:55.992-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;foo.xq created&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2009-02-18T15:12:47.529-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;foo.xq last-modified&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2008-11-25T13:53:23.877-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;bar.xq created&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2008-11-25T14:22:27.798-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;bar.xq last-modified&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2008-11-25T15:39:40.445-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;foo.xhtml created&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2008-11-25T15:41:51.547-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;bar.xhtml last-modified&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2009-02-06T14:24:34.74-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;hello-world.xml created&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2009-02-06T15:13:24.251-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;hello-world.xml last-modified&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2008-11-25T14:07:00.273-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;test.xml created&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;event start=&quot;2008-11-25T14:07:00.273-06:00&quot; isDuration=&quot;false&quot;&gt;test.xml last-modified&lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Event objects are used to notify your application about external events such as user input,
user interface activity and so on.

The are two main ways your program can receive events: either by adding a hook function to
the [[BlitzMax/Modules/Events/Events#EmitEventHook|EmitEventHook]] hook, or by using using the global [[BlitzMax/Modules/Events/Event_queue|event queue]]

The most important field in an event object is the '''id''' field, which identifies the kind of
event:

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Need soundbite}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

We need more than knowlegde how to create a SQL command to optimize the performance of database application. More informations over our database environment and software design are also helpful, like a good database administrator just beside you.

&lt;noinclude&gt;__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

First we try to do some optimizing without changes in our application and database schema. Otherwise we also hope the design from database has include some advisement for performance.

==Driver==
The right driver can help us. We need to use the newest direct database driver. We can fast take the ODBC and this is often a nice way for prototyping. ODBC access works of some converting from database statement and the result of this. This can't be fast or furious. Attention - depending on programming language choice, we have some different drivers (for example JDBC knows four driver types).

==Network link==
Database are often using over a network. To handle incomming statements, these database need a high performant network link. If many users working with database, check for load sharig to use a database cluster.

Also you need to know how is the mtu [maximum transfer unit] from your network. Optimize your database statements and results to avoid fragmentation in your network. This is database and your network performance. This can be one of the last steps, if nothing other can help you.
==Tablespace==
Take the right size of tablespace and remember also the undo and temp tablespace. You need the right filesystem for your tablespace. We would not therefore recommend that you use journaling filesystems.

===Partitions of tablespace===
Partitions of tablespace can help you. Some database systems can faster returning results, if you know relative allocation of data in your database.

==Keys and indexes==
The change to select values over distinct keys is important for databases. For queries you can win more than 100% with the right keys. Also important is to create correct indexes. The space for these is not so big. Better not the time will tell if we have right keys and indexes. Let us using executing plans...

==Execution plans==
Execution plans are good changes to check your performance effort. These mostly visual displayed statistics let you see: would your index and key take for your SQL statement?

==Sort data==
Often we need sorted data and we can simple include these request in our SQL. But attention - our RAM can be too fast full and then the temp tablespace / hard disk drive is in using. At this time it is important how these [[The Performance Guide/Database and Performance#Tablespace|tablespace]] is defined.

==Result amount==
Many times we don't need to return all results to the user. Think about internet search machines - no one send all big results at once. First, the user get from special rule selected pieces of result set. The small-piece principle combined with background processes or thread for next result pieces can be a subjective performance for our users. Think - how often has You all sites from internet search visiting.

==Offline and onlinequeries==
We 'normal' user want our query result very quickly. But some application like datawarehouse, statistic and so on doesn't require results directly. When we need our result is a small but important information to check. Sometimes async offline queries are enough. We can stop needless pressure with clever later start for these query - sometime at night...

==Where are the SQL command?==
We can be faster with in database saved SQL queries - procedures. Before we use the query procedure our database knows the wanted information and can be optimizing itself.

Otherwise we can also use storage procedures. Here the application give our database the SQL statement before '''often''' use this. Also database can equally optimizing for us.

==Connectioncount and reusing==
Connection management is using many resources. Check how many connection to the database are required. 

Reusing database connection is a good way named connection pooling. We can save many resources / overhead, as we always create a new connection.

==Database internal==
===Order of SQL statements===
It is a good idea, to know how our using database SQL statement exploited. But this is databse specific an so we better place our statements to external ressources.
====Oracle====
Oracle database interpret the where clause from right to left. Big constraints should be conducted first, if we join huge tables. So with oracle database the place the bigger constraints at the right site - for example:

&lt;source lang='sql'&gt;
select * from Kunde K, Bestellung B
 where Datum ‘1.1.2000’ and ’31.1.2000 23:59’ and Name= ‘Anton’
   and K.kdkey = B.kdkey
&lt;/source&gt;
====Interbase====
Interbase interpret the where clause from left to right. Big constraints should be conducted first, if we join huge tables. So with oracle database the place the bigger constraints at the left site - for example:

&lt;source lang='sql'&gt;
select * from Kunde K, join Bestellung B on K.kdkey=B.kdkey
 where “Anton” 
   and Datum between “1.1.2000” and “31.1.2000 23:59”
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the tutorial on applying a normalmaps to you textured asset using the 3D program Blender. It can be found at http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/.  Just download the platform version you need. The version at the time of this writing is Blender 2.48a. During the installation it will require you to download and install the Python Engine : Python 2.5.4. You must use this version because the newer python version have changes that will have adverse affects with this version of Blender. You can download it from http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/ . Be sure you use the one for your platform and processor  (i.e. windows x86 processors is python-2.5.4.msi,  Win64-AMD64 uses: python-2.5.4.amd64.msi.) Download and install, follow the install directions. You will also need for this tutorial the zip file located at and unzip it to you desktop. Putting it on the desktop will help prevent a loading error in the tutorial.  You will need to download “normalmap tutorial” from the DLS &lt;kuid2:86627:2350:1&gt; and rename the normalmap_tutorial.zip.txt file to normalmap_tutorial.zip then unzip it to get the blender source file used in this tutorial.  If you upload anything based on this tutorial please give credit to the mesh creator JohnWhelan, you may not upload the textures.  The texture for the tutorial, ssa.tga, is to be found in the asset_body folder of the normalmap tutorial asset.

This tutorial is written to demonstrate the application of normalmaps to textures on assets used in the Trainz simulation program. (TS2009). It is not written for beginners to Blender or novice creating assets for trainz. There are other very good tutorials for learning the basic in the trainz wiki and the Blenders online tutorial webpages. I suggest starting with http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:Blender_3D-_Noob_to_Pro_-_Beginner_Tutorials.pdf  This is a downloadable PDF file that takes you from the very beginning to Pro state in a few days. It is a fun tutorial full of invaluable tricks and tips. Then follow-up with http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Trainz/Tutorial_for_Blender . An excellent tutorial on creating assets in blender for use in Trainz.

Now...those of you that haven't been chased off....here we go.

If you have not open blender yet do so now. 

Now, open the blend file entitled &quot;normalmap_tutorial.blend&quot;. It should be location in the folder on the desktop called normalmap test. After it finishes loading right click on a part of the mesh that has the original texture already applied.
Marked in red is a good spot for the purpose of this tutorial.

[[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image1.jpg]] 

Click on the shading button marked with blue or hit F5. Then, click the texture button marked in red or hit F6.

Click on an empty map slot below the slot holding the original texture; marked in blue. Then, click the Add New button; marked in red. Now, type in a name in the slot marked yellow and hit Enter. Next, click the type button and select &quot;Image&quot; from the list; mark with green.

[[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image2.jpg]] [[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image3.jpg]] 
    
This will bring up the map image controls, pictured below. Click the Load button marked in red.

[[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image4.jpg]] 
 
Navigate to the folder that has the normalmap. In the case &quot;Desktop/Nornal Tutorial/asset_body/load/&quot;. Choose ssa_normalmap.tga, marked in red. Then click Select Image, marked in blue.

[[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image5.jpg]] 
 
Under the Map Image tab click on the Normal Map button to tell blender it is a normalmap. Since, we are not using an alpha with the normalmap you can deselect UseAlpha button. Leave all else at default.

[[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image6.jpg]] 
 
Click on the material button marked in red below. No shortcut key for this one.
[[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image9.jpg]] 

[[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image7.jpg]] 

 You will notice the &quot;preview&quot; image changed to show the normalmap instead of the original texture. This is because we have not finished telling Blender how to place the normalmap.

[[File:Incorporating_normalmaps_using_Blender_Image8.jpg]] 
 
In the Texture tab showed above, click the slot with the normal in it; mark in red. Next, under the Map Input tab click UV button mark in blue. Since the original texure is laid out using UV this will make the normalmap match the layout. Next, in the Map To tab we will unset the &quot;Col&quot; color button and set the &quot;Nor&quot; normalmap button. Note: the Nor button has 3 states, unset, set 1 and set 2. Do not use the 3rd state as it will render the normals in the opposite directions. Sinking the image &quot;in&quot; instead of &quot;out&quot;. Finally, we set how strong the effect will appear in trainz; marked with yellow. Somewhere near the middle is good. You can experiment with this control til you are happy with how it looks in trainz. The built-in renderer may not always be trustworthy for our use. 

Save your work and export the mesh to trainz and have a look. Happy creating.

== == NMSU konbu centroid == ==

=== NMSU konbu centroid ===
;Purpose
NMSU konbu centroid is a phrase used for competition among [[Computer Science]] students.  This is a part of an [[Information Retrieval]] exercise.  The purpose is to manipulate a webpage to get a higher ranking among search engines.  NMSU refers to the [[New Mexico State University]].  This school is used because of the manipulation of the term &quot;NMSU&quot; may affect search engines results towards the school.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* A username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* Your own personal user page and talk page.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].
Be sure to sign your talk page comments with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

I'm glad you're interested in the project. Note, however, that this isn't Wikipedia. We, too, encourage contributors to [[Wikibooks:be bold]], but you still need to be careful. In your past edits you replaced the contents of a talk page and added [[WB:MODULE|module]] content to a category page. These may well be beginner mistakes, but be aware that they may be taken as disruptive.

I encourage you to register under a username, log in, and read the available information about how to contribute. See [[Help:Contents]] for a good starting point. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:06, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Components of Rites of Passage===
I thought that for readability issues it would be nice to have these components in list form. 

===Syncretism===
I thought it a good idea to define that not only the worship but the mere acknowledgement of gods other than the ones recognized by the those Olympian pantheon was punishable by death according to the The Decree of Diopithes.

===Buddhism===
I thought it very pertinant to link to the wiki ascentism page when referring to ascentism.

===Euhemerism===
I thought it important to define deity here.

===Myth===
I thought that the introductory definition of myth was a tad pointed and I wanted to illustrate that there is more than one use for myths.</text>

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with the '''[[w:GCE Advanced Level|General Certificate of Education Advanced Level]]''' (commonly referred to as an ''A-Level''): a qualification offered by education institutions in England, Northern Ireland and Wales and by a small minority of institutions, typically private, in Scotland. A-levels are also taken in Commonwealth countries and British Overseas Territories. Due to respective changes in the systems, these examinations differ both in terms of content and style from the A-levels taken in the United Kingdom.

== Re: Archiving ==

Hi Mike,

I'm not sure what to say, I physically did not make that edit. I can only assume that this edit was caused by some form of bug within internet explorer 8 (which i have been using for the past few days). To rectify this I have removed all of my javacript and gadget preferences in the hope that it will not happen again. As a precaution i am also changing my password and email address, in case of a stray cookie left on another machine somewhere. How embarrasing. Apologies,

== [[Subject:Health and Wellness]] ==

Mike, I added this top-level subject page to cover various health-related topics. I want to move all the medicine books like the first aide stuff to this category instead of being buried in Sciences/Life Sciences/Medicine. You like this idea, or you think it is unnecessary? I won't start moving any books until I get some approval. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:47, 4 February 2009 (UTC)
:No, I think that's a great idea. The current hodge-podge of misc/medicine categorization is less than ideal - and not just for [[First Aid]]. If you've got the time, re-categorize to your heart's content! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:31, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:Why &quot;Health and Wellness&quot;? Each subject is suppose to have there own page right? Surely it should be Subject:Health and Subject:Wellness, or if you think they are the same subject, why not have Subject:Wellness redirect to Subject:Health? In any case I think &quot;Subject:X and Y&quot; type pages should be avoided. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:18, 7 February 2009 (UTC)
::&quot;Health and wellness&quot; is sortof an interdisciplinary subject combining leisure/recreation studies, physio/occupational therapy, psychosocial therapy, some public health stuff and so on. It's a [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22health%20and%20wellness%22 distinct thing] called &quot;health and wellness&quot; - not two things called &quot;health&quot; and &quot;wellness&quot; (although the word &quot;wellness&quot; does take a specific meaning in that field). Whether Whiteknight knew that or not, it's a good idea. See [http://www.health.alberta.ca/ Alberta Health &amp; Wellness] for example. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:03, 7 February 2009 (UTC)
::: That don't sound like something a layman might look/search for when trying to find health information. I see I am guilty of doing something similar though. Awhile back when I changed [[Wikibooks:Requested books]] to work with Subject pages instead, I used &quot;Health and Fitness&quot;. I guess I think people are more likely to type in &quot;Health&quot; and press enter or click go than they are &quot;Health and Wellness&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:41, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
::::Fitness is one aspect of health and wellness; it might be worth combining them and/or adjusting the hierarchy there. As well, there's no reason that [[Subject:Health]], [[Subject:Wellness]] and [[Subject:Fitness]] can't redirect to other pages (or depending on the hierarchy structure, those could be the actual subject pages). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:53, 8 February 2009 (UTC)
::::Darklama, think more about using [[WB:AS]] to &quot;browse&quot; instead of using [[Special:Search]] to &quot;search&quot;. That's the purpose of subject pages, and the name &quot;Health and Wellness&quot; will be perfectly usable in that regard.

== your denial of delisting for lyrikline.org ==

[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASpam_blacklist&amp;diff=1382528&amp;oldid=1382481] Mike, did you notice that every one of those links added was reasonable and appropriate? In the evidence provided by Hu12, there is one project where the contributions stand, most of them, and that is de, which has whitelisted lyrikline.org, because meta has refused to delist. The user was a de user, and was never blocked there. There is only one project where the use of lyrikline.org links was deliberated, and that was de, and they decided to allow it. The user edited IP on all those other wikis because registering an account on each wiki would be cumbersome; I noticed that the antispam volunteer who filed the original request for blacklisting, en.wiki user MER-C, edited IP to remove a set of links on de. It's normal. This user thought that he or she was, indeed, improving the project, was almost certainly not affiliated with lyrikline.org (there is no sign of affiliation), which is a reputable web site and has an article on de, http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lyrikline.org. Links were generally removed not because they were inappropriate for the articles, but because linkspam prevention volunteers considered them linkspam. Adding a single link to an article on a poet, to audio recordings of that poet, contributed by the poet, to lyrikline.org, isn't creating a linkfarm! The links were in compliance, all of them that I've seen, with en wiki external link policy. Please reconsider. --[[Special:Contributions/70.17.129.180|70.17.129.180]] ([[User talk:70.17.129.180|talk]]) 04:24, 9 February 2009 (UTC) (This is user Abd from en.wiki and meta.)(This user page was linked from your meta edit.... confusing, Mike.)
:It's not confusing. @en.wb fairly clearly means &quot;at English Wikibooks.&quot;
:The link was being pushed cross-wiki (in what is probably a conflict of interest), so it gets blacklisted. Dewiki can whitelist &amp; monitor as they see fit. Enwiki might want to whitelist and add to XLinkBot if there's consensus to do so. However, Meta's criteria for blacklisting are not about content, it's instead largely about protecting small wikis from being spammed. The large wikis have resources the small don't, which is why the options I mentioned are possible; please go use them. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:19, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

== Psychology ==

Psychology already was listed as a social science, I didn't really change that. The biggest thing I did change was to make Neuroscience a &quot;hard&quot; science instead of making it a subset of psychology, which it definitely is not. I've always heard psychology referred to as a &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;social&quot; science, not a &quot;hard&quot; one. I don't mean any condescention with any of these names, it's just what I've always heard these things called. I'll do some research today to see if I can find a good categorization/explanation somewhere. I'm not against making it a child of both [[Subject:Science]] and [[Subject:Social Sciences]] either, but I'm not going to jam extra subjects on there if it's not really warranted.

The beauty of the subject pages is that to change the category hierarchy we just need to make a single edit to the page's {{tlx|Subject}} template and everything sorts itself out. Wherever we want [[Subject:Psychology]] to be listed, it's easy enough to make that happen. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:20, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

== finding license information for an image ==

Hey Mike,

Hope all is well with you.  I haven't seen you around much lately, but I do know that you are my image guru, so I wanted to pass along a quick question from a student in my class.  She wants to use [http://cjwriter.com/2008/04/17/the-modern-face-of-racism/ this image] in her Wikibooks entry but is not sure about the licensing.  My gut tells me this pic is already licensed by someone who won't want it shared freely, but I wondered if you had any secrets for figuring this out for sure.  

As always, thanks for all your help, and have a great day!

(a copy from the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Negative resistance#Howland circuit|talk page about negative resistance]]) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:21, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

The circuit on Fig. 4.13 (''The Art of Electronics'', page 182) represents the first version of ''Howland current source'' (''pump'') or, if we exclude the input voltage source and the load, a ''Howland voltage-to-current converter''. It consists of four ingredients: an input voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, a negative impedance converter INIC (R1 = R4 = R3 = R and the op-amp), a &quot;positive&quot; resistor R2 = R and a load. The voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and the INIC constitute a voltage source with negative internal resistance -R that is connected in parallel to the positive resistor R2 and the load. The role of the positive resistance R of the resistor R2 is to &quot;neutralize&quot; the negative internal resistance -R of the source. As a result, the final source has an infinite internal resistance and behaves as a constant current source.

The second version of Howland current source (see Fig. 1 of [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/1155 MAXIM's AN1155]) consists of an input voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, a positive resistor R, a load and a negative impedance converter INIC (R1 = R2 = R3 = R and the op-amp). The input voltage source and the resistor R constitute an imperfect current source with positive internal resistance R that is connected in parallel to the negative resistor INIC and the load. The role of the negative resistance -R is to neutralize the positive internal resistance R of the source. As a result, the load is driven again by a constant current source with infinite internal resistance. Well, let's include some algebra to be more cogent.

The imperfect current source produces a current I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)/R = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R. As you can see, it differs from the ideal result I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R by the term V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R. It is more than obvious that we may compensate this error by adding the same term; then, I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R - V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R + V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R = V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;/R. That means to inject an additional &quot;helping&quot; current I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R that is proportional to the load voltage. What is this circuit that can produce such a current I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;? Of course, it is a voltage driven negative resistor with resistance -R; it is a negative impedance converter with current inversion (INIC) that is connected in parallel to the load.

The generalized version is a combination between the two ones where the output current is proportional to the difference between two input voltages. As a conclusion, ''Howland voltage-to-current converter consists of two connected in parallel resistors with equivalent but opposite (positive and negative) resistances''; ''Howland voltage-to-current converter = INIC + resistor''. The &quot;neutralization&quot; between them produces an infinite resistance and, as a result, a constant current. The circuit is stable since the positive load resistance remains after the &quot;neutralization&quot; (another wisdom: ''the positive resistance has to dominate over the negative resistance to have stability'').

Deboo integrator (see again Fig. 1 of [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/1155 MAXIM's AN1155]) is just a Howland voltage-to-current converter driving a capacitive load; ''Deboo integrator =  Howland voltage-to-current converter + capacitor''. It has two advantages over the dual inverting integrator: it is a non-inverting circuit and the capacitor is grounded. But it has two disadvantages as well: it requires an op-amp with differential input and it has a bigger error depending on the resistor tolerances (here, the op-amp does not monitor the result of the compensation as it monitors the virtual ground at the inverting circuit).

It is interesting that although there was nothing new in a Deboo integrator (actually, it was just a Howland pump driving a capacitor) Deboo was not aware of the Howland current source when he invented his integrator. I found out this fact in a [[Talk:Circuit Idea/Deboo Integrator|personal correspondence]] between me and Deboo a year ago (Deboo was impressed by my comments to an [http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/1633/1633.html EDN article] about his famous circuit and emailed me). By the way, then I also exchanged interesting thoughts with Deboo about the unique feature of negative feedback to [[Talk:Circuit Idea/How Do We Swap Circuit Inputs and Outputs?|reverse the causality]] in circuits (to swap circuit inputs and outputs). For example, the [[w:Negative impedance converter#Negative impedance circuits|negative inductance circuit]] is based on this idea.

Today, I found an extremely interesting [http://techpreservation.dyndns.org/beitman/abpr/newfiles/The%20Howland%20Current%20Pump%20Circuit.pdf source] about the invention of the Howland circuit. Although it is nameless, it seems it is written by the very Howland. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 16:46, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

== How to create simple negative impedance elements ==

(a copy from the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Negative resistance/Archive_4#How to create simple negative impedance elements|Archive_4 talk page about negative resistance]]) [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 17:21, 4 March 2009 (UTC)


I have started the most interesting part of the article where we have to show how to create negative impedance elements. I have exposed in detail my viewpoint at the topic in the [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist/Negative resistance#How to create the simplest current-driven negative impedance element...|full version]] of my suggestions for improving the article. [[Negative impedance#Negative impedance implementation|Here]], I will  show the truth about these odd, mystic and never explained circuits by using extremely simple and clear explanations that are obvious for every thinking human being. Please, do not put a damper on my enthusiasm; instead, just help me to reveal the truth! Here are the main points:

* True negative impedance elements do not exist in nature; so, we have to create them

* The basic idea: to &quot;copy&quot; the voltage drop across the &quot;positive&quot; impedance element (by a voltage follower) and to add an equivalent voltage to the input voltage

* Putting in practice the idea: making an op-amp produce a &quot;mirror&quot; voltage by using a negative feedback. Revealing the role of the op-amp in all kinds op-amp inverting circuits witn negative feedback.

      <comment>/* Cultural Imperialism‎ */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">edit one: I changed words as well as added content to the first paragraph of human rights. I felt that it helped the information be better understood and more elaborated on.

edit two: I expanded the second paragraph of human rights to help give people a better understanding of the role cultural anthropologists play.

edit three: I rearranged the the content in the section about the universal declaration of human rights to help it read more smoothly with a better flow.

edit four: I had to fix my wiki links because they weren't going to the correct wiki page

edit five: added more content to Universal Declaration of Human Rights

I added multiple paragraphs about human rights and cultural relevance, using eg. FGM.

== Cultural Imperialism‎ ==
I highly disagree with the section about Cultural Imperialism‎, in how it presents the influence that Westerns culture has had and continues to exert as a bad example. This will be covered in the [[Teaching Social Studies in Virtual Space/Cultural Anthropology/Cultural Imperialism]] page (see my edits now on [[Teaching Social Studies in Virtual Space/Cultural Anthropology/cultural imperialism2]]).&lt;br&gt;
In any case the effect (probably not the label) predates the cold war, it has been a constant across most of human history for instance the relation between the Romans and the Greeks...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:08, 22 July 2011 (UTC)

Cultural alternative - it is quite easy to discuss culture change in a given form but it should be discussed only in the frame of cultural imperialism ans cultural hybrid because all creatures  want to survive and it is supported by survival of the fittest given by Darwin but after the coinage of culture and eruption of Human rights , every human being has right to survive even as a member of a cultural group. Culture has its own limit and carrying capacity which pushes its people to adopt some alternatives for survival and when these alternatives are adopted by several members of a particular culture , its become the part of cultural change .so change is a matter of use of alternatives for livelihood and survival  instead of imperialism or hybrid effect

:Your above post is a bit hard to digest in its intelligibility. But I note an error in what I think I understand. You are equating culture to a individualized living being, that simply is comparing oranges to apples a culture can be modified and isn't born a blank slate nor has an expiration date included among many other major differences (point is as any artificial constructs cultures do not have, or should have rights even if they should be protected or at least enshrined in memory at the peak of their originality and as completely as possible). Cultural diversity is a wonderful thing, but at the same time we go to war because of cultural clashes, in fact war is how cultures is interchanged (not simply military war but any type of active cultural conflict) in the end winers or losers all are culturally changed.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:17, 13 January 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ask an Energy Expert: Optimizing Your Industrial Fan Systems ==

''U.S. Department of Energy - Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy''

'''Energy Matters'''

''From the [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/energymatters Summer 2008] issue of Energy Matters''

Ron Wroblewski is a DOE [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/saveenergynow/energy_experts.html Energy Expert] who is proficient in optimizing industrial fan systems and who regularly conducts Save Energy Now [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/saveenergynow/assessments.html energy assessments] to help companies pinpoint ways to save energy and costs. In this issue of Energy Matters, Ron addresses some common questions about efficiency and operational costs of fan systems.


== How can I tell if I have an inefficient fan? ==
It's not always obvious when a fan system is running inefficiently. Look at the system closely and understand the needs of the process to determine if inefficiency is an issue. 

Indicators of fan system inefficiency usually fall into one of three categories: control, production/maintenance, or system effect. Use indicators to qualitatively select the systems that will benefit most from optimization projects. 

Control indicators relate to the use of dampers to restrict flow and include:
*A motor that overloads unless a damper restricts flow
*Excess flow that is spilled or bypassed
*Use of a discharge damper, inlet damper, variable inlet vane or system damper
*A damper that is mostly closed. 

Production and maintenance indicators signify wasted energy that causes equipment breakdowns and can include:
*Either too much or not enough flow or pressure for Production. 
*A system that is unstable or hard to control
*Regular breakdowns
*Excessive noise, heat or vibration
*The need to weld ductwork cracks regularly.    

System effect indicators point to problems with the design of the fan system that create excessive turbulence and instability. For example, abrupt turns can sometimes rob you of a significant portion of fan capacity. Some system effect indicators are:
*A 90° turn at or near the fan outlet or inlet
*A &quot;dirt leg&quot; at the bottom of the inlet duct, where the inlet duct is tapped into the side of a duct
*Lack of an outlet duct
*Restricted or sharp inlet

If your facility has multiple fan systems with more than one of these indicators, use the Fan System Optimization Checklist [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/pdfs/fan_optimization_checklist.pdf (PDF 86KB)] to help you identify which systems are the best candidates for optimization. [http://get.adobe.com/reader/ Download Adobe Reader].


== How can I determine what it's costing me to operate my fans? ==

Fan systems can consume a considerable amount of energy on an annual basis, making it important to estimate power usage and annual energy costs.

If you are planning a project to improve the efficiency of your fan system, estimate fan operating costs before you begin. This process, call baselining, lets you document the current system status, come up with accurate savings estimates and provide results to management after project completion. 

1. The first step is to obtain accurate estimates of your system's annual operating hours and the average cost of electricity from your utility company. To find your average electric rate, review the last 12 months of electric bills for your facility and choose one or two months that look typical. On the bill, look for two numbers:
*Total bill amount ($)
*Total energy used (kWh).

Divide the total bill by the total kWh to get the average electric rate for your facility:
'''Electric rate = Total bill/Energy used'''

This gives you the rate in $/kWh. In most instances, the average electric rate is adequate to make an accurate estimate of operating costs.

2. Have a qualified electrician take measurements of the system, using one of the methods described below:
*The power meter method is very accurate at measuring power, but requires the use of an expensive meter and takes only a snap-shot measurement.
*A recording power meter that can be left on the process for a week is the best way to monitor the power consumption so you can see any variation over time, and know exactly how long the equipment is run.
*The volt-ammeter method is widely used because the meters are less costly and readily available. Although based on actual measurements, it depends on an estimate of the motor power factor, thus introducing some uncertainty.

3. Calculate the operating costs using DOE's Industrial Technologies Program [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/software.html#fsat Fan System Assessment Tool] (FSAT) software or the following method. The equations below are used for the volt-ammeter method.
*1.Calculate electrical power drawn by the motor: [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/energymatters/images/em_sum08_calculate_electrical_power-2.gif Electrical power drawn by motor equation] and [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/energymatters/images/em_sum08_where-2.gif abbreviations] 
    
A word on power factor: If the motor is over 60% loaded, then it is probably fine to assume that the power factor is 0.8, however, if the motor is very lightly loaded then the power factor can be much lower.
   
*2.Calculate annual energy use: [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/energymatters/images/em_sum08_annual_energy_use-2.gif Annual Energy Use equation]

*3. Calculate annual energy cost: [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/energymatters/images/em_sum08_annual_energy_cost-2.gif Annual Energy Cost equation]

*For example, for a 125 hp combustion air fan that uses an average current of 107.3 amps operates at an average voltage of 461 volts and runs 8,760 hours/year, at a facility where the electric rate is 0.05 $/kWh, the calculations would be:

*For the electrical power drawn by the motor: [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/energymatters/images/em_sum08_electrical_power_drawn-2.gif Electrical Power Drawn by the motor equation]
*For the annual energy use: [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/energymatters/images/em_sum08_annual_energy_use-b-2.gif Annual Energy Use equation]
*And, for the annual energy cost: [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/energymatters/images/em_sum08_annual_energy_cost-b-2.gif Annual Energy Cost equation]

These steps are used by FSAT to estimate baseline energy usage. Instead of the equations above, you could use FSAT to baseline operating costs; FSAT also includes a very good method to estimate power factor based on motor loading.

If the fan is operating with a damper that is mostly closed, you can also calculate the cost of the pressure drop across the damper. This is done by determining the ratio of the drop across the damper to the pressure rise across the fan, which shows you how much of the system's energy is actually feeding the damper. 

''Pressure drop across damper divided by Pressure rise across fan.''

Baselining can also be performed on pumps, motors and compressors. Use this technique to identify the major energy users among your systems. This allows you to prioritize the systems for project work to increase efficiency. To learn more about baselining your fan systems or the effects of dampers, attend DOE's Industrial Technologies Program [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/bestpractices/fan_systems.html Fan Systems Assessment training] session.

Welcome to the REALbasic community maintained manual for beginning and intermediate users of the REALbasic computer programming language.

== Our Purpose ==
This project '''is not''' an effort to recreate existing REALbasic documentation. Instead, our goal is create materials that can be used to teach programming skills using REALbasic. We want contributors to assume the readers of these pages are new not only to REALbasic, but to programming in general. Our goal is a '''complete beginners' guide''' to programming, not a guide to advanced techniques in REALbasic. 

'''Teachers and students''' are our primary audience. A secondary audience would be those individuals '''wanting to learn programming''' independently using REALbasic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Style Guide for REALbasic Documentation ==
When contributing, follow as closely as possible the conventions we are developing. These conventions include the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items in &lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represent placeholders which should be replaced as indicated in the description;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items in &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; represent literal text that you should enter exactly as shown;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items in &lt;code&gt;plain non-italic text&lt;/code&gt; represent literal text that you should usually enter exactly as shown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Code Samples ===
Please adhere to the following coding standards:

# Keywords: lower case  (&lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;PRINT&lt;/code&gt;) or &quot;camel case&quot;  (&lt;code&gt;HandleEvents&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;HANDLEEVENTS&lt;/code&gt;).
## The mixed-case format is preferred.
## Please do not color code the Wikibook text. 

==== Code within Text ====
The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag is supported by Wikibooks. This tag renders enclosed text in a monospace font, usually Courier or Courier New. Unfortunately, the text is not always easy to read, so please avoid using italics or other effects unless absolutely essential. 

==== Blocks of Code ====
Use a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; (pre-formatted) tag for large blocks of code:
&lt;pre&gt;
// This is sample code
&lt;/pre&gt;
The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag places example code within a box. It also preserves formatting by rendering the code in a monospace font.

=== Document Organization ===
When documents can be organized in folders (directories), the following standards are used:

#'''Language''': An Overview of Syntax, Organized by Functionality
#'''Intro''': An Introduction to Programming in REALbasic (Note: please compose content for true beginning programmers)
#'''Programming''': Intermediate to Advanced Programming Topics
##'''Programming'''/''subtopic'': Specific Topics (&lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Programming/Databases| Working with Databases]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; produces [[../Programming/Databases| Working with Databases]] 
#'''Tutorials''': Programming Examples and More
#'''Appendix''': Additional Information

Folders are divided further into specific topics. Always consult the [[REALbasic]] main page before creating sub-folders (sub-sections) for this text. The Wikibook entries are linked from REALbasic → &quot;Major Section&quot; → &quot;Sub-section&quot; and this organization will be automatically recreated when a Wikibook is exported. Since the Wikibook is our central repository for content, please maintain the organization. Reorganizing a Wikibook requires copying pages to new locations and then deleting the originals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Databases ==
REALBasic provides a number of options for the Database your program can use.

The simplest is using the built in Database, which produces a single SQLite format file. The main disadvantage with this is only a single program can safely access this database at any one time.

For a database that multiple users can access simulataneously, you need to go on to a client/server database system. The three main systems supported are REALServer, MySQL and PostgreSQL. It is also possible to connect to various other databases using ODBC.

Waiting for someone to write the rest of this...

__TOC__

The following tips may improve your chances of enjoying a successful project with Blender.

==='''Organize early, organize thoroughly'''===
In Blender projects, you may work with complex scenes containing hundreds of items: models, lights, cameras, scripts, materials, and more.  This can be overwhelming if it is not properly organized.

We suggest that you organize as you go, giving each item a descriptive name. There will be ways to search for items by name, so start early.  Similarly, give each file a descriptive name and organize files into folders (or directories):  a separate folder for each project, with sub-folders for renders, texture images, background images, and so on.   
&lt;!--Needs a link to the Organization tutorial --&gt;

==='''Don't bite off more than you can chew'''===
One of the greatest challenges faced by Blender users is their own imagination. While it's great to be creative and imaginative, you have to pace yourself.  Be aware of your limits and the limits of your computer.

When making something from scratch, start with a very simple version of it and add details gradually.

Test frequently; see how well your recent changes work before proceeding to the next step.  In this way, you will meet with fewer problems, and the ones you do run into will be simpler and easier to fix because there will be fewer possible causes to consider.

Monitor the complexity of your projects, watching for &quot;lag&quot; or excessive disk activity which might mean you are nearing your computer's limits.

When working on the computer, take frequent breaks to rest your eyes and stretch your muscles.  Eat, sleep and exercise regularly.  While focused time at the computer is necessary, inspiration and solutions to problems often come when our bodies are relaxed and our mental focus is elsewhere.  While you may be tempted to go wild, keeping a level head while swimming in your imagination will give you a much more satisfying result with fewer headaches along the way.

This section of the refrigeration assessment guide will answer common questions that may have arisen during previous reading. Along with a few new topics, much of the following expands on previous subjects.
*Refrigeration properties
*Simple refrigeration cycle
*Multistage systems
*Control
*Recommendations

;Refrigerant properties
Working fluids and their properties are key to the operation of a refrigeration system. The thermodynamic characteristics of the working fluids define the conditions that must be met in the design of a successful system. A short list of commonly used refrigerants include: 
*Halocarbons
*Chlorofluorcarbons - now mostly banned because of their destructive impact on the Earth's protective Ozone layer. R-11, R-12, R-113, R-114 and R-115
*Other Halocarbons; R22, R134a, R502
*Inorganix Ammonia (R717), water (R718), carbon dioxide (R744)
*Hydrocarbons methane (R50), ethane (R170), propane (R290)

Important refrigerant properties include boiling point, latent heat of vaporization, and specific volume. The system designer must consider these properties when designing and sizing equipment for a specific application. Equipment is generally designed to work with one specific refrigerant.

;Boiling Point
Phase change (boiling/condensing temperature for a given refrigerant is constant for any given pressure. Refrigeration system designer use constant temperature phase change as the primary method of heat transfer in most systems. System pressures are chosen to correspond to a phase change temperature that will drive heat transfer in the desired direction. 

For example, the suction (low-side) pressure is chosen so that the liquid refrigerant evaporates at the required temperature; the saturation temperature is below that of the cooled space or medium. the condensing pressure is chosend such that gaseous refrigerant will condense. rejecting energy to the outside, at a saturation temperature above that of the outside air.

;Latent Heat of Vaporization (hfg)
Latent heat represents the amount of energy per unit mass of refrigerant that is absorbed during evaporation at a specific pressure. Refrigeration absorbs enery while evapor at low pressure and expels energy condensing at high presure. refrigerant with a lower latent heat of vaporiztion will absorb less energy during evaporation thatn those with higher hfg. The required refrigerant mass flow rate depands on hfg, and required cooling load.

;Specific Volume
Specific volume is the volume occupied by a unit mass of the refrierant at a specific pressure. Mass flow of refrigerant and specific volume at the compressor inlet dtermine the required compressor displacement fora particular refrigerant.

;Saturation Temperature
The temperature for a given pressure at which the gaseous refrigerant begins to condense into a liquid.

Performance calculations require knowledge of other thermodynamic properties that you can find in appropriate tables or charts.

;Mollier diagram
A pressure-enthalpy (p-h) diagram that describes the behavior of a refrigerant under conditions that range from saturated to super heated. A drawback of the diagram is the difficulty of reading data accurately. A table or equation yields more accurate results.

;Simple Refrigeration Cycle
Refrigeration in the simple cycle passes through 4 distinct states. More complex systems are always a combination of the simple cycle. The diagrams below show a schematic of a simple system and thermodynamic characteristics for the 4 operating states.

;Description and Assumptions
Following are descriptions of the 4 states that make up the simple refrigeration cycl and assumptions that were made in drawing the cycle on the Mollier Diagram. The refrigeration states are label 1 to 4 in the diagram.

;1-2 Condenser
A heat exchanger that rejects heat from high pressure refrigerant as it condenses. We assume no pressure drop across the condenser. In most cases, this is a reasonable estimate. If not, condenser manufacturers adjust their heat transfer ratings.

;2-3 Expansion
High-pressure liquid (often sub-cooled passes through an expansion device. refrigerant pressure drops because the passage through the device is physically very small. Some liquid flashes to gas, absorbs heat, and cools the refrigerant to the lower saturation temperature. Heat transfer is small. the vertical line 2-3 in the Mollier diagram assumes that the device is isenthalpixc.

;3-4 Evaporator
Cold, lower pressure liuid-gas mixture evaporates absorbing heat from the cold environment. The Mollier diagram assemes no pressure drop.

;4-1 Compressor
Refrigerant gas is compressed to higher-pressure (often superheated). The refrigerant must be completely gaseous because liquid can destroy a compressor. The Mollier diagram assumes no friction or heat transfer (constant-entropy). The assumption is a good initial approximation and can be adjusted with an efficiency rating.

;Equipment
All vapor compression refrigeration systems include the four states described in the previous section. Following is further detail on theses four states and some of the equipment involved.

;Condenser
High-pressure, super-heated gas cools to its saturation point then condenses as energy is removed. Air and water are two common heat &quot;sinks&quot;.

;Air-cooled
Air has a lower specific heat than water. The effectiveness of the condenser can be quantified by measuring the temperature difference between the refrigerant as it leaves the condenser and the dry-bulb temperature for an air-cooled unit.

;Water-cooled
Energy from the condenser is transferred to water. The water in turn may be cooled through a cooling tower and possibly recycle in a closed system or used once passing on to another process or disposal. scaling is a concern that can reduce efficiency in water-cooled condensers. refrigerant tubing must be cleaned oten.

;Evaporative
These condensers use air flow across tubes that are sprayed with water, to take advantage of evporative cooling effects. Some water evaporates or is blown from the condenser and must be made up. This type of condenser should be used where water is available and the cooling load justifies the added complexity of the system and the water treatment that it requires. The effectiveness of the condenser, the condensing approach temperature, can be measured as the temperature difference between the refrigerant as it leaves the condenser and the wet-bulb temperature.

Condensing &quot;capacity&quot; determines the minimum condensing pressure for a system. The condensing pressure will remain at its pressure setting, unless available heat transfer cannot fully condense the refrigerant. In such a case, condensing pressure and temperature rise until the refrigerant can fully condense. This occures commonly during hot weather. When condensing temperature and pressure rise, it is referred to as &quot;floating&quot; above ambient temperature. For much of the year, ambient temperature will be low enough for the condensing pressure to stay at its minimum.

When the ambient temperature is near the minimum condensing temperature, condensing temperature will float higher to ensure that all refrigerant condenses. the condensing temperature is always above the ambient temperature by no less than the condenser' sminimum approach temperature difference (MATD). Factors the influence condenser MATD include: heat rejection rate, condensing surface area, and heat transfer coefficient of the condenser. MATD is often available in manufacturer or vendor literature, but is usually 10-15 degrees F at capacity.

''Energy is used at the condenser:''
*Fans modulate the overall heat transfer coefficient to control condensing pressure. Increasing airflow across the coils improves heat transfer, reduces approach temperature difference, and decreases condensing temperature and pressure.
**Pumps circulate water on evaporative or shell-in tube condensers.
**Purge control: Purge units are located near the condensers. They remove non-condensable  gases such as air that may leak into the system when suction pressure at the compressor drops below atmospheric pressure. These gases must be removed or system performance falls. Non-condensable gases effectively reduce available condensing heat exchange area; condensing pressure rises, heat transfer falls, and corrosion may occur.

;Expansion Device
Refrigerant pressure drops in an expansion device. Expansion cools the refrigerant as some evaporates and the mixture cools to the lower saturation temperature. The expansion device can be as simple as a orifice or capillary tube. It is often more sophisticated, including controls to actively modulate flow.

An active flow control volve senses refrigerant temperature at the evaporator exit. The refrigerant gas is typically superheated several degrees above the saturation temperature so that the controls can sense complete evaporation. This also protects the compressor from liquid-slugging damage. active flow control senses refrigerant conditions entering and exiting the evaporator, adjusting the mass flow through the device accordingly. Mechanical or electronic pressure and temperature sensors feed information to the flow control device to adjust the refrigerant flow. Float valves sense the liquid refrigerant flow. Float valves sense the liquid refrigerant level ini a receiver feeding the evaporator refrigerant flow is adjusted to maintain the desired conditions.

:Expansion valves use little or no energy. Electronic expansion valves require minimal power to monitor and control the valve.

;Evaporator
Liquid refrigerant evaporates as energy is transferred to the refrigerant in the evaporator (cold side). A refrigeration system commonly removes energy from air, water, antifreeze liquid, or product. The compressor controls the suction pressure in the evaporator.

Evaporator fans or pumps use energy. Cross-flow coils use fans to maximize heat transfer. Pumps circulate refrigerant on liquid overfeed systems and antifreeze solutions through chillers.

;Defrost Control
Defrost removes ice that forms when an evaporator cools moist air below freezing. Defrost systems generally are needed for the low-stage evaporator on a multi-stage system. Ice reduces heat transfer. Several defrost methods are available, but all require that the evaporator be heated. Ice is melted by either pumping warm water or hot refrigerant gas through it, or by energizing heating elements.

Choice of defrost type depends on available energy. The most energy efficient method is to use war, wastewater to defrost the evaporators, but this is not always possible. Any other type of defrost will require extra energy. Electric heating elemenat defrost is next in efficiency, followed by hot gas defrost. Hot gas defrost uses the compressor to circulate hot refrigerant gas. All can be progammed to operate in timed cycles or on power.

;Compressor
The compressor uses energy to compresso the refrigerant to higher perssure. The required suction pressure is determined by the temperature of the refrigerated space or product and the MATD of the evaporator.

:Condensing pressure is determined so that condensing temperature is higher than the temperature of the cooling medium. For steady operation, all energy added must be removed from the system. Energy absorbed from the cold environment and energy added to drive the cycle is rejected at the condenser.

Suction and discharge pressures depend on

*Refrigerant Type
*Desired cold temperature
*Outside temperature (wet or dry bulb)
*Evaporator MATD
*Condenser MATD

Energy transfer from a low to a high temperature medium will not occur without adding work to the system (compressing refrigerant). The majority of the work added to are frigeration system is at the compressor.

Some compressors have the ability to operate at part load by unloading cylinders (in reciprocating compressors) or moving a slide valve (in a screw compressor). Part load power is not directly proportional to refrigerant flow, however, because pressure drop depends on control type and load. Performance curves are available from som compressor manufacturers that show performance under different loads.

;Compressor Types
Compressors can be positive displacement or dynamic. Centrifugal compressors are dynamic, and are not included in this guide. Descriptions follow for positive displacement compressors. Note that compressor-lubricating oil is entrapped in the refrigerant during compression, particularly with screw compressors. Separators are typically required to remove the oil from the refrigerant.

;Reciprocating compressor
A motor turns the crankshaft of the compressor, reciprocating the pistons in their cylinders. Each piston moves down, creating a low-pressure volume and refrigerant gas flows into the cylinder. Then the piston moves back up and compresses the refrigerant until it is discharged at high pressure.

Reciprocating compressors use reed or plate valves that operate on pressure differences. When the cylinder pressure drops below suction line pressure, the suction valve opens allowing refrigerant in while the discharge valve remains closed. When cylinder pressure rises above discharge line pressure, the discharge valve opens and refrigerant is forced out while the suction vavle remains closed.

Clearance volume is required in compressor cylinders to allow for valve operation and equipment stretch overtime. Because of the extra clearance, refrigerant is never completely expelled out of the compressor. As the compressor executes its suction stroke, trapped refrigerant re-expands before pressure drops enough to let new refrigerant in. This necessary clearance volume reduces the compressor's volumetric efficiency.

;Screw Compressors
Refrigerant flow is smoother than from a reciprocating unit. [This is really a lame description. Copy one from elsewhere if it exists in this or previous versions]

;Rotary vane
Rotary vane compressors have an eccentrically mounted cylinder on stationary bearings. Vanes mounted in slots on the cylinder seal against the wall of the housing. Rotary vanes are sometimes used as the low-stage compressor in a two-stage system, due to good volumetric efficiency. In general, rotary vane compressors are not used often, require high maintenance, and have poor part load efficiency. Consider replacing with a different type of compressor when they are encountered.

;Mulit-stage Systems
The simple refrigeration cycle is limited by the maximum pressure difference a single compressor can efficiently sustain. The condenser and heat sink (outside air, water, etc.) help determine discharge pressure. For simple systems with a single compressor, suction pressure is limited. A single stage system generally cannot efficiently achieve temperature below -15 degrees F.

A multistage system must be used to achieve lower refrigerant temperatures. There are two common types of multistage systems: compound or cascade. A compound system has a single continuous loop. The following p-h diagram shows thermodynamic properties at different points.

;Two-stage Compound System
The main advantage of two-stage systems is that they can reach lower temperatures than single-stage systems. Multistage equipment is more expansive than a single-stage system, but it is more efficient.

;Two-stage Cascade System
A cascade system is actually two separate single stage systems that are joined the cascade condenser. The cascade condenser serves as the condenser for the low-pressure system and the evaporator for the high-pressure system. A cascade system is actually two separate single-stage systems that are joined at the cascade heat exchanger. The cascade head exchanger serves as the condenser for the low-stage system and the evaporator for the high-stage system.

;Economized Single-Stage System
An economized single-stage screw compressor is less expensive than a two-stage system, but can be used to achieve temperatures lower than a simple cycle. An economizer can also increase refrigeration capacity 10% to 40% at a given suction pressure. The following figures show the schematic and p-h diagram for an economized single-stage system.

In an economized cycle, a valve expands high pressure liquid refrigerant to an intermediate pressure in an economizer vessel, from which refrigerant gas is drawn through an intermediate suction port to the compressor. The remaining liquid refrigerant goes through a second expansion  vavle to an evaporator.

The intermediate pressure saturated gas mixes with superheated gas in the compressor and decreases the overall superheat of the mixture. The temperature decreases with flow through the low-stage compressor, reducing total compressor power.

;Heat Transfer
The following equations describe the heat transfer across a heat transfer across a heat exchanger.
*Q = U x A x delta T = m x ha-b
*Where,
**Q = heat transfer
**U = Overall heat transfer coefficient
**A = exchanger surface area
**Delta T = Temperature difference
**m = refrigerant mass flow
**delta ha-b = Change in specific enthalpy between states a and b

Heat transfer increases with an increase in any of the above listed controlling variables. For example, heat transfer (Q) will increase with a larger temperature difference, then refrigerant mass flow or enthalpy change must also increase to remove the additional energy. Otherwise, fans will cycle to slide valve, or increasing compressor motor speed.

When a refrigeration load increases, the system must adjust to greater heat transfer. .The surface area of an evaporator does not change, but fans can affect heat transfer. Fans require less energy than a compressor, so it is more efficient to maximize evaporator heat transfer with the fans and allow suction pressure to rise to reduce compressor load.

;Control
Refrigeration loads and outdoor temperatures vary with time. A refrigeration system must react to these changes properly to maintain the temperature of the cooled medium or space. Several types of control are available to react to load variation. The most common methods for controlling a refrigeration system are slide valve, cylinder unloading, on-off, compressor speed, compressor unloading, and hot-gas bypass.

;Slide valve
Most screw compressors have a slide valve for part load control. The slide valve allows some refrigerant to exit the rotors without compressed for part-load operation.

;Cylinder Unloading
Individual cylinders in a reciprocating compressor can unload to vary refrigeration flow through the compressor. For example, a two-cylinder reciprocating compressor may reduce power 40% with a 50% reduction in flow. The power reduction is not direct, due to friction in the unloaded cylinders.

;On-off
Suction pressures determines when the compressor will turn on and off. When suction pressure increases due to the refrigeration load, the compressor turns on until the suction pressure drops below the low pressure set-point. This control is used primarily for small systems (&lt;5 hp) where it doesn't result in short-cycling the motor. On-off control is the simplest on reciprocating compressors.

;Compressor Speed Control
By controlling the speed of the compressor motor, the refrigerant mass flow rate can be modulated. Variable Speed Drives (VSD) can change compressor speed. VSD reduces the power requirements of a compressor at part-load, but is not common because it is expensive, results in minimal efficiency improvement, and may be unreliable.

;Compressor Unloading
Multiple compressor systems include several compressor that share a common header. Mass flow is controlled by turning individual compressors on and off. In this type of system, compressors may be staged so that the most efficient compressor turns on first.

Hot gas bypass. The diagram depicts hot gas bypass. This method is the least desirable because there are no part-load compressor savings. The compressor always runs at full load. the bypass valve senses compressor suction pressure (refrigeration load) and bypasses hot gas to the evaporator. This method is not efficient.

== Recommendations: ==

;1) Reduce Discharge Pressure
Work done by the compressor increases with compression ratio. Suction pressure is usually fixed, but condensing pressure depends on load, outdoor air temperature, and condenser fan controls.

The minimum condensing pressure is controlled by fans on air-cooled and evaporative condensers. Fan control changes the overall heat transfer to maintain condensing pressure. The condensing approach temperature difference is commonly designed to be around 10 degree F with all fans at full load.

To transfer heat to warm summer air, refrigerant discharge pressure often is higher than during winter or nights when the air is colder. However, the minimum condensing pressure settings are commonly left at summer levels year-round. Higher pressure settings that are acceptable during summertime are inefficient on cooler days. A condensing temperature set point higher than 80 degrees F throughout the entire year is probably excessive. Condensing temperature set points over 100 degrees F are common for halocarbon systems. When the minimum pressure settings are reduced, fans will operate more to reduce condensing temperature. Compressor energy savings at a lower discharge pressure usually exceed increased fan energy use.

Strategies for controlling discharge pressure may include multiple fans cycling, 2 -speed or VSD fans. When ambient temperature rises, condensing pressure will tend to rise. If the fans are not already at full capacity, their use factor or speed will increase to maintain the condensing pressure. Once the fans reach full capacity, any further increase in ambient temperature will cause the condensing pressure and temperature to increase as well. Condensing temperature will remain above the ambient temperature by the minimum approach temperature difference. This condition is called &quot;floating&quot; discharge pressure.

When reducing condensing pressure, take care that it does not fall below the minimum required to circulate the refrigerant through the system to avoid flash gas and to cool teh compressor if liquid injection is used. One way to determine the MATD is to manually operate all of the fans on the condenser. Watch the system response for potential problems as discharge pressure falls. This must be done slowly as it usually takes a while to stabilize. Check compressor oil temperature and monitor discharge pressure. Compare to ambient temperature. Minimum condensing temperature will depend on ambient temperature at the time of the test.

If refrigerant flow is inadequate at low pressures, identify and adjust or replace needle valves or orifices that may be restricting flow. A small, magnetically - coupled, sealed centrifugal pump can be installed in the liquid line after the condenser to sub-cool the liquid by increasing its pressure, thereby reducing flash gas. another small pump might ensure adequate liquid injection cooling at low pressures. Ammonia systems require special impellers to avoid corrosion.

With a drop in condensing pressure, the mass flow required to obtain a desired refrigeration effect decreases. Compressor power decreases. Compressor power decreases with decreases in both compressor work and mass flow. Net heat rejection also decreases with decreased mass flow. System efficiency represented by coefficient of performance (COP), increases with the increased refrigeration effect and decreased compressor work.

LOOK FOR: Higher condensing pressure. If you are assessing a plant in the summer, the condensing pressure will typically be floating. You'll be floating. You'll have to ask or record pressure settings and whether they have changed.

;2) Increase Suction Pressure
Compressor controls maintain suction pressure. Plant personnel often set compressor controls at lower temperatures than needed for efficient operation. A large temperature difference is maintained between the evaporator and cooled medium to ensure everything is kept cool.

With an increase in suction pressure, the refrigeration flow rate can be decreased while maintaining the same system cooling. reducing both refrigeration flow and compression ratio decreases compressor power and total heat rejected from the condenser. COP increases with the increased refrigeration effect and reduced compressor work.

LOOK FOR: Low refrigeration suction pressure. Low refrigerant temperature may be required because the evaporator coils are dirty or scaled. It may be cost effective to buy more evaporators. Also look for back pressure regulators reducing suction pressure.

;3) Thermosyphon and Liquid Injection Cooling
Oil absorbs some of the heat of compression. Oil must be cooled to avoid compressor damage. Oil cooling applies to screw compressors.

Liquid injection cooling is one method of cooling the compressor oil. High-pressure liquid refrigerant is expanded (cooling it ) and injected into an intermediate port in the compressor. The disadvantage of liquid-injection cooling is that the re-injected refrigerant must be recompressed, using between 5 to 15% of total compressor power, depending on compression ratio.

The Thermosyphon Oil Cooling diagram illustrates another method to cool compressor oil. A heat exchanger beside the sump of the compressor cools the oil using refrigerant driven by buoyancy forces. A small receiver feeds the exchanger with liquid refrigerant that evaporates. The gas rises to a condenser. There is not additional power used for this type of cooling because the refrigerant is not reinjected into the compressor and does not have to be reconnected.

Existing condenser fan energy will not increase significantly because of the reduction in compressor power. A new thermosyphon condenser will increase fan power, but will improve performance of the existing compressor by reducing load and condensing temperature.

LOOK FOR: A liquid refrigerant line and expansion valve in the side of the compressor.

;4) VSD on Condenser Fans
Heat transfer in a condenser can be controlled by adjusting fan speed. Most condenser fan motors have one speed, so heat transfer is controlled with on-off control (cycling). When the fan is on, it draws full power.

There are two common methods that control motor speed: Variable Speed Drives (VSD) and two-spped motors. Fans won't consume full power at partial capacity, saving power and energy.

Methods to control motor sped include solid state drives that can be applied to AC motors to reduce the motor speed.

When condensing pressure rises above the pressure settings, fans increase speed or cycle to increase the condenser heat transfer. If there are multiple single speed-fans, they turn on in separate until all are on, or condensing pressure settles back to the set point.

When multiple fans are used in sequence on a single condenser, if is important to operate them all together after VSD's are installed. There will be a larger savings than if the fans operate in sequence wit VSDs.

LOOK FOR: Singer speed condensing fans. Otherwise identify the type of drive used.

;5) VSD on evaporator Fans
As with condensers, single-speed evaporator fans either run continuously or cycle on and off depending on refrigerant load. When the refrigeration load is high, fans operate at full power. When the refrigeration laod decreases, the fans can turn off to save energy. refrigeration load will decrease once the cooled space and medium reach the temperature setpoint. Excess energy is wasted and airflow is only required to keep the air from stratifying in the cooled space. As in the condenser, a VSD and controls will reduce part-load fan power.

LOOK FOR: Evaporator fans that operate continuously (best opportunity) or cycle to control space temperature.

;6) Avoid Excess Refrigeration Loads
In coolers or freezers, there are other refrigeration loads beyond the product: exterior heat gain, excess or inefficient lighting, and inefficient doors and seals. In a space with poor insulation, a large portion of the refrigeration load may be external heat gain from warm air and the sun. Poorly insulated walls, ceilings and doors, doors that spend a lot of time open, and poorly functioning air curtains or automatic doors also allow heat gain.

Energy added to the room by lights increase refrigeration load. Use low-wattage, efficient added to the room by the lights increase refrigeration load. Use low-wattage, efficient lighting to save energy at the compressor as well as in the lighting system. Some lamps can't be used in cold temperatures , so take care in recommending alternate lighting.

LOOK FOR: Temperatures in the freezer higher than desired. Cold exterior surfaces, warm interior walls or slow doors are signs of efficiencies. Incandescent lamps and high lighting levels in the cooled spaces.

;7) Install Economizer
An economizer is used on screw compressor to obtain slightly lower refrigerant temperatures than possible with a simple cycle. Reciprocating compressors cannot be economized, because there is no way to inject refrigerant gas at an intermediate pressure.

LOOK FOR: Simple refrigeration systems used to achieve low temperatures.

&lt;/div&gt;
== Ways to Improve Performance ==
In 3D Graphic Design, there are many issues to consider. First, consider how the project moves, how the project performs. Next, consider how you create objects in your project, especially when working with meshes and lighting. &lt;br&gt;

=== Mesh ===

'''Modifying an object's properties'''

When you add a modifying property to an object, the computer has to calculate that property every time it moves in the animation. These modifying properties include soft bodies, particles, or mirror textures. They can significantly slow down the computer.

To make things move faster, pre-calculate and &quot;bake&quot; the modifier into the object. To bake a modifier, such as a soft body movement, save the modifier as a permanent animation. That way no matter how the object changes, it moves the same way. As a result, your computer does not calculate how the object moves. The move is already set.

There is a drawback. If the object moves and hits another section with different slopes, it will continue to move as if it was in the original baking site. You will have to calculate and bake the section again to get new results.

'''Making 2D backgrounds'''

Scenes will have a foreground, background, sky, and more.

Your computer will take more time to render a scene that is big, open, and filled with modeled objects. This wastes time and memory, especially when modeling an object far in the distance. I'm guessing however, you do not want to make a quick, plain model. So what do you do?

That is easy. You make a 2D background.

* Put the distant image or background on a plane.
* Verify that everything on the plane around the image is black.

If it is not black, set the Alpha to 0 if the image was saved in a format that supports Alpha. This will retain the detail but reduce the number of faces the computer must count in the scene.

* Set the image to Billboard to prevent the image from skewing by perspective.

=== Materials ===
'''Using UV maps''' 

For those who do not know the term, a UV map is an image applied to a 2D plane. The 2D plane is then applied to the mesh.

Here is how to create a UV map:

* Spread out the image onto a 2D plane. 
* Apply the 2D plane over the face of the mesh using the 3D view.

===Mesh===
:'''Polygon Count''' - when you work with meshes in 3D, be aware that the memory usage in Blender with reference to meshes comes from the number of faces (or vertices) the mesh contains. That means that if you have many useless faces (such as 55 faces on the side of a mesh that are as flat as one face), the number of faces will directly affect the Render time of Images and Animations. Also remember that for smooth rounded meshes, you do not need an infinite number of faces to make it look really nice and smooth.  You actually don't need that many faces to keep a smooth slope looking smooth when viewed from the side. The viewer's eye will not actually identify every flat face, but will trace it as a smooth curve.&lt;br&gt;
:'''Face Structure - 4-side (quad) vs.3-side (tri)''' - Poly Count is very important when working in 3D graphics, and depending on the type of mesh you are making you could be wasting a vast number of faces because they are not the right structure. For example, if you want a smooth object, you can make it look mostly smooth when viewed from the side if you make it with well-structured 3-vertex faces.  You will also yield the same results with fewer faces than if you use 4-vertex faces. Another example is that if you need to apply UVTexture, or have something to animate, a mesh being evenly deformed will yield a lower face-count if it is a 4-vertex versus a 3-vertex face-structure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;It is worth bearing in mind, however, that most graphics libraries deal exclusively with triangles.  This means if you are planning to export your mesh to a game or other external 3D application, whether you use quads or triangles will make no difference as all quads will likely be converted into two triangles anyway.&lt;/br&gt;

===Lighting===
:'''Using RayShadows or Buffer Shadows''' - There are a few options you have for using shadows. Ray Shadows use an advanced algorithm to trace the edge of any interfering objects and create a perfect shadow onto the receiving object(s); however, the Ray Shadow calculation is memory-intensive and can seriously slow down your Render-Time. Buffer Shadows, on the other hand, use a different algorithm for similar results. The difference is that buffer shadows use a bit-rate of shadow &quot;pixels&quot; that fill in the shadowing area. You can adjust the bit-rate to make the shadow higher or lower quality. This calculation is much more memory-friendly, and your Render-Time will not jump up as much as with Ray Shadows. An interesting topic because this will change with better hardware performance and eventually won't matter.  Until we get into 3D.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Claim that Java and C# are not statically typed needs substantiation.

-- Well, Java and C# can have dynamic type errors (typically, during casts) [[User:Yoric|Yoric]] ([[User talk:Yoric|talk]]) 12:02, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

Claim that OCaml is declarative needs work too - I don't think of OCaml as that declarative a language, and I don't know many that use it that way either.  Maybe the functional subset of OCaml is declarative, but the functional subset of C# is declarative too.

-- Well, OCaml aims to allow declarative programming. That doesn't mean that its fully declarative, tough. [[User:Yoric|Yoric]] ([[User talk:Yoric|talk]]) 12:02, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

I'm not sure it is fair to say that &quot;MetaOCaml is for writing compilers&quot;. MetaOCaml aims at, among other things, speeding-up computations by precomputing the code to solve problem instances.</text>

* [[Japanese/Grammar/Adjectives]]}}

There are two types of adjectives in modern Japanese: な- and い-adjectives. Both are descriptive and modify nouns. They describe nouns and form predicates differently.
The な-adjectives (形容動詞, けいようどうし) conjugate with nouns by appending &quot;〜な&quot; before the following noun.

=== な-Adjective Predicates ===
&lt;!-- I don't think there is any need to describe the difference between the two, the student should have learnt about the polite and plain copula by now --&gt;
When used as predicates, な-adjectives behave just like nouns:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| rowspan=2 | &lt;な-adjective&gt; || です
|-
| だ
|}

Examples:
{{Japanese vocabulary entry|begin}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
| english =(She) is pretty. (formal)
| japanese=奇麗です。
| reading =きれいです。
}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
| english =(It) is famous. (formal)
| japanese=有名です。
| reading =ゆうめいです。
}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
| english =(This) is simple. (formal)
| japanese=簡単です。
| reading =かんたん
}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
| english =(I'm) well. (informal)
| japanese=元気だ。
| reading =げんきだ。
}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
| english =(He) is handsome. (informal)
| japanese=ハンサムだ。
| reading =ハンサムだ。
}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
| english =(They) are bright. (informal)
| japanese=優秀だ。
| reading =ゆうしゅうだ。
}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
| english =(That) is important. (informal)
| japanese=大切だ。
| reading =たいせつだ。
}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry|end}}

* [[Japanese/Lessons/Personal pronouns]]
}}
Note that the pronouns are usually dropped when they can be inferred from context. The pronouns in the English version are examples only to make better formed English sentences. For example, &quot;{{furi|元気|げんき}}だ&quot; can mean any of: &quot;I'm well,&quot; &quot;He's well,&quot; &quot;They're well,&quot; etc.

=== な-Adjectives noun modifierss ===
When modifying nouns, な-adjectives take a &quot;な&quot; before the nouns:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| rowspan=2 | &lt;な-adjective&gt; な &lt;noun&gt; || です
|-
| だ
|}

Examples:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! English || Adjective || noun || sentence
|-
| a healthy person || {{furi|元気|げんき}} || {{furi|人|ひと}}
| {{furi|元気|げんき}}な{{furi|人|ひと}}です。
|-
| a famous doctor  || {{furi|有名|ゆうめい}} || {{furi|医者|いしゃ}}
| {{furi|有名|ゆうめい}}な{{furi|医者|いしゃ}}です。
|-
| an important class || {{furi|大切|たいせつ}} || {{furi|授業|じゅぎょう}}
| {{furi|大切|たいせつ}}な{{furi|授業|じゅぎょう}}です。
|}

      <comment>/* Checking for Authenticated User */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to manage a group of users of your web site, validate their roles on the site, and track user-dependent information.  This application will manage a list of users, and associate with the users the number of attempted logins, their session timeout interval, and the roles they are assigned.

== Method ==
Our application will use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).  We will use several functions to perform user management:

  '''xmldb:login($collection, $user, $pass)''' will log the user into the system and verify they have write access to a collection.

Note that to log the user out, we will change the login to the user &quot;guest.&quot;

  '''xmldb:get-current-user()''' will return the user-id of the current user.

We will also need to add a new function that will check to see if a given user has a role.

  '''auth:has-role(xmldb:get-current-user(), $role) as xs:boolean''' check to see if a user has a given role.

This will return a '''true()''' if the current user has a given role.

== User Data ==

The following is an example of a user's information.  Note that we do not store the password in this file.  The eXist system is used to store the user's password.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;user&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;47&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;user-id&gt;jdoe&lt;/user-id&gt;
    &lt;person-given-name&gt;John&lt;/person-given-name&gt;
    &lt;person-family-name&gt;Doe&lt;/person-family-name&gt;
    &lt;account-active-indicator&gt;true&lt;/account-active-indicator&gt;
    &lt;max-login-retrys&gt;5&lt;/max-login-retrys&gt;
    &lt;session-timeout-minutes&gt;60&lt;/session-timeout-minutes&gt;
    &lt;roles&gt;
        &lt;role&gt;ba&lt;/role&gt;
        &lt;role&gt;ba-admin&lt;/role&gt;
    &lt;/roles&gt;
&lt;/user&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example, the user '''jdoe''' has the role of '''ba''' and '''ba-admin''' which means the user is classified as a business analyst and also has the ability to administer the business analyst tools in the system.

So the following function:

   auth:has-role('jdoe', 'ba')

will return '''true()'''

== Login Form ==

The following is a simplified login form that will allow the user to enter a login and a password and perform an HTTP post operation.  Note that this is different from the eXist standard login in that it does not place the password on the URL using an HTTP get.  This information is placed in a log file can compromise the security of the system.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace style ='http://code.google.com/p/xrx/style' at '/db/xrx/modules/style.xqm';
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $user := xmldb:get-current-user()

(: this gets the entire input URL :)
let $get-query-string := request:get-query-string()

(: were are only interested in the portion after the return= :)
let $return-uri := substring-after($get-query-string, 'return=')

return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Login&lt;/title&gt;
      {style:import-css()}
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      {style:header()}
      &lt;h1&gt;Login&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Current User = {$user}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;form action=&quot;login.xq&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
            &lt;table class=&quot;login&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;th colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Please Login&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Username:&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;user&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; size=&quot;20&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Password:&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;pass&quot; type=&quot;password&quot; size=&quot;20&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;/table&gt;
            &lt;input name=&quot;return&quot; type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;{$return-uri}&quot; size=&quot;20&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Login&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We will return to the following URI on success: {$return-uri}&lt;/p&gt;
      {style:footer()}
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Login Verification Script ==

The following script takes incoming login data from an HTTP POST operation and performs a login.  HTTP POST data arrives from the '''request:get-data()''' format in the following key-value-pair format:

user=jdoe&amp;pass=mypass&amp;return=/exist/rest/db/xrx/apps/test/view/view-item.xq&amp;id=47

Note that we assume that the '''user-id''' is in the first key-value pair and the '''pass''' is in the second.  If you want a more general interface you can scan for the correct key in all the incoming form key-value pairs.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace style ='http://code.google.com/p/xrx/style' at '/db/xrx/modules/style.xqm';
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $data := request:get-data()
let $tokens := tokenize($data, '&amp;amp;')
let $user := substring-after($tokens[1], 'user=')
let $pass := substring-after($tokens[2], 'pass=')
let $return := substring-after($tokens[3], 'return=')

(: this is required to fix the incomming URI encodings :)
let $unescape-uri := request:unescape-uri($return, 'UTF-8')

(: this is required to put the first parameter deliminator ? back in place of the ampersand :)
let $fix-first-param := replace($unescape-uri, 'xq&amp;amp;', 'xq?')
let $login-success-indicator := xmldb:login(&quot;/db&quot;, $user, $pass)

return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Login Result&lt;/title&gt;
      {style:import-css()}
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      {style:header()}
      {style:breadcrumb()}
      &lt;h1&gt;Login Status&lt;/h1&gt;
      {if ($login-success-indicator)
         then &lt;p&gt;Your Login Was Successful &lt;a href=&quot;{$fix-first-param}&quot;&gt;Return&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
         else &lt;p&gt;Login Failed &lt;a href=&quot;login-form.xq&quot;&gt;Try Again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      }
      You are logged in to the root database collection as {xmldb:get-current-user()}
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;logout.xq&quot;&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;
      {style:footer()}
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Logout Script ==
The following script logs you out of the system.  Technically, it just logs you in as the user that has read-only access.


&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
import module namespace style='http://mdr.crossflow.com/style' at '/db/crossflo/modules/style.xq';
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

let $null := xmldb:login(&quot;/db&quot;, &quot;guest&quot;, &quot;guest&quot;) 

let $user := xmldb:get-current-user()

return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Logout&lt;/title&gt;
      {style:import-css()}
      {style:breadcrumb()}
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      {style:header()}
      &lt;h1&gt;You have been logged out.&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;User = {$user}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;login-form.xq&quot;&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
      {style:footer()}
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html
&lt;/source&gt;

== Adding an Authorization Function ==
We will now create an XQuery module that performs an authentication check for a given user.

== Role-Based Conditional Display of Edit Functions ==
Many screens have links to Edit forms that allow users to change the data.  You can conditionally display these Edit links by adding the following code to each page that would normally have an Edit link:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
{if (auth:has-role(xmldb:get-current-user(), 'ba'))
   then
      &lt;div&gt;
         &lt;a href=&quot;../edit/edit.xq?id={$id}&quot;&gt;Edit Item&lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;a href=&quot;../edit/delete-confirm.xq?id={$id}&quot;&gt;Delete Item&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
   else 
      &lt;span&gt;User {xmldb:get-current-user()} has no roles with edit privileges 
         &lt;a href=&quot;{auth:login-uri()}&quot;&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Checking for Authenticated User ==

You can also add a function in any page that has sensitive information or functions by checking that the user is logged in.  This can be done with a single function called auth:validate-user()

   request:get-session-attribute(&quot;user&quot;) - this function will return the user name associated with the the login session

   response:redirect-to($uri as xs:anyURI) - this function will redirect the user to another URI such as a login panel.

Note that typically you want to make it easy to allow the user to bounce back to the screen that they were on.  To do this you frequently want to add a parameter to the login.xq XQuery that will redirect the user back to where they came from.

   response:redirect-to('/exist/rest/db/xrx/apps/user-manager/login.xq?return=/exist/rest/db/myapp/edit/edit.xq?id=47')

The following is a sample function that can be placed at the top of all pages that require user authentication:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function auth:validate-user() as xs:string {
   let $url:= request:get-url()
   let $param-names := request:parameter-names()
   let $param-string :=for $count in 1 to count($param-names)
   let $param := $param-names[$count]
   let $value := request:get-parameter($param, '')
   let $return := if ($count=1) then (concat('?',$param,'=',$value)) else (concat('&amp;amp;',$param,'=',$value))
        return
            $return
   let $return-param :=fn:string-join($param-string,'')
   let $get-session-name :=request:get-session-attribute(&quot;user&quot;)
   let $login-uri := '/exist/rest/db/xrx/apps/user-manager/login.xq?url='
return
   if ($get-session-name) then
      ($get-session-name)
   else(
       response:redirect-to(xs:anyURI(concat($string,$url,fn:string-join($param-string,'')))))
};
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The point is that we are human beings needing something more than scientific facts, reports, formal explanations and definitions. In order to really comprehend the phenomenon of negative resistance (and of every new thing in this life), we need first to know '''what the general idea behind it is'''. Only, basic circuit ideas are in fact &quot;non-electrical&quot;. They do not depend on the specific implementation (tube, transistor, op-amp etc.); they are eternal. So, we may find them in our routine. Then, let's ask the first question.


== A story about developing the Wikipedia page about negative resistance ==

I have copied below a text from an old Wikipedia talk page about negative resistance that contains interesting thoughts about human creativity. [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 16:32, 3 March 2009 (UTC)


In the end of 2006, I made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Negative_resistance&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=91217690 a major edit] of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Negative_resistance&amp;oldid=91217690 existing article] by presenting a new fresh viewpoint at the negative resistance phenomenon. My idea was to unveil the mystery of this strange, odd and unrecognized phenomenon, to show in a human friendly manner that there was nothing mystic, magic and supernatural behind it... [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 09:18, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

Now, two years later, as I can see, I have not succeeded in doing that:( No one has appreciated my insights into the phenomenon although they are unique and based only on human common sense; instead, there are only negative reactions to them. I can understand these Wikipedians as I know people do not like someone to express own ideas even if they are more than obvious. This upsets their mental equilibrium and they react to this &quot;intervention&quot; trying to redress the &quot;balance&quot;. The sorry truth is that people do not prefer to use their own brains; contrary, they like &quot;nameless&quot; facts or speculations expressed by famous reputable persons even when they have not explained anything. People adopt willingly, use and benefit from nobody's ideas. I have known this truth from my experience since, being an individualist who has own philosophy about circuit phenomena, I have been bearing the reactions of people around me through my life. I have even reserved a special page (''Why creative persons are unhappy'') about these human &quot;phenomenon&quot; in [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] wikibook.

As I can see, the idea behind the (reasonable) suggestions above that are expressed through these two years is: &quot;Let some ''super-expert'' in this area get the ''absolute true'' from some ''completely reputable sources'' and write it ''fully encyclopedically''&quot;. It sounds wonderful but...no one has still done it... just because the simple fact - there are not such experts, the true is hidden&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/Why Circuit Ideas are Hidden|Why Circuit Ideas are Hidden]] (why inventors, authors, lecturers, professionals and producers hide circuit ideas)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/How to Hide Circuit Ideas|How to Hide Circuit Ideas]] (&quot;useful&quot; tips for beginning &quot;idea hiders&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; and there are not such sources! There are only capable wikipedians that can rewrite the article encyclopedically... but they do not like to do it. What do we do then?

Of course, it would be wonderful if there were such nice places on the web where to get the absolute truth from. And, more generally speaking, it would be wonderful, if we live in a well-arranged and a predictable world where all is clear and we know exactly what to do. For example, then we, ordinary human beings, will know whether or not we should fall in love and whom to fall in love:) Also, if you have graduated a reputable university and then if you are a reputable professor, you will know all the secrets of electronic circuits and will show them to students, etc. Unfortunately:) or maybe fortunately, I think:), quite frequently there is not any logic in our world... and exactly this feature is its charm! I am 54-years old man and I know I should not fall in love but I have fallen in love with woman that I have never supposed. I have not graduated a reputable university but I have managed to reveal the secrets of electronic circuits while for thousands graduates from such universities circuit phenomena look like &quot;black magic&quot;. I am (still:) not a reputable professor but I reveal the secrets of electronic circuits to my students while thousands professors do not show the truth about circuits as just they do not know it. Further, I know I should not devote myself to this thankless task - revealing the ideas behind circuits and I should not contribute the non-profit Wikipedia and Wikibooks; instead, I have to write dull (pseudo)scientific articles to climb up the academic ladder. And finally, I know I should not expose my new insights into negative resistance phenomenon on this page and I should not take up rewriting, restructuring and tiding it up as this initiative will bring about me only troubles; instead I should place them on my site of [http://www.circuit-fantasia.com/ circuit-fantasia.com] or in [[Circuit Idea|Circuit idea]] or in papers or a book...everywhere only not here...but yet I resume here this discussion...

Doing that, I do not cherish the hope that some reputable professionals will support me; instead, I expect sooner they will try to depress me and to kill my enthusiasm (I recommend a list of sophisticated &quot;idea-killing&quot; techniques&lt;ref&gt;[[Circuit Idea/How to Kill Circuit Ideas|How to Kill Circuit Ideas]] (&quot;useful&quot; tips for beginning &quot;idea killers&quot;:)&lt;/ref&gt; to help them:) I can understand all these people - reputable engineers, designers, lecturers, authors. It is pity for them to realize they have spent a lot of money to educate and then many years of time to apply their knowledge... and now to realize they do not actually know the truth about the phenomenon. Only imagine how a famous old professor that has been teaching circuitry to the poor students decade of years on end will react if he/she realizes the naked truth?!? Can you guess what he/she will do after reading these speculations? I can... [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[w:User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 15:13, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

== How to present circuits in Wikipedia ==

(a copy from the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Negative resistance/Archive_4#This content is not appropriate for an encyclopedia|Archive_4 talk page about negative resistance]]) 

I don't think that to show the basic ideas behind circuits in such clear and intuitive manner is pseudo-Science and to veil the truth about circuit ideas by vague definitions and mazy mathematical expressions is Science. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a detailed course on electronic circuit design. The electronics part of Wikipedia is not intended only for &quot;those who pursue a career in Electrical Engineering&quot;; it is intended to all curious people interested in electronic circuits.

IMO, the main goals of every Wikipedia electronics article are first to reveal the general ideas behind the circuit, then to analyze the circuit operation and finally, to give some directions about calculating the component parameters (not in detail). The first part is qualitative; so, it needs specific qualitative methods based on human imagination, intuition and some abilities to generalize and to make associations between apparent different phenomena. Mathematical methods are wonderful but useless for the purposes of the first part; they are useful for the rest. It is a great mistake to &quot;explain&quot; circuits by means of mathematical models. It is also a mistake to play down people having aptitudes to discern the fundamental circuit ideas.

== How do we present op-amp circuits? ==
(a copy from the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Operational amplifier applications#How do we present op-amp circuits?|talk page about op-amp applications]])

=== Intuitive versus formal tools ===

Of course, circuits can be and have to be analyzed by formal methods but first basic ideas behind them have to be shown. At this first stage, mathematical expressions will not help us to grasp circuit ideas; they can't explain circuits. Formal methods will not answer all WHAT and HOW questions needed (what a problem electronic components solve, why they are connected there, what they actually do in circuits, how they do what they do, etc.) as they are quantitative tools while circuit ideas are something qualitative. It is more than obvious that we have to explain qualitative things by qualitative tools and quantitative things by quantitative tools. It is a great mistake to explain qualitative things by quantitative tools; at this stage, quantitative tools can serve only as secondary means.

Do not forget that these circuits have seen the light of day thanks to human fantasy, imagination and enthusiasm. We, human beings, understand, explain and even invent circuits by using our human intuition, imagination and emotions and only then we analyze, calculate and design them by using our reason, mind and intelligence. Circuits are systems of subsystems (functional blocks or more-elementary circuits consisting of components connected according to some clever idea). In order to understand/explain complex circuits, we have to discern/show these functional blocks (the basic op-amp circuits described in this page). For this purpose, we have to have very good notion about them.

Every, even the most elementary circuit solution, is based on some fundamental idea. When we see a new circuit and we try to understand it, we need to know this idea, the clever trick on which the circuit is based. Our page visitors need too the fundamental circuit ideas and concepts to understand circuits.

=== How to show circuit concepts in this page ===

In this current state, the article does not show the concepts behind op-amp applications. That is why, I would like to insert some text (two-three sentences) in the beginning of every op-amp application (subsection) where to show the basic idea. Some groups of circuits are based on the same general idea that may be shown in the beginning of the group. The problem is that now the op-amp circuits are classified only according to linearity. With the same success they may be classified by the presence of the feedback (without or with), by the kind of the feedback (negative or positive), by the way of feedback applying (parallel or series), etc. But the page will become too branched. So, I suggest to show (where it is possible) the general idea in the beginning of the common sections and to show the specific implementation in the beginning of the concrete subsections.

== Returning at the beginning ==

(a copy from the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Virtual ground|virtual ground]]) 

[[User:Oli Filth|Oli Filth]], I am a little surprised by you as I have been expecting you to join the discussion about storage properties of [[gyrator]]s. But you have preferred to leave me along on the field of battle:) I have been thinking about the clever ideas behind these so odd gyrator circuits but you have ceased my chain of thoughts... As I can see, you have almost blanked the page about virtual ground and returned it nearly to its initial stage. 

Honestly, I was a little stressed by your &quot;edits&quot; this morning and I decided to examine thoroughly your contributions to see the reason for your high spirits. Looking at your edits (more of them in complex and abstract areas), I have the feeling that you are (too) able, clever and intelligent. But, at the same time, you are formal and sterile thinking specialist who does not like powerful, clear and simple intuitive explanations based on common reason. I am absolutely sure you understand perfectly great circuit ideas but the entire problem is that you do not see any need of showing them to people, to Wikipedia visitors. You looks like a famous professor or (worse) a researcher, that has decided, for some reasons, to teach pupils in a primary school but he/she is nervous as he/she wastes his/her so valuable time on explaining trivial things. But you please, do not forget that Wikipedia visitors are not mainly engineers, designers, scientists; they are mostly ordinary people that would like to know the basic circuit ideas, the clever tricks on which circuits are based, the simple truth about circuits.

Let's see only one example that is closely related to [[virtual ground]] and to [[Gyrator|simulated inductor]] - the page about the simple [[RC circuit]] (in particular, the sections about the passive [[RC circuit#Integrator|integrator]] and [[RC circuit#Differentiator|differentiator]]). Will the reader understand what the main problem of these humble circuits is? Will the visitor come to know what the general solution is? No, the reader will learn that &quot;...more accurate integration and differentiation can be achieved by placing resistors and capacitors as appropriate on the input and feedback loop of operational amplifiers...&quot; The information in this sentence is almost zero... But if we show here the problem (the voltage drop across the grounded element), and if we suggest, right here, the general solution (compensating the voltage drop by adding an equivalent voltage), the reader will understand momentarily how the op-amp [[Operational amplifier applications#Integrator|integrator]] and [[Operational amplifier applications#Differentiator|differentiator]] work, what the op-amp does in these circuits. What is more, the reader will understand what the op-amp does in all the op-amp inverting circuits there...

Wikipedia is intended to human beings, not to computers. If we continue creating so formal, sterile, dull and synthetic pages, people will not read them! These pages will be read only by [[Wikipedia:Bots|bots]]! [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 15:06, 5 April 2010 (UTC)

...This is a happy example; it illustrates the unique negative feedback feature to reverse the causality in circuits. Read more about it in this [[wikibooks:Talk:Circuit Idea/How Do We Swap Circuit Inputs and Outputs?|wikibooks talk]] and in this story about the famous [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/How to Reverse Current Direction|current mirror]]. IMO, it is high time to realize that understanding, explaining, inventing, analyzing and designing are different things; so, they need different means. Formal analysis will never replace human imagination (see more about the topic [[wikiversity:Albert Einstein quote|here]])...

== Thinking of an op-amp as an integrator ==

...Really, how op-amps work is a key point to understanding op-amp circuits. When I was a student in middle 1970s, reading classical explanations (they still exist) I couldn't understand what and how an op-amp really does in op-amp circuits with negative feedback. Later, in middle 1980s, when I began explaining basic op-amp circuits with negative feedback to my students, I realized gradually a paradoxical fact: '''although an op-amp is really a proportional and, as they consider, an almost &quot;non-inertial&quot; device, in order to understand how op-amp circuits work, we have to think of it as an integrating, inertial device''' what it actually is (see also [http://archive.chipcenter.com/analog/c007.htm op-amp myths], ''Integrator inside'' section). Figuratively speaking, we have to think of the op-amp as a &quot;being&quot; that &quot;observes&quot; continuously its input voltage and changes its output voltage until it manages to zero the input voltage. If we think of the op-amp in terms of U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = A.V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; change simultaneously), we fall into a vicious circle traveling the feedback loop and we can never understand circuit operation. We have to assume that the output voltage stays late regarding the input voltage. More philosophically speaking, we have to see the causality in the op-amp operation; to think of the input voltage as a cause and of the output voltage as a result. Quite later I found this concept in ''The art of electronics'', &quot;The golden rules&quot; section (p. 177): ''What the op-amp does is &quot;look&quot; at its input terminals and swing its output terminal around so that the external feedback network brings the input differential to zero (if possible)''. As you can see, Horowitz &amp; Hill have also animated the inanimate op-amp with the sole purpose of showing what it actually does in negative feedback circuits.

== How to present circuits to people ==

''(a copy from the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Negative resistance/Archive 4#Re-structure of article|Archive_4 talk page]] about negative resistance.'' [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 18:52, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

Believe me (I have been explaining circuits to young people for decades), the best way of presenting circuits to people is to show the circuit evolution. The final result is not so important for understanding circuit ideas; the movement from the imperfect initial circuit solution to the final perfect one is the most important. If we want people really understand circuit solutions, we have first to show why the initial (usually passive or transistor) circuit is so &quot;bad&quot; and then to make it perfect by means of electronics according to some clever idea.  [[w:User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[w:User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 14:01, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

== What does &quot;to understand circuits&quot; mean? ==

''(a copy from the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Negative resistance/Archive 4#What does &quot;to understand circuits&quot; mean?|Archive_4 talk page]] about negative resistance.'' [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] ([[User talk:Circuit-fantasist|talk]]) 18:56, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

It is more than obvious that, in order to create this part of the article, we (Wikipedia editors, responsible for it) have to understand all these op-amp circuits. Otherwise, it would be very confusing if we &quot;explain&quot; these circuits to people but the very we do not know what the basic ideas behind them are. But what does &quot;to understand circuits&quot; mean?

Generally speaking, it means to find out all about each of the components constituting the circuit: why it is added to the circuit, what its function is, what it does, how it does it, what its value has to be, etc. Then we have to discern groups of components constituting familiar sub-circuits and to clarify its role. Especially for the present op-amp circuits we have to know  the role of the positive impedance element connected between the op-amp output and the non-inverting input,  the role of the voltage divider connected between op-amp output and the inverting input and, of course, the role of the very op-amp. Please, answer the concrete questions below and suggest possible circuit explanations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like any software, Mathematica has certain features, bugs, quirks and defaults that can cause problems for those unaware of the solutions, and this is especially noticeable in graphical output.

==Removing white borders==

By default, Mathematica includes a white border around graphics. Normally in a notebook environment, this is not problem, as the background of the editor is white, and you can't see it. However, when you export the image, this can be annoying, especially as Mathematica includes the border in the image size, so the actual image is different size once cropped.

First, we will make a 2D graphics object &lt;tt&gt;graphic&lt;/tt&gt; consisting of a blue square and two red circles to demonstrate:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
graphic = Graphics[
   {
    {Blue, Rectangle[{-1.5, -1.5}, {4, 4}]},
    {Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 1]},
    {Red, Disk[{2, 2}, 1.5]}
    }
   ];
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If we use &lt;tt&gt;Show[]&lt;/tt&gt; to display this graphic, or we export it, a white border will be included in the image size. We can use the following option command to override this default:-&gt; False}

Below is this graphic shown with (left) and without (right) the default border. A light grey border has been added in the markup for this page to highlight it, but this is not present in the actual images. You can see that the blue rectangle of the left image is not 250 pixels wide, but slightly smaller, although both images are exactly 250 pixels wide.

{|align=center
!With default white border
|rowspan=3 width=50|&amp;nbsp;
!Without default white border
|-
|width=250|[[File:Mathematica Tutorial - White border removal 1.png|border|center]]
|width=250|[[File:Mathematica Tutorial - White border removal 2.png|border|center]]
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Show[graphic,
 ImageSize -&gt; 250
 ]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Show[graphic,
 ImageSize -&gt; 250,
 Method -&gt;{&quot;ShrinkWrap&quot;-&gt;True}
 ]
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

It uses both approximating integrals by Riemann sums, and the fundamental theorem of calculus before this book has discussed integrals.</text>

Thanks for your interest in the book. About an hour ago, you replaced a number of instances of the {{tlx|furi}} and {{tlx|ruby}} templates. These actually serve a purpose and I've rolled back your edits. Should you wish to see them removed from the Wikibooks, please bring it up on the [[Talk:Japanese|Japanese book discussion page]]. Thanks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:15, 5 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Adverb formation in Old English */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Old English}}
'''Adverbs''' are a large category of words that includes:
*words that modify adjectives - &quot;He is '''really''' tall&quot;
*words that modify verbs - &quot;I run '''fast'''&quot;
*words that modify other adverbs - &quot;The dog is '''very''' tall&quot;

Although we call all of these kinds of words adverbs, not all adverbs can be used in all of these ways. For example, in Modern English &quot;very&quot; is an adverb that can be used to modify only other adverbs and adjectives, not verbs. For example, one does not say, &quot;I very will kick you&quot; (because &quot;very&quot; cannot modify the verb &quot;will&quot; or &quot;kick&quot;); but one can say &quot;I am very angry&quot; (where &quot;very&quot; modifies the adjective &quot;angry&quot;). Likewise in Old English, not all adverbs can be used in all of the above ways.

==Adverb formation in Old English==
Most adverbs form themselves from adjectives with one of two suffixes:
*''-līċe'' (from whence we get the Modern English &quot;-ly&quot; ending) (for example, ''wundor-līċe'' - &quot;wondrously&quot;) 
*''-e'' (for example, ''wrāþ-e'' - &quot;fiercely&quot;)

There are also some other suffixes sometimes used less commonly:
*''-unga'' (for example, ''eall-unga'' - &quot;entirely, completely&quot;)

Note that the dative, accusative, and genetive cases of most nouns or adjectives of time and length can be used as adverbs, e.g.:
*''hwīlum'' - &quot;sometimes&quot;
*''þrēo geardas ''- &quot;(for) three yards&quot; (as in: &quot;He ran for three yards and then stopped&quot; - ''Hē earn aweġ þrēo geardas and stōd'')
*''tū ġēar'' - &quot;(for) two years&quot; (as in: &quot;The baby lived for only two years&quot; - ''Þæt ċild lifode efne tū ġēar'')

These &quot;adverbs&quot; formed by declining a noun or an adjective do not have the comparative or superlative degrees.

In addition, many words are in and of themselves adverbs, without the need for any derivation from other kinds of words, for example:
*nū - now
*þā - then 
*þær - there
*hider - hither
*þider - thither
*hēr - here
*heonan - hence
*sōna - soon/directly 
*oft - often
*eft - back/again
*swā - so 
*þus - thus, in this way

==Comparative and superlative degrees==
Adverbs form their comparative (e.g. &quot;better&quot; or &quot;more&quot;) and superlative (e.g. &quot;best&quot; or &quot;most&quot;) degrees using suffixes similar to those used for adjectives (for which see [[Old English/Adjectives#Comparatives and Superlatives|here]]), but adverbs are never declined according to case, number, gender, or in anyway.

Adverbs usually take the ''-or'' ending for comparative and the ''-ost'' ending for the superlative. Here is an example:

*''oft'' (&quot;often&quot;) - ''oftor'' (&quot;more often&quot;) - ''oftost'' (&quot;most often&quot;)

There are some adverbs which are affected by i-mutation in the comparative and superlative degrees; these usually take no comparative ending, and &quot;-est&quot; instead of &quot;-ost&quot; for superlative:

*''lange'' (&quot;long, for a long time&quot;) - ''leng'' (&quot;longer&quot;) - ''lenġest'' (&quot;longest&quot;)  

There are also some adverbs which are irregular in the comparative and superlative degrees:

*(well) wel - bet - betst

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Second-order and Higher-order Logic==
First published Thu Dec 20, 2007; substantive revision Wed Mar 4, 2009

Second-order logic is an extension of first-order logic where, in addition to quantifiers such as “for every object (in the universe of discourse),” one has quantifiers such as “for every property of objects (in the universe of discourse).”   This augmentation of the language increases its expressive strength, without adding new non-logical symbols, such as new predicate symbols.   For classical extensional logic (as in this entry), properties can be identified with sets, so that second-order logic provides us with the quantifier “for every set of objects.”

There are two approaches to the semantics of second-order logic.   They differ on the interpretation of the phrase “for every set of objects.”   Does this have some fixed meaning to which we can refer, or do we need to consider the variety of meanings the phrase might have?   In the first case (which will be called standard semantics), we are taking for granted certain mathematical concepts.   In the second case (which will be called general semantics), much less is being taken for granted.   In this case, to be considered valid, a sentence will need to be true under all the allowable meanings of the phrase “for every set of objects.”

===1. Syntax and translation===

In symbolic logic, the formula (Px → Px) will be true, no matter what object in the universe of discourse is assigned to the variable x.   Which is to say nothing but that ∀x(Px → Px) will be true, no matter what subset of the universe of discourse is used to interpret the predicate symbol P.   But is not that to say nothing but that the formula ∀P ∀x(Px → Px) is true, no matter what?

In first-order languages, there are some things we can say, and some that we cannot.   Suppose, for example, that we want to express facts about the arithmetic of the natural numbers.   That is, we want to express facts about the structure (N; 0, S, &lt;, +, ×) consisting of the set N = {0, 1, ...} of natural numbers, together with the common arithmetical operations and relations.   And we want to use a first-order language with quantifiers ∀ interpreted as “for every natural number” and ∃ interpreted as “for some natural number.”   Moreover, we include in the language a constant symbol 0 for the number zero, a one-place function symbol S for the successor operation (which applied to a natural number gives the next one), a two place predicate symbol &lt; for the ordering relation &lt; on N, and two-place function symbols + and × for addition and multiplication, respectively.

With this language, we can now symbolize many of the facts we know to be true about the natural numbers.   We can form the sentence ∀x(x &lt; Sx) expressing the fact that each number is smaller than the next one, for example.   But a difficulty arises if we want to express the “well-ordering property” that any non-empty set of natural numbers has a smallest member.   If P is a new one-place predicate symbol, then

∃x Px → ∃x(Px &amp; ∀y(Py → (y = x v x &lt; y)))

expresses the idea that P is true of some smallest number, if it is true of any numbers at all.   This formula is true in the structure (N; 0, S, &lt;, +, ×) when we interpret the predicate symbol P as being true of the numbers in some particular set—no matter what that set is—it says that the set has a least member, if it is non-empty.   By now adding the quantifier ∀P

∀P[∃x Px → ∃x(Px &amp; ∀y(Py → (y = x v x &lt; y)))]

we get a formalization of the well-ordering property.

The language of second-order logic extends the language of first-order logic by allowing quantification of predicate symbols and function symbols.   As the foregoing example shows, in a second-order language for arithmetic, we can say that the natural numbers are well ordered.   We know that the well-ordering property is not expressible by any first-order sentence, because the non-standard models of the (first-order) theory of (N; 0, S, &lt;, +, ×) are never well ordered.   So going to second-order logic is a genuine extension.   That is, we can translate some natural-language sentences, such as “The relation &lt; is a well-ordering,” into the language of second-order logic that are not translatable into the language of first-order logic.

For another example, we can (using choice) say that the universe of discourse is infinite by saying that there is a transitive relation on the universe such that every element bears the relation to something, but not to itself:

∃R[∀x ∀y ∀z(Rxy &amp; Ryz → Rxz) &amp; ∀x[¬Rxx &amp; ∃y Rxy]

Here the second-order quantifier “∃R” expresses the existence of some binary relation on the universe.   Because the only predicate symbol, R, is in the scope of this quantifier, the sentence has no predicate symbols open to interpretation.   As is well known, no first-order sentence has for its models exactly the infinite structures.

In more detail, here is what is meant by a second-order language: One starts with a first-order language, and augments it by an unending supply of n-place predicate variables for each positive integer n, and an unending supply of n-place function variables for each positive integer n.   (The function variables are can be avoided, but that is another matter.)   The formation rules for well-formed formulas are the obvious one; in particular universal and existential quantification is allowed for any variable, be it an individual variable, a predicate variable, or a function variable.

To return to the example of natural numbers, we can express the Peano induction postulate by a second-order sentence:

∀X[X0 &amp; ∀y(Xy → XSy) → ∀y Xy]

This sentence expresses the idea that X is true of all natural numbers, if it is true of 0 and its truth at some number y guarantees its truth at the successor of y, no matter what set of numbers X might be true of.

For an example involving the set R of real numbers with its usual ordering, we can express the least-upper-bound property by a second-order sentence:

∀X[∃y∀z(Xz → z ≤ y) &amp; ∃z Xz → ∃y∀y′(∀z(Xz → z ≤ y′) ↔ y ≤ y′)]

The foregoing examples are drawn from mathematical situations.   There is also the intriguing possibility of natural-language sentences that seem to require second-order formulas for their formalization.   George Boolos suggested the example, “There are some critics who admire only each other.”   This sentence asserts the existence of a set of individuals having a certain property; it does not entail, for example, that there are two critics who admire each other and admire no others.

==2. Standard semantics==

Implicit in the previous section is the concept of truth of a second-order sentence in a structure.   Consider a structure M = (A, R, ...) consisting of a non-empty set A serving as the universe of discourse, and some relations and functions on A interpreting the non-logical symbols.   Then we want to count a second-order sentence of the form ∀P φ (where P is a k-place predicate variable) as being true in this structure if for every set Q of k-tuples of members of A, we have that φ is true in the structure when P is assigned the relation Q.

More formally, we need to define inductively what it means for a second-order formula φ to be satisfied in a structure M = (A, R, ...) under an assignment s of objects to the free variables in φ, which will be written M ⊨ φ[s]. The definition proceeds exactly as in the first-order case, except for the additional clauses for the second-order quantifiers.   For a k-place predicate variable P,

M ⊨ ∀P φ[s]   iff   for every k-ary relation Q on A, we have M ⊨ φ[s′]

where s′ differs from s only in assigning the relation Q to the predicate variable P.   (Here “iff” abbreviates “if and only if.”)   Similarly, for a k-place function variable F,

M ⊨ ∀F φ[s]   iff   for every k-place function G on A, we have M ⊨ φ[s′]

where s′ differs from s only in assigning the function G to the function variable F.   Observe that this definition refers, in the case of a 1-place predicate variable, to all subsets of A, that is, to the entire power set of A.   It is this feature that accounts for the extraordinary semantical strength of second-order languages.

In the case of a second-order sentence σ (i.e., a formula with no free variable), the assignment s is no longer relevant, and we may speak unambiguously of the truth or falsity of σ in the structure M (that is, we can say that M is or is not a model of σ).   In particular, the examples in §1 of translations from natural language into the language of second-order logic can now be seen to accomplish their intended purposes.   The conjunction of the axioms for a linear ordering and the sentence

∃x Px → ∃x(Px &amp; ∀y(Py → (y = x v x &lt; y)))
is true in a structure (A, &lt;) iff the relation &lt; well-orders the set A.   The sentence

∃R[∀x ∀y ∀z(Rxy &amp; Ryz → Rxz) &amp; ∀x[¬Rxx &amp; ∃y Rxy]

is true in a structure iff the universe of discourse is an infinite set.   This example shows that the compactness theorem does not hold for second-order logic.   If we call the above sentence λ∞ and we let λn be the first-order sentence “there are at least n different things in the universe,” then the set

{¬λ∞,    λ2,    λ3,    λ4,    … }

has no model, although each finite subset has a model.

The conjunction of the Peano postulates

∀x(¬0 = Sx)    and    ∀x∀y(Sx = Sy → x = y)

and the Peano induction postulate

∀X[X0 &amp; ∀y(Xy → XSy) → ∀y Xy]

is true in a structure (A, f, e) iff this structure is isomorphic to (N, S, 0), the natural numbers with the successor operation S and distinguished element 0.   The conjunction of these three sentences provides an example of a sentence that is categorical, that is, it has exactly one model, up to isomorphism.   By contrast, a first-order sentence can be categorical only if its one model is finite.

Similarly, the ordered field of real numbers, (R, 0, 1, +, ×, &lt;), can be characterized up to isomorphism by the first-order axioms for an ordered field, together with the second-order sentence expressing the least-upper-bound property.   It is well known that any model of these sentences must be isomorphic to the ordered field of real numbers.   This example shows that the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem does not hold for second-order logic.

The preceding examples show that two everyday mathematical structures, (N, S, 0) and (R, 0, 1, +, ×, &lt;) are second-order characterizable.   That is, each one has a single second-order axiom of which it is the only model, up to isomorphism.   One might ask what other structures might be second-order characterizable.   Of course, there can be only countably many such structures, up to isomorphism, because each one needs a sentence.

Next, suppose that in these examples, we existentially quantify all the non-logical symbols (i.e., all the predicate symbols and function symbols).   Where π(0, S,) is the conjunction of the three Peano postulates, the sentence ∃x ∃F π(x, F) is a sentence in the second-order language of equality, that is, it has no non-logical symbols at all.

A structure for the language of equality consists simply of a non-empty universe of discourse; there are no relations or functions or distinguished elements.   Such a structure is of course determined up to isomorphism simply by its cardinality.   For a sentence σ in the language of equality, let its spectrum be the class of cardinalities in which it is true.   For example, the spectrum of a valid sentence is the class of all non-zero cardinal numbers.   The spectrum of an unsatisfiable sentence is empty.   The spectrum of ¬σ is the complement (relative to the class of all non-zero cardinal numbers) of the spectrum of σ.   Conjunction and disjunction of sentences yield intersection and union of spectra.   A sentence in the language of equality is determined up to logical equivalence by its spectrum.

The sentence ∃x ∃F π(x, F) we made from the Peano postulates is true in the countably infinite cardinality and no other one.   Thus its spectrum is a singleton.   Say that a cardinal number κ is second-order characterizable if there is a sentence of the second-order language of equality that is true in cardinality κ and only there.   (The non-zero finite cardinals are all first-order characterizable.)   We have seen that the countable infinite cardinal is second-order characterizable.   Similarly, we can show that the power of the continuum is second-order characterizable.   Where ρ(0, 1, +, ×, &lt;) is the second-order sentence that characterizes the ordered field of real numbers up to isomorphism, the sentence

∃x ∃y ∃F ∃G ∃R ρ(x, y, F, G, R)

is a sentence in the second-order language of equality that is true in the power of the continuum and in no other cardinality.

One might ask what other cardinal numbers are second-order characterizable.   See the 1974 paper by S. Garland for an exploration of this question.   There can be only countably many such cardinals, of course, because each one takes a sentence.

It is not hard to see that the least uncountable cardinal is second-order characterizable.   We can use a sentence saying that the universe is infinite but not countable, and that any uncountable subset is equinumerous to the entire universe.   Thus we have sentences κ and λ in the second-order language of equality that characterize the least uncountable cardinal and the power of the continuum, respectively.   The sentence κ ↔ λ is a valid sentence if the continuum hypothesis is true, and only then.   We can conclude that not all issues involving second-order logic are necessarily settled in ZFC.

The much-studied theory PA, first-order Peano arithmetic, is of course obtained by using, in place of the second-order induction postulate ∀X[X0 &amp; ∀y(Xy → XSy) → ∀y Xy], the corresponding first-order schema

φ(0) &amp; ∀y(φ(y → φ(Sy)) → ∀y φ(y)

where φ can be any suitable first-order formula.   The effect of this schema is well known; it assures that any definable set that contains 0 and is closed under successor must contain everything.

Suppose that, by analogy, we start from our second-order axiomatization of the ordered field of real numbers, and replace the second-order least-upper-bound axiom by the corresponding schema.   The result is an infinite set of first-order axioms, assuring that any definable set that is non-empty and bounded has a least upper bound.   The models of this are called real-closed ordered fields.   Interestingly, this concept was first formulated by algebraists, not by logicians.

One measurement of the strength of second-order logic is the complexity of its set of valid sentences.   Let V¹ be the set of valid sentences of first-order logic and let V² be the set of valid sentences of second-order logic.   More specifically, in first-order logic with only a single 2-place predicate symbol P, we know that the set V¹(P) of valid sentences is a complete computably enumerable set (i.e., a complete recursively enumerable set).   (Here we can assign Gödel numbers and view V¹(P) as a set of natural numbers, or equivalently we can view it directly as a set of words over a finite alphabet.)   And Tarski has pointed out that the set V¹(=) of valid sentences in the first-order language of equality (with no non-logical symbols at all) is decidable.

For comparison, let V²(=) be the set of valid sentences in the second-order language of equality.   What is the complexity of this set?

Let π be the conjunction of the Peano postulates and the recursion equations for addition and multiplication.   Thus π is a second-order sentence in the language of arithmetic, with 0, S, +, and ×.   The sentence π is categorical; its only model is (N, 0, S, +, ×), up to isomorphism.   Consequently, for a sentence σ in the language of arithmetic, σ is true in arithmetic iff the conditional (π → σ) is valid.   This shows that V²(0, S, +, ×) cannot be arithmetical (i.e., cannot be first-order definable in arithmetic), lest truth in arithmetic be definable, in violation of Tarski's theorem.   Now we can quantify away all the non-logical symbols; a sentence φ(P) is valid iff the sentence ∀P φ(P) is valid.   The conclusion is that V²(=) is not arithmetical.

As interesting as that may be, it is merely the tip of the iceberg.   To begin with, we can show that V²(=) is not analytical, that is, is not definable in arithmetic by a second-order formula.   The proof of Tarski's theorem, showing that the set of true first-order sentences of arithmetic is not first-order definable in arithmetic, also shows that the set of true second-order sentences of arithmetic is not second-order definable in arithmetic.   The rest of the argument is unchanged.   And later we will see that even more is true.

In a very different direction, R. Fagin has shown a surprising connection between a topic in computational complexity and second-order definability over finite structures.   For example, a finite graph can be regarded as a pair (V, E) consisting of a non-empty vertex set V and a symmetric edge relation E on V.   The statement that the graph can be properly colored with three colors can be expressed by a second-order sentence: there exist subsets R, G, B that partition V in such a way that two vertices connected by an edge are never the same color.   This sentence is Σ-1-1, that is, it has the form

[existential second-order quantifiers] [first-order formula].

It is well known that being three-colorable is an NP property of a graph.   That is, it is a property that is recognizable in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine.   (There is a non-deterministic Turing machine M and a polynomial p such that whenever (V, E), suitably encoded, is given to M, then if (V, E) is three-colorable then some computation of M will accept the graph within p(n) steps, where n measures the size of (V, E), and if (V, E) is not three-colorable then no computation of M will ever accept the graph.)

Fagin showed that this is not an isolated example; every NP property of finite graphs is definable by a Σ-1-1 sentence of second-order logic.   And conversely, any Σ-1-1 sentence defines an NP property.   And in place of graphs, we can use directed graphs or other finite structures.   Fagin's theorem states that a property of finite structures is an NP property if and only if it is definable by a Σ-1-1 second-order sentence.

==3. General semantics==

A key feature of the “standard semantics” discussed in the previous section is that, for a one-place predicate variable X, the quantifier ∀X ranges over the entire power set of the universe of discourse.   We have seen that this feature gives second-order languages a high degree of expressive strength.

But do we really want the quantifier ∀X to range over the actual power set?   The predicativist will object that the power-set operation is not meaningful.   And even the classical mathematician will admit that there are some obscure features of the power-set operation.   The independence of the continuum hypothesis illustrates one such obscurity.   If our goal is to study the foundations of mathematics, then it might be prudent not to take for granted that we already know all about power sets.

The concept of general semantics for second-order logic avoids any pretense that the power-set operation is a fixed well-understood resource.   Instead, the range of the quantifier ∀X must be directly specified.

By a general pre-structure for a second-order language we mean a structure in the usual sense (a universe of discourse plus interpretations for the non-logical symbols) together with the additional sets:

    * The n-place relation universe for each positive integer n.   This must be a collection of n-ary relations on the universe of discourse.   In particular, the 1-place relation universe must be some collection of subsets of the universe.   Thus it is part (perhaps all, perhaps not) of the power set of the universe.
    * The n-place function universe for each positive integer n.   This must be a collection of n-place functions on the universe of discourse.

For a general pre-structure M, there is a natural way to define what it means for a second-order formula φ to be satisfied in a structure M under an assignment s of objects to the free variables in φ, which again will be written M ⊨ φ[s].   The second-order quantifiers are now defined to range over the corresponding universe.   For a k-place predicate variable P,

M ⊨ ∀P φ[s]   iff   for every k-ary relation Q in the k-place relation universe, we have M ⊨ φ [s′]
where s′ differs from s only in assigning the relation Q to the predicate variable P.   Similarly, for a k-place function variable F,

M ⊨ ∀F φ[s]   iff   for every k-place function G in the k-place function universe, we have M ⊨ φ [s′]
where s′ differs from s only in assigning the function G to the function variable F.   In the case of a second-order sentence σ (i.e., a formula with no free variable), the assignment s is no longer relevant, and we may speak unambiguously of the truth or falsity of σ in the general pre-structure M (that is, we can say that M is or is not a model of σ).  

But for second-order logic, we do not really want the 1-place relation universe to be an arbitrary collection of subsets of the universe.   We might not know everything about the power-set operation, but we know some things about it.   In effect, using general pre-structures amounts to treating a second-order language as a many-sorted first-order language.

There are some subsets of the universe that we know about, because we can define them.   That is, suppose φ is a formula in which only the variable u occurs free.   Then the set φ defines in M is the set consisting of all members a of M such that φ is satisfied in M when a is assigned to u.   This idea can be extended.   Suppose that φ has only the free variables u, v, w, x, Y, and Z (where Y is an m-place predicate variable and Z is an n-place function variable).   Suppose that c and d are members of the (individual) universe |M| of M, that E is in M's m-place relation universe, and that F is in M's n-place function universe.   Then the binary relation φ defines in M from the parameters c, d, E, and F is the set of pairs &lt;a, b&gt; of elements of |M| such that φ is satisfied in M when its variables u, v, w, x, Y, and Z are assigned a, b, c, d, E, and F, respectively.   That is, it is the binary relation:

{&lt;a, b&gt;  |  M   ⊨   φ(u, v, w, x, Y, Z) [a, b, c, d, E, F]}

Obviously, this concept can be generalized to the situation where a k-ary relation is defined from any particular number of parameters.

Then it is reasonable to restrict attention to general pre-structures that are closed under definability.   Thus in the situation just described, it is reasonable to expect M's 2-ary relation universe to contain the binary relation that φ defines from parameters in the pre-structure.   That is, we expect the sentence

∀w ∀x ∀Y ∀Z ∃R ∀u ∀v [Ruv ↔ φ(u, v, w, x, Y, Z)]

to be true in M.   Call such sentences comprehension axioms.

By a general structure for a second-order language (also called a Henkin structure) is meant a general pre-structure in which all comprehension axioms (for all formulas) are true.   (Here φ might contain quantifiers over predicate variables, so that even impredicative comprehension axioms are to be true.   In Section 5, we consider alternatives to “full comprehension.”)   Among the general structures are those in which the 1-place relation universe is the actual power set of the individual universe, and so forth.   (Call such a general structure absolute.)   But there can be others.

We obtain the general semantics (also called the Henkin semantics) for a second-order language by considering all general structures.   That is, for a sentence σ to be valid in the general semantics, it must be true in all general structures.   This is a stronger requirement than saying that σ is valid in the standard semantics.   A sentence that is valid in the standard semantics is true in those general structures for which the 1-place relation universe is the full power set of the individual universe, and so forth.   But such a sentence σ might turn out to be false in some general structure (that is, ¬σ might have a general model).

The main feature of the general semantics is a result of the “nothing but” type: Second-order logic with the general semantics is nothing but first-order logic (many-sorted) together with the comprehension axioms.   Thus a sentence is valid in the general semantics iff it is logically implied (in first-order logic) by the set of comprehension axioms.

This reduction to first-order logic yields at once the following results:

    * (Enumerability)   In a second-order language with finitely many non-logical symbols, the set of sentences that are valid in the general semantics is computably enumerable.   This holds because the set of comprehension axioms is a computable set (i.e., a recursive set).
    * (Compactness)   A set of sentences has a general model if every finite subset has a general model.
    * (Löwenheim–Skolem)   If a set of sentences has a general model, then it has a countable general model.

In each of these three cases, there is a sharp contrast to the situation of standard semantics considered in Section 2.   Moreover, a deductive calculus can be given for second-order logic (adapted from first-order logic and augmented by the comprehension axioms) that will be complete for the general semantics.

For comparison, axiomatic set theory (ZFC say) is a first-order theory; a model of set theory must supply a power-set operation.   But the language of set theory has certain higher-order aspects, in that it permits us to speak of sets, sets of sets, and so forth.

In the extreme case of a structure M in which all relations are definable (e.g. a structure with a one-point universe), the general semantics will coincide with the standard semantics.

==4. Higher-order logic==

There is no need to stop at second-order logic; one can keep going.   We can add to the language “super-predicate” symbols, which take as arguments both individual symbols (either variables or constants) and predicate symbols.   And then we can allow quantification over super-predicate symbols.   And then we can keep going further.

(The reader is to be cautioned that there are in the literature two different ways of counting the order.   According to one scheme, third-order logic allows super-predicate symbols to occur free, and fourth-order logic allows them to be quantified.   According to the other scheme, third-order logic already allows quantification of super-predicate symbols.)

We reach the level of type theory after ω steps.   And continuation into the transfinite is conceivable.

We have seen that, although the set V¹ of valid formulas of first-order logic is computably enumerable, the corresponding set V² for second-order logic (with the standard semantics) is vastly more complex.   This phenomenon does not continue into the higher orders.

There is a sense in which the power-set operation is definable in second-order logic.   Consider a language with a one-place predicate symbol I (for individuals), a one-place predicate symbol S (for sets), and a two-place predicate symbol E (for the membership relation).   Then to express the idea that S is the power set of I we can use the conjunction (call it σ) of the following four sentences:
∀x(Ix + Sx)   where “+” denotes exclusive disjunction
∀x ∀y (Exy → Ix &amp; Sy)
∀x ∀y (Sx &amp; Sy &amp; ∀t(Etx ↔ Ety) → x = y)   (extensionality)
∀X ∃y(Sy &amp; ∀t(It → (Ety ↔ Xt)))   (comprehension).

Clearly σ is true in any structure whose universe is the disjoint union of a set A and its power set P(A) and which assigns A to I, assigns P(A) to S, and assigns the membership relation ∈ to E.   Conversely, let M be any model of σ (in the standard semantics).   Let f  be a one-to-one function from M's interpretation of I onto a set A that is disjoint from its power set (there always is such a set).   Extend f to all of M's universe by defining for each s in M's interpretation of S

f(s) = {f(i)   |   M ⊨ E [i, s]}

(that is, f(s) is the set of things in A that M thinks belong to s).   Then f is an isomorphism from M to a structure whose universe is the disjoint union of a set A and its power set P(A) and which assigns A to I, assigns P(A) to S, and assigns the membership relation ∈ to E.   So roughly speaking, σ defines the power-set operation “to within isomorphism.”

In a similar vein, we can define to within isomorphism the power set of I × I, i.e., the set of binary relations on I. And so forth.

This second-order expressibility of the power-set operation permits the simulation of higher-order logic within second order.   More specifically, we have the following result of Hintikka (1955): For each formula φ of higher-order logic (in a language with finitely many non-logical symbols), we can effectively find a sentence ψ of second-order logic (in the language of equality) such that φ is valid if and only if ψ is valid.   The sentence ψ is constructed by first expanding the language by adding symbols for universes of various types (individuals, sets of individuals, ...) and for membership in these universes.   Then φ's validity is equivalent to the validity of a second-order formula

The universes are correctly arranged → φ*

where φ* is a suitable relativization of φ.   Finally, we can prefix universal quantifiers to obtain a sentence ψ in the language of equality.

Thus the set of validities of seventeenth-order logic is computably reducible to V²(=), the set of second-order validities in the language of equality.   (In fact, these two sets are computably isomorphic.)   So in this aspect, the complexity of higher-order logic does not increase with the order. It follows that the set V²(=) has a high degree of complexity.   We can extend our earlier observation that it is not definable in second-order arithmetic; it is not definable in arithmetic of higher order either.   Montague in 1965 extended this into the transfinite.   At the time, he was heard to say that the set V²(=) does not lie in any Kleene hierarchy, “past, present, or future.”

The fact that we can express the power-set operation in second-order logic (and can iterate the procedure) gives second-order logic some large part of the expressiveness of set theory.   Quine has claimed that second-order logic is not really logic, but rather set theory in disguise.   And Robert Vaught has commented that studying second-order logic was like studying “the standard model of set theory.”

The complexity of V²(=) does not change much if we impose limitations on the quantifier form of the sentences.   The foregoing reduction of higher-order logic yields Π-1-2 sentences, so we can conclude that the set of valid Π-1-2 sentences in the language of equality is computably isomorphic to the full V²(=). That is about the best possible result.   The set of Π-1-1 valid sentences is a complete computably enumerable set; once we drop the universal second-order quantifiers we are looking at first-order formulas. The set of Σ-1-1 valid sentences in the language of equality is a complete co-c.e. set, i.e., the complement of a computably enumerable set.   (The sentence ∃Pφ(P) is true in every non-zero cardinality iff the elementary sentence φ(P) has models of every finite size, a co-c.e. property.   And to a Turing machine we can effectively assign an elementary sentence having models of every finite size iff the machine never halts.)   The set of valid Σ-1-2 sentences in the language of equality is also computably isomorphic to the full V²(=), but this fact requires a different sort of proof.

==5. Systems of second-order number theory==

The language of arithmetic (with 0, S, &lt;, +, and ×) is important to the foundations of mathematics.   As axioms, we can take the usual Peano postulates, including the second-order induction axiom.   In the standard semantics, the only model of the Peano postulates, up to isomorphism, is the usual model of arithmetic.   So the theory generated by these axioms (in the standard semantics) is simply the second-order theory of true arithmetic.

But suppose we consider instead the general semantics.   The Peano postulates have general models that can differ from the usual model in either (or both) of two ways.   We can employ the compactness theorem to construct non-standard general models of the Peano postulates containing infinitely large numbers.   We can also find general models of the Peano postulates in which the universe of sets is less than the full power set of the individual universe (i.e., general models that are not absolute).   Indeed, any countable general model must be of this kind.  

In the context of general models, we add the additional axiom schema for choice:

∀n ∃X φ(n,X) → ∃Y ∀n φ(n, {t | Ynt})

prefixed by universal quantifiers as needed.   (Here the formula that has been written as φ(n, {t | Ytn}) is obtained from φ(n,X) by replacing each term Xu by the term Ynu.)

The Peano postulates are strong enough to provide us with pairing functions.   Consequently, for a general model, its 1-place relation universe completely determines its k-place relation universe for each k.

The traditional terminology is to refer to second-order number theory as analysis.   The name derives from the fact that it is possible to identify real numbers with sets of natural numbers.   The second-order quantifiers over sets of natural numbers can then be viewed as quantifiers over the real numbers.   The appropriateness of the name is open to question, but its usage is well established.   Accordingly, by a model of analysis we will mean a general model of the Peano postulates with choice.   As a general model, any model of analysis must of course satisfy all of the comprehension axioms; later we will consider weakening this requirement.

Let A2 be the theory generated by the Peano postulates with choice (in the general semantics).   Then A2 is a complete computably enumerable subset of true second-order arithmetic.   A2 contains every true Σ-0-1 sentence. It does not contain every true Π-0-1 sentence.

We can obtain a stronger theory by restricting attention to the models of analysis that differ from the usual model in only the second of the two ways described previously.   That is, define an ω-model of analysis to be a model of analysis in which the individual universe is the actual set of natural numbers and the symbols 0 and S have their usual interpretations.   (Consequently, the symbols &lt;, +, and × have their usual interpretations.)   The set universe of an ω-model of analysis must therefore be some part (possibly all) of the power set of the natural numbers, but it must be such that full comprehension is satisfied.

The motivation for considering ω-models can be stated as follow.   We have a clear understanding—or so we like to think—of the set of natural numbers.   But we do not have anything like the same understanding of the power set of the set of natural numbers.   So it is reasonable to hold fixed the part we are sure of, but to leave open to interpretation the part we are not so sure about.

An ω-model of analysis is completely determined by its set universe.   Because we have pairing functions that are first-order definable, the set universe will determine the binary relation universe, and so on.   A Löwenheim–Skolem argument will show that there are ω-models of analysis with a countable set universe.

In any ω-model of analysis, the true first-order sentences are exactly the ones true in usual model.   But ω-models can differ on second-order sentences.   Let Aω be the theory of ω-models, that is, the set of sentences true in all ω-models of analysis.   Then Aω extends A2.   It is a complete Π-1-1 set.   It contains every true Π-1-1 sentence; it does not contain every true Σ-1-1 sentence.

By the ω-rule we mean the infinitary rule of inference that infers ∀x φ(x) from the premisses φ(0), φ(1), φ(2), … .   Suppose we add this rule to the usual logical apparatus, and see what is then deducible from the Peano postulates with choice.   A “deduction” using the ω-rule will in general be infinite, but it must be well founded.   It is not hard to see that any sentence deducible in this way is in Aω.   Conversely, a completeness theorem holds: Every sentence in Aω has a deduction of the sort described.

In a 1961 paper, Andrzej Mostowski described a way of going one step further, toward a stronger theory still.   Suppose we are willing to consider not just the order type ω as being sufficiently understood, but even the concept of being a well-ordering.   Define a β-model of analysis to be an ω-model with the additional property that orderings in the model that appear to be well-orderings really are.   That is, an ω-model M of analysis is a β-model if every ordering relation (on the natural numbers) in M with the property that non-empty sets in M always have least members, is in fact a well-ordering.

Then the set Aβ of sentences that are true in all β-models turns out to be a complete Π-1-2 set.   It contains every true Π-1-2 sentence; it does not contain every true Σ-1-2 sentence.   Clearly we have the inclusions

A2   ⊆   Aω   ⊆   Aβ   ⊆   True Second-Order Arithmetic.

For example, the number-theoretic part of a transitive ∈-model of ZF set theory will always be a β-model of analysis.   But we can construct a β-model without strong assumptions.   There is in fact a smallest β-model, and it can be constructed in a way reminiscent of Gödel's definition of the class L of constructible sets.

Finally, it should be mentioned that there are contexts in which theories of second-order arithmetic with less than full comprehension are suitable.   For example, one can take the theory ACA given by the Peano postulates together with comprehension axioms for first-order formulas only.   Such theories have been shown to be applicable to the study of “reverse mathematics.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navlist/Top}}

We'll start our exploration of grammar by examining the ways that words can be altered and rearranged to create new meanings. For now, try not to focus on the actual meaning that's being conveyed, but rather on the way that that meaning is constructed.

== Morphological ==

The morphological ways of marking a word are often referred to under the collective term '''affixes'''. There are lots of different types of affixes and we'll look at some of the most common ones here.

=== Prefixes &amp; Suffixes ===

Prefixes and suffixes are small word fragments that are added to the beginning or end of a word in order to change its meaning.  '''Prefixes''' are added to the beginning of a word and '''suffixes''' are added to the end.

Prefixes and suffixes are a very important way for a language to change the meanings of words. Almost every language has them to some degree. In English, among other things, we use suffixes to show plurals on most nouns and the past tense on most verbs;

 ''dog'' with the plural suffix -s becomes ''dogs''
 ''walk'' with the past tense suffix -ed becomes ''walked''

An example of an English prefix would be the negative prefix un-;

 ''happy'' becomes ''unhappy''

=== Infixes ===

It's also possible to put an affix ''inside'' a word; these kind of affixes are called '''infixes''' and they're less common than either prefixes or suffixes. For example, the language Tagalog sometimes forms the active voice by infixing the affix -um-:

 ''bili'' &quot;to exchange something for money&quot; becomes ''bumili'' &quot;to buy&quot;

Another example of an infix occurs in the conlang Quenya, where the past tense forms of some verbs are formed by infixing -n- (and also suffixing -e);

 ''tec-'' &quot;to write&quot; becomes ''tence'' &quot;wrote&quot;

=== Apophony ===

Apophony (sometimes referred to as '''simulfixes''') is when you change the sounds that make up a word. The best way to describe apophony is to show you an example. In English we sometimes change the vowels in a noun to show that it's plural; &lt;foot&gt; becomes &lt;feet&gt;, &lt;goose&gt; becomes &lt;geese&gt;, and &lt;mouse&gt; becomes &lt;mice&gt;.

What's happening here is that the vowels are all moving towards the [[Conlang/Intermediate/Sounds/Phones#Vowels|front]] of the mouth. The change that occurs is always systematic, for example, all the vowels in a word moving to the front (as we see above). If this reminds you of sandhi, it should. Apophony is just a sandhi rule that happens to be triggered by some process happening in the grammar, whereas with sandhi the trigger is purely phonological.

When apophony occurs on vowels it is often called '''ablaut''' while on consonants it's '''mutation'''.

An example of consonant apophony, or mutation, occurs in the Welsh language. In Welsh, nouns that start with consonants will sometimes change that consonant to a different one when they are preceded by certain grammatical words. Different changes happen with different words and it isn't just grammatical words that can trigger the change. For example, the Welsh word for &quot;stone&quot; is &lt;carreg&gt;, but &quot;the stone&quot; is &lt;y garreg&gt;, &quot;my stone&quot; is &lt;fy ngharreg&gt; and &quot;her stone&quot; is &lt;ei charreg&gt;.

=== Reduplication ===

Reduplication is when a part of a word is repeated in order to change its meaning.  The affix-y name for this is '''duplifix'''.  The repeated part of the word can go anywhere around (or in) the original word.
&lt;!-- TODO: Think up a decent natlang example --&gt;

The Indonesian language uses this, often to pluralize things.  For example, &quot;sayur&quot; (vegetable) will become &quot;sayur-mayur&quot; (vegetables), or &quot;sayur-sayuran&quot; (vegetables, but can also translate as artificial vegetables).

In English reduplication isn't used very much at all, but one use for it is as an intensifier, to try to make the meaning of a word stronger; &quot;super&quot; is reduplicated to &quot;super-duper&quot;. It's also sometimes used in baby-talk.

== Syntactic ==

=== Function words ===

Function words are basically the syntactic versions of prefixes and suffixes. The difference from them is that function words are whole words that, instead of being fixed to another word, are simply juxtaposed next to it. Function words in English include everything from the articles (a, the), to the prepositions (in, for, over), to the final element in phrasal verbs (to put ''off'', to eat ''out'').

Because they are a syntactic phenomenon, function words don't just act on single words; they can act on whole phrases. For example, the article &quot;the&quot; in the phrase &quot;the house&quot; only affects the one word &quot;house&quot;, but the preposition &quot;in&quot; in the phrase &quot;in the house where I grew up&quot; affects the whole phrase &quot;the house where I grew up&quot;.

=== Clitics ===

A clitic is sort of like a cross between an affix and a function word; it's physically attached to a word and affects it phonologically like an affix, but grammatically it acts at the level of phrases like a function word.

An example of a clitic in English is the possessive 's (as in ''the boy's bike''). So why is this a clitic and not a suffix? Here's why... suppose that you wanted to express the concept that &quot;the castle&quot; belongs to &quot;the king&quot;. You'd say &quot;the king's castle&quot;. Now suppose that you wanted to say that &quot;the castle&quot; belongs to both &quot;the king&quot; and &quot;the queen&quot;. If the possessive 's was really a suffix then you'd have to say &quot;the king's and queen's castle&quot; (two s'), but you don't, you say &quot;the king and queen's castle&quot; (one 's). This is because the possessive s is a clitic and is capable of governing the whole phrase &quot;the king and queen&quot; rather than just &quot;the king&quot; and &quot;the queen&quot; separately.

The Epistle to the Hebrews
Wherein it is put forward that Jesus, upon ascension into heaven, assumes the office of High Priest whereby the access of man to God is finally and fully assured.
“Hebrews does not name its author nor identify the intended readers, nor does it give us any explicit information about the provenance, the destination, or the date of composition… unless fresh evidence comes to light, Hebrews must remain a witness to the richness and variety of thought in the first century among Christians not known to us by name.”  TIB XI pp. 577, 583, &amp; 589 
 “Heb’s” [Hebrews’] “extensive use of the contrast between the eternal, stable, and abiding nature of heavenly reality and the transitory and imperfect nature of all that is outside that sphere has led many scholars to maintain that the intellectual world of the author was that of idle Platonism, the same as that of the Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria.”  TNJBC p. 921 
“… [this] means that [the author’s] .. Christian convictions are presented in the atmosphere of Platonic idealism…
“It has long been recognized that Hebrews betrays a close kinship with the thinking of Philo of Alexandria, extending to very striking verbal parallelism… What the parallels … prove is that he worked with a non-Palestinian Jewish tradition…The Logos for Philo is prevailingly a philosophical concept and can be equated with a ‘power of God’ or ‘reason in man’; and while Philo has genuine religious objectives and can indeed conceive of an incarnate Logos he could not have concentrated the Logos in one historic person whose human experience is the one and only source of salvation.
“… [the author’s] attempt to validate the sacrifice as a permanent principle is good Judaism.”  TIB XI p. 587

“We may sum up our author’s Christology negatively by saying that he has nothing to do with the older Hebrew messianic hopes of a coming Son of David, who would be a divinely empowered human leader to bring in the kingdom of God on earth; and that while he still employs the figure of a militant, apocalyptic king … who will come again…, this is not of the essence of his thought about Christ.

“Positively, our author present Christ as divine in nature, and solves any possible objection to a divine being who participates in human experience, especially in the experience of death, by the priestly analogy.   He seems quite unconscious of the logical difficulties of his position proceeding from the assumption that Christ is both divine and human, at least human in experience although hardly in nature.”  TIB XI p. 588

 “This article has avoided the use of the term ‘mystical,’ a slippery word; yet it is clear that our author does not follow the Pauline line in setting forth the relation of the Christian to Christ.  ‘In Christ,’ ‘in the Spirit,’ are expressions and ideas foreign to this thinking…. Christ’s priesthood was a priesthood of personality – although that word is not used – reaching home to men where they live and drawing them to God…  
“The characteristic ideas of Paul are lacking in Hebrews and vice versa.  Hebrews knows nothing of the teaching of justification and does not emphasize the Resurrection (it is the 
Ascension that concerns the author; cf. 4:14), mystical union with Christ, the new life through the Spirit and in the spirit, or reconciliation.  Paul does not present Christ as priest …
“For Paul the Incarnation is an evidence of the condescension of Christ (II Cor. 8:9); for Hebrews it assures his priestly compassion, fellow feeling, and sympathy…. Paul thinks of the law predominantly under its moral aspects; Hebrews, in respect to its ritualistic requirements…  In our author’s use of Hellenistic ideas, especially the dualistic two-world concept, he has gone several steps beyond Paul who … is much more basically eschatological in his thinking.”  TIB XI p. 590
Authorship is of less interest to me than the question of what Hebrews adds to progress of Christianity from its roots in the sayings and life of Jesus.  The effect of Hebrews, as far as I can tell, has been to reinforce the idea of exclusivity of Christianity.
“There are many signs that Hebrews was ‘late’ as our author regarded lateness.  The gospel ‘was declared at first by the Lord,  and it was attested to us by those who heard him’ (2:3) – a sentence almost enough in itself to rule out Pauline authorship – showing that author and readers alike are second-generation Christians… converts once removed from the original message of the Lord.”  TIB XI p. 593
“The one certainty is that Hebrews was written before I Clement, who quotes extensively from the writing as authoritative but without naming its author.  If we assume that I Clement was written about A.D. 96, Hebrews must have been written before that time.”  TIB XI p. 594
Text
Chapter One
“1. The God who spoke from the first many times and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets 2. speaks to us in these last days by the son whom he set to inherit everything, through whom also he created heavens and the world.” 

“The last days are ‘these’ days; the turn of the ages is now.  The author shares the view of I Pet. 1:20 rather than holding that the End is still ahead, as in II Pet.” [Peter]  “3:3; Jude 18; II Tim.” [Timothy] “3:1.” TIB XI p. 599
“The idea of the Son as the active agent of Creation (cf. John 1:3), so foreign to primitive Hebrew thinking, appeared in Judaism under the form of Wisdom as the forthgoing power of God, and in Hellenistic circles under the form of the Logos.” TIB XI p. 600
“3. He projected his glory and image of his self, and bore everything by his word, so great is its power,” 
“The same form of expression is used by an apocryphal writer, Wisdom, chap. vii. 26 where, speaking of the uncreated Wisdom of God, he says, ‘For she is the splendor of eternal light, απαυγασμα γαρ εσι φοτος αιδιου,” [apaugasma gar esi fotos aidiou] ‘and the unsullied mirror of the image of God, and the image of his goodness.’” A.C. VI p. 652 
“and after he cleansed sins, sat to the right of the majesty in the heights.”
 “It is well to consider whether these extreme statements about the unique relation of the Son to God and to the universe do not compromise monotheism.  Our author, like other N.T. writers , is not conscious of any threat to monotheism in his Christology.   It is God alone who reveals himself in his own nature, glory, and creative power in the Son.  The accent is upon God’s action and revelation in and through the Son, whose identity in nature with God simply ensures that the revelation is truly from and of God.  The real problem the author has set for himself is to explain Jesus’ humiliating suffering and death.”  TIB XI p. 602

…
“5. For of whom of the angels did He ever say,”

‘You are my son;
today I have begotten you’”

 “…the verse guarantees the sonship of Christ.  That the angels were frequently called the ‘sons of God’ in the O.T. (cf. Gen. 6:2, Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7) and in Jewish writings is either unknown to our author or is regarded as irrelevant to the sense in which he uses the word.”  TIB XI pp. 604-605

“The author of Heb understood the ‘today’ of Ps 2:7 as the day of the exaltation of the risen Christ (cf. Acts 13:33)” TNJBC p. 923
“or

‘I will be father to him
and he will be son to me’?”

“… quoted by St. Paul, Acts xiii.33, as referring to the resurrection of Christ.”  A. C. VI p. 654

“According to 2 Sam 7:15, the relationship between God and the Davidic ruler was that of father to son.  Consequently the day of the king’s accession to power was the day on which he was ‘begotten’ as the son of God.”  TNJBC p. 923 

“6. And, when he brings the first born to the world, he says,

‘And all the gods worship him’”

“A quotation from Deut. 32:43 (LXX) and Ps. 97:7” TIB XI p. 605

“7. while of the angles he said,

“I will make spirits of the angels,
His servants will be blazing fires.” 

“8. But of the son he says,

‘Your throne, God, is forever and ever
The scepter of your kingdom will be an upright scepter’

“Of itself, the application of the name ‘God’ to him is of no great significance; the Ps had already used it of the Hebr king to whom it was addressed.  Undoubtedly, the author of Heb saw more in the name than what was conveyed by the court style of the original…”  TNJBC p. 923
…
“11. They will pass away and you will remain standing.
12. They will wear out like clothing.”

“It is remarkable that our word world is a contraction of wear old; a term by which our ancestors expressed the sentiment expressed in this verse.”  A.C. VI p. 657

 …
“14. Are not all of them spirits of service, sent to serve those destined to inherit salvation?”

“What will impress the student of the quotations” [vss. 5-14] “is that our author is not interested in the original meaning or the original context; e.g., Deut. 32:43 (LXX, cf. Ps. 97:7) is clearly an exhortation to worship God and contains no messianic implication.  Many of the quotations, conceivably all of them, may have been messianically interpreted in this time and the circles in which the author moved, but he assumes a method of scriptural exegesis which is based on the belief that hidden meanings become clear to the reader who has the ‘key.’  The ‘key’ is the sonship of Christ, as for Philo it is the Logos.  What are we to say about such a method?  It is more important to understand than to condemn him.  He and his contemporaries reverse the modern developmental approach to the Bible.  Without the concept of an evolving, growing revelation of God, he reads back into the ancient scriptures intimations and forshadowings of the truth as he sees it in Christ.  Every passage, as equally inspired, must yield its quota of divine truth to the eye upon which the perfect revelation has dawned.  Unjustifiable as this method undoubtedly is for the interpretation of scripture, it yet suggests a valid principle which the historical method tends to obscure, viz., that the prophets were dealing at first hand with God and God with them, and that to regard them as items in a ‘process’ and nothing more is to disregard their essential significance.” TIB XI p. 604

Chapter Two
…
“3. How can we escape if we do not attend to this great salvation, which was first spoken from the mouth of the lord and confirmed to us by his listeners?”

“Though John the Baptist went before our Lord to prepare his way, yet he could not be properly said to preach the Gospel, and even Christ’s preaching was a beginning of the great proclamation; it was his own spirit in the apostles and evangelists, the men who heard him preach, that opened the whole mystery of the kingdom of heaven.”  A.C. VI pp. 660-661

“… incidentally” [this] rules out Paul as the author of Hebrew.”  TIB XI p. 610
…
“10 … he, for whose sake everything is and by whom everything is, was fit, in his bringing many sons to glory, to perfect, by suffering, the engineer” [bretkhu] “of their salvation.”

perfect, by suffering “… an answer to the grand objection of the Jews: ‘The Messiah is never to be conquered, or die; but will be victorious, and endure forever.”  A.C. VI p. 663
…
“14. And since the children were partakers in flesh and blood, he partook in flesh and blood himself in order to destroy, by his death, that which is in the hand of the ruler” [χρατος kratos] “of death; the Adversary.”

“This is spoken in conformity to an opinion prevalent among Jews, that there was a certain fallen angel who was called מליק המות malik hamaveth, the angel of death, i.e., one who had the power of separating the soul from the body, when God decreed that the person should die.  There were two of these according to the Jewish writers…  Thus Tob haarets, fol. 31 ‘There are two angels which preside over death; one is over those who die out of the land of Israel, and his name is Sammael: the other is he who presides over those who die in the land of Israel, and this is Gabriel.’” A.C. VI p. 665

“The paradox that death was nullified by Christ’s death is similar to that of Rom 8:3, where Paul says that God condemned sin by sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh.  The author gives no reason beyond saying that it was fitting to God to act thus.”  TNJBC p. 926
…
“17. Thus it was that he was likened to his brethren in everything, so that he could be high priest, merciful and faithful in the things of God, in order to reconcile the sins of the people.”

“We assume that his readers were familiar with the idea that the devil has the power of death – it was current in both Jewish and Christian thinking – and that they will understand how the human experience of Jesus, culminating in his death and exaltation, vanquishes the devil, for the writer does not explain it.” TIB XI p. 616
…
Chapter Three

“1. Therefore, holy brethren, whose portion is in your heavenly calling, regard Jesus, the emissary and chief priest of the proclamation of our belief.”

“The not attending to this circumstance, and the not discerning between actual positive holiness, and the call to it, as the consecration of the persons, has led many commentators and preachers into destructive mistakes.  Antinomianism has had its origin here: and as it was found that many persons were called saints, who, in many respects, were miserable sinners, hence it has been inferred that they were called saints in reference to a holiness which they had in another: and hence the Antinomian imputation of Christ’s righteousness to unholy believers, whose hearts were abominable before God; and whose lives were a scandal to the Gospel.  Let, therefore, a due distinction be made between persons, by their Profession holy, i.e. consecrated to God: and persons who are faithful to that profession, and are both inwardly and outwardly holy.  They are not all Israel who are of Israel; a man, by a literal circumcision, may be a Jew outwardly: but the circumcision of the heart, by the spirit, makes a man a Jew inwardly.  A man may be a Christian in profession, and not such in heart: and those who pretend, that although they are unholy in themselves, they are reputed holy in Christ, because his righteousness is imputed to them, most awfully deceive their own souls.” A.C VI p. 667

“7. Therefore, as the holy spirit said,

‘Today’, if you attend to his voice,
8. ‘do not harden your hearts as in MeRiYBaH,
as in the day of MaSaH in the desert,
9. when your fathers tried me,
tested me, and saw my work forty years,
10. wherefore I was disgusted with that generation, 
and I said, “If their hearts err,
And they do not know my ways!”,
11. whereby I swore in my anger,
“If they come to my rest!”’”

“Verse 7. Wherefore; (as the Holy Ghost saith, To-day] These words are quoted form Psa. xcv. 7. And as they were written by David and attributed here to the Holy Ghost, it proves that David wrote by the inspiration of God’s Holy Spirit. … The words strongly imply, as indeed does the whole epistle, the possibility of falling from the grace of God, and perishing everlastingly: and without this supposition, these words, and all such like, which make more than two-thirds of the whole of divine revelation, would have neither sense nor meaning… Angels fell – Adam fell – Solomon fell – and multitudes of believers have fallen, and, for aught we know, rose no more; and yet we are told that we cannot finally lose the benefits of our conversion!   Satan preached this doctrine to our first parents: they believed him – sinned – and fell; and brought a whole world to ruin.”  A.C. VI pp. 669-670

“In the OT the exodus had served as a symbol of the return of the Jews from the Babylonian Exile (Isa 42:9; 43:16-21; 51:9-11)…” TNJBC p. 927

“12. Beware, brethren, that there not be in any of you an evil or faithless heart, diverging from the living God.”

“The expression ‘to apostatize from the living God’ is frequently taken as indication that Heb was written not to Jewish Christians in danger of relapsing into Judaism, but to pagan converts; for a return to Judaism would not, it is argued, be called an ‘apostatizing from the true God’.”  TNJBC p. 927

“The intense seriousness of the warning is emphasized by the danger of hardening of the heart and of falling away from the living God, and by the implication that the readers face a decision which may exclude them from salvation as irrevocably as the wilderness generation was excluded from the Promised Land.  The writer will recur to the impossibility of a second repentance (cr. 6:4 ff.; 10:26; 12: 15-17, 25), which is based on the perfect and final offering of Christ … This teaching, uniquely stressed in Hebrews, was to play an important role in subsequent Christian life and thought..” TIB XI p. 625
…
“14. Thus we are partakers of Anointed if we hold on, without failing, to the end, with the confidence with which we began.”

“This and similar expressions derive from the basic outlook of our author, who thinks of religion in terms of worship, the summon bonum” [Latin: highest good] “being access to God through the purification of sins.” TIB XI p. 625

Chapter Four
…
“4. Since somewhere he said regarding the seventh day, ‘And God rested on the seventh day from all his work’, 5. and since he said again, ‘lest there come to my rest’, 6. while there are those for whom it remains to enter into her, and those who were evangelized first who did not enter because of rebellion, 7. again he witnessed of a special day – today – in his saying in the mouth of David as told above and this after much time, ‘Today, if you listen, do not harden your hearts.’ 8. Had Joshua [Ιησυς Yesus Jesus = Joshua (God is savior)] brought them to the rest, he would not have spoken after that of another day. 9. Therefore there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.”

“The ingenious interweaving of Gen. 2:2, the story of the fate of those who perished in the wilderness because of unbelief recorded in Ps. 95, and the promise of today in the same psalm, together with the application of the whole to the current situation of the church, is a type of argument thoroughly familiar in the first century and not unknown today.  We will see this kind of scriptural interpretation again, notably in the Melchizedek speculation (ch. 7).  The fact that no responsible scholar today would juggle scripture in this fashion must not be allowed to obscure the underlying thought of the writer.”  TIB XI pp. 631-632

“14. And since we have a great High Priest, who passed by way of the heavens,  (is he not Jesus the son of God?) we hold fast to the profession of our faith.
15. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot feel our weaknesses with us, rather one who, like us, has been tried in everything, but without sin.”

“The writer is implying here – and this is unique in the N.T. – that temptations in every respect like our own were experienced by Jesus, and that his sinlessness was the result of conscious decision and intense struggle (c.f. 5:7-9; 12:2-4), rather than the mere formal consequence of his divine nature. … [The writer] must not be robbed of the credit… of being the first to ascribe to Jesus full human experience and at the same time full divinity, without, at least from his point of view, compromising either.” TIB XI pp. 639-640

“…though he had a perfect human body, and human soul, yet that body was perfectly tempered; it was free from all morbid action, and, consequently, from all irregular movements.  His mind, or human soul, being free from all sin, being every way perfect, could feel no irregular temper, nothing that was inconsistent with infinite purity.  In all these respects he was different from us; and cannot, as man, sympathize with us in any feelings of this kind…” A.C. VI p. 679

Chapter Five

“1. Every high priest, taken from among men, is appointed for the sake of men unto the things of God in order to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 2. He can spare [μετριοπαθειν metriopathein] the erring and the strayers because he too is encompassed with weakness.”

“… (μετριοπαθειν) is a word common with the Stoics and witnesses to our author’s culture.  It connotes the mean between censoriousness and sentimentality, and although our author hardly means by it an approach toward that apathy (απαθεια [apatheia]) which was the Stoic goal, it suits his purpose admirably, for the true priest must combine severity toward sin and sympathy for the sinner.  He limits the possibility of forgiveness through sacrifice to sins of ignorance and waywardness arising from human weakness, as did the law of sacrifice itself.  The day of Atonement, which is in his mind, availed only for such sins, not for deliberate and willful disloyalty.  As we shall see, our author finds no place for the forgiveness of such sins.” TIB XI pp. 642-643

“7. And, in the days he was in a flesh and blood body, he brought forth prayers and supplications in great shouting and tears unto the He who can save from death, and truly was heard because of the fear of God in him.”

“Who in the days of his flesh] The time of his incarnation, during which he took all the infirmities of human nature upon him; and was afflicted in his body and human soul just as other men are; irregular and sinful passions excepted.

“…  ‘there is no gate which tears will not pass through’ Rabbi Jehudah Sohar, Exod. Fol. 5.” A.C. VI p. 682

Chapter Six

“4. Thus those whose eyes had already shown them, who had experienced the gifts of the heavens, who were given their portion in the holy spirit,
5. and who tasted  the good word of God and powers of the world to come
6. and yet apostatize – it is impossible to renew them again to repentance , they being crucifiers anew of the son of God, holding him in contempt.”

“Vs. 6b means that they themselves  crucify the Son of God when they apostatize, not that they crucify him ‘again’ …, for the initial Crucifixion was necessary for his priestly ministry and our author does not regard it as a crime (contrast Acts 2:23).” TIB XI p. 653

“7. Behold, the ground that drinks the rain that falls upon her many times and produces good herbs for those who work her receives a blessing from God,
8. but if thorns and thistles grow she is worthless and brought to cursing, and her end is to be burnt.”

“The agricultural illustration …. Adds little to the thought and is not very apt… Our author was a man of the study, as Paul was of the city, and, in striking contrast to Jesus, they are equally unimpressive when they turn to illustrations from nature.” TIV XI p. 653
…
“13. When God promised his promise to Abraham, he swore on himself, since there was none greater than he upon whom he could swear.  He said, ‘For a blessing I have blessed you and a multitude I will multiply of you’. 15. And thus, in his persisting patiently, Abraham acquired that which he had been promised. 16 Men swear by greater than they, and the oath is to them a seal of truth which puts an end to all disputation.
…
“18. And when God wanted to show more forcefully to the heirs of the promise that his intention was not subject to change, he obligated himself by oath.  18. In this way, upon two unchanging things,” [the oath and the promise] “(lest God lie by them), we are rescued, we are greatly encouraged to hold on to the hope of rest before him, 19. hope that is a secure and firm anchor for us, and reaches to within the veil, 20. into the place that Jesus, the vanguard who works before us, enters for us, and is the chief priest ‘forever of my oracle, Melchizedek’.”

“This formal argument is thoroughly uncongenial to modern modes of thought.  It is a kind of midrash on Gen. 22:16-17, combined with Lev. 16:2 (vs. 19), issuing in Ps. 110:4 (vs. 20) and so tying up the argument with 4:14 and 5:10.  Before asking what validity, if any, this method of interpreting scripture may have for us, let us note some points of interest in this strange piece of exegesis.  First, it was not strange to the writer’s contemporaries.  The oath of God by himself had intrigued others, notably Philo.  Philo is troubled by the anthropomorphism of the phrase and inclines to regard it as a concession the O.T. writer makes to the human understanding of his readers… Our author betrays no knowledge of the recorded saying of Jesus about oaths in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5:33-37; cf. Jas. 5:12)

“The writer’s artificial use of scriptural witnesses, by its very disregard of the historical setting and the literal meaning of the passages cited, testifies to his sensitiveness to a divine Voice speaking through the changing modes of human understanding directly from God to man.” TIB XI pp. 657-660

“18. …we the rescued are greatly encouraged to hold onto the hope of repose before us, 19. hope which is as a secure and firm anchor to our lives, and arrive to within the veil.”

‘The apostle here changes the allusion: he represent the state of the followers of God in this lower world, as resembling that of a vessel striving to perform her voyage thorough a troublesome, tempestuous, dangerous sea.  At last she gets near the port; but the tempest continues, the water is shallow, broken, and dangerous, and she cannot get it: in order to prevent her being driven to sea again, she heaves out her sheet anchor, which she has been able to get within the pier head, by means of her boat, though she could not herself get in; then, swinging at the length of her cable, she rides out the storm in confidence, knowing that her anchor is sound, the ground good in which it is fastened, and the cable strong.  Though agitated, she is safe; though buffeted by wind and tide, she does not drive: by and by the storm ceases, the tide flows in, her sailors take to the capstan, wear the ship against the anchor, which still keeps its bite or hold, and she get safely into the port.”  A.C. VI p. 693
…
Chapter Seven

“Ch. 7 is the famous Melchizedek speculation in which by an ingenious use of etymology and Scripture the author proves to his own, and perhaps to his readers’, satisfaction that although Jesus was not a priest after the Levitical order, he was a ‘a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek,’ and that the Melchizedek priesthood, the perfect as contrasted to the imperfect, was destined to supersede it, and with it the law on which it was based…” TIB XI p. 578  
“The form of this scriptural argument” [7:1-28] “is quite like the discussion of ‘rest’ (3:6c-4:13) in that the author combines what we would call a historic incident with verses from the psalms, which lift it out of the temporal into the eternal or spiritual realm.  We need to remember that this is a legitimate method for interpreting scripture by the standards of the times, and that it is, in fact, quite mild as an example of allegory when compared with the best-known exponent of that school, Philo of Alexandria.”  TIB XI p. 661

“1.This MaLKhiY TseDeQ [Melchizedek], king of SaLayM [Salem], priest to the high God, who went out to greet ‘aBRaHaM [Abraham] when Abraham returned from beating the kings, and blessed him,
2. and to whom Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything (whose name meant righteous king, who was also king of Salem, which means king of the peace),
3. without father, without mother, without noteworthy genealogy; there is neither beginning to his days nor end to his life, yet, like the son of God, he remained priest forever.”

“According to a principle of rabbinic exegesis, what is not mentioned in the Torah does not exist …. This is a partial but probably insufficient explanation for the ascription of eternal life to Melchizedek… though Melchizedek’s ‘eternity’ furnished the author with a typology that suited his purpose since it provided not only a foreshadowing of Jesus’ priesthood but a contrast with that of the sons of Levi (v8), it also creates a problem, viz., are there, then two eternal priests, Melchizedek and Jesus?... Perhaps one must conclude that the Melchizedek-Jesus typology, for all its usefulness to the author of Heb, raises also a difficulty that he simply ignored.”   TNJBC p. 932

“It is vs. 3 that most troubles the modern reader.  The silence of Genesis on the genealogy of Melchizedek is pressed to mean that he had none… He regards historical events as valid but shadowy intimations of unseen and timeless realities. He is not prepared to go all the way with Philo and his school in permitting history to evaporate into mere representations of reality, for he focuses attention upon the radical significance of Jesus’ human experience; and man’s apprehension of the unseen does not depend on any innate potentiality (Logos), but upon an objective living way to God opened up by Jesus as the perfect priest.” TIB XI pp. 662-664

“The object of the apostle, in thus producing the example of Melchisedec, was to show – 1. That Jesus was the person prophesied of in the cxth Psalm; which Psalm the Jews uniformly understood as predicting the Messiah.  2. To answer the objections of the Jews against the legitimacy of the priesthood of Christ, taken from the stock from which he proceeded.  The objection is this: - if the Messiah is to be a true priest, he must come from a legitimate stock, as all the priests under the law have regularly done; otherwise we cannot acknowledge him to be a priest.  But Jesus of Nazareth has not proceeded from such a stock; therefore we cannot acknowledge him for a priest, the antitype of Aaron. … 1. God had commanded (lev. xxi. 10.) that the high priest should be chosen from among their brethren; i.e. from the family of Aaron.  2. That he should marry a virgin.  3. He must not marry a widow.  4. Nor a divorced person.  5. Nor a harlot.  6. Nor one of another nation.  He who was found to have acted contrary to these requisitions, was, jure divino,” [by divine law] “excluded from the pontificate.  On the contrary, it was necessary that he who desired this honour should be able to prove his descent from the family of Aaron; and if he could not, though even in the priesthood, he was cast out, as we find from Ezra ii. 62. and Nehem. vii.63.

“To these divine ordinances the Jews have added, 1. That no proselyte could be a priest; 2. Nor a slave; 3. Nor a bastard; 4. Nor the son of a Nethinim ; 5. Nor one whose father exercised any base trade.  And that they might be well assured of all this, they took the utmost care to preserve their genealogies, which were regularly kept in the archives of the temple.  When any person aspired to the sacerdotal function, his genealogical table was carefully inspected; and if any of the above blemishes was found in him, he was rejected.

“He who could not support his pretension by just genealogical evidences, was said by the Jews to be without father.  Thus in the Bershith Rabba, sect. 18. fol. 18. on these words, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother – it is said, if a proselyte to the Jewish religion have married his own sister, whether by the same father or by the same mother, they cast her out, according to Rabbi Meir.  But the wise men say, if she be of the same mother, they cast her out; but, if of the same father, they retain her, שאין אב לגוי” [She’aYN ‘aB LeGOiY] ‘for a Gentile has not father’; i.e. his father is not reckoned in the Jewish genealogies.  In this way both Christ and Melchisedec were without father and without mother; i.e. were not descended from the original Jewish sacerdotal stock.  Yet Melchisedec, who was a Canaanite, was a priest of the Most High God.”  A.C. VI pp. 694-695

4.  Behold how great is he to whom Abraham our father gave a tenth of the best of the plunder.
5. Are not the sons of Levi, the heirs of the priesthood, decreed by the Torah to take a tenth from the people (that is, from their brethren)? So too are those excretions [יוצאי] of Abraham’s loins.”

“… The Levites received a tenth from the people.  The priests received a tenth of this tenth from the Levites…” A. C. VI p. 696

“6. But he who was unrelated to their family took a tenth from Abraham, and blessed him who was obliged to him [הבטחה].
7. There is no appeal of this, that the lesser is blessed of the greater than he.”

“In spite of the axiomatic tone of these words, this contradicts what is said in the OT (cf. 2 Sam 14:22; Job 31:20)…” TNJBC p. 932
…
“19. The Torah fulfills nothing; instead came a better hope, and by her we approach God.”

“The priesthood of the believers – “What the OT reserved to the priesthood is attributed to all believers” TNJBC p. 933

“Limited as he is by the formal and to us rather artificial character of this argument, his thought from time to time overflows it.”  TIB XI p. 668

“20. And so that this not be without an oath –“

“… ‘the Levitical priesthood, and the law of Moses, being established without an oath, were thereby declared to be changeable at God’s pleasure’. This judicious note is from Dr. Macknight.” A.C. VI p. 699
…
Chapter Eight
…
“6. And here Jesus receives a higher priesthood, just as he is the mediator of a higher covenant that was established on a better promise.”

“The importance of the covenant idea both in Judaism and in early Christianity can hardly be overestimated.  It was the word used (berît) to characterize Judaism as a religion of moral obligations and moral choices.  Other religions accepted their gods as a natural and inevitable necessity… But Yahweh chose Israel as his people, and the people of Israel freely accepted the divine choice and the obligations involved. … This view of covenant was closely bound up with the development of Judaism as an ethical monotheism.”  TIB XI pp. 678-679

“9. YHVH said ‘Not like the covenant that I cut with their fathers in the day when I held their hands to remove them from the land of Egypt, which covenant they violated, for which I loathed them,’” 

“And I regarded them not] Καγω ημελησα αυτων,” [Kago emelesa auton] “and I neglected them, or despised them; but the words in the Hebrew text in the prophet, are ואנכי בעלתי בם veanoci baalti bam, which we translate, although I was a husband to them.  If our translation be correct, is it possible to account for this most strange difference between the apostle and the prophet?  Could the Spirit of God be the author of such a strange, not to say contradictory, translation of the same word?  Let it be observed: - 1. That the apostle quotes from the Septuagint; and in quoting a version accredited by, and commonly used among the Jews, he ought to give the text as he found it…”  A.C. VI p. 704

“10. ‘for this is the covenant that I will cut with the house of Israel after those days;’ said YHVH, ‘I will set my law among them and upon their hearts I will write it, and I will be God to them and they will be a people to me.’”

“What distresses the modern student is our author’s failure to make the most of this magnificent passage which is one of the high-water marks of the O.T.  Taken by itself, the Jeremiah passage seems to ignore entirely the priestly system so important for our author, and to present religion, in its purely spiritual aspects.  The Mosaic law with its insistence upon code and conduct is set aside for a religion whose laws are written in the mind and on the heart.  Obedience, the knowledge of God, and forgiveness of sins are still essential, but they are conceived in terms of inwardness.  All this our author seems to ignore in the interest of making his one point: the new antiquates the old… the sacrificial system on earth is ended, not because it is repudiated, but because it is perfected.  In his own way, the way of the liturgist, he presents religion in wholly spiritual terms.”  TIB XI pp. 681-683

Chapter Nine
…
“2. …they raised an outer tabernacle, in which were the menorah, and the table, and the bread of the presence; and it was called holy.
3. And from that house to the second veil, the tabernacle called the holy of holies.
4.  And in it were the golden incense altar and the cabinet of the covenant, covered about with gold.  And in the cabinet of the covenant a gold jar (in which was the manna), the staff of Aaron (which blossomed), and the tablets of the covenant.”

“It is evident that the apostle speaks here of the tabernacle built by Moses … The ark of the covenant and the two tables of the law, were never found after the return from the Babylonian captivity…”  A.C. VI p. 707

“5. And above it the cherubs of the glory shaded the cover (not to speak yet of everything about them).
6. When all these were so arranged, the priests entered regularly into the outer tabernacle to fulfill their service.
7. But into the inner tabernacle only the high priest entered, once a year, and not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins of the people.”

“… as Lev. 16:14ff indicates, there is no provision even on the Day of Atonement for deliberate, willful sin.” TIB XI p. 687
…
“9. … offerings and sacrifices could not bring the holy servant into perfection of his conscience,
10. they related to nothing other than food, drink, and diverse ablutions.”

“This low estimate of their efficacy would hardly have been accepted by any Hebrew.  For the Hebrew sacrifice was not merely an expression of the spirit of the offerer, and certainly not an empty form that neither added nor subtracted anything.  It required the spirit to validate it, but once validated it was thought to be charged with power.”  TNJBC p. 936

“11. But the Anointed, in his becoming chief priest of the good to come, passed through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not the work of hands,  - that is to say, that was not related to this creation, - 
12. and in his blood, not in the blood of he-goats and claves, entered once and for all in to the holy, and acquired eternal redemption.”

“How does the sacrifice of Christ achieve the result of ridding men of sin and ensuring access to God?  The author … rests upon the axiom that ‘without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins’ (vs. 22). … This is all the logic of his argument requires; with this concise statement he has reached the climax of his thought, and what follows (i.e., after vs. 14) is an exposition of some aspects of the argument and exhortation on the basis of it. …Entrance into this Holy Place and access through him into it for all men is the supreme service of Christ as priest.  Again we see that the Resurrection, never mentioned in Hebrews except in 13:20 and there in a benediction, plays not role.  It is the Ascension which his analogy requires.”  TIB XI p. 690
…
“22. Thus, according to the Torah, almost everything is cleaned in blood, and without the spilling of blood there is no pardon.”

John Brown’s favorite verse .

“This ignores the other means of forgiveness known to the OT: fasting (Joel 2:12), almsgiving (Sir 3:29), contrition (Ps. 51:19)…” TNJBC p. 937

“It is idle to ask just how blood availed to effect forgiveness of sins, for this is precisely the point he assumes as an axiom… The efficacy of blood was axiomatic not only in Judaism, but by and large in the ancient world … Was Christ’s blood propitiatory, expiatory, or merely symbolic?  He does not tell us …” TIB XI pp. 695-696
…
“27. And just as it is decreed that the sons of Adam will die once, and then the judgment,
28. so also the Anointed, after he is offered once, to bear many sins, will appear again [שנית ShayNiYT second] – not for the matter of sin – to those who wait for him for salvation.”

“To deliver the bodies of believers from the empire of death, reunite them to their purified souls, and bring both into his eternal glory,.” A.C. VI p. 713

“This is the one explicit use of the term ‘Second Coming’ in the NT.  The ‘parousia’ or ‘presence’ is not elsewhere called ‘second’ coming, although the idea may be present.”  TIB XI p. 698

Chapter Ten

“1. The Torah, which is a shadow of the good that was to come, not the perfect reflection of those things, never could bring to perfection by offerings those bringing the offerings continually year after year.
2. Could they have done so, the offerings would have ceased, because after the holy servants had been cleansed once there would not have been in them a further occurrence of sin.”

“The argument is weak and ignores the evident objection that those sacrifices could have expiated past sins, but new sins would have called for further sacrifices.”  TNJBC p. 938
…
“4. For the blood of bulls and goats cannot remove sins.”

“This statement of inability contradicts the belief expressed in Jub” [Book of Jubilees] “5:17-18” TNJBC p. 938

“Readers attracted by Judaism of the normative type would hardly have been impressed by his argument, for he does not meet the objections a good Jew would raise at every point.  He assumes that his controlling concept of shadow and substance, earthly and heavenly, is shared by his readers.  If they share it, his argument is really cogent.”  TIB XI p. 702

“5. So upon entering the world he said,

‘You desired neither sacrifice nor offering;
you prepared a body for me;
6. you requested neither burnt nor sin offerings.
7. So I said, “Behold, I have come; -
 in the scroll of the book it is written of me, -
‘to do the will of my God.’”’”

“Ps. 40: 6-8 is quoted not as the words of the Psalmist, but as Christ’s words to God when he came into the world.  The Psalm in the Hebrew original is a song of praise for God’s help.  But instead of the Hebrew ‘mine ears hast thou opened’ (i.e., that I may hear and obey), the LX reads a body hast thou prepared for me.  This word body is essential for the author (cf. vs. 10), and his dependence on the Greek translation is nowhere more obvious than here.  It is true that both readings can be reconciled with the main idea of the passage, obedience to the will of God as the true substitute for animal sacrifice.  Our author cannot use this thought.  He must show that instead of animal sacrifices, Christ offered himself, his own body, as the one acceptable sacrifice to God.  The sacrificial principle is thus maintained by the contrast not of sacrifice with obedience but of a sacrifice with the sacrifice.” TIB XI pp. 704 - 705

“8. In his saying, above, ‘I do not want nor have I requested sacrifice, offering, or burnt or sin offering’ which were brought to him according to the Torah,
9. and in his saying after that, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will’, he removed the first in order to raise the second.
10. And with the same will sanctified us by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus the Anointed once and for all.”

“… The author comes close to saying that God willed the sacrifice of the self and of self-will, and that Christ’s sacrifice is of that kind.  We almost expect him to continue the thought by saying that we draw near to God through self-sacrifice and self-denial.  Jesus’ words, ‘If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me’ (Mark 8:34…) come involuntarily to mind…” TIB XI pp. 705-706
…
“23. Let us hold on to the hope about which we testify without wavering, for faithful is the promise,” 

i.e., the hope  of “the resurrection of the body, and everlasting life” A.C. VI p. 720

“24. Let us pay attention to each to his neighbor to encourage one another to love and good works 25. without neglecting our assemblies, as some men do, but each should encourage his neighbor. Particularly when you see that the day is near.

“… fellowship in worship is the root of right human relations.” TIB XI p. 713
…
“28. The violator of the law of Moses died without clemency upon the testimony of two or three witnesses,
29. How much greater will be, in your opinion, the punishment appropriate to he who tramples underfoot the son of God, and scorns the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and blasphemes the spirit of grace?
30. Behold we know who said ‘vengeance and repayment is mine’, and, ‘YHVH will judge his people’,
31. so, it is awful to fall into the hands of the living God!”

“At this point, it may be said, the author did not catch the full import of the gospel … his analogy from the old covenant turns out to impose a limitation on the new … Can he have known of the record that Peter, who denied the Lord at a moment of crises, became a leader in the church?” TIB XI p. 715
…
Chapter 11
...
“4. Out of belief Abel brought to God an offering better than that which Cain brought …”

“As Cain was a husbandman, he brought a mincha or eucharistic offering, of the fruits of the ground, by which he acknowledged the being and providence of God.  Abel being a shepherd, or a feeder of cattle, brought not only the eucharistic offering, but also of the produce of his flock as a sin-offering to God; by which he acknowledged his own sinfulness, God’s justice and mercy, as well as his being and providence, Cain, not at all apprehensive of the demerit of sin, or God’s holiness, contented himself with the mincha or thank-offering; this God could not, consistently with his holiness and justice receive with complacency.”  A.C. VI p. 726

“11. In faith also Sarah received power to become pregnant, although after she had aged, because she thought the promiser faithful.”

“by faith Sarah herself received power for the sewing of seed: The Greek text seems to attribute to Sarah the male role in the conception of Isaac.” TNJBC p. 940

“12. Thus also from one who was as good as dead proceeded quantities like stars of the heavens and sands on the sea shore.”

“The birth of Isaac, (the circumstances of the father and mother considered) was entirely supernatural; and the people who proceeded from this birth were a supernatural people; and were and are most strikingly singular through every period of their history to the present day.”  A.C. VI p. 727
…
“21. In faith Jacob, before his death, blessed the two sons of Joseph, and bowed over the head of his staff.”

“The author’s dependence of the LXX is shown in the phrase the head of his staff (vs. 21), where the Hebrew has ‘bed’.  The consonants of the two words are the same, and the LXX has introduced wrong vowels into the unpointed Hebrew text.”  TIB XI p. 730
…
“32. And what more should I say?  Time is too short to tell of Gideon and Barak and Sampson and Japheth and David and Saul and the prophet, 33. who by faith subdued kings, wrought justice, obtained the promise, closed the mouth of lions, 34. quenched the flames of fire…

 “Vss. 33-34 present the deeds of faith in nine compact phrases.  The fourth and fifth (lions, … fire) inevitably recall Daniel and the doughty three, and appropriate names can be suggested for the rest.  What strikes the reader is the emphasis on military triumphs, unparalleled in the N.T. …  The source in history for much of this summary must be the Maccabean struggle and its triumph.” TIB XI pp. 734-735

“35. Some women received their dead who were resurrected; others were violated to death, without agreeing to deliverance, for the sake of receiving a better resurrection.”

Ετυμπανισθησον – Etumpanistheson “Τυμπανον” [Tympanon] “signifies a baton which was used in bastinadoing  criminals.”  A.C VI p. 731

Chapter 12

“1.Therefore we too, whom a cloud of witnesses surrounds, must also remove every burden and sin, which so easily seizes us, and with patience run the race set before us while looking to Jesus, the engineer and fulfillment of the faith, who for the happiness spread before him, bore the cross and discounted disgrace, and sat to the right of the throne of God.” 

“Our author believes that direct access to God through Christ is the goal of religion, not righteousness as such.”  TIB XI
…
“4. You have not yet fought to blood in your struggle with sin”

“It has been argued that this excludes Rome … as the destination of Hebrews, for Rome had its Martyrs … but if the readers were addressed some decades after the Neronian persecution, the words, although in not too tactful, would not necessarily be untrue of the Romans.”  TIB XI p. 740
…
“22. … You are come to Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem and to the myriad angels, to the assembly, 23. to the congregation of the first born, those written in heaven, to God, judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous who where made perfect, 24. to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood…”

“Our author was not a philosopher like Philo, stressing the inherent capacity of men to apprehend the invisible and to achieve salvation by spiritual discipline and education; he was a Christian, believing that salvation was offered by God in Christ and that men might, through faith in the invisible and timeless reality revealed from within the human and temporal realm by Jesus, be saved to enjoy the complete fellowship with God which the ancient sacrificial system foresaw and prefigured but could never achieve.”  TIB XI p. 747

“28. …let us worship God according to his will, in grace and in reverence, 29. because God is a consuming fire.”

“The final clause, for our God is a consuming fire, will seem to the modern reader a tragic misinterpretation of the gospel message of the love of God.  It must be admitted that our author does not move in the Johannine (cf. John 4:24; I John 4:13-18) or in the Pauline tradition (cf. Rom. 8:37 ff).”

Chapter 13
…
“5. Flee from love of money, and rejoice in your portion, for he said, ‘I will not forsake or leave you.’”

“In one of the sentences of Phocylides, we have a sentiment in nearly the same words as that of the apostle… Be content with present things, and abstain from others.  The covetous man is ever running out into futurity, with insatiable desires after secular good; and if this disposition be not checked, it increases as the subject of it increases in years.  Covetousness is the vice of old age.”  A.C. VI p. 747
…
“9. Do not be swept away by different and strange doctrine, it is good to sustain the heart with grace, not with pronouncements about food that do not benefit anyone who lives according to them;  
10. we have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat.”

“… we are totally unable to identify the strange teaching which is being combated.  Do foods refer to Jewish ritual meals?  To religious sacraments in the mystery cults?  Or even to the Lord’s Supper?  Because Hebrews never refers to the Lord’s Supper and because of the language of this passage (vss. 10-12), many have held that this is a protest against it, or at any rate against a materialistic and magical celebration of it.  It must be admitted that the argument of Hebrews allows no logical place for the repetition of the super.  Christ’s sacrifice cannot be repeated; it was once for all.  The evidence is too scanty, however, for any final conclusion, although diverse and strange seem hardly the appropriate words to use if the readers were Jews by race, tempted to return to Judaism.” 
“11. the carcasses of the animals whose blood is brought to the sanctuary by the chief priest to atone for sin are burned outside the camp
12. therefore also Jesus, in order to sanctify the people with his blood, suffered outside the gate
“14. …we do not have here a constant city, rather we request that which is to come.”

“Here is an elegant and forcible allusion to the approaching destruction of Jerusalem.  The Jerusalem that was below was about to be burnt with fire, and erased to the ground … About seven or eight years after this, Jerusalem was wholly destroyed.” A.C. VI p. 749

“15. Therefore, in every event, we offer, though his mediation a sacrifice of thanks to God, which is to say, the fruit of our lips in thanks to his name.”

“The Jews allowed that, in the time of the Messiah, all sacrifices, except the sacrifice of praise, should cease.  To this maxim the apostle appears to allude; and understood in this way, his words are much more forcible.  In Vayidra Rabba sect. 9. fol. 153. and Rabbi Tanchum, fol. 55. ‘Rabbi Phineas, Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Jocahanan, from the authority of Rabbi Menachem of Galilee, said, In the time of the Messiah all sacrifice shall cease, except the sacrifice of praise.’” A,C. VI p. 749

“16. And do not forget to repay mercy, and to share with the other of what is yours, for sacrifice like these are pleasant to God.”

“Praise, prayer, and thanksgiving, to God, with works of charity and mercy to man, are  the sacrifices which every genuine follower of Christ must offer: and they are the proofs that a man belongs to Christ; and he who does not bear these fruits, gives full evidence, whatever his creed may be, that he is no Christian.”  A.C. VI p. 750

Made a few changes with the Margaret Mead section as well as added an image of Margaret Mead. --[[User:Grotjahn2975|Grotjahn2975]] ([[User talk:Grotjahn2975|talk]]) 22:43, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

While I know it wasn't really explicit in class, I think this section needs more actual history and theory rather than simply small snipits of famous anthropologists' biographies. [[User:Brennanholten|Brennanholten]] ([[User talk:Brennanholten|talk]]) 23:01, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

I changed a few weak words in the Margaret Mead section to add clarity. [[User:Eck4068|Eck4068]] ([[User talk:Eck4068|talk]]) 02:32, 10 March 2009 (UTC) Eck4068

I added more information to the Ray Birdwhistell and added links for a few topics to give more details.  [[User:Cayab|Cayab]]

I edited the last sentence of Edward Burnett Tylor for sentence structure. Holmesa2

I edited the link of Lewis Henry Morgan to not include the was in it. Holmesa2

Added image Lewis Henry Morgan, resized image of tylor.--[[User:Le0068|Le0068]] ([[User talk:Le0068|talk]]) 22:09, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

I added a picture to the Ray Birdwhistell section.  [[User:Cayab|Cayab]]

I added the definition of Animism to the Sir Edward Tyler section [[User:Dasselj|Dasselj]]

I agree that it could use more history, a more general view of the history and changes in field of anthropology over the past centuries. It would also make more organizational sense if the anthropologists were listed according to when they were born/made contributions to the field of anthropology. Ingham7166

I edited one of the sentences in the Lewis Henry morgan article. [[User:Dasselj|Dasselj]]

I switched Ruth Benedict and Mead because Benedict was born before Mead and began her worked as an anthropologist before her. Ingham7166

I edited one of the sentences in the Franz Boas article and also added content about his contribution of the ethnography. [[User:Dasselj|Dasselj]]

I added a few sentences onto Paul Farmer pertaining to the organization that he started. I think he needs credit for started such a helpful and successful organization and it was not mentioned before. [[User:Fredric|Fredric]] ([[User talk:Fredric|talk]]) 23:27, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

In response to the editions of my page on ruth benedict, thank you.  I'm not much of a computer wizard and wasn't sure how to format the code for the picture.  I think that the addition of information about her books being translated was also a viable contribution.  One thing that I think would greatly help students understand the theory would be to classify the theorists work as being (Anthropology as a science (Spencer, Morgan, Tyler), Cultural relativism (Boas, Mead, Structuralism (Durheim, Levi-Strauss) and Structural Functionalism (Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown)and so on.
[[User:Dasselj|Dasselj]]

I edited the title under Famous Cultural Anthropologists &quot;Researches Into the Early History of Mankind&quot; because it was a title and was not capitalized. --[[User:Gabi Chavarria|Gabi Chavarria]] ([[User talk:Gabi Chavarria|talk]]) 06:55, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I made a link under American Sign Language for Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet because he was the founder. --[[User:Gabi Chavarria|Gabi Chavarria]] ([[User talk:Gabi Chavarria|talk]]) 06:58, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

=Appreciating Technical Communication Audiences=

== Types of Audiences ==
When preparing documents, it is important to remember potential audiences for your work. Awareness of the differences between Intended and Unintended audiences may impact how an author presents or includes information in a document, and may make a difference in the event of a legal issue concerning the document. Also, awareness of a complex audience will ensure that an author's writing does not exclude any potential readers. You do not want to leave an important figure out if they need to be touched on. 

===Intended vs. Unintended Audience ===

Intended audiences are best thought of as the people you are initially writing to. It is the audience for which your document is intended. Unintended audiences may be anyone that comes across your writing at any point in time. In a professional setting, its important to be mindful of the unintended audience of any written work. This includes any email, memos or proposals produced in the course of business. In addition to being a good rule of thumb, it is in your best interest legally to remain professional in every document you produce as these documents may be used as evidence in court against either the author or the business from which they originated.

===Complex Audience===

Writing for a complex audience is different from academic writing. In academia, there is a specific audience for most pieces of writing, generally an instructor, teaching assistant, or a fairly small group of peers. In a professional setting, you will often write for a complex audience of people with different backgrounds, specialties, and expectations. With that in mind, avoid using terminology that is too technical so you don't unintentionally exclude portions of your audience. This can become increasingly difficult when writing for larger and more complex audiences.

==Tailoring Employment Documents For a Specific Audience==
When it comes to an employment document such as a '''résumé''' or a '''cover letter''' there is no such thing as “one size fits all”. Each document should be individually tailored to catch the attention of the employer to which the document(s) are being submitted. To do this effectively, it helps to research the company and the position. Some different ways that this can be done are:

* ''Looking at the job description'' – The job description usually gives a set of skills that will be required for the position. The skills outline what the employer is looking for, and therefore, what should be added into a resume. (One should never lie about applicable skills, but '''highlight''' and '''prioritize''' these skills among others). 

* ''Looking at the company website'' – Looking at the company’s website can help with understanding the company environment and values that may not be listed in a job description. This can be most beneficial when writing a cover letter, in which it is important to acknowledge the potential employer. 

In addition to looking at the job description and company website, it is helpful to evaluate the type of job that you are applying for. If you are applying to a job in a design field, you would want to tailor your résumé to be more creative and avoid using any sort of generic template. 

Depending on your level of experience, it can be beneficial to create a list of skills and job experience in a Word document. As mentioned above, different jobs typically look for a specific set of skills. To make it easier to tailor a business document to a potential employer, it can be easy to have a Word document of skills and job experiences listed. After you determine the specific job you're applying for, copy and paste the appropriate skills into the document.

It is important to remember that in employment documents you are '''selling yourself'''. Each job will be slightly different, so it is crucial to tailor your résumé to the employer. Additionally, make sure it is not cluttered with information that the employer may find unnecessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">CRITIQUE OF CONCURRENT ENGINEERING WIKIBOOK
MARCH 5, 2009
PETER BURKE
[[User:Burkep|Burkep]] ([[User talk:Burkep|talk]])


CRITERIA FOR JUDGING PERFORMANCE
The wikibook must contain useful content (relevant to beginning engineers on the job) and it must be easy to use. 

OVERALL COMMENTS

I think this wiki has potential and hope that many people contribute to it in the future.

It can be greatly strengthened by using more internal links.

I definitely like having personal reports and interviews as well as academic content, so we see both textbook language and personal language. They can cross-reference one another. For example, “risk assessment” in Scott Kramer’s personal experience section with could be linked to “risk management” in the Design Process section. 

I like having several different takes on the same subject (as in the introduction and the team building sections.) 

Many of the entries consists of lists – a mixed blessing. 

CRITICAL QUESTIONS

How well does the wiki meet the product concept and product data sheet defined in the Introduction? In other words, did we meet our goals?

What about copyright issues?

Did you communicate this wiki to your classmates?

Will you use this wiki in the future?

SECTION-BY-SECTION COMMENTS
 
*Introduction
	
Needs an overview of the class project – why it was chosen, what its phases were .

I have in mind a few more diagrams of the concurrent engineering process	I find it tough to read this much text on the computer screen.  The content seems quite relevant for defining concurrent engineering in different contexts, but they need navigation guidance – maybe headers and a paragraph introducing the concepts. 

Do users need a brief guide to navigation and editing on page 1?

*Team Building
	
Some redundancy in individual sections

I like the sections based on personal experience

In the section on Aeronautical Engineering, give credit to Susan Carlson Skalak straight off and explain that the notes in the wiki are based on her course and are accessible in pdf format through the reference section.	Would be improved with an introduction and summary section

*Communication Systems	

The Modes of Communication (verbal, written, body language) are entirely human, but much of it sits on an infrastructure of technology which can either hinder or help human-to-human communication.  A new section on infrastructure should be added.

The subsection on Practical Application is important and might be promoted to  serve as an introduction to the entire section (with a little modification)

The following  subsections are too brief to be useful, or they don’t point anywhere.

Group Dynamics; Pooled Resources; Tools; Open Source; Small Business; Enterprise: Other

Would be improved with an introduction and summary section

*Design Process
	
Figures from the Toyota example  might be useful in the very first section of this wikibook “Introduction” to augment the figures already there  (except there are no figures)

I like the warning that delays come from changes  in product definition, so-called “feature creep.” A concept worth emphasizing.

What is the Bug ID project?

Is SysML really useful? Who uses it?

What is a trade study?

The Bayesian section does not seem to make its advantages clear or to distinguish it from normal project management.

What is Intelligent Negotiation Mechanism? ASTV?

The subsection on Collaborative Engineering (Fagan) should probably be renamed “Use ConSERV instead of Gantt”

I bog down in the section on Risk and Uncertainty

Include links to Toyota

Toyota text includes references to “the above figure” but no figures

Same in the section on ConSERV
Also File:DFP flow.jpg in Design for Performance


*Additional Resources
	
I would like to see about 20 book reviews in this section, also 20 websites, with critiques as to why they are useful
	
Needs formatting in a consistent way with sections &amp; subsections

*Contributors

Everyone in class – please sign in
	
*Leftovers	
	
*Interviews	

All of the class interviews can be added here, PROVIDED we get an OK from the people we interviewed	

An introduction will be needed when this section has enough content to summarize

*Personal Experiences	

I think personal experience reports and interviews are well worth presenting. The language is immediate and personal, rather than abstract and general, as is so much textbook language
	
This section could be combined with Interviews

==Human Rights==

 [[File:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|thumb|Martin Luther King, a famous supporter of human rights.]][[W:Human rights|Human rights]] are the &quot;basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled&quot;. Human rights are distinguished from general American rights or human privileges in that they are &quot;guaranteed by international standards, legally protected, focus on the dignity of the human being, oblige states and state actors, cannot be waived or taken away, [and are] interdependent, interrelated, and universal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; World Health Organization http://www.who.int/topics/human_rights/en/ &lt;/ref&gt;



Countries vary widely in their approach to human rights and history is littered with cases of ignorance of these rights to downright atrocities that don't give human rights the smallest consideration. Though the world has seen great triumphs in human rights such as the American Civil Rights Movement, it has also seen great horrors such as the Holocaust and genocide in Rwanda.  By showing the atrocities of what people are capable of and the good faith people are capable of society can have a more well rounded view of our world and strive to make it a better place.  &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights#Regional_human_rights&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil and Political Rights===
[[Image:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png|thumb|left|200px|Eleanor Roosevelt holding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]
[[Image:ICCPR-members.PNG|thumb|right|400px|Parties and signatories to the ICCPR]] 

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a document representing the foundation of established human rights laws. This document is a set of principles adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948. This document was written in response to WWII and the holocaust as an assurance that nothing that inhumane would ever happen again. This document sparked a commitment by many countries to abide by certain humane regulations regarding political, social, economic, and cultural rights of humans. 

The '''[[W:International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]''' is a [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] treaty based on the [[w:Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], created in 1966 and entered into force on 23 March 1976.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is monitored by the [[w:Human Rights Committee|Human Rights Committee]] (a separate body to the [[w:Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] which replaced the Commission on Human Rights under the UN Charter in 2006) with permanent standing, to consider periodic reports submitted by member States on their compliance with the treaty. Members of the Human Rights Committee are elected by member states, but do not represent any State. The Covenant contains two Optional Protocols. The [[W:First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|first optional protocol]] creates an individual complaints mechanism whereby individuals in member States can submit complaints, known as communications, to be reviewed by the Human Rights Committee.
Its rulings under the first optional protocol have created the most complex jurisprudence in the UN international human rights law system.

The [[w:Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|second optional protocol]] abolishes the death penalty; however, countries were permitted to make a reservation allowing for use of death penalty for the most serious crimes of a military nature, committed during wartime&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_opt2.htm Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty], Article 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Economic, Social and Cultural Rights===
[[Image:ICESCR-members.png|thumb|right|400px|States parties and signatories to the ICESCR]]
{{legend|#008000|states parties}}
{{legend|#00ff00|non-state parties signatories}}
{{legend|#b9b9b9|non-state parties non-signatories}}]]

The '''[[w:International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]''' (ICESCR) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 16, 1966, and in force from January 3, 1976. It commits its parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) to individuals, including labour rights and rights to health, education, and an adequate standard of living. As of December, 2008, the Covenant had 159 parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;id=321&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=UN Treaty Collection: International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |accessdate=2009-02-25 |publisher= UN |date= 2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further seven countries had signed, but not yet ratified the Covenant.

One example of this organizations efforts includes the UN's many attempt to create peace in Northern Uganda.  As discussed in Sverker Finnstrom's article in American Ethnologist, The Acholi peoples of Uganda despite having been largely displaced into refuge camps have continued to make steps toward a more stable economy. Their humans rights have been at stake for over two decades.  The UN's various programs are working to put the rebel forces out and regain this cultures natural human rights.&lt;ref&gt; Sverker Finnstrom {url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext?ID=121359002&amp;PLACEBO=IE.pdf&amp;mode=pdf}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICESCR is part of the International Bill of Human Rights, along with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), including the latter's first and second Optional Protocols. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproductive Rights===

Reproductive rights are more than the women's right to her birthing process but also the right of the women to have the child. Although abortion is a large issue around the world the question remains on whether a women should have the right to abortion if she so chooses. As reproductive rights are more clearly defined later on in this section it is important that we keep in mind the issue of abortion and what this could mean for women's reproductive rights. Does it fall into the rights of the women or not?

According to Craven a woman's right to choose a  midwife is center to reproductive rights. &lt;ref&gt; CHRISTA CRAVEN 2007 A &quot;Consumer's Right&quot; to Choose a Midwife: Shifting Meanings for Reproductive Rights under Neoliberalism: American Anthropologist Volume 109. Issue 4. December 2007 (Pages 701 - 712)| http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext?ID=120126886&amp;PLACEBO=IE.pdf&amp;mode=pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights are rights relating to reproduction and reproductive health.[1] The World Health Organisation defines reproductive rights as follows:

&quot;Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.&quot;[2]

Reproductive rights were first established as a subset of human rights at the United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.[3] The sixteenth article of the resulting Proclamation of Teheran states, &quot;Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children.&quot;[4][3]

Worldwide, issues related to reproductive rights are some of the most vigorously contested, regardless of the population's socioeconomic level, religion or culture.[5] Reproductive rights may include some or all of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to control one's reproductive functions, the right to access quality reproductive healthcare, and the right to education and access in order to make reproductive choices free from coercion, discrimination, and violence.[6] Reproductive rights may also be understood to include education about contraception and sexually transmitted infections, and freedom from coerced sterilization and contraception, protection from gender-based practices such as female genital cutting (FGC) and male genital mutilation (MGM).
&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rights versus Culture, Rights to Culture====
Rights to Culture ensure that an individual or group of individuals have all their rights to enjoy and participate in their culture. This includes such aspects as the right to take part in cultural life, the right that will guarantee that a culture will be conserved, yet still developed, and finally, the right to still be protected from any harmful cultural practices.

In discussing rights and culture there are two assumptions that people often make: 

•One is that cultures are unchanging.

•Another is that in a given society there is only one acceptable culture that everyone must abide by.

However, these assumptions may cause problems within a group of people in a few ways. When new rights are accepted in a culture that is normally unchanging, that new right may create conflict within the culture because of the varying viewpoints within the group. For example the issue of unveiling Muslim women so that they would no longer be oppressed. While Westerners are using the etic point of view without understanding fully what the veil means to the Muslim women.
This is when rights and culture may not agree. Culture and human rights don't tend to agree fully, new human rights given may go against rights given within a culture.

In Farnaz Fassihi's book &quot;Waiting for an Ordinary Day&quot; explains the life of individuals in Iraq. Once Saddam was captured and the citizens were run by Americans, all hell broke loose.  Not only did the citizens not know how to respond to the new freedoms they had, they soon came to rebel against the men who had given them that freedom. Their human rights of freedom were not of the norm in their culture and were unknown how to cope with. (2b) [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Saddam_Hussein_captured_%26_shaven_DD-SD-05-01885.jpg]]

====Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act====

[[Wikipedia: Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)]] touches on this topic. On 16 November 1990, a United States federal law passed that requires federal agencies and institutions to return Native American human remains and cultural items to their respective peoples. Some of these cultural artifacts include funeral objects, religious objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. These federal agencies and institutions receive funding in order to do this. In this way, people are entitled to their culture both during life and after death. However, when it is unclear as to who the remain belong to, NAGPRA made a outline of decent for who should gain ownership of the remains. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NAGPRA and Ownership&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt;	Ownership resides with any lineal descendants
&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt;	If no lineal descendants, ownership resides with (in order) :
&lt;b&gt;A.&lt;/b&gt; The tribe on whose land the remains or objects were found or
&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;. The tribe who has closest cultural affiliation with the remains and who stakes a claim or if undetermined
&lt;b&gt;C.&lt;/b&gt; The tribe who is recognized as aboriginally occupying land that was determined to be traditionally theirs by the Indian Claims Commission, unless
&lt;b&gt;D. &lt;/b&gt; Preponderance of the evidence shows that another tribe has a stronger cultural affiliation that the tribe id’d by the ICC

====Rights as Culture====

As a culture, certain rights are issued to provide a general guideline as to how people within that culture act, respond, and live. As it is common for many different cultures to share similar rights, it is equally familiar to have diverse rights among these same cultures. With differing views on how things work and what is acceptable, each culture has its own idea of what rights are issued to whom. It is not one cultures place to say that the rights issued within another culture are unacceptable, with the exception of universal rights (a term in itself that is often undefined among anthropologists). Each culture has a right to their way of living. Even though some cultures practices may seem cruel, like the circumcision of young girls in Africa, these cultures have been practicing their traditions for hundreds of years and do not see them as unreasonable or cruel. They can choose freely how to live and govern themselves as long as individual rights, specific to that culture, are still upheld. As a culture, you have a right to define your way of living. It is only when the line of human rights is crossed that the right as a culture can be questioned.

Rights as culture vary from people to people. As an individual participating in a culture, you are granted certain rights. Slavery, from an anthropological perspective is a violation of human rights. The idea of “right as culture” supports slavery as a violation of human rights. It is because of the rights of the enslaved that this can be said. The enslaved has rights pertinent to his/her culture that the person facilitating the slavery is overlooking. The violation of these rights cross the boundary of inhumane. It is therefore impossible to justify the idea of slavery when looking at it from a cultural perspective.

==Human Rights and Cultural Relevance==
                                                              
It is the job of cultural anthropologists to study the world around them to better understand the differences of all the various cultures. Even with human rights clearly defined in a universal list of 30 articles; there still can be unclear cultural practices that question these articles by law and by morality of some. 

Today many organizations have been formed to protect and fight for the rights of all man-kind.  

Amnesty International: The oldest, biggest human rights group focused on individual, local human rights activism. Because AI stays strictly out of politics and avoids getting involved in issues outside its rather narrow mandate (area of concern), people from all sorts of political and religious backgrounds are members and work together. 

Electronic Frontier Foundation: Founded to promote and extend the concept of civil liberties to on-line communications. While the EFF is a U.S.-based group whose main focus is on U.S. law, it has a number of &quot;sister organizations&quot; in other countries.

Human Rights Watch: Founded in 1978 as Helsinki Watch, is a coalition formed by a number of independent regional human groups. They are perhaps the best human rights researchers in the field at present -- their reports are extremely thorough, carefully written, and backed by impressive amounts of detail and numerous sources. 

Peacenet: Not a human rights group itself, but rather the first and largest computer network for activists in peace, human rights, and related issues. Peacenet is run by the Institute for Global Communications (IGC), an activity of the Tides Foundation, a San Francisco-based non-profit trust. It is a member of the Association for Progressive Communications, an international coalition of networks for peace and human rights activists. This is a good group for the hard core, on-line activists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrweb.org/orgs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Women’s Rights in America
[[Image:Age-of-Brass Triumph-of-Womans-Rights 1869.jpg|thumb|This satirical 1869 cartoon is an example of the propaganda used in the Womens' Rights Movement.]]Many rights that may seem inherent to our generations have not necessarily been that way forever.  One great example is the woman’s suffrage movement. The end of the Civil War, when African Americans were given the right to vote, marked a date when women found themselves the last social group in America to be able to vote.  Organized women’s movements originally stood for many causes.  But around the year 1914, it seemed, most women activists were fighting for the right to vote.  In New York City, women's movements “revived flagging local organizations, introduced new lobbying techniques, standardized membership lists, and established a state headquarters”. &lt;ref&gt; Lois W. Banner, Women in Modern America: A Brief History &lt;/ref&gt;  People were rallying and protesting for the right to vote.  All the hard work by women and fellow radicals eventually paid off.  On August 18, 1920 women were given the right to vote with the addition of the 19th amendment to the Constitution.


'''Labor, Land, and Women’s Rights in Africa: Challenges on the Rights of Women'''

Recent developments illustrate an increasing awareness of the status of women’s rights in Africa and social well-being of women is contingent on rights to equality, health, education, and political participation in economic, electoral, and customary institutions. The Protocol could serve as a blueprint for African governments, engaged in revising their national constitutions and in passing new equality legislation, to incorporate a more fulsome recognition of women’s rights in these documents. Legal instruments of the African system largely ignored women’s rights until recent years. The 1963 Charter of the Organization of African Unity (“OAU”) made no mention of women. African nations designed the region’s primary human rights document—the African Charter—in 1981 to protect state sovereignty. The African Charter references women only twice: Article 2 includes sex in a broad non-discrimination clause and Article 18(3) requires states to eliminate every discrimination against women. The definition of employment at the most general level an activity for which one receives payment needs some elaboration in the African context. Employment for women in Africa is characterized by subsistence and small-scale farming, and their participation in informal trade is connected to agriculture, as opposed to what might be normally understood as paid labor. This “unpaid” work is typically tied to women’s duties as mothers and wives, and to their community and familial relationships. African women’s agricultural labor, including subsistence and small-scale farming, will be referred to as “informal” labor and is distinguished from formal or salaried/contractual work. It is in this “informal” labor context that African human rights instruments, of the kind that the Protocol aims to be, could usefully qualify and add to the existing international obligations of African states by framing labor rights not only in terms of salaried employment, but also as work in and for the home. Yet the Protocol adheres to a definition of labor that overly differentiates between employment and agricultural work. The rights related to employment focus on equal pay and on freedom from harassment—rights important in the context of a salaried position but of little consequence for women deriving income from land or trade. In this regard, the Protocol is limited in its ability to address the obstacles that women face in developing and owning land and the impact of these obstacles on women’s ability to sustain a liveable wage. Before analyzing the provisions regarding labor and employment in the Protocol more carefully, it is useful to explore the context in which many African women perform their labor.
Although specific employment patterns diverge across Africa, regional patterns seem to exist: 80% of African women do agricultural work, which is the mainstay of most East African economies, and few women perform salaried professional and clerical work. Sub-Saharan African countries, like Kenya, reflect similar employment patterns: women are largely excluded from formal, paid employment and they constitute almost half of the agricultural workforce and 70% to 80% of all subsistence farmers. The chief reasons cited for women’s exclusion from the formal sector are lack of education, poor mobility, restrictions on reproductive choice, and workplace discrimination.

===Genital Cutting: two sides===

There are approximately 85-114 million women with mutilated genitalia, and millions more face the practice each year. Mostly practiced in Africa, FGM (female genital mutilation) has many different levels of severity, with three main varieties of the procedure.  The first is Sunna (meaning “tradition&quot; in Arabic) Circumcision which involves the removal of the prepuce, or retractable fold of skin, or hood, and/or the tip of the clitoris.  The second type is a clitoridectomy, which consists of the removal of the entire clitoris (prepuce and glands) and the removal of the adjacent labia.  Lastly is infibulation, or pharonic circumcision.  Infibulation involves a clitoridectomy followed by the remaining tissue being stitched closed, leaving a small hole to allow for urine and menstrual blood to flow through.  Most cases of female genital cutting occurs between the ages of four and eight and the use of anesthesia is rare. FGM is practiced in order for the women of their culture to be accepted; it is the beginning of being a women. Although there are different religions that practice FGM not one of these groups require it. The reactions to FGM involve national action and law. 

Female genital mutilation is a prime example of cultural relativism. Cultural relativism is a principle stating that a given practice can be truly understood only from the context of the culture in which it is practiced. From a western prospective, female genital mutilation is viewed as inhumane and a violation of human rights. However, from the prospective of a member of a village in Africa that does practice female genital cutting (such as Senegal), this may be a social normalcy comparable to male circumcision in the United States.   

FGM is a controversial issue that does not have a clear and concise answer. An international campaign to eliminate female genital cutting has been active since the early 90's, actively attempting to divorce itself from a health framework, adopting instead a human rights framework to justify the intervention.&lt;ref&gt; Bettina Shell-Duncan http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=0002-7294&amp;volume=110&amp;issue=2&amp;supplement=0&amp;article=231977&amp;jstor=False&lt;/ref&gt; In western culture genital cutting is not part of the culture and therefore not accepted. But with the numbers of mutilated women in the millions there is a strong conviction for many cultures to maintain the act. Different cultural factors affect the beliefs all over the world about whether the act of genital cutting is an appropriate action. There are many negative factors regarding genital cutting; effects include extreme pain, susceptibility to infection, sometimes death, HIV susceptibility, abscesses and small benign tumours, haemorrhages, shock, and clitoral cysts, and decreased, if not elimination, of sexual pleasure.  Long term effects may include kidney stones, sterility, sexual dysfunction, depression, various urinary tract infections, various gynecological and problems with child birth. For us in the Western part of the world it seems ridiculous to go under such a risky procedure just to be accepted. The upside of the cultural cutting is that the girls can now be respected adults among the community and start a family,and the fact that this custom has been practiced throughout their culture for many generations. In Sudan, for example, a family's honor derives from a woman's sexual conduct and by practicing genital cutting families can curb their sexual desires.   These unbalanced side effects cause uproar among human rights activist

====Female Genital Cutting in Britain====
One of the more interesting examples of female genital cutting is placed in Britain. Most FGC (female genital cutting) occurs in Africa and is under hot debate with human rights activists because of all of the negative affects associated with FGC. Britain is a westernized type culture and so genital cutting is strictly forbidden. It was officially outlawed in 1985 and considered child abuse nationally. Still, even with government stepping in to stop this cultural sin an underground culture grew to where parents were leaving the country in order to see their children to adult hood. Even in cases where widespread education campaigns reach the people and inform of the technological advances and horrific consequences of genital mutilation it still happens. I believe that in a world with so many different views that it would be strange if everyone thought the same way. This practice of FGC may not be pretty and may have terrible outcomes but it is part of some cultures and to them nothing matters more than preserving their beliefs and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Entitlements===
Entitlements are the socially defined rights to life sustaining resources, meaning access to things that are seen as basic human rights. In cultures like the United States, government entitlement programs are expected to maintain equality in employment opportunities, access to healthcare, and correct any other biases in the political system. Many American entitlements are depicted in the “United States Bill of Rights.” However, in many developing countries where entitlements are not as explicitly defined and enforced, it is a struggle for citizens to hold entitlements. 

====Entitlements in the United States====

One view concerning entitlements in the United States is that the country is cover-obligated when it comes to [[W:entitlement|entitlements]] that may bankrupt the nation. The U.S. is currently obligated to pay over $50 trillion. Without reform, the US could follow suit of Argentina who defaulted on their debt, which had an overwhelming effect on their economy and standard of living. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Curbing Spending by Reframing the Politics of Entitlements

  | url=http://walker-foundation.org/net/org/project.aspx?projectid=50006&amp;p=50005&amp;s=0.0.69.5316
  | accessdate=?-?-2009}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Health care can be used as an example, because it is considered an unalienable right in the U.S. Currently American tax payers and the government is footing the bill for medical coverage for those who cannot afford it because they are &quot;entitled&quot; to it. Lower classed citizens have developed a dependence on the government to take care of them and focus tax dollars on their entitlements like Medicaid welfare. This entitlement mentality has pushed the US deeper into debt, because of the social transition from independence to reliance.

Not only is this idea of entitlement hurting the U.S on a national level, it is also damaging the citizens at a more personal level and many people do not recognize this. People do not really contribute to their workplace. They simply show up and have 'face time' and expect that simply because they are there they are entitled to get their raise or promotion. As Phillipe Bourgois’ article “Workaday World, Crack Economy”, describes, although this sense of entitlement is felt many people from areas such as East Harlem, simply quit working legally all together.  &lt;ref&gt; Bourgois, Philippe 1995 “Workaday World, Crack Economy.” The Nation  (December 4) pp. 706-11. http://www.philippebourgois.net/Nation%2095.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; This mind set causes the work ethic and motivation of employees to drop, which decreases their productivity. This epidemic that has begun to sweep the nation is a grass roots reason for the economic position the country is in.&lt;ref&gt; Danger in the Comfort Zone. American Management Association| {url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rrJ_Ohzzm7oC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=american+entitlement&amp;ots=BiRwwTaC2u&amp;sig=WkUpqzltNJ0gn5X1xhzMmfrKpSw#PPA212,M1}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of individualism and independence characteristic of Americans who advocate the idea that the U.S. spends too much on entitlements is not characteristic of all of Americans, and indeed is not characteristic of many other societies throughout the rest of the world who believe that all their citizens have a right to healthcare, food water, etc.  Many believe that the U.S. does not provide enough entitlements for its citizens, especially when compared to the majority of the other developed countries in the world.  In fact, the Human Development Index--which ranks countries according to factors such as health, knowledge and education, and standard of living--ranks the U.S. at #15, whereas many countries who provide their citizens with much more entitlements are ranked much higher.  &lt;ref&gt; http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many people make the argument that U.S. debt is a result of immense military spending, not entitlement payments.  For example, Wallsten and Kosec &lt;ref&gt; http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/01/17/business/20070117_LEONHARDT_GRAPHIC.html &lt;/ref&gt; estimate that the U.S. is spending approximately $200 billion per year on military expenditures.  Contrastingly, the estimated annual cost of several entitlement programs are much smaller; for example, universal health care would cost only half the current U.S. military expenditures.

===Cultural Imperialism===

[[W:Cultural_imperialism|Cultural Imperialism]] was first conceptualized during the Cold War. There are two ideas cultural imperialism is based on. The first is that some cultures will dominate other cultures; while the second is cultural domination by one culture will eventually destruct the lesser culture(s) and the dominating one will take its place. A common  wrong example of cultural imperialism is the Western culture imperialism across the world, which is erasing local traditions and replacing them with cell phones, McDonald's, and radios. However, anthropologists dismissed this because of three things: cultural imperialism assumes the citizens do not have the means of resisting anything of Western origin; non-Western music, food, and material have been able to integrate into Western Europe and the United States, and ignores the fact that cultural forms and practices sometimes move around the world, without ever reaching the West.

===Cultural Hybridity===

Anthropologists were not satisfied with the discourse of cultural imperialism, so they began to search for alternative ways of understanding global cultural flows. That is when the phrase borrowing-with-modification came to be. Borrowing cultural forms or practices from elsewhere always involves borrowing-with-modification. This phrase refers to the idea that people never adopt blindly, but always adopt what they borrow for local purposes. In other words people rarely accepted ideas, practices or objects from elsewhere without finding a way of adapting them to local practices in order to serve local purposes. This form of cultural change is very different from having something from elsewhere forced upon you, like cultural imperialism suggests.  &lt;ref&gt; Schultz, Emily and Lavenda, Robert, &quot;Cultural Anthropology, A Perspective on the Human Condition&quot; pg.422 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">1.	Labor Migrants
Labor Migrants are workers who move from region to region in order to find work. They are usually unskilled laborers and will mostly work seasonal jobs. The United Nations defines a migrant worker as anyone working outside of their country of origin. The definition of migrant workers is different for all parts of the world but is usually considered someone who moves looking for seasonal work. (Requirement 2a anthropological key term or concept) 
	
In Walla Walla Washington there are many migrant workers. There has always been a large number of them because of the vast agricultural base in Walla Walla. As years have gone by the number of migrant workers has increased greatly because of the up and coming wine industry. The workers there are now settled and not migrating seasonally because there is so much work. All of these workers are field workers. They harvest grapes, asparagus, and apples which falls into the unskilled workers category. (Requirement 2b ethnographic example)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Particle kinematics is the study of motion of particles without any reference to the causes of their motion. Though the idea behind this book seems very intuitively clear, the term motion (and rest)must be precisely defined qualitatively and quantitatively without any ambiguity. This and other common topics of Kinematics will constitutes this book.

The work assumes a good grasp of Mathematics. A small primer for the same might be written at a later date. Readers with limited mathematical background will not find this book enjoyable. 

The abundance of useless jargon in modern Physics texts is the prime reason for writing this text. Modern writers of Physics seem to have got an idea that filling the lessons with quotations of great people, interesting anecdotes, unnecessarily fancy drawings, etc sell a book. Perhaps they are not wrong. If the reader is in search of such a book, then this isn't it. It is quite plainly, very distracting, to have so many side issues in a text. 

In this book, historical references, anecdotes and other trivia, will be reserved for the appendix. The thrust of the development period will be on developing clean and crisp chapters which bring out cleanly the ideas that are central to Particle kinematics. 

A set of problems is also intended to be developed.

== Position ==

Central to the study of Particle kinematics, is the idea of ''position''. The position of a particle can be said to have three distinct specifications:

#The point from which the position of the particle is specified, called the ''Reference Point''.
#The distance of the particle from the reference point.
#Some quantifier of the direction in which the particle lies with respect to the reference point.

It can easily be seen that if any one of these three specifications aren't mentioned, the description of position is incomplete. 

The position of a particle can be specified via various artifacts that have all these three specifications. The most common of these are vectors and complex numbers.

=== Position Vector ===
The position vector of a particle is the vector drawn from the reference point to the particle. If the reference point is &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and the particle's position is at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\vec{OP}=\vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of the particle &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Motion and Rest==
If the position vector of a particle (with respect to some arbitrary reference point) changes with time in a given time interval, then the particle is said to be in motion in that time interval with respect to the reference point. However, if the position vector is invariant within the time interval considered, the the particle is said to be at rest with respect to the reference point.

Rest and motion are attributes of a particle that are solely dependent on the reference point. A particle can be in rest relative to one reference point and in motion relative to another. Thus, rest and motion are combined properties of the particle and the reference point.

Further, it can be said that if a particle is in motion with respect to a certain reference point, then the particle's position vector is a non constant function of time. Motion of a particle causes the position vector to change in both magnitude and direction in the general case.

== Path ==
The locus of end points of the particle's position vector is said to be the ''path'' of the particle.
== Distance ==
The length of the path curve traced by a particle during a time interval is the distance traveled by the particle.

For a particle in motion the distance traveled is always an increasing function of time. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;s(t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be the distance traveled by a particle from a fixed point on the path, then, &lt;math&gt;\dot{s}(t)&gt;0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The dot over &lt;math&gt;s(t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; denotes differentiation with respect to time.

== Displacement ==
The displacement of a particle between two positions occupied by the particle at different time instants is the change in position in that particular time interval. If  &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}_{1}=\vec{r}\left(t_{1}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}_{2}=\vec{r}\left(t_{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then the displacement in the time interval &lt;math&gt;[t_{1},t_{2}]&lt;/math&gt; is

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following has been corrected, as it is debunked by a simple example.
* Changing the prototype of an object doesn't automatically update the instances of the object, and as such, you will have to add the gender field manually to the already created instances.

The debunking example
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function Animal (type) {
    this.type = type;
     this.name = &quot;No name&quot;;
}
var dog = new Animal('dog');
Animal.prototype.gender = 'unspecified';
alert(dog.gender); 

var cat = new Animal('cat');
alert(cat.gender);
&lt;/source&gt;
[[User:Pmw57|Pmw57]] ([[User talk:Pmw57|talk]]) 07:11, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

The above &quot;debunking&quot; example is deceptive. The statement &lt;code&gt;Animal.prototype.gender = 'unspecified'; &lt;/code&gt; doesn't make a difference, you'll get an unspecified alert message with or without it. Changing 'unspecified' to something else will show you that the original example is in fact correct.
[[User:Seipher|Seipher]] ([[User talk:Seipher|talk]]) 20:36, 8 October 2010 (UTC)

Ambiguity of &quot;changing the prototype&quot;:-&lt;br /&gt;
If the whole object is replaced then this will not be seen by the objects already created. It will be seen by newly created objects.&lt;br /&gt;
Because Animal.prototype = anewprototype;&lt;br /&gt;
will replace the prototype, objects that already exist will keep the reference to the old prototype. Newly created objects will get the new prototype.&lt;br /&gt;
Whereas Animal.prototype.gender = anewvalue;&lt;br /&gt;
does not replace the prototype, it modifies the object that is the referenced by all the objects already created. Newly created objects will get the same prototype.&lt;br /&gt;

Practical transformer design requires knowledge of electrical principles, materials, and economics.  Small transformers, under 10 kVA, may be designed using handbook data and pencil-and-paper calculations, but larger or mass-produced units are often designed with extensive computer aided modeling (CAM). and finite element analysis (FEA). However, CAM and FEA are still based on Maxwell's equations, Ampere’s law, Faraday’s law, and Gauss’s law, which together with Lenz’s law, are the basis of magnetic circuit analysis.

==Power transformer design==

The designer first needs several known factors to design a transformer. For a transformer using a sine or square wave, one needs to know the incoming line voltage, the operating frequency, the secondary voltage(s), the secondary current(s), the permissible temperature rise, the target efficiency, the physical size one can use, and the cost limitations. Once these factors are known, design can begin.

=== Initial calculations ===

The designer first starts with the primary voltage and frequency. Since they are a known factor, they are the first numbers to be plugged into the equations. One then will find the power in watts (or volt-amperes) of each secondary winding by multiplying the voltage by the current of each coil. These are added together to get the total power the transformer must provide to the load(s).

[[Image:BH_Loop1a.jpg|thumb|right|Hysteresis loop similar to Permalloy]]
[[File:BH Curve and Loop.jpg|thumb|A normal BH Curve within a Loop]]
The transformer losses in watts are estimated and added to this sum to give a total power the primary coil must supply. The losses are from wire resistance (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; R loss), loss in the core from magnetic hysteresis and from eddy currents. These losses are dissipated as heat. Here, the permissible temperature rise must be kept in mind. Each type of core material will have a loss chart whereby one can find the loss in watts per pound by looking up the operating flux density and frequency. Next, one selects the type of iron by what efficiency is stated, and the value of losses to the user. Once the iron is selected, the flux density is selected for that material.

=== Type of iron (electrical steel) ===

The relative permeability (ur) of a magnetic material is essentially how easy it will become magnetized. In this case, one looks for a core material with high permeability and a high flux density. Of course, the better each become, the material goes up in price due to the manufacturing cost of the material, and the different chemistries they have. Some basic values  for electrical steel are: SiFe unoriented 400, SiFe oriented 1500, 50-50 NiFe oriented 2000, and 79 Permaloy 12,000 to 100,000. In other words, a grain-oriented silicon steel conducts magnetic flux 1500 times better than a vacuum. Ref:&lt;ref&gt;Winders Jr.,John J. (2002). ''Power Transformers, Principles and Applications.'' ISBN 0-8247-0766-4&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:B-H Curve.jpg|thumb|right|B-H Curve for M-19 CRNO Steel.]]
[[File:Mag Perm.jpg|thumb|left|Perm. Vs. Mag. Curve.]]
Each type of iron (steel) has a maximum flux density it can be run at without saturating. The designer refers to B-H curves for each type of steel. They select a flux density where the knee either starts on the curve, or slightly up on it. The start of the knee is where saturation starts and permeability is at its highest. As saturation starts, the permeability curve starts dropping off rapidly to zero, and the primaries inductance falls rapidly. By selecting this point on the knee, it will give a transformer with the lowest weight possible for that material. The curve shows that as saturation begins, the magnetic field strength in Oersted's (H) raises rapidly as compared to any increase in flux density (B), and so will the ampere turns.  When using the equations, the two most important are the number of turns (N), and the core area (a). One needs to find the core area in square centimeters or inches, and match it to the total power in watts or volt-amperes. The larger the core, the more power it will handle. Once this core size is calculated, one then finds the number of turns for the primary. One then is looking at a transformer whose primary voltage will cause a flux density of a specified amount due to the number of turns in a certain type/size of core. 

For sine wave operation, the designer then uses either the two short formulas, or they begin using the long formulas which are more exact, and whereby all the factors can be changed. For square wave operation, refer to the notes at the end of the equations section. Either way, it's time to use a transformer design sheet. The design sheet has places to write the details such as the flux density, the number of turns, calculate the turns per layer, and thickness of the coil.

=== Secondary turns calculation ===

Once the number of turns of the primary are calculated, the secondary windings numbers can be calculated with the same turns per volt figure. If the primary has 120 turns for 120 volts input, we would have 1 turn per volt. If we needed a 12 volt secondary, then we would require 12 turns on it. This is for a perfect transformer without losses though. 

In reality, there are losses that have to be added, as the 12 turn coil will not produce 12 volts under load, but a lower voltage. A rule of thumb is to allow for 5% in losses. (Transformers below 300w often have higher regulation losses). In this case, we would multiply the 12 turns by 1.05 to get a new number of turns equaling 12.6 turns. Since fractional turns are not possible for line frequency transformers, 13 turns would be used. It is best to have a slightly higher voltage than one too low. Beware, smaller transformers which have a higher turns per volt, have higher losses, and the efficiency drops as the size goes down. 

The turns per volt figure typically varies from 1 to about 4, with around 4 turns per volt common for small appliance transformers, and around 1 turn per volt used for intermittent duty fan cooled microwave oven transformers. Volts per turn is commonly used for larger transformers, distribution transformers are often limited by excessive insulation required between each turn, thus they are ran at high flux densities and oil cooled.

Here is where cut-and-try still comes into transformer design. Since the primary coil has to be wound with a wire that is large enough to handle the total power the transformer will handle at a certain flux density, and the secondary or secondaries have to be wound with heavy enough wire for their loads, the finished coil must still fit within the core's windows once the overall size is calculated after adding the bobbin and paper thickness of each layer. Most of the time, the design has to be modified or adjusted several times over this, because the coil is too big for the windows. If the coil does not fit, there are a few options. A larger core with larger window openings having the same core area can be used, or the flux density can be raised by reducing the turns on the primary. Once these turns are reduced, the turns in the secondary will be reduced. This since the number of volts per turn in the primary equal the number of volts per turn in the secondary minus losses. However, this is at the expense of raising the flux density, the magnetizing current, the temperature, and lowering the efficiency. It's much better to select a larger core which has larger windows to accept the coil. The depth or thickness of the new core can be adjusted to equal the old core area in square centimeters or square inches. This measurement is the cores tongue width multiplied by its depth or thickness. As the core size goes up, so does the tongue width, which would add to the core area.

=== Thickness of coil windings ===

[[Image:Trafo-innenleben.jpg|thumb|right|Random Wound Transformer Coils on plastic bobbin.]]

[[File:Transformer Section.jpg|thumb||right|A Through Section Of A Transformer]]
[[Image:Xfmr sect.jpg|thumb|left|Transformer Section For Cooling]]

When calculating the coil thickness, several things need to be considered. The voltage that each winding sees will determine the wires insulation thickness. Once this voltage is known, the diameter of the selected insulated wire can be used. By knowing the wire diameter, the number of turns per layer can be calculated, and the number of layers by using the window height and winding margins. The windows are the openings on either side of the core. The window area is simply found by multiplying the window width by its height. Next, one adjusts the thickness of the insulation paper for the layers of each winding due to the voltage between the coils. This thickness is added to the total coil thickness by multiplying the paper thickness by the number of layers. The paper that separates two different windings is always thicker than the layer paper to match the voltage difference between the windings and must support the wire. Last, the bobbin, (13B on drawing), thickness is added. All is then added to the design sheet and the total calculated. This total thickness is compared to the window dimensions for a fit.  '''The design should not exceed 80-85% of available opening to allow for manufacturing tolerances.''' In certain circumstances, it may be better to reduce the number of windings in the coil, and use another smaller transformer to supply them. This can actually save money in the long run by reducing the possibility of coil failure over heat.

A smaller coil with few layers is always recommended. A coil with a large number of layers will run hotter than one with a few. Each winding has a &quot;hot spot&quot; which is always located mid-way at its center. If the winding has a number of layers, the heat will increase at this hot spot. The hot spot is almost always where the winding will fail due to heat. The heat from each winding has to travel through each layer and is dissipated from the outside of the coil. This means that the winding, (13 on drawing), closer to the core, (12 on drawing), will be hotter than the outer ones. Since this is the case, and most of the time the winding closest to the core is the primary, the largest wire that will fit for the current drawn should be used. The exception to having the primary here is using a winding with very small diameter wire. Since the coil will expand due to heat, a small wire coil on the outside could break because of the expansion. Being at the core, it would expand less and not break the wire. Most small bias windings, rated at a few milliamperes, and used in vacuum tube circuits are wound in this manner. A good rule of thumb is to use 1000 circular mills per ampere for the wire selection, when designing the primary winding.

It should be noted that some small transformers fail, when the wire coming up from the bottom of the coil, breaks near the terminal post. This could be due to expansion of the coil, or from the connection between the wire and terminal not being soldered properly.

Referring to the transformer sectional cooling drawing in this section, the spacer, (14 on drawing), is added to each side of the coil to separate the two windings, thus allowing a cooling vent to cool the coils. This is done in some small power and large distribution transformers. There is also a special insulation paper that has wood slats glued to the surface to hold the windings apart. If the windings are separated completely, it also raises the electrical insulation between the two windings by adding an air gap.

For using a two section bobbin (for a two winding transformer), the above is not necessary. These are used by jumble or random winding the wire on each section of the bobbin. Jumble-winding by definition means that the wire is wound on the bobbin in a random way without layers separated by paper. However, the amount of wire used for each winding has to fit within the bobbin so it too will fit inside the cores windows. Most small transformers are manufactured this way to save cost, as it would be very difficult to neatly stack extremely fine wire.
[[File:Coil frame 2 01.JPG|thumb|Typical Plastic Bobbin]]

=== Insulation ===

The insulation materials used in transformer construction varies, but are mainly the finish applied to the laminations, varnish or coated insulation on the wire, paper (fish paper, crepe paper, etc.), or plastic film for the coil, cardboard or plastic for the bobbin, and the varnish that the completed transformer is dipped into at the end of construction. Though this all works well for electrical insulation, it is also a thermal insulation, and causes the coil to hold in heat. This being the case, the thinnest insulation should be used that will supply the correct electrical insulation for the transformer.

The varnish dip that is applied, is generally done in a vacuum chamber. Most varnish is a clear color, but some is dyed black. The vacuum atmosphere assures that the coil is totally saturated with varnish, as the vacuum removes any bubbles or air pockets that could form without it. After the dip is completed, the transformer is placed into an oven, and is baked until the varnish is dry. The main purpose of the varnish, besides increasing the electrical insulation, is to keep any form of moisture from effecting the coil, and to stop the windings from humming or vibrating when magnetized.

== Wire selection ==

The wire generally used in small transformer coils is magnet wire. Magnet wire is generally a solid copper wire with an insulating jacket such as varnish. Other wires such as litz wire are common use for r.f. transformers. Large power transformers use stranded wire, which may be rectangular in cross-section, with periodic transpositions in the strands to equalize current and reduce loss. Windings for large currents may be made in strip form, or have a square or rectangular cross section. Aluminum is sometimes used in power transformer windings to reduce costs. The connections on smaller transformers are soldered, but larger transformer connections, especially ones handling high current, are brazed or welded.

The wire is selected by its ability to carry the proper amount of current without getting hot enough to melt the insulation or wire itself. It is sized by its cross sectional area measured in circular mils per ampere (CGS measurement system), or more commonly in engineering design circles, amperes per square meter (MKS measurement system). In transformer use, the circular mils per ampere runs anywhere from 500 cir. mils for intermittent operation, to 1500 cir. mils for heavy duty continuous operation. For most applications, 800 to 1000 cir. mils is a good starting point. The real value chosen is iterative, because heat is often not the limiting factor, as the desired regulation often puts the temperature rise well below insulation limits. Most wire charts have the wires cross sectional area in circular mils to make selection easier.

== The core stack ==

[[Image:EI Lam.jpg|thumb|right|EI Lamination Pair.]]
[[File:Laminering av kärna.svg|thumb|right|Eddy Currents Inside Laminations.]]
[[Image:Interleave.jpg|thumb|right|Interleaved Transformer Core Diagram.]]
[[Image:Scrapless Lam.jpg|thumb|right|EI-2 Scrapless Lamination Dimensions.]]

The core stack is the total amount of the steel laminations needed to produce the correct core area for the power in watts, or volt amperes that the transformer is required to handle.

The core can be stacked in two different ways when using steel laminations. The most common is the interleaved fashion where each lamination is staggered opposite to the other (turned 180 degrees opposite the other). This provides for the least amount of air gap in the core, and the highest efficiency. The other way is butt stacked. In this way, all the E type lams are stacked on one side, and all the I type lams are stacked on the other. This way though creates an air gap where the butt joint is created thus increasing the losses. However, when a DC current is superimposed on an AC current as in an audio transformer or filter choke, the air gap can stop the core from saturating. A combination of the two stacking types can be used with good results obtaining the best properties of both.

==== Stacking Factor ====

When using the formulas on this page to calculate the core area, a stacking factor should be included. The stacking factor is given by the lamination manufacturer on the individual specification sheet for each size lamination. It varies by the thickness of the material, type, and whether it is either butt stacked, or interleaved. This factor ranges from around 0.80 to 0.98. The formulas here can be used as is, but one will have a slightly smaller core if the factor is not added.

The stacking factor is needed due to each iron lamination having a thin coating of insulation on each face. This coating thereby insulates each lamination from the other minimizing eddy currents. The stacking factor adjusts the core size due to the extra thickness of this insulative coating so that the proper amount of iron is used in the core. Without this factor placed into the equations, the core would be slightly under-sized in iron content, even though the core stack equaled the calculated measurement. The core in mention, not using the stacking factor, would then have a slightly higher flux density than what was wanted.

==== Scrapless Laminations ====

When EI and other laminations are produced, they are literally punched out of a coiled strip of electrical steel with a punch press. To reduce the amount of scrap as much as possible, the lamination is dimensioned in such a way that if one placed two E laminations with their open ends toward each other, the two sections that make the windows would make the two I's needed when all four pieces are punched out at once. Due to this, the window width, and the leg width is generally 1/2 the width of the tongue. The window height would be equal to 1/2 the width of the whole E lamination. The lamination height would be equal to the window height plus the width of the window or leg. There are exceptions to this rule, as a few shapes have wider or taller windows such as custom laminations. These measurements are handy to know, as once one knows the tongue width, they will know the window width by dividing the tongue width in half. One could simply work out the total dimensions of a lamination in their mind when design time comes.

==== Core Stack Assembly ====

There are several ways that the core stack is held together after assembly. One way, is using mechanical fasteners, but this can promote a problem, if the fastener is made of a magnetic material, and the screw hole in the lamination is too far into the flux path of the lamination. If the magnetic flux cuts through a magnetic fastener, it causes the fastener to heat up, acting like a short-circuit, which in reality, is what happens, allowing the flux lines to mingle between the laminations as if they were shorted together. To cure this, the fastener holes in the laminations are generally placed in the far corner of the laminations, where the least amount of magnetic flux travels. Also, magnetic fasteners have been used by adding a paper sleeve over the screw, to insulate it somewhat, or a non-magnetic fastener, such as made from Aluminum or Brass, have been used.

Some transformers, today, have a welded seam placed on the outside of the laminations to hold them together, but this can cause a small amount of loss, the same way a magnetic screw would allow the magnetic flux to mingle between the insulated laminations. Since it is on the outside surface of the lamination, though, and away from the majority of the magnetic flux toward the center and coil, the loss is generally low.

Small power transformer are sometimes held together with a formed sheet metal housing, which encapsulates the circumference of the core stack, and this stops the need for using mechanical fasteners to hold the cores laminations together.

== Watts versus volt-amperes ==

A transformer's power handling ability is determined in two different ways. If the transformer's secondary is supplying a totally resistive load, one can simply use wattage, or the voltage multiplied by the current. However, if the transformer's secondary is supplying a reactive load, containing capacitance and or inductance, such as in most DC power supplies, one must use [[w:Volt-amperes_reactive|volt-amperes]] in place of watts. Volt-amperes, (S) or (VA), is simply the wattage (P), divided by a [[w:Power_factor|power factor]], or P / PF = VA; for example: 1000 watts (P) / 0.80 (PF) = 1,250 Volt-amperes (VA). The power factor for the better transformer circuits is around 0.80 to 0.85. However, some are lower, with a PF of around 0.60, especially in some appliance transformers.

When calculating the power required in Volt Amperes for the secondary windings in DC power supplies, one must take into account the equivalent series resistance of the capacitors, and or the way they, or any inductors act in the filtering circuits. This is due to the current either leading or lagging the voltage in reactive circuits, and or any harmonics. The type of rectifier circuit also comes into play, and is described in the following section. Also, please see this section for the formulae for the power, in volt amperes, of each rectifier circuit.

== Rectifier transformers ==

Rectifier transformers are transformers used to feed a rectifier circuit which converts an AC current into a DC current. Due to the small conduction angle when feeding a rectifier &amp; reservoir (capacitor), the rms AC current in the transformers secondary is somewhat higher than the DC load current. Each rectifier circuit has different conduction angles, and thus different rms current needs. The proper rms current the transformer needs to supply, and the volt amperes of each secondary, are calculated using the following formulae. (Note: Some may use &quot;S&quot; in place of &quot;VA&quot; in the following formulae). The formulae below does not take into consideration any extra current needed by voltage regulation circuits fed by the rectifier/filter assembly. They need to be added to the total power that the rectifier circuit will feed. Each rectifier and voltage regulation system uses different amounts of current, and each case has to be calculated differently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcitransformer.com/i_notes.html MCI, Basic Power Supply Application Quide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powertronix.com/resources.php?page=linear Powertronix, Linear Power Supplies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powervolt.com/techan01.html PowerVolt, How To Determine Power Supply Transformer Ratings]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equations ==

There are two approaches used in designing transformers. One uses the long formulas, and the other uses the Wa product. The Wa product is simply the cores window area multiplied by the cores area. Some say it simplifies the design, especially in C-core (cut core) construction. Most manufacturers of C-cores have the Wa product added into the tables used in their selection. The designer takes the area used by a coil and finds a C-core with a similar window area. The Wa product is then divided by the window area to find the area of the core. Either way will bring the same result.

For a transformer designed for use with a sine wave, the universal voltage formula is:Ref:&lt;ref&gt;McLyman,Col. William T. (1981). ''Transformer and Inductor Design Handbook.'' ISBN 978-0-824-75393-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowdon,Eric (1981). ''Practical Transformer Design Handbook.'' ISBN 978-0-672-21657-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eng. Staff of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1949). ''Magnetic Circuits and Transformers.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. ISBN 978-0-262-63063-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*''The J&amp;P Transformer Book,'' Heathcote, Martin (2007), ISBN 978-0-7506-8164-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*''Hipersil Core Design Engineer's Handbook'' Westinghouse (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E={\frac {2 \pi f N a B} {\sqrt{2}} {10^{-8}}} \!=4.44 f N a B {10^{-8}}&lt;/math&gt;

thus,

:&lt;math&gt; E={4.44 f N a B {10^{-8}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where,

* ''E'' is the sinusoidal rms or root mean square voltage of the winding,
* ''f'' is the frequency in hertz,
* ''N'' is the number of turns of wire on the winding,
* ''a'' is the cross-sectional area of the core in square centimeters or inches,
* ''B'' is the peak magnetic flux density in Teslas or Webers per square meter (MKS meas. sys.), gausses per square centimeter, or lines (maxwells) per square inch (cgs meas. sys.).
* ''P'' is the power in volt amperes or watts,
* ''W'' is the window area in square centimeters or inches and,
* ''J'' is the current density.
* Note: 10 kilogauss = 1 Tesla.

This gives way to the following other transformer equations for cores in square centimeters (cgs meas. sys.):

:&lt;math&gt; N={\frac {E  10^8} {{4.44 f B a}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B={\frac {E  10^8} {{4.44 f N a}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a={\frac {E  10^8} {{4.44 f B N}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; P={0.707 J f W a B} \!&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation of the above formula is actually quite simple.  The maximum induced voltage, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, is the result of N times the time-varying flux:

:&lt;math&gt; e=N{\frac {d \phi} {dt}} &lt;/math&gt;

If using RMS voltage values and E equal the rms value of voltage then:

:&lt;math&gt; e=E{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt; E = {\frac {N} {\sqrt{2}}} {\frac {d \phi} {dt}} &lt;/math&gt;

Since the flux is created by a sinusoidal voltage, it too varies sinusoidally:

:&lt;math&gt; {\phi(t)} = \Phi_{max} \sin \omega t = A B_{max} \sin \omega t \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = area of the core

Taking the derivative we have:

:&lt;math&gt; {\frac {d\phi(t)} {dt}} =  \omega A B_{max} \cos \omega t &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the above equation and using  &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 {\pi}f&lt;/math&gt;  and the fact that we are only concerned with the maximum value yields

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac {{2\pi}fNAB} {\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Imperial measurement system===

The formulas for the imperial (inch) system are still being used in the United States by many transformer manufacturers. Most steel EI laminations used in the US are measured in inches. The flux is still measured in gauss or Teslas, but the core area is measured in square inches. 28.638 is the conversion factor from 6.45 x 4.44 (see note 1) the 6.45 factor is simply the square of 2.54 cm in 1 Inch. The formulas for sine wave operation are below. For square wave operation, see Note (3):

:&lt;math&gt; E={28.638 f a N B {10^{-8}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; N={\frac {E  10^8} {{28.638 f B a}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T={\frac {10^8} {{28.638 f a B}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B={\frac {E  10^8} {{28.638 f N a}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a={\frac {E  10^8} {{28.638 f B N}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

To determine the power (''P'') capability of the core, the core stack in inches (''D''), and the window-area (''Wa'') product, the formulas are:

:&lt;math&gt; P={\frac {fBWa} {{17.26S}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Wa={\frac {17.26SP} {{fB}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D={\frac {17.26PS} {{WCfB}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where,

* ''P'' is the power in volt amperes or watts,
* ''T'' is the volts per turn,
* ''E'' is the RMS voltage,
* ''S'' is the current density in circular mils per ampere (Generally 750 to 1500 cir mils),
* ''W'' is the window area in square inches,
* ''C'' is the core width in square inches,
* ''D'' is the depth of the stack in inches and,
* ''Wa'' is the product of the window area in square inches multiplied by the core area in square inches. This is especially useful for determining C-cores, but can also be used with EI types. The window area is simply the windows height multiplied by its width.

===Simpler formulae===

A shorter formula for the core area (a) and the turns per volt (T) can be derived from the long voltage formula by multiplying, rearranging, and dividing out. This is used if one wants to design a transformer using a sine wave, at a fixed flux density, and frequency. Below is the short formulas for core areas in square inches having a flux density of 12 kilogauss at 60 Hz (see note 2):

:&lt;math&gt; a={0.1725 {\sqrt{P}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T={\frac {4.85} {{a}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And for 12 kilogauss at 50 Hz:

:&lt;math&gt; a={0.206 {\sqrt{P}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T={\frac {5.82} {{a}}} \!&lt;/math&gt;

===Equation notes===

* Note 1: The factor of 4.44 is derived from the first part of the voltage formula. It is from 4 multiplied by the form factor (''F'') which is 1.11, thus 4 multiplied by 1.11 = 4.44. The number 1.11 is derived from dividing the rms value of a sine wave by its average value, where ''F'' = rms / average  = 1.11.

* Note 2: A value of 12 kilogauss per square inch (77,400 lines per sq. in.) is used for the short formulas above as it will work with most steel types used (M-2 to M-27), including unknown steel from scrap transformer laminations in TV sets, radios, and power supplies. The very lowest classes of steel (M-50) would probably not work as it should be run at or around 10 kilogauss or under.

* Note 3: All formulas shown are for sine wave operation only. Square wave operation does not use the form factor (F) of 1.11. For using square waves, substitute 4 for 4.44, and 25.8 for 28.638.

* Note 4: None of the above equations show the stacking factor (Sf). Each core or lamination will have its own stacking factor. It is selected by the size of the core or lamination, and the material it is made from. At design time, this is simply added to the string to be multiplied. Example; ''E'' = 4.44 ''f'' ''N'' ''a'' ''B'' ''Sf''

==Electrical steel types==
====Silicon steel====
Iron was used in the first transformers and motor designs along with early steel. Steel is simply a de-carbonized alloy of iron. This early steel had the problem of aging, and it's magnetic properties changed with age. Next, [[w:Silicon_steel|silicon steel]] came into use, as it was found to raise the magnetic resistance against eddy currents, reduce hysteresis, increase permeability, and the aging problems were countered. Electrical silicon steel and its alloys are what are in use today.

====Other alloys====

There are various iron alloys other than silicon-steel or low-carbon steel. These include alloys which contain nickel-iron (Permalloy), cobalt-nickel-iron (Perminvar), cobalt-iron (Permendur), and vanadium-cobalt-iron. Others include Supermalloy, amorphous Metglas, Mu-metal, Sendust, iron powder, and ferrite types.

Some of the Permalloy types are processed to accentuate the squareness of the B-H loop and carry proprietary names like SuperSquare 80 (Magnetic Metals Corp.), and Square Permalloy Hy-Ra 80 (Carpenter Steel Co.). The squareness of the B-H loop helps in switching transformers as in inverter type power supplies with a square wave input. The nickel-iron content may range from about 45% to over 85%.

Perminvar exhibits a substantially constant permeability and low hysteresis loss at low flux densities. This is mainly due to the addition of cobalt to the nickel and iron. In some cases it may have the odd property of low coercive force and remanence although the hysteresis loop area is still greater than zero. One type of Perminvar is Fernico.

Permendur is created by mixing cobalt with iron. It has a high permeability at high flux densities with a very high saturation point. It also has a high incremental permeability and is very good to use with a combination of AC and DC voltages combined such as in filter chokes.

Vanadium-cobalt-iron has the very highest saturation point with low losses, but it is very expensive.

For descriptions of the other materials and shapes, refer to the Wikipedia section titled [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_core Magnetic core].

==DC Transformers==
[[File:Core-Stacks.jpg|thumb|Different types of transformer core stacks.]]
[[File:Electrical Vibrator.jpg|thumb|left|A Typical Electrical Vibrator.]]
Transformers used in DC (Direct Current) circuits, generally consist of switching transformers in inverter type power supplies. These are widely used to convert 12 VDC to 115-120 VAC. However, the waveform produced is either a square wave, or a modified square wave. A modified square wave, is in reality, an attempt to create something similar to a sine wave, and it has a stair-step look on an oscilloscope. It is created by an electronic circuit that controls and steps the voltage level of the switching semiconductors output throughout one cycle.

The first switching power supplies, or &quot;inverters&quot;, were controlled by a Vibrator that worked similar to an electric buzzer, and were used in the old tube type automobile radios. The Vibrator was merely a reed relay, with two sets of contacts, whose armature would switch back and forth at around 115 to 250 Hz, and create a square to flat-topped triangle wave output. It switched the positive and negative primary connections polarity back and forth at approximately 115-120 Hz. This fast switching speed allowed a smaller transformer core to be used, which was needed in the small radios of the time. It should be noted that the US Air Force adopted 400 Hz as the operating frequency for their power supplies to lighten the weight in aircraft. Now, higher frequencies are used to get away from the audible range, as switching transformers in the lower frequency range can produce a high-pitched noise from vibration. The higher frequencies keep the noise aspect down.

When semiconductors came into being, large PNP type Germanium transistors were used, like the 2N1522, and their bases were connected to a &quot;tickler&quot; winding on the transformer, which was out of phase with the primary, and supplied around 5 VAC (Square Wave) for bias. The tickler winding would set up the oscillation of the circuit, and relied on core saturation to work. The transistors then took the place of the vibrator, and created a square wave input to the primary of the transformer; some ran at higher frequencies. Since the transformer relied on saturation, a core with an interleaved stack was used. In some instances, toroidal transformers were used, made by winding a continuous strip of electrical steel into a dough-nut shape. The transformers coil was then wound over the toroid using a special winding machine.

Now, the switching is accomplished by both bipolar transistors and FETs (Field Effect Transistors). They are controlled either by an oscillator circuit, or an integrated circuit similar to a flip-flop, or multivibrator, such as in [[w:Switched-mode power supply|switched mode power supplies]] and [[w:Flyback transformer|flyback type transformer]] circuits. There are numerous switching circuits in use today. Transformer cores used with external oscillators, in this fashion, would be butt stacked, or a combination of butt and interleaving, or of the gapped ferrite type, due to the DC current within the windings. In this case, core saturation is not generally needed.

Transformers used at these higher frequencies are different from the larger 60 Hz line transformers, in that the core is constructed with thinner laminations. This is due to the losses because of Eddy currents, etc. at these frequencies, and the core material is made to suit the service. Higher frequency switch mode transformers, and flyback type transformers used to power the CRTs in computer monitors, use a ferrite type molded core.

However, in designing transformers for these square wave circuits, the above formulae are still used, except the form factor of 1.11, which is only used for sine waves, is not.

==Impedance matching transformers==
[[File:Coil Construction.jpg|thumb|left|Different Coil Winding Methods]]
[[Image:Kreuzwickelspule.png|thumb|right|RF Transformer with shielding removed.]]

Impedance matching transformers are known by other names such as [[w:Transformer_types#RF_transformers|RF transformers]], audio, and modulation transformers. Their function is to match one impedance in ohms to another.

Audio and modulation transformers generally have an electrical steel laminated core, but the material is thinner, and sometimes chemically different than line transformers. This is due to the higher frequency at which they are run. The core is designed around the lowest frequency and open circuit load, and at high frequencies around leakage inductance and winding capacitance. The primary may be wound with a two-piece primary with the first section against the core, the secondary on top of that, and the last half of the primary on the outside of the coil. Some air gap should be used in the core due to the DC current superimposed on the AC current.

RF (Radio Frequency) transformers are used between different stages of transistor or tube amplifiers in radio or transmitter circuits, or the impedance from the final amplifier to the load. Again, they match the primary impedance in ohms to the secondary impedance. The core is generally a form of [[w:Ferrite_core|Ferrite]]. Ferrite is made from a powdered iron oxide, with other alloys such as nickel oxide. Ferrite is used only in high to radio frequency circuits. The RF transformer is generally shielded with an enclosure made of copper or aluminum to shield it from interference from other radio signals. The core can be adjustable, using a threaded slug of ferrite, or it can be a core made up of ferrite toroids. There are also air core RF transformers used in push-pull RF amplifiers, and in matching networks.

For the formulae for the above, reference Wikipedia article: [[w:Impedance matching|Impedance matching]]

Complete the square of the equations in this part to render them in a form of the equation of a circle.

===13===

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x + y^2 = 5 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x = 5 - y^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x + 1 = 6 - y^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

We add one to both sides so we can write the right hand side as a single power.

&lt;math&gt;(x+1)^2 = 6 - y^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x+1)^2 + y^2 = 6 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x + y^2 - 4y = 20 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x = -(y^2-4y) + 20 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x + 4 = -(y^2-4y)+20 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x+2)^2 = -(y^2-4y)+24 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y^2-4y = -(x+2)^2 + 24 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y^2-4y+4 = -(x+2)^2 + 28 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(y-2)^2 + (x+2)^2 = 28 \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Section 4==

===2=== 
Multiply both sides of the inequality by both numerator and denominator of both sides to get:


&lt;math&gt;(1+t^2)(1-s^2) &gt; (1-t^2)(1+s^2) \,&lt;/math&gt;


Then, expand and simplify:


&lt;math&gt;1-s^2+t^2-(ts)^2 &gt; 1+s^2-t^2-(ts)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-s^2+t^2 &gt; s^2-t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-2s^2+t^2 &gt; -t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-2s^2 &gt; -2t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s^2 &lt; t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;s &lt; t \,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't know how they got this to turn out yellow with all that tomato puree and the red wine. My sauce was pink after folding in the whipped creme. This is decidedly odd stuff; not bad, but not worth the hassle. Maybe you've gotta be a blue blood?

===== Raisins? =====

What happened to the raisins? This recipe is like no Coronation Chicken I've had.

== Marking morphological categories ==

Does anyone have any idea how we should explain the various ways of marking morphological categories; things like affixation, alternation, and reduplication? Since they're used throughout morphology, they don't really lend themselves to any of the existing pages. Should we add a new page for them? And what about syntactic ways of expressing these things, such as compound tenses or cases on determiners &amp;mdash; should they be explained in the same place? I'm beginning to think that such a strict chapter structure (like the strong division between morphology and syntax) is the wrong approach for this book.

== Materials looking for a home ==

I've just pulled the following recently-added paragraphs out of [[{{BOOKNAME}}/Beginner/Grammar|Beginner/Grammar]], on the grounds that they didn't seem to me to belong at the Beginner level.  Perhaps they (or something like them) could find a home somewhere in this section.

:[concerning &quot;morphology&quot; versus &quot;syntax&quot;]
:Sometimes it's hard to draw the line between these terms. In Chinese (Mandarin), for example, the word ''to eat'' is 吃 chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, like in 吃面 chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;mian&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ''to eat noodles''. However, 吃 chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is not used alone, so ''to eat'' without any object is transtaled 吃饭 chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;fan&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (literally, ''to eat rice''). It's hard to tell whether 吃面 chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;mian&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 吃饭 chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;fan&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; are phrases with a word 吃 chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or new words with a root 吃 chi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

:...

:If one suffix is used for one property, language is called ''agglutinative'', and if one suffix is used for several properties, then language is ''inflectional''.

:I've added a section on the morphology/syntax distinction because we needed to talk about it a little more considering how much I've used it in the forms page. The piece you've quoted fit in fairly well so I've added that too. [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] ([[User talk:Ingolemo|talk]]) 10:07, 27 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

This is not really a tutorial, but a list of handy tricks you will probably use a lot when modeling.

1: Extrusion: to extrude, press EKEY in edit mode with the vertices selected, move and click to place the extrusion. You'll basically need this for every model in blender, without it, most models would be really hard to create.

2: Set Smooth: setting smooth will smoothen everything, without increasing the amount of polygons and vertices. You can use it for models with a smooth surface. To apply set smooth, select the mesh, go to the editing buttons (F9) and in the Links and Materials tab, press Set Smooth. If you press the Set Solid button, it will go back to normal.

3: Remove Double: when you remove double vertices, they will melt together, this is good for attaching things to each other. to remove double vertices, select the vertices, go to editing (F9) in edit mode, and in the Mesh tools tab, press Rem Doubl, the limit button next to it is the distance that the vertices have to have to be melted together.

Example use of these techniques:

Extrusion: http://www.geocities.com/gauravnawani/tutorials/beginner/a-vase-modeling.html (they explain subsurf here too, but I'd recommend set smooth, because it doesn't increase the number of polygons and subsurf does) http://biorust.com/index.php?page=tutorial_detail&amp;tutid=77&amp;lang=en

Remove Double: http://biorust.com/index.php?page=tutorial_detail&amp;tutid=77&amp;lang=en (same tutorial as in the extrusion section)

Set smooth: http://www.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/x2681.html


If you want to add more handy techniques, please add them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am afraid you did not understand Frank Lin, while he understood quite well what Girdi was saying.  Girdi was trying to establish the list from the FSI as a universal list and then said it was useless (and American etc. etc.).  If you take it as a universal list, it is indeed useless, but there never was a claim that it is universal.  It is not a deductive nomothetic list that gratuitously assigns labels to languages. It is simply a statement of what the people at the various government language institutes have inductively found over decades of professional language work using a consistent standard as to what it means if we say that someone 'knows' a language.
 
The list ranks languages for speakers of English, but for the non-Indoeuropean languages, the findings are likely to be similar, no matter which major European language you speak. If you speak Japanese it will be easier for you to learn Korean and vice versa. If you speak Dutch, German is quite easy and vice versa (except you don't always know where one ends and the other one begins).  If you speak any of the European languages, Chinese will be quite difficult, just as learning a European language is quite difficult for someone from China. Even if Chinese only has 4000 words, someone who starts from a European language must learn all of these words one by one since there are practically no cognates. This will take years, even if the grammar is easy. If you learn a major European language speaking another European language natively, you know hundreds of words and cultural references already and you can typically understand vastly more than you can say. This makes certain languages easier TO LEARN for a speaker starting out from, e.g., English.  The Foreign Service Institute has taught hundreds and often thousands of adults in various languages, and they state an average how long motivated and language-experienced English speakers need to achieve a very high level of ability. As in all statistics, there may be large variations for each individual. Sometimes there are real outliers. I have been teaching a foreign language for 40 years now, and every two years or so, a student will soak the language up as if it were nothing.  That does not change the fact that 'normal' students will progress at a certain fairly predictable pace, given my instructional methods. If someone should come up with a different method which makes average progress faster, I will have to revise my teaching. Having a rating of languages will help students and decision-makers in being realistic in their expectations.

One last note: Of course one teach a language in more difficult and easier ways. If you have various languages taught in schools, they may all be taught roughly at the same level of difficulty, but the learning outcomes won't be the same.

'''How do we use ''Information Systems'' in schools to accomplish learning, teaching, management, collaboration and communication functions?'''

== ''IS for Learning:'' ==
Information systems are used in a variety of ways. This section will look at how IS can be used for Learning, Teaching, Management, and for Collaboration and Communication. We will look at what goes into an IS to be used in an academic setting. Students use at least one of these common tools everyday. It is up to the teacher to bring that new method of teaching to the understanding of the students. How can this be utilized in a classroom setting? In a study by Stratham and Torrell (1996) researchers reviewed 200 studies on the effectiveness of technology in supporting student learning in grades K–12. Among the positive findings were that students seemed to work more collaboratively on IT projects and were more motivated when computers were involved&quot; (from [http://www.techlearning.com/article/8790]). This shows that using technology in the classroom not only works, but it also brings the students together to accomplish a common goal they share. This speaks well for learning especially when technology and classroom activities are tied together. There are often positive correlations between enhanced learning and IT&quot; (from [http://www.techlearning.com/article/8790]).

'''Below is an example of a breakdown of equipment, its uses and the people that use them in ''learning''.'''

   HARDWARE: 
     desktop/notebook computers, handheld computers, clickers, projector, DVD player, cell phone, printers, 
     scanners, digital cameras, document cameras, digital video cameras, headphones, microphone, gaming system (ex. wii)

   SOFTWARE:

== ''IS for Teaching'' ==
A good example of how IS can be used in teaching is with online courses or a web-enhanced course that is tied to a brick and mortar course. Most of the same equipment and software are used. Many instructors are utilizing learning management systems, like ''Blackboard'' or ''Moodle'', to deliver the course materials to the students. They would use this as a normal classroom setting, except that it would be up to the student(s) to sign in to access their course materials. Assignments would still have due dates, but the actual course would not have a normal preset schedule unless required by the instructor. 

Another example, and a more common use of technology in the classroom, is students using computers for researching projects, computer software, demonstrations, etc. Many different programs are taught to students for daily applications. Because today's students learn in a different way these days, teachers need to figure out a way to get that information to them effectively. In an article by Johnny J. Moye, he describes what it is like to start a new technology course to promote technological literacy. According to Moye, students learn to operate a program by just doing it (Moye, 2008). The old rules do not apply to today's students. Instead of the students changing to fit the mold of what the teacher expects, the teacher needs to change his or her delivery to get that information to the students. One way these can be delivered to the students are from multi media modeling presentation. The students watch what they need to do and then they just dive right in to the project and start working.

     desktop/notebook computers, handheld computers, clickers, projector, DVD player, cell phone, printers,

   PEOPLE:

== ''IS for Management'' ==
A student information system &quot;can become a true portal for student, parent, and teacher communication. The majority of SIS offerings allow teachers to enter attendance, grades, and homework assignments directly into the system from their classrooms. This data can then be accessed by parents and students via a web-based interface&quot; (from [http://www.techlearning.com/article/13878]). This is a great tool for the parents to stay on top of how the child is doing in class, as well as keep track of attendance or any fees/fines owed. As a management system, this keeps all of the information in a nice, neat package and it gives information in an instant.

== ''IS for Collaboration &amp; Communication'' ==
Communication is key if you want the right message to be delivered. There are many ways to communicate. Using the right method for its delivery is important. Just a few years ago when teachers and students would make presentations in class, they would use flipcharts, overhead projectors, or chalkboards as the primary medium. Now, we have electronic whiteboards that record what the teacher writes, so students can access the animated and/or narrated information on a computer for review after the presentation. We also have Power Point presentations in which we can integrate text, video, sound, graphics, links to other documents, or links to the Internet. This widespread application allows both students and teachers to communicate in a truly multimedia format. Social networking sites, electronic mail (e-mail), and web logs (blogs) are three more means of facilitating communication among students.
 
Collaboration is easier than ever because of online tools and software that allow students (and educators) who do not necessarily know each other to work together on projects. Wikis, webinars, and video conference calls are just a few of the ways students and teachers can collaborate to share information with other students and colleagues.
 
Below is a list of various communication skills and examples of how those skills can be developed in the classroom using technology.

 ''    LISTENING: Listening to instructions in a lesson or online broadcast'' 

 ''    SPEAKING: Creating a podcast about a famous author.''

 ''    READING: Reading electronic texts, including e-books, e-mails, online scholarly articles, and online news releases.'' 

 ''    WRITING: Recording journals and newspaper reports electronically, to have them electronically stored.''

 ''    VIEWING: Watching online videos about the life cycle of butterflies.''

 ''    PRESENTING: Using Kidspiration® and/or PowerPoint® software to present research on mammals to the class.''

 ''    NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION: Considering layout and colors when putting presentations together.''

== ''Final Thoughts'' ==
Once one has identified the hardware, software, data, procedures, and people it takes to get an IS in place in schools, it is important to understand how to share the information with all educational stakeholders so that it functions effectively. With today's ever-changing technology, teaching and learning need to keep up. More and more schools are meeting with success as they attempt online instruction or have an online element added to a traditional &quot;brick and mortar&quot; approach in classroom learning.

==1. Define the following commonly used terms: ==
===a. Marae ===
[[Image:Marae, Raiatea 2.jpg|thumb|390px|Taputapuātea, an ancient marae at Ra'iātea in the Society Islands, restored in 1994.]]A '''marae''' is a sacred place which served both religious and social purposes in pre-Christian Polynesian societies and in some modern Polynesian societies, such as Māori, today. In all these languages, the word also means &quot;cleared, free of weeds, trees, etc.&quot; It generally consists of an area of cleared land roughly rectangular (the marae itself), bordered with stones or wooden posts (called ''au'' in Tahitian and Cook Islands Māori) perhaps with terraces (''paepae'') which were used in olden times for ceremonial purposes; and with a central stone ''ahu'' or ''a'u'' (sometimes as in the Rapanui culture's ahu on Easter Island &quot;ahu&quot; becomes a synonym for the whole marae complex).

===b. Powhiri===
A Pōwhiri is a Māori welcoming ceremony involving speeches, dancing, singing and hongi. It can be performed both to welcome guests onto a marae or during other ceremonies, such as during a dedication of a building (where the performers might welcome the owners or future users of the building). A pōwhiri is not performed for every group of manuhiri (visitors). It is often reserved for special visitors or for tupapaku (the arrival of the body of the deceased) for a tangihanga (funeral). However, powhiri are also often performed for tourist groups as part of special events.
{{clear}}

===c. Karakia===
'''Karakia''' is the Māori word for incantations and prayers.  Karakia are generally used to ensure a favourable outcome of important untertakings. They are also considered a formal greeting when beginning a ceremony. According to legend, in the village of Ruatoria, there was a curse on the Waiapu River which was lifted when Hori Keeti performed Karakia.

===d. Mate ===
''Mate'' means &quot;death&quot; in Māori. &quot;Ka Mate&quot; is a Māori ''haka'' composed by Te Rauparaha, war leader of the Ngāti Toa tribe of the North Island of New Zealand:
the main body of the haka:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|--
|Ka mate, ka mate! ka ora! ka ora!
Ka mate! ka mate! ka ora! ka ora!

Tēnei te tangata pūhuruhuru

Nāna nei i tiki mai whakawhiti te rā

Ā, upane! ka upane!

Ā, upane, ka upane, whiti te ra!
|’Tis death! ‘tis death! ''(or: I may die)'' ’Tis life! ‘tis life! ''(or: I may live)''
’Tis death! ‘tis death! ’Tis life! ‘tis life!

This the hairy man that stands here...

…who brought the sun and caused it to shine

A step upward, another step upward!

A step upward, another... the Sun shines!
|}

===e. Waiata ===
Waiata is the Māori word for song.

===f. Korero ===
Kōrero is the spoken word.  Māori is a culture based on Kōrero, the oral tradition.  Māori place as much importance on the spoken word as Western cultures place on the written word.  In the Western world, people are bound by written contracts and laws are written down before they may come into effect.  In Māori, Kōrero is binding.

[http://www.maori.org.nz/Tikanga/default.asp?pid=sp100&amp;parent=95 www.maori.org.nz].

===g. Haka ===
[[Image:MaoriWardanceKahuroa.jpg|thumb|260px|The haka is a traditional genre of Māori dance. This depiction of a haka as a war dance dates from ca. 1845.]]
A haka is a traditional dance form. It is a posture dance with shouted accompaniment, performed by a group.  Although the use of a haka by the ''All Blacks'' (a rugby team) has made one type of haka familiar, it has led to misconceptions. Haka are not exclusively war dances, nor are they only performed by men. Some are performed by women, others by mixed groups, and some simple haka are performed by children. Haka are performed for various reasons: for amusement, as a hearty welcome to distinguished guests, or to acknowledge great achievements or occasions. War haka, which had their own term, 'peruperu', were originally performed by warriors before a battle, proclaiming their strength and prowess in order to intimidate the opposition. Today, haka constitute an integral part of formal or official welcome ceremonies for distinguished visitors or foreign dignitaries, serving to impart a sense of the importance of the occasion.

===h. Kuia ===
''Kuia'' (also ''kui'') is the Māori word for &quot;grandmother&quot;.

===i. Tane ===
In the Māori language, ''Tāne'' means &quot;man&quot;.

===j. Wero===
In the Māori language, ''Wero'' means &quot;challenge&quot;.  At the beginning of a Powhiri, the people must first determine if the visitors have peaceful intentions or not.  This is done through the wero which literally means &quot;to cast a spear.&quot;  The warriors performing the wero will make frightening gestures with spears.  Once the challenge is complete, the warriors will guide the visitors to the marae where they will be welcomed by the women and children.

===k. Mana===
In Polynesian culture (for example, Hawaiian and Māori), mana is a spiritual quality considered to have supernatural origin – a sacred impersonal force existing in the universe. Therefore to have ''mana'' is to have influence and authority, and efficacy – the power to perform in a given situation. This essential quality of ''mana'' is not limited to persons – peoples, governments, places and inanimate objects can possess ''mana''. In Hawaiian, ''mana loa'' means &quot;great power&quot;. People or objects that possess ''mana'' are accorded &quot;respect&quot;; because their possession of ''mana'' gives them &quot;authority&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, and &quot;prestige&quot;. In Māori, a tribe that has ''mana whenua'' is considered to have demonstrated their authority over a given piece of land or territory. The word’s meaning is complex because ''mana'' is a basic foundation of the Polynesian worldview.

The magazine ''Māori Law Review'' suggests two essential aspects to a Māori person's ''mana'':

* ''mana tangata'', authority derived from ''whakapapa'' connections, and
* ''mana huaanga'', defined as &quot;authority derived from having a wealth of resources to gift to others to bind them into reciprocal obligations&quot;.

===l. Manuhiri ===
Manuhiri are visitors.  Locals and visitors have to respect certain rules, especially during the rituals of encounter. This is when the phrase tāngata whenua (people of the land) comes into play. Should a group of people come to stay on a marae, they are considered manuhiri (guests) while the owners of the marae are known as tāngata whenua. Should other groups of manuhiri arrive, the manuhiri who arrived previously - regardless of their race - are considered tāngata whenua for the purposes of formally welcoming the new group. When Māori refer to themselves as tāngata whenua this is not done solely to emphasise their indigenous status, as is often assumed, because the connotation in Māori of the phrase is one not of separation but rather of welcome and inclusion.

===m. Hongi ===
A '''Hongi''' is a traditional  Māori greeting in New Zealand. It is done by pressing one's nose to another person at an encounter.  See below.


===n.  Hui ===
A hui is a New Zealand Māori social gathering or assembly in a Māori community.

=== o.  Poroporoaki ===
Poroporoaki is the final farewell during a ''powhiri''.  When the poroporoaki is concluded, the ''mana'' returns to the host.  It is a solemn occasion during which the people reflect on the welcome they have received, and recognize that they may not experience another ''powhiri'' before their death.

=== p.  Whanau ===
Whānau is a Māori-language word for extended family. Other meanings, though less commonly used in English, are to give birth, or genus.

===q. Tangi ===
Tangi is a Māori funeral rite.

===r. Aroha ===
''Aroha'' can be best translated as &quot;love,&quot; but the meaning is deeper than that.  The Māori believe that ''Aroha'' is the force that binds the universe together.

===s.  Whakairo===
Whakairo is a Māori form of carving.  Carvings are made from wood, jade, bone, or basalt.

===t.  Koro ===
''Koro'' is a Māori chief.

===u. Kaumatua ===
Kaumatua are respected tribal elders of either gender in a Māori community who have been involved with their whānau for a number of years. They are appointed by their people who believe the chosen elders have the capacity to teach and guide both current and future generations.

===v. Wahine ===
''Wahine'' is the Māori word for &quot;woman&quot;.

=== w. Mihi ===
A Māori word literally meaning &quot;homage&quot; or &quot;respect&quot;.

=== x. Whaikorero===
Whaikorero means &quot;formal speech&quot; or &quot;oration&quot;.

===y. Tangata whenua ===
Tangata whenua is a Māori term literally meaning &quot;people of the land&quot;, from tangata, 'people' and whenua land.  In the context of tribal descent and ownership of land, tangata whenua are the people who descend from the first people to settle the land of the district, whereas the actual mana may reside with later arrivals. However, in the context of a marae, the tangata whenua are the owners of the marae, in contradistinction to the manuhiri or guests. After the welcoming ceremony on a marae, the guests may be afforded the temporary, honorary status of tangata whenua, and may even be invited to participate as locals as the ceremonies continue. In the national context of New Zealand, Māori are the tangata whenua, and in this sense the term is equivalent to 'indigenous'.

===z. Taonga ===
A taonga in Māori culture is a treasured thing, whether tangible or intangible. Tangible examples are all sorts of heirlooms and artefacts, land and fisheries. Intangible examples may include language, spiritual beliefs, radio frequencies and riparian rights.

==2. a. Draw or trace a map of the world and show with arrows the directions of Polynesian settlement.==
[[File:Polynesian Migration.svg|thumb|600px|center|&lt;center&gt;Polynesian migration routes&lt;/center&gt;]]

==2. b. Where do Māoris consider themselves to have come to New Zealand from?==
Various Māori traditions recount how their ancestors set out from a mythical homeland in great ocean-going canoes (or waka). Some of these traditions name the homeland as Hawaiki.

==2. c. Explain what the Great Migration Myth is. Who was the originator of the myth? What were the canoes that arrived in this migration and where did they come from? ==
Various Māori traditions recount how their ancestors set out from a mythical homeland in great ocean-going canoes (or waka). Some of these traditions name the homeland as Hawaiki.

Among these is the story of Kupe, who had eloped with Kuramarotini, the wife of Hoturapa, the owner of the great canoe Matahourua, whom Kupe had murdered. To escape punishment for the murder, Kupe and Kura fled in Matahourua and discovered a land he called Aotearoa ('long-white-cloud'). He explored its coast and killed the sea monster Te Wheke-a-Muturangi, finally returning to his home to spread news of his newly discovered land.

Other stories of various other tribes report migrations to escape famine, over-population, and warfare. These were made in legendary canoes, the best known of which are Aotea, Arawa, Kurahaupō, Mataatua, Tainui, Tākitimu, and Tokomaru. Various traditions name numerous other canoes. Some, including the Āraiteuru, are well known; others including the Kirauta and the sacred Arahura and Mahangaatuamatua are little known. Rather than arriving in a single fleet, the journeys may have occurred over several centuries.

An important early collector and preserver of Māori traditions was the surveyor and ethnologist Stephenson Percy Smith. He believed that while the Polynesian traditions may have been flawed in detail, they preserved the threads of truth which could be recovered using a method already well established for Hawaiian traditions by Fornander (1878-1885). This method involved seeking out common elements of tradition from different sources, and aligning these to genealogies to give a time frame for the events. Abraham Fornander, Smith, and others used this method to reconstruct the migrations of the Polynesians, tracing them back to a supposed ancient homeland in India.

S. Percy Smith used the Fornander method, combining disparate traditions from various parts of New Zealand and other parts of Polynesia, to derive a now discredited version of Māori migration to New Zealand -- the 'Great Fleet' hypothesis. Through an examination of the genealogies of various tribes, he came up with a set of precise dates for his 'Great Fleet' and the explorers that he and others posited as having paved the way for the fleet.

According to Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand, &quot;Smith’s account went as follows. In 750 AD the Polynesian explorer Kupe discovered an uninhabited New Zealand. Then in 1000–1100 AD, the Polynesian explorers Toi and Whātonga visited New Zealand, and found it inhabited by a primitive, nomadic people known as the Moriori. Finally, in 1350 AD a ‘great fleet’ of seven canoes – Aotea, Kurahaupō, Mataatua, Tainui, Tokomaru, Te Arawa and Tākitimu – all departed from the Tahitian region at the same time, bringing the people now known as Māori to New Zealand. These were advanced, warlike, agricultural tribes who destroyed the Moriori.&quot; The great fleet scenario won general acceptance, its adherents even including the famous Māori ethnologist Te Rangi Hīroa (Sir Peter Buck), and was taught in New Zealand schools. However it was effectively demolished during the 1960s by the ethnologist David Simmons, who showed that it derived from an incomplete and indiscriminate study of Māori tradition as recorded in the 19th Century. Simmons also suggests that some of these 'migrations' may actually have been journeys within New Zealand. 

Historian Rāwiri Taonui, writing in 2006 for the website Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, accuses Smith of falsification: &quot;The Great Fleet theory was the result of a collaboration between the 19th-century ethnologist S. Percy Smith and the Māori scholar Hoani Te Whatahoro Jury. Smith obtained details about places in Rarotonga and Tahiti during a visit in 1897, while Jury provided information about Māori canoes in New Zealand. Smith then ‘cut and pasted’ his material, combining several oral traditions into new ones. Their joint work was published in two books, in which Jury and Smith falsely attributed much of their information to two 19th-century tohunga, Moihi Te Mātorohanga and Nēpia Pōhūhū&quot; (Taonui 2006).

==2. e. Why was Rangitoto named “Rangitoto”? ==
[[Image:Rangitoto island from north head.jpg|thumb|600px|left|Rangitoto Island as viewed from North Head.]]
Rangitoto Island is a volcanic island in the Hauraki Gulf near Auckland, New Zealand. Rangitoto is Māori for 'Bloody Sky', with the name coming from the full phrase Nga Rangi-i-totongia-a Tama-te-kapua ('The days of the bleeding of Tama-te-kapua').

==3. Visit a marae with a group that has been called to a hui. Write a report on the events that take place from the time you arrive at the marae to the time you leave. State the name of the marae, its locality and the tribe to which it is affiliated. ==
A hui can be called for many reasons, including a wedding, birth, funeral, or even a meeting to discuss community decisions.

If you arrive at the marae before the rest of your group, wait for them before entering.  Visitors are always welcomed in groups, and to enter all by yourself is a violation of protocol.  When your whole group has arrived, you may enter the marae, and you will be welcomed in a powhiri ceremony.

It might be a good idea to bring a small notebook and pen along so you can take notes about what is happening.  A hui follows a prescribed structure.  If you do not understand everything that happens, ask your host afterwards.

==4. Briefly relate the customs observed at each of the following events: ==
===a. Mate ===
As described previously, ''mate'' means &quot;death&quot; in Māori.  

Tangihanga, or more commonly, Tangi, is a Māori funeral rite. Tangihanga takes place at a marae, and each manuhiri (visiting group) receives a pohiri (formal greeting).  Some tribes will not perform a pohiri after dark, so the visitors must arrive before dusk.

A collection is taken up to defray the costs of embalming, to defray the costs of the marae, or both. 

On the final night of the tangihanga, people tell stories, sing, and tell jokes to help cheer the grieving family.  Burial takes place the following day.  After the body is lowered into the grave, people are given an opportunity to say a final farewell.  Then everyone present files by the grave and throws in either a flower or a handful of soil.

If the deceased lived near the cemetery, the people go their after the burial and bless the house.  Otherwise, this is done sometime later.  After the house blessing, a Hakari (final feast) is held, during which people will speak or perform.  The Hakari is a celebration and affirmation of life.

===b. Meal times===
Food was considered communal property among the Māori.  It was distributed by an official who was placed in charge of the food warehouse.  Communal ownership of food prevented an unlucky fisherman (and his family) from going hungry.

Before contact with Europeans was established, the Māori diet consisted primarily of vegetables, though fish was not an uncommon food.  They correctly believed that diet affected health, and that regular bowels were an important aspect of general health.  

The Māori ate two meals per day.  Breakfast was eaten a few hours after waking, and dinner was eaten in the early evening.  A light snack sufficed for lunch.

===c. Speeches===
The history of individual tribal groups is kept by means of narratives, songs and chants, hence the importance of music, story and poetry. Oratory, the making of speeches, is especially important in the rituals of encounter, and it is regarded as important for a speaker to include allusions to traditional narrative and to a complex system of proverbial sayings, called whakataukī.

Formal speeches are delivered at marae, and as the orator speaks, he re-enacts portions of the Māori creation story when Tāne separated the earth (his mother) from the sky (his father), thus allowing himself and his siblings to see light.  During the oration, this re-enactment represents light (or understanding) coming to the people.

=== d. Sleeping ===
In some cases, guests to a marae may spend the night.  When this happens, the hosts provide mattresses on the floor, but no beds.  Everyone sleeps in a common room, and the guests are not separated by gender.

It is considered ''very'' bad manners to step over the body of a sleeping person. Stepping over a person's head is absolutely forbidden, as a person's head is considered the most ''tapu'' (sacred) part of a person.

The Māori also observe customs to determine where guests and hosts sleep.  The guests sleep in the tapu part of the house, which is located along the right wall as one enters the building.  Hosts sleep on the ''noa'' (common) side which is on the left.  Further, the chief among the visitors will sleep in the corner near a window, and visitors are ordered in a way which is related to the order in which they speak.

==5. a. What are the two Māori religions currently in use today, and what are some of their characteristics? ==
Of the Māori who claim a religion, 98% today identify themselves as Christian. The largest denominations in the 2006 census were Anglicans (about 14% of the population), Catholics (about 12%), Presbyterians (about 9%), and Methodists (about 3%). Around 5% of the population identified themselves as Christian without associating themselves with any particular denomination.

For the purposes of this requirement though, we will not consider these as  &quot;Māori&quot; religions, as they were introduced by the Europeans.  &quot;The&quot; two Māori religions in use today could arguably be the original Māori religion practiced before the Europeans arrived, and Ratana.

===Māori Religion===
Traditional Māori religion, that is, the pre-European belief system of the Māori, was little modified from that of their tropical Eastern Polynesian homeland (Hawaiki Nui), conceiving of everything, including natural elements and all living things as connected by common descent through whakapapa or genealogy. Accordingly, all things were thought of as possessing a life force or mauri. As an illustration of this concept of connectedness through genealogy, consider a few of the major personifications of pre-contact times: Tangaroa was the personification of the ocean and the ancestor or origin of all fish; Tāne was the personification of the forest and the origin of all birds; and Rongo was the personification of peaceful activities and agriculture and the ancestor of cultivation.

Certain practices are followed that relate to traditional concepts like tapu. Certain people and objects contain mana - spiritual power or essence. In earlier times, tribal members of a higher rank would not touch objects which belonged to members of a lower rank. This was considered &quot;pollution&quot; and persons of a lower rank could not touch the belongings of a highborn person without putting themselves at risk of death.

Tapu can be interpreted as &quot;sacred&quot;, as &quot;spiritual restriction&quot; or &quot;implied prohibition&quot;; it involves rules and prohibitions. There are two kinds of tapu, the private (relating to individuals) and the public tapu (relating to communities). A person, an object or a place, which is tapu, may not be touched by human contact, in some cases, not even approached. A person, object or a place could be made sacred by tapu for a certain time.

In pre-contact society, tapu was one of the strongest forces in Māori life. A violation of tapu could have dire consequences, including the death of the offender through sickness or at the hands of someone affected by the offence. In earlier times food cooked for a person of high rank was tapu, and could not be eaten by an inferior. A chief's house was tapu, and even the chief could not eat food in the interior of his house. Not only were the houses of people of high rank perceived to be tapu, but also their possessions including their clothing. Burial grounds and places of death were always tapu, and these areas were often surrounded by a protective fence.

===Ratana===
The Ratana movement is a Māori religion and pan-tribal political movement founded by Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana in early 20th century New Zealand. The Ratana Church has its headquarters at the settlement of Ratana, near Wanganui.

The first decades of the twentieth century were a low point for Māori, both in numbers and in spirit. During the nineteenth century, Māori lost their tribal way of life, lands, traditional religion and their mana. Christianity had been accepted, but the missionaries had acted as chaplains to the colonial forces fighting against their Christian converts who were defending their land. Many Māori regarded the missionary clergy as agents of the Government in a deep-laid plot to subjugate the Māori people.

From the 1860s, prophets such as Te Ua Haumene, Te Kooti, Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kakahi put the words of the Bible into terms Māori could understand. The dislocation of colonialism had strained Māori society and led to a belief in a saviour to come.

In 1918, Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana saw a vision, which he regarded as divinely inspired, asking him to preach the gospel to the Māori people, to destroy the power of the tohunga and to cure the spirits and bodies of his people. Until 1924, he preached to increasingly large numbers of Māori, and T.W. Ratana established a name for himself as the &quot;Māori Miracle Man&quot;. Initially, the movement was seen as a Christian revival but it soon moved away from mainstream churches. On 31 May 1925, Te Haahi Ratana (The Ratana Church) was formally established as a separate church, with its founder acknowledged as Te Mangai or the mouthpiece of God. Hostile attitudes have caused the church to be guarded towards its teaching and founder.

==5. b. Briefly describe the Māori story of creation.==
[[Image:WahineTane.jpg|right|260px|thumb|right|Papa and Rangi held each other in a tight embrace]]  In Māori mythology the primal couple Rangi and Papa (or Ranginui and Papatuanuku) appear in a creation myth explaining the origin of the world.

Rangi and Papa are the primordial parents, the sky father and the earth mother who lie locked together in a tight embrace. They have many children all of which are male, who are forced to live in the cramped darkness between them. These children grow and discuss among themselves what it would be like to live in the light. Tūmatauenga, the fiercest of the children, proposes that the best solution to their predicament is to kill their parents.

But his brother Tāne (or Tāne-mahuta) disagrees, suggesting that it is better to push them apart, to let Rangi (their father) be as a stranger to them in the sky above while Papa (their mother) will remain below to nurture them. The others put their plans into action—Rongo, the god of cultivated food, tries to push his parents apart, then Tangaroa, the god of the sea, and his sibling Haumia-tiketike, the god of wild food, join him. In spite of their joint efforts Rangi and Papa remain close together in their loving embrace. After many attempts Tāne, god of forests and birds, forces his parents apart. Instead of standing upright and pushing with his hands as his brothers have done, he lies on his back and pushes with his strong legs. Stretching every sinew Tāne pushes and pushes until, with cries of grief and surprise, Ranginui and Papatuanuku are prised apart.

And so the children of Rangi and Papa see light and have space to move for the first time. While the other children have agreed to the separation Tāwhirimātea, the god of storms and winds, is angered that the parents have been torn apart. He cannot not bear to hear the cries of his parents nor see the tears of the Rangi as they are parted, he promises his siblings that from henceforth they will have to deal with his anger. He flies off to join Rangi and there carefully fosters his own many offspring who include the winds, one of whom is sent to each quarter of the compass. To fight his brothers, Tāwhirimātea gathers an army of his children—winds and clouds of different kinds, including fierce squalls, whirlwinds, gloomy thick clouds, fiery clouds, hurricane clouds and thunderstorm clouds, and rain, mists and fog. As these winds show their might the dust flies and the great forest trees of Tāne are smashed under the attack and fall to the ground, food for decay and for insects.

Then Tāwhirimātea attacks the oceans and huge waves rise, whirlpools form, and Tangaroa, the god of the sea, flees in panic. Punga, a son of Tangaroa, has two children, Ikatere father of fish, and Tu-te-wehiwehi (or Tu-te-wanawana) the ancestor of reptiles. Terrified by Tāwhirimātea’s onslaught the fish seek shelter in the sea and the reptiles in the forests. Ever since Tangaroa has been angry with Tāne for giving refuge to his runaway children. So it is that Tāne supplies the descendants of Tūmatauenga with canoes, fishhooks and nets to catch the descendants of Tangaroa. Tangaroa retaliates by swamping canoes and sweeping away houses, land and trees that are washed out to sea in floods.

Tāwhirimātea next attacks his brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike, the gods of cultivated and uncultivated foods. Rongo and Haumia are in great fear of Tāwhirimātea but, as he attacks them, Papa determines to keep these for her other children and hides them so well that Tāwhirimātea cannot find them. So Tāwhirimātea turns on his brother Tūmatauenga. He uses all his strength but Tūmatauenga stands fast and Tāwhirimatea cannot prevail against him. Tū (or humankind) stands fast and, at last, the anger of the gods subsided and peace prevailed.

Tū thought about the actions of Tāne in separating their parents and made snares to catch the birds, the children of Tāne who could no longer fly free. He then makes nets from forest plants and casts them in the sea so that the children of Tangaroa soon lie in heaps on the shore. He made hoes to dig the ground, capturing his brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike where they have hidden from Tāwhirimātea in the bosom of the earth mother and, recognising them by their long hair that remains above the surface of the earth, he drags them forth and heaps them into baskets to be eaten. So Tūmatauenga eats all of his brothers to repay them for their cowardice; the only brother that Tūmatauenga does not subdue is Tāwhirimātea, whose storms and hurricanes attack humankind to this day.

==5. c. Briefly outline the story of Seventh-day Adventism among the Māori people.==
;before 1893: Maui Pomare, a Māori youth is baptized as a Seventh-day Adventist in Napier.
;1893: Pomare travels to the U.S. to study medicine at the Seventh-day Adventist Church medical college at Battle Creek, Michigan.
;1895: Pomare publishes a pamphlet in the Māori language arguing that the seventh day is the Sabbath.
;1900: Pomare returns to New Zealand and was selected to serve as Māori Health Officer in the Department of Health. In this role he undertook a number of major campaigns to improve Māori health and met with considerable success. He eventually leaves the Adventist Church.
;1902: First Adventist school opens in New Zealand at Ponsonby
;1903: Adventist school opened in Christschurch.  Both schools fail due to lack of resources.
;1903-1905: Adventist schools opened in Napier, Lower Hutt, Petone and New Plymouth.
;1908: School opened near Cambridge and named &quot;Pukekura&quot;, Māori for &quot;I love the place.&quot;
;1913: Pukekura relocated to its current site at Longburn Adventist College near Palmerston North.

==5. d. What is the Māori attitude to religion in general? ==
In the book ''Tikanga Māori'' Hirini Moko Mead describes the Māori attitude to religion this way:

==6. Make a sample tukutuku panel (approx 30cm x 30cm) OR a tipare OR a small flax mat/basket. ==
===Tukutuku===
A tukutuku is a woven wall hanging traditionally made from flax.  New Zealand flax describes common New Zealand perennial plants ''Phormium tenax'' and ''Phormium cookianum'', known by the Māori names harakeke and wharariki respectively. They are quite distinct from ''Linum usitatissimum'', the Northern Hemisphere plant known as flax (and also known as linseed). The genus was given the common name 'flax' by Anglophone Europeans as it too could be used for its fibres.

&lt;!-- I bookmarked a site that has instructions for making a tukutuku, but WM won't let me link to the site where I'm learning this, as it's a frequent source of spam.  It's at suite101 dot come/article.cfm/ethnic_crafts/110454 and I will eventually make a tukutuku, photograph the procedure, upload the pix, and document it here.  --~~~~ --&gt;
{{TODO|Add instruction for making a tukutuku panel|Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book}}

Tukutuku panels are a traditional Māori art form. They are decorative wall panels that were once part of the traditional wall construction used inside meeting houses. Originally tukutuku were made by creating a latticework of vertically and horizontally placed dried stalks of kākaho, the creamy-gold flower stalks of toetoe grass, and kākaka, long straight fern stalks, or wooden laths of rimu or tōtara, called variously kaho tara, kaho tarai or arapaki.

These panels were lashed or stitched together. This was done by people working in pairs from either side, using the rich yellow strands of pīngao, white bleached or black-dyed kiekie, and sometimes harakeke, to create a range of intricate and artistic patterns. Stitches were combined to form a variety of patterns. Groups of single stitches created patterns such as tapuae kautuku, waewae pakura, whakarua kopito and papakirango. Some of the traditional cross stitched patterns are poutama, waharua, purapura whetu or mangaroa, kaokao, pātikitiki, roimata toroa and niho taniwha. In some situations, a central vertical stake, tumatahuki, was lashed to the panel to aid its strength and stability.

This method of construction created a warm, insulating type of decorative wallboard. Later, painted wooden slats or half-rounds were used for the horizontal element. Today, however, such dry flammable wallboards would fail to meet modern building regulations, and they are no longer used in construction. When used nowadays, tukutuku panels are created for their aesthetic appeal and attached to structurally approved building materials.

===Tipare===
A tipare is a headband woven from flax.  You can make one from paper if you do not have access to flax, or you could use any broad-leaved grass.  These instructions are adapted from those written by Catherine Brown in [http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao52TeA/c11.html an article written in 1965]. If using flax, run the length of the flax over the blade of a knife to soften it up.  To make a tipare from paper, start by cutting it into strips 1 cm wide.  You might want to practice on paper before trying this in flax, but that's up to you.  The tipare illustrated below was made in paper (with the edges marked) to make it easier to understand the photos.

{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|[[Image:Tipare_621.jpg|thumb|300px|left]] Mark a 60° angle on one strip, not in the center, but off to either side.  Fold the strip into a V along the 60° line with the left side over the right.  This angle is critical, so make it as close to 60° as you can.  Place a second strip in the bottom of the V as shown, but do not center it in the notch of the V.  If you make the V fold in the center or center the second strip on the notch, the two ends of the strip will run out at the same time and you will have two splices in the same vicinity.  Offsetting them from the center avoids this problem.
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|[[Image:Tipare_622.jpg|thumb|300px|left]] Fold the right side of the horizontal strip behind the right leg of the V so that it lies parallel to the left leg of the V.  If the 60° angle was folded properly, the second strip should fall right into place.  If it does not, check the angle of that first fold again.  
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|
[[Image:Tipare_623.jpg|thumb|300px|left]][[Image:Tipare_624.jpg|thumb|300px|right]] 
Fold the other horizontal strip over the left leg of the V so that it runs along and parallel to the right leg of the V.  Tuck it beneath the second strip it crosses.  You should end up with a double-V, consisting of two outer legs and two inner.  The rest of the weaving process will always begin with one of the outer legs.  Choosing which is perhaps the most difficult part of making a tipare, but for now, choose the one on the right and fold it behind the V as shown on the right.  Make sure that it goes behind two strips and over the third.
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
| 
[[Image:Tipare_625.jpg|thumb|300px|left]] Now take that same strip and fold it around the back of the strip it was just tucked in front of.  Weave it in front of the adjacent strip.
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|
[[Image:Tipare_626.jpg|thumb|300px|left]] Fold the strip farthest to the left behind the tipare, and weave it in front of the strip farthest to the right.
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|
[[Image:Tipare_627.jpg|thumb|300px|left]] Fold that same strip behind the right-most strip and weave it in front of the next.  The next step is to take one of the outer strips and fold it into a horizontal position, but which strip?  As you make a tipare, this will be the question that vexes you after every fold, and if you get it wrong, the tipare will come out wrong as well.  Look at the photo to the left.  If you fold the strip on the left, you will continue the edge made along the left side.  If you fold the strip on the right, you will form a point on the right side.  Always choose the strip that will form a point.
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|
[[Image:Tipare_628.jpg|thumb|300px|left]][[Image:Tipare_629.jpg|thumb|300px|right]] There &amp;mdash; we have chosen the strip that will form a point and have folded it horizontally.  It was woven over the front of the outer strip on the other side and then folded around it and woven again.
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|
[[Image:Tipare_631.jpg|thumb|300px|left]] But now we've run out of strip.  Cut the strip along the edge of the tipare, and cut the tip of a new strip off at the same angle.  The ends of these two strips are positioned next to the pieces from which they were cut.  Discard them.
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|
[[Image:Tipare_632.jpg|thumb|300px|left]] Now tuck the new strip into the weave, pushing it in until it stops.  You should be able to push it in pretty far.  There is no need for glue or any other sort of adhesive.  The weave itself will hold the strip in place.  Continue weaving until you have a long enough piece of tipare to wrap around the head of the intended tipare wearer.
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|
[[Image:Tipare_633.jpg|thumb|300px|left]][[Image:Tipare_634.jpg|thumb|300px|right]]Bend the tipare around forming a loop.  Line up the beginning of the tipare with the points on the unwoven end (photo on the left).  Fold the next strip on the unwoven end around the beginning, cut it to length, and tuck it into the weave (photo on the right).  
|}
{|border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
|-
|
[[Image:Tipare_636.jpg|thumb|300px|left]][[Image:Tipare_641.jpg|thumb|300px|right]] Continue weaving the loose ends into the tipare, cutting them off at the proper length and tucking them into the weave.  When the last strip is woven into place, the tipare is finished.  Crown the recipient.

====Preparations==== 

;Harvesting:
Flax should be cut in a certain way. Traditional weavers were conservationists &amp;mdash; they looked after the flax plant from its growth, after harvesting, and through the whole process of usage. Māori treasure the flax plant, presumably because it was a major resource for them for many things. Never cut the center (baby blade), nor the two on either side - (mother and father). Cutting these blades will kill the plant.  Return all unused flax (harekeke) and wastage to the plant cut up as mulch. Don't harvest in the rain or the flax will shrink too much after use.  When cutting the flax make sure you cut on an angle. This is to make sure that rain and debris does not settle in the roots and spoil the plant.  Keep the flax usable for a few days by placing ends in a bucket of water as soon as you return home. Keep it out of the direct sun.  To keep it longer boil it as described in the ''Dying Flax'' section below.

;Tools:
A steel bar or using the back or blunt side of a butter knife is used to soften the strips. Traditionally a mussel shell was used.  The shell or blunt edge is pulled along the dull side of the flax blade and this also helps release the moisture content. Flax woven articles do shrink to a beautiful golden colour as they dry.  Flax is used green or is softened by boiling as described below. Using boiled flax reduces the shrinkage in the finished article.  
 

;Dying Flax: 
Bring a pot of water to a boil, and add your flax, prepared as above in the ''Tools'' section.  Boil the flax for 5 minutes and then dry it.  This can be kept for later use or dyed whenever you are ready.  Fill a sink or bucket with warm water and put the boiled, dry flax in the water to soften it.  You can now weave with it or dye it.  Use a large pot and fill two thirds with water and then add the dye to the boiling water. The amount used is up to the weaver.  Return it to a boil.  Finally, place your softened flax into the dye - use rubber gloves.  Once the right colour is obtained, add a good handful of salt.  This will set the dye or ''fix'' it to the flax fibres.  Allow the dyed flax to dry, but not in the direct sun.  Once it is dry you can then go through the process to soften it and weave it.  If you use it straight after dying you will need to wear disposable gloves unless you want your hands to be dyed as well. But once it has dryed it will set the dye.  Some people use vinegar to fix the dye.  For the dye itself you can use cordial drink concentrates (Thriftee and Koolaid are brands available in New Zealand and they  don't need a fixer as the citric acid in the drink concentrate and set the dye).  You can mix these colours to get the one you want.

==7. Know how to correctly: ==
===a. Greet people in Māori ===
In the Māori language, speakers distinguish correct use of the number of people referred to in all aspects of the language. For example, everyday greetings take different forms depending on the number of people greeted:

* Tēnā koe: hello (to one person)
* Tēnā kōrua: hello (to two people)
* Tēnā koutou: hello (to more than two people

===b. Hongi ===

A '''Hongi''' is a traditional  Māori greeting in New Zealand. It is done by pressing one's nose to another person at an encounter. 

It is still used at traditional meetings among members of the Māori people and on major ceremonies.

In the hongi, the ha or breath of life is exchanged and intermingled.

Through the exchange of this physical greeting, you are no longer considered manuhiri (visitor) but rather tangata whenua, one of the people of the land. For the remainder of your stay you are obliged to share in all the duties and responsibilities of the home people. In earlier times, this may have meant bearing arms in times of war, or tending crops of kumara (sweet potato).

When Māori greet one another by pressing noses, the tradition of sharing the breath of life is considered to have come directly from the gods.

In Māori folklore, woman was created by the god Tane moulding her shape out of the earth. Then Tane (meaning male) embraced the figure and breathed into her nostrils. She then sneezed and came to life. Her name was Hineahuone (earth formed woman).  Tane later had a child with her and when she found out he was her father she fled to the underworld where she was believed to look after the spirits of the dead.

==8. a. What are five different pastimes enjoyed by Māori children in former times?==

===Māori Stick Game===
In the Māori stick game, the participants sit in a circle and each person holds two sticks.  Music begins, and the sticks are then rhythmically rapped on the floor or tapped together in beat with the music.  See http://www.uen.org/Lessonplan/preview.cgi?LPid=13919 for more details.

===Poi===
[[File:Feuerpois02.JPG|thumb|200px|Fire poi in action (long exposure)]]
Poi is a form of juggling or object manipulation employing a ball suspended from a length of rope which is held in hand and swung in circular patterns, comparable to club-twirling. Poi spinning originated with the Māori people of New Zealand (the word poi means &quot;ball&quot; in Māori) as a means of promoting increased flexibility, strength, and coordination -in particular, the dexterity of the wrist- and as an exercise of movements central to the use of hand weapons, including the patu, mere, and kotiate.

Some popular poi tricks include: reels, weaves, fountains, crossers, windmills, butterflies, stalls, and wraps.  Split time and split direction moves are possible, and some of the more difficult moves require a considerable amount of manual dexterity, coordination and forearm strength to accomplish.

There are several basic classes of trick. The two poi are usually spun in parallel planes, and can be spun in the same direction (weaves) or opposite directions (butterflies). Moves such as stalls and wraps can change direction of one (or both poi) to change between these two classes.

===Flying Kites===
Māori people were experts a building and flying kites.  Kites were made from the flower stalks of toetoe grass (''Cortaderia fulvida'') and decorated with shells (such as the abalone), feathers, and foliage.  Some kites were big enough to carry a person, and these were sometimes used to lift warriors over the walls of enemy defences.

===Puppetry===
The Māori made Karetao (puppets) to use in story-telling.  The Karetao were carved figures featuring a handle at the bottom (and held by one hand) and movable arms attached to strings (operated by the other hand).

===Other Games===
Other games include
*Spinning Tops
*Wrestling
*Throwing Darts
*Memorization Games

==8. b. Learn how to do three string figures and walk on stilts.==
===String Figures===
String figures are designs made on the hands and fingers using a piece of string tied into a circle.  In the west, an example of this would be the ''cat in the cradle''.

For instruction on making several Māori string figures, see 
http://www.tki.org.nz/r/hpe/exploring_te_ao_kori/stringgames/index_e.php

===Stilts===
[[Image:WSJ2007 TerraVille Stilts.JPG|thumb|300px]]
Stilts are long poles with foot pegs mounted to them.  The stilt-walker stands on the pegs, and the poles extend upwards past the shoulders.  The walker wraps his arms around the poles and as he lifts his left foot, uses his left hand to lift the pole.  The foot pegs are often movable, and it is best to learn to walk with stilts with the pegs set low to the ground.  As the Pathfinder develops skill, the foot pegs can be raised.

==9. Visit an old pa site in your locality and make a brief written report on what you could see.==
The word '''pā''' (pronounced pah) refers to a Māori village, generally one from the 19th century or earlier that was fortified for defence. In Māori society, a great pā represented the mana of a tribal group, as personified by a chief or rangatira. 

Nearly all pā were built in defensible locations to protect dwelling sites or gardens, almost always on prominent, raised ground which was then terraced; as for example in the Auckland region, where dormant volcanic cones were used. While built for defence, many were also primarily residential, and often quite extensive.

Māori pā played a significant role in the New Zealand Land Wars, though they are known from earlier periods of Māori history. They were mostly absent, however, until around 500 years ago, suggesting scarcity of resources through environmental damage and population pressure began to bring about warfare, leading to a period of pā building.

===Fortification===
[[Image:Mt Eden terraces.JPG|thumb|right|Terraces on Mt Eden, Auckland, marking the sites of the defensive pallisades and ditches of this former pā.]]

Their main defence was the use of earth ramparts (or terraced hillsides), topped with stakes or wicker barriers. The historically later versions were constructed by people who were fighting with muskets and hand weapons (such as spear, taiaha and mere) against the British Army and armed constabulary, who were armed with swords, rifles, and heavy weapons such as howitzers and rocket artillery.

Pā were often put in place in very limited time scales, sometimes less than two days, and resisted attack for many hours and, sometimes, weeks. Military historians like John Keegan have noted that Māori recognition of the strong resistance of earth fortifications against modern weapons (especially artillery) predates the successful defensive use of trenches and sloped earth ramparts in World War I by many decades.

Warrior chiefs like Te Ruki Kawiti realised these properties as a good counter to the greater firepower of the British.  With that in mind, they sometimes built pā purposefully to resist the British Empire's forces, like at Ruapekapeka, which was constructed specifically to draw the enemy, instead of protecting a specific site or place of habitation like more traditional pās. At the Battle of Ruapekapeka, the British suffered 45 casualties, against only 30 amongst the Māori. Afterwards, British engineers twice surveyed the fortifications, produced a scale model and tabled the plans in the House of Commons.

The fortifications of such a purpose-built pa included palisades of puriri trunks and split timber, with bundles of protective flax padding, the two lines of palisade covering a firing trench with individual pits, while more defenders could use the second palisade to fire over the heads of the first below. Simple communication trenches or tunnels were also built to connect the various parts, as found at Ohaeawai Pā or Ruapekapeka. The forts could even include underground bunkers, protected by a thick layer of earth over wooden beams, which sheltered the inhabitants during periods of heavy shelling by artillery.

A limiting factor of the Māori fortifications that were not built as set pieces, however, was the need for the people inhabiting them to leave frequently to cultivate areas for food, or to gather it from the wilderness. Consequently, pā would often be abandoned for 4 to 6 months of each year.

===Examples===
The old pā remains found on One Tree Hill, New Zealand, close to the center of Auckland, represent one of the largest known sites as well as one of the largest pre-historic earthworks fortifications known worldwide.

      <comment>/* the formula, the equation?! */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">All,

I want to address some questions from where this was originally posted under wikipeida and moved here.

When I started this article, it was mainly for the basics of transformer design. It has been modified somewhat by several, especially mentioning the use of CAD software. In reality, the large transformer manufacturers use this method as they weigh cost and service life to get the most for their buck. Smaller companies who manufacture transformers under 10 kVA rely on the old design methods. In actuality, the CAD programs still use Maxwell's equations in their core, and so is the basis for every design. No matter the type of core in a transformer, these equations are still used today, and are in the most recent books published on the matter. This can be seen by the works of Colonel William T. McLyman who designs transformers for NASA, and he has written several books, along with some software on the subject. As regards for the references in the article, and their dates, they have all be carried over into the newest reprints of the books. Some new technology has been added, mainly in the alloy's used in the cores, and insulation used in the windings.

As far as other core types, there is already a page in wikipedia for them, if I recall, and was the main reason I never included them. At this though, toroids, Kuhlman Electric type folded cores, and G.E. type spiral cores are calculated the same as a standard EI core or C-Core.

RF transformers that use Ferrite are essentially matching transformers, and are the same as audio transformers. The core material is different between the two because of the frequency they are ran at. These were not added either as if I recall, there was a wikipedia article about them somewhere else. These would be under impedance matching transformers.

Someone mentioned something about switching transformers. They can run on square waves or modified square waves, etc. The formula is adjusted in square wave usage, and the multiplier is changed from 4.44 to 4.0, and is addressed in the article. This, and the core using different alloy's with thinner strips, is the only difference to standard EI core transformers running at 50-60 Hz., and is due to the higher frequency they are ran at. Therefore, these are designed the same as a standard transformer.

I stopped writing the article in 2006, and was hoping for others to add to it. Maybe someone could add something about how toroidal transformers are wound, as the machinery is totally different than a simple lathe that is used in EI and C-Core core transformers.

Last, please reference wikipedia with a search for transformer types, and transformer cores.

== Modeling Software ==

Today, I edited the first paragraph about using modeling software. The way the paragraph read, it dismissed the importance of the calculations and equations; the same ones that are written into the softwares code. The paragraph made it seem that using software was the only way to design large transformers or mass produced ones which is simply not the case.

Computer modeling may be fine for larger companies, but smaller manufacturers do not use it, mainly due to its cost, and they use either simpler design software that is indeed on the market, or do it by hand on paper.

== Edit &amp; Cleanup ==

I cleaned up some text, and corrected some minor things, along with adding several pics to the page.[[User:Craxd1|Craxd1]] ([[User talk:Craxd1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Craxd1|contribs]]) 19:08, 3 February 2013 (UTC)

I added some photos today, along with cleaning up the opening text.[[User:Craxd1|Craxd1]] ([[User talk:Craxd1|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Craxd1|contribs]]) 00:15, 19 February 2013 (UTC)

== What is the window area ==

This page uses the term window area many times but doesn't seem to define what it means. [[w:user:plugwash]]

The window area is simply the window width times its height. There are two windows on a transformer using EI laminations, on either side of the core. I will add this to the content.

[[w:user:craxd]]

== Window Area ==

I added the description of the window area measurement to both the section about the coil calculation, and the formula section under the WA product.

== Adrignola, checking the book. ==

Adrignola,

Thanks for helping with this.

I noticed, too, that someone had added a long list of things on how 'they' constructed their transformers, and made it sound like a sales promotion, although they didn't list who did it this way. Here, I finally deleted this, as it was practically unreadable. I didn't know whether you saw this or not, but it was taken out by me.

Really, I haven't found the time to work on this in a while, and just happened to drop by to see that it had been cleaned up a bit.

== source for BH curves  ==

hi, i'm looking for more data like this http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/B-H_Curve.jpg, particularly for NOES (CRNO) steels, their B-H curves and core loss curves.  Can't seem to find any on the internet that fall into that category (like M22, M15).

== the formula, the equation?! ==

Section &quot;Power transformer design&quot; constantly refers to &quot;the formula&quot; and &quot;the equation&quot; without linking which equation. This is a mess as it is hard to know which design equations the article is talking about without having some initial knowledge about the governing equations for transformers. In most scientific writing it is common place to number the equations, which I presume are derived in the section &quot;Equations&quot;, and reference those numbers when talking about specific equations.</text>

=== Hesitation noises ===
Hesitation noises, or vocal pauses, are the &quot;uh&quot; and &quot;um&quot; of a language, filler sounds we produce when we pause to think while speaking.    Using the correct hesitation noises can make the difference between natural sounding Japanese, and awkward foreign sounding speech.

They are:
* あのう - Usually when you are about to say something.
* ええと - When you are just thinking.
* まぁ　 - &quot;Well...&quot; used for considering, reconsidering, etc...
* さぁ　 - Another thinking sound) Used for when you're not sure of the information.
* 何だっけ (なんだっけ) - &quot;What's it called...&quot; used when trying to remember something specific.
* そうですね - Acknowledges what was previously said.  More of a staller than a hesitation noise.  Somewhat more formal. Also used to show you care what the speaker is saying.

== Beginner Words ==

It's a small point, maybe, but there appears to be a nascent discrepancy between here and there as to whether apophony and reduplication are kinds of affixation.  In the [[Conlang/Beginner/Words#Morphology|Beginner treatment of derivational morphology]], they are.  That happened because I was trying to minimize technical terminology as much as possible there (having declared that as a Beginner goal), but I wanted to provide some interesting suggestions to get the reader's imagination working on kinds of stuff they could do.  So I justified putting all the examples under the aegis of &quot;affixes&quot; by drawing on [[w:Affix#Positional categories of affixes|this table from Wikipedia]].  Of course none of the terms '''apophony''', '''simulfix''', '''duplifix''' should occur in the Beginner section &amp;mdash; I believe I introduced '''affix''' only as the price for eliminating '''morpheme''' &amp;mdash; but eventually, something somewhere should probably be tweaked for greater consistency between the two.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:39, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

:I've made some changes with respect to this. What do you think? [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] ([[User talk:Ingolemo|talk]]) 12:15, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

I really didn't add any information, someone just had the definition for syndrome underneath your segment, and I thought it would work better if they were integrated. I am glad it worked though!</text>

You can continue to work on your book and not have it get indexed by search engines by adding &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:33, 30 July 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Intro=
&quot; The dynamics of [[Fractals/Multibrot_sets|polynomials]] is much better understood than the dynamics of general rational maps&quot; due to the Bottcher’s theorem&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7934 ON THE NOTIONS OF MATING by CARSTEN LUNDE PETERSEN AND DANIEL MEYER]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Superattracting fixed points==

For [[w:complex quadratic polynomial|complex quadratic polynomial]] there are many [[w:Periodic_point|superattracting fixed point]] ( with [[w:Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings|multiplier]] = 0 ):
* infinity ( It is always is superattracting fixed point for polynomials )
* &lt;math&gt;z_s = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;  is finite superattracting fixed point for map &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;z_s = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_s = -1 \,&lt;/math&gt; are two finite superattracting fixed points for map &lt;math&gt;f_{-1}\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Description==
Near&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Neighbourhood (mathematics)|Neighbourhood in wikipedia ]]&lt;/ref&gt; super attracting fixed point (for example infinity)  the behaviour of discrete dynamical system :

&lt;math&gt;z_{n+1} = f_c(z_n) = z_n^2 + c  \,&lt;/math&gt;

based on [[w:complex quadratic polynomial|complex quadratic polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;f_c(z) = z^2 + c\,&lt;/math&gt; is similar to 

&lt;math&gt;w_{n+1} = f_0(w_n) = w_n^2  \,&lt;/math&gt;

based on &lt;math&gt;f_0(w) = w^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

It can be treated as one dynamical system viewed in two coordinate systems : 
* easy  ( w )
* hard to analyse( z )
&lt;ref&gt;[http://keithbriggs.info/documents/Szekeres_seminar_QMUL_2006jan10.pdf  The work of George Szekeres on functional equations by Keith Briggs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words map  &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; is conjugate &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Topological conjugacy|Topological conjugacy in wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; to map &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt; near infinity. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndynamics.com/indexp.html How to draw external rays by Wolf Jung]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1904 LE Boettcher  solved Schröder equation&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Schröder equation|Schröder equation in wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2747 Lucjan Emil Böttcher and his mathematical legacy by  Stanislaw Domoradzki, Malgorzata Stawiska]&lt;/ref&gt; in case of supperattracting fixed point&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Boettcher, The principal laws of convergence of iterates and their aplication to analysis (Russian), Izv. Kazan. fiz.-Mat. Obshch. 14) (1904), 155-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
* &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt; is Boettcher coordinate
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi_c \,&lt;/math&gt; is Boettcher function
* Boettcher Functional Equation  &lt;ref&gt;[http://math.eretrandre.org/hyperops_wiki/index.php?title=B%C3%B6ttcher_equation Böttcher equation at Hyperoperations Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Böttcher's equation|wikipedia  : Böttcher's equation]]&lt;/ref&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_c(f_c(z)) = \Phi_c(z)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where :

:&lt;math&gt;w = \Phi_c(z)\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[w:Interior (topology)|Exterior]] or [[w:Complement (set theory)|complement]] of [[w:Filled Julia set|filled-in Julia]] set is :
* a [[w:Basin_of_attraction|basin of attraction]] of [[w:Point at infinity|infinity]] ( superattracting fixed point) 
* one of [[w:Classification_of_Fatou_components|components of the Fatou set]]

&lt;math&gt;A_{f_c}(\infty) = K(f_c)^C = F_\infty&lt;/math&gt;

It can be analysed using 
* escape time (simple but gives only radial values = escape time ) LSM/J, 
* distance estimation ( more advanced, continuus,  but gives only radial values = distance ) DEM/J
* Boettcher coordinate or complex potential ( the best , gives  :
** radial values ( real potential ) LogPhi = CPM/J
** angular values ( external angle ) ArgPhi

So both values can be used to [[Color_Theory/Color_gradient#2D|color with 2D gradient]]. 


First compute [[Fractals/Iterations in the complex plane/boettcher|Boettcher coordinate]] &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt; using this formula &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndynamics.com/indexp.html How to draw external rays by Wolf Jung]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w = \Phi_c(z) = z* \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{f_c^n(z)}{f_c^n(z)-c}\right )^{1/2^n}\,&lt;/math&gt;

It looks &quot;simple&quot;, but square root of complex nuber gives two values so one have to choose one value.

Note that potential inside Kc is zero so :

'''Pseudocode version''' : 

 if (LastIteration==IterationMax)
  then potential=0    /* inside  Filled-in Julia set */
  else potential= GiveLogPhi(z0,c,ER,nMax); /* outside */

It also removes potential error for log(0).

'''Computing external angle '''

External angle (argument) is argument of Boettcher coordinate &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;arg_c(z) = arg(w) = arg(\Phi_c(z)) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Because Boettcher coordinate is a product of [[w:complex number|complex numbers]] so [[w:Arg_(mathematics)#Identities|argument of product]] is : 


&lt;math&gt;arg_c(z) = arg(z) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2^n}*arg \left( \frac{f_c^n(z)}{f_c^n(z)-c}     \right ) \right )  \,&lt;/math&gt;

This method has been used by several people and proved by Thierry Bousch. &lt;ref&gt;[http://topo.math.u-psud.fr/~bousch/preprints/rayext.pdf Thierry Bousch : De combien tournent les rayons externes? Manuscrit non publié, 1995 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Code in c++  by Wolf Jung can be found in procedure QmnPlane::backray() in file qmnplane.cpp  ( see source code of program mandel  version 5.3 ). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndynamics.com/indexp.html Program Mandel by Wolf Jung]&lt;/ref&gt;


* Ray for periodic angle ( simplest case )

It will be explained by an example :

First choose external angle &lt;math&gt;t \,&lt;/math&gt; (in turns). External angle for periodic ray is a rational number.

:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{1}{3}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Compute period of external angle under [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Doubling_map|doubling map]].

Because &quot;1/3 doubled gives 2/3 and 2/3 doubled gives 4/3, which is congruent to 1/3&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Explanation by Wolf Jung&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;1 \equiv 2 \pmod 3.\,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \equiv \frac{1}{3} \pmod 1.\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[w:Modular arithmetic|Modular arithmetic in wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

so external angle &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{1}{3}\,&lt;/math&gt; has period 2 under doubling map.

Start with 2 points near infinity (in conjugate plane):

on ray 1/3  is a point &lt;math&gt;w = R*e^{2\pi i/3}\,&lt;/math&gt; 

on ray 2/3  is a point &lt;math&gt;w = R*e^{4 \pi i /3}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Near infinity  &lt;math&gt;z = w \,&lt;/math&gt; so one can swith to dynamical plane ( Boettcher conjugation )

[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/q-iterations|Backward iteration]] (with proper chose from two possibilities)&lt;ref&gt;Square root of complex number gives 2 values so one has to choose only one. For details see [http://www.mndynamics.com/indexp.html Wolf Jung page]&lt;/ref&gt; of point on ray 1/3 goes to ray 2/3, back to 1/3 and so on. 

In C it is : 
 /* choose one of 2 roots: zNm1 or -zNm1  where zN = sqrt(zN - c )  */
 if (creal(zNm1)*creal(zN) + cimag(zNm1)*cimag(zN) &lt;= 0) zNm1=-zNm1;

or in [[Maxima|Maxima CAS]] :

 if (z1m1.z01&gt;0) then z11:z1m1 else z11:-z1m1;


One has to divide set of points into 2 subsets ( 2 rays).
Draw one of these 2 sets  and join the points. It will be an approximation of ray.

*Ray for preperiodic angle ( to do )

====Drawing [[w:external ray|dynamic external ray]] using inverse Boettcher map by Curtis McMullen ====
[[File:JuliaRay3.png|thumb|right|Julia set with external rays using McMullen method]]

This method is based on C program by Curtis McMullen&lt;ref&gt;[http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/programs.html c program by Curtis McMullen (quad.c in Julia.tar.gz)]&lt;/ref&gt; and its Pascal version by Matjaz Erat&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~erat/mj/ Quadratische Polynome  by Matjaz Erat]&lt;/ref&gt;

It consist of 3 big steps :

* compute some w-points of external ray of circle for angle &lt;math&gt;\theta  \,&lt;/math&gt; and various radii (rasterisation)
:&lt;math&gt;w_0 = R * e^{2\pi i t} \,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;1 &lt; R &lt; \infty \,&lt;/math&gt;
* map w-points to z-point using inverse Boettcher map &lt;math&gt;\Psi_c = \Phi_{c}^{-1} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_0 = \Psi_c (w_0) = f_c^{-n}(w_0^{2^n}) \,&lt;/math&gt;
* draw z-points ( and connect them using lines )


First and last steps are easy, but second is not so needs more explanation.
=====[[w:Rasterisation|Rasterisation]]=====
For given external ray in &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt; [[w:Complex_quadratic_polynomial#Planes|plane]] each point of ray has :
* constant value &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; ( external angle in turns )
* variable radius &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt; points of  ray  are parametrised by radius &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt;
and can be computed using [[w:Complex_number#Notation_of_the_polar_form|exponential form of complex numbers]] : 

:&lt;math&gt;w = F_t(R) = R * e^{2*\Pi*i*t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

One can go along ray using '''linear scale''' :
 t:1/3; /* example value */
 R_Max:4;
 R_Min:1.1;
 for R:R_Max step -0.5 thru R_Min do w:R*exp(2*%pi*%i*t);
 /* Maxima allows non-integer values in for statement */ 

It gives some w points with equal distance between them.
 

Another method is to use '''nonlinera scale'''.
 
To do it we introduce floating point [[w:exponent|exponent]] &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; such that :

: &lt;math&gt;R = 2^r\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;w = G_t(r) = 2^r * e^{2*\Pi*i*t}\,&lt;/math&gt;
To compute some w points of external ray in &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt; plane for angle &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; use
such Maxima code :

 t:1/3; /* external angle in turns */
 /* range for computing  R ; as r tends to 0 R tends to 1 */
 rMax:2; /* so Rmax=2^2=4 /
 rMin:0.1; /* rMin &gt; 0   */
 caution:0.93; /* positive number &lt; 1 ; r:r*caution  gives smaller r */
 r:rMax;
 unless r&lt;rMin do
 ( 
  r:r*caution, /* new smaller r */ 
  R:2^r, /* new smaller R */
  w:R*exp(2*%pi*%i*t) /* new point w in f0 plane */
 );

In this method distance between points is not equal but [[w:inversely proportional|inversely proportional]] to distance to boundary of filled Julia set. 

It is good because here ray has greater [[w:curvature|curvature]] so curve will be more smooth.

=====Mapping=====
Mapping points from [[w:Complex_quadratic_polynomial#Planes|&lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt;-plane]] to [[w:Complex_quadratic_polynomial#Planes|&lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt;-plane]]  consist of 4 minor steps :
* forward iteration in &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt; plane 
:&lt;math&gt;w_n = w_0^{2^n} = R^{2^n}*e^{2\pi i 2^n t}\,&lt;/math&gt;

until &lt;math&gt;w_n\,&lt;/math&gt; is near infinity 
: &lt;math&gt;abs(w_n) &gt; R_{limit} \,&lt;/math&gt;

* switching plane ( from &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;z_n =w_n \,&lt;/math&gt;

( because here, near infinity : &lt;math&gt;w = z \,&lt;/math&gt;)
*backward iteration in &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; plane the same ( &lt;math&gt;n \,&lt;/math&gt;) number of iterations
*last point &lt;math&gt; z_0 \,&lt;/math&gt; is on our external ray


1,2 and 4 minor steps are easy. Third is not.
:&lt;math&gt;z_{n-1} = f_c^{-1} (z_n) = \sqrt{z_n - c}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Backward iteration uses square root of complex number. It is 2-valued functions so backward 
iteration gives binary tree. 

One can't choose good path in such tree without extre informations. To solve it we will use 2 things :
*[[w:Equicontinuity|equicontinuity]] of basin of attraction of infinity 
*conjugacy between &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; planes

=====Equicontinuity of basin of attraction of infinity=====
Basin of attraction of infinity ( complement of filled-in Julia set) contains all points which tends to infinity under forward iteration. 

&lt;math&gt;A_{f_c}(\infty) \  \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \  \{ z \in  \mathbb{C}  : f^{(k)} _c (z)  \to  \infty\  as\  k \to \infty \}. &lt;/math&gt;

Infinity is superattracting fixed point and orbits of all points have similar behaviour. 
In other words orbits of 2 points are assumed to stay close if they are close at the beginning. 

It is equicontinuity ( compare with normality).

In &lt;math&gt;f_c\,&lt;/math&gt; plane one can use forward orbit of previous point of ray for computing backward orbit of next point.

=====Detailed version of algorithm =====
* compute first point of ray (start near infinity ang go toward Julia set )
:&lt;math&gt;w = 2^r * e^{2\Pi i t}\,&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;r = r_{max}\,&lt;/math&gt;
here one can easily switch planes :
:&lt;math&gt;z = w\,&lt;/math&gt;
It is our first z-point of ray.
* compute next z-point of ray
**compute next w-point of ray for &lt;math&gt;r = r * caution \,&lt;/math&gt;
**compute forward iteration of 2 points : previous z-point and actual w-point. Save z-orbit and last w-point
**switch planes and use last w-point as a starting point :&lt;math&gt;z_n = w_{last}\,&lt;/math&gt;
**backward iteration of new &lt;math&gt;z_n\,&lt;/math&gt; toward new &lt;math&gt;z_0\,&lt;/math&gt; using forward orbit of previous z point
**&lt;math&gt;z_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is our next z point of our ray
* and so on ( next points )  until &lt;math&gt; r &lt; r_{Min}\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Separation of the book ==

I have separated the book &quot;English for B2 Students&quot; from the bundle of books and pages that is currently linked to from &quot;[[English]]&quot;. This book seems to have started as a separate one, and still has a unity of style and purpose that marks it off from the rest of the material linked to from [[English]]. The title &quot;English&quot; of [[English]] suggests, beacuse of its too broad a coverage, a name for a bookshelf; there should probably be no wikibook titled &quot;English&quot;. Another wikibook on English already so separated is [[English as an Additional Language]].

Whether the various books on English should be merged or mutually enriched is another question. A merger however cannot proceed by plainly collecting several books under the head of &quot;English&quot;.  --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:20, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

:I separated the books and I also created this book.  The idea was for a central 'book' called English to provide an easy link to books related to that topic.  You say there &quot;shouldn't&quot; be no book called 'English' but why exactly?  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:29, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

:: There is no reason why there mustn't be an 'English' book, but there needn't be one either. The subject pages now have the purpose which you intended for it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:22, 27 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two basic forms of English as an additional language: English to use in an English-speaking region (e.g. by refugees and immigrants) and English to use in a non-English-speaking region (e.g. by international business people). 

This textbook offers resources for English teachers working in both contexts. When appropriate we will mark information that is specific to one discipline or the other. Included are language reference information, teaching techniques and tips, historical information about the English language, and activities to be used in your classes.

=== Terminology ===
English as a Foreign Language (EFL) refers to English for use in the second of these situations, in a non-English-speaking region. Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) is a common abbreviation for the teaching aspect (education, career and methods).

In North America, in the first situation, English for use in an English-speaking region, is known as English as a Second Language (ESL). In Britain this is called English for Speaker of Other Languages (ESOL) in recognition of the fact that many of the learners already speak more than one language. Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) is a common abbreviation for the teaching aspect.

==Title==
I have moved this material to &quot;IFTC Jump into English Textbook - Teacher's Manual&quot;. It was called &quot;IFTC Jump into English Textbook (Teacher's Manual)&quot; some time ago before it was moved to &quot;ESL/EFL Lesson Plans/IFTC Jump into English Textbook (Teacher's Manual)&quot;. From what I have understood from the Wikibooks policy, the titles of books should not use the larger subject in their title. Thus, if the title of the book is BT, and the larger subject is LS, the title of the book should be &quot;BT&quot; and not &quot;LS/BT&quot;. If the first chapter is titled &quot;CH1&quot;, its title in the Wikibooks should be &quot;BT/CH1&quot;. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 12:26, 8 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

Hey if you are interested in [[ethnomedicine]], there is a really messy book on that topic that I had students create a few years ago and any changes you would like to make to it would be welcome. [[User:YakbutterT|YakbutterT]] ([[User talk:YakbutterT|talk]]) 12:34, 29 September 2009 (UTC)

== German wikibook ==

Hi there and good luck with the German wikibook. :)

Well, part of the problem is that at some point a couple of years ago, it was in quite good shape (apart from missing audio recordings and missing collapsible boxes which were all implemented by hyperlinks). Then some people had some ideas, moved pages around, messed things up, others contributed without really understanding the ideas, and of course nothing got finished. Thus, when I started to look at it last year, most of the content wasn't even accessible from the table of contents. What motivated me to work on the German book was a) that no one else worked on it and b) that there were quite a few audio recordings (which are really useful in my opinion; the lack of them is a major reason why so many language learning wikibooks are close to useless). Of course, I also didn't have enough time but at least all the content is now available again, the first few lessons include the audio recordings, more or less complete vocabulary lists and collapsible boxes for the problems and tests. These first lessons might give you an idea of how the rest of the book (at least the rest of level I) could be formatted.

In my experience the best way to work on a wikibook is alone without having to discuss anything. Otherwise there are just too many endless discussions that paralyze the development of the book. (Remind me of that when I start such a discussion! ;) Thus, I consider the book yours, feel free to change anything. I'll be happy to correct typos and give advice on the German and might also be able to contribute some audio recordings (if I find the time to do them).

I'll comment on your comments on your user page. Let me know if I should comment here. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 11:12, 22 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

Hi Ricardoramalho

I saw your remarks about the Dutch book. Although I (as my alter ego Iarlagab) am the culprit of most of what you object against, I can understand you objections. What happened is that I decided to write the necessary grammar first and then to write parallel lessons that aim more at drills, exercises, fill in the blanks, memorization games, text-in-context etc. but I just never got around to writing it (Or was I hoping that another Dutchman would lend a hand?). Actually I mustly went bakc to the Dutch wiktionary because it was is the process of stalling. Now that that is buzzing with activity I might come back here and add some more stuff. For now I have made a few changes in the only parallel lesson (1A) and added another hover table. I plan to create some more audio files for the conversations and stories.

Hi R

As I was born in Rotterdam I am very prejudiced. A recommendation? OK, how about Groningen? (Lived there for a while). But I you ''must'' live in that overcrowded Randstad I'd say take one of the smaller places like Gouda or Delft. Or Brielle. (My sister lives there). Both R'dam and Den Haag are fine. It's just very hectic. Den Haag is where all the laws are made (A'dam where they are all broken. This is why we have two capitals.) So things are bit more snooty there. Rdam is pretty hardworking businesslike but culturally there is actually more going on there even than A'dam.

Regarding the book. I plan to put some pronunciation drills on it. Here is the first one. I would appreciate if you told me what you think about it.

==English grammars==

As much as I remember, the content of what is now English in Use, was previously here. And I think that it should be here even now. What concerns English grammars in general, then likely there should be grammars on different levels. What likely caused the most confusion, was that only one grammar, called the English Grammar, was created at first. My perhaps naive idea is that what is now English in Use, should be Comprehensive English Grammar (for highest level), and then there also should be Beginners English Grammar, and perhaps also Advanced English Grammar or something for intermediate (B) level. And there should be no other grammars. That the English grammar was called English in Use was wrong I think, it looks like an effort to change a grammar into a (C category) learning module. I think that especially the English course for B level is a great thing and was well done. But learning modules or courses should be separate from grammars, as their content is in principle different. Complete grammars should be additional reference material to learning modules, not parts of them. But there must be complete grammars. English in Use should be changed into a C level learning module, however this may look like, when there are people interested in such high level courses. Just my thoughts. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 17:14, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
: From what I can see, what is now &quot;[[English in Use]]&quot; was originally called &quot;English&quot;, not &quot;[[English Grammar]]&quot;. Judging from http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=English_in_Use&amp;action=history, there were the following renamings or moves of what is now [[English in Use]]:
:* &quot;English/English in use&quot; was moved to &quot;English in Use&quot;, on 8 March 2009, by Dan Polansky
:* &quot;English&quot; was moved to &quot;English/English in use&quot;, on 13 May 2007, by Xania
: For further detail, please consult the histories of the pages under discussion.

::Perhaps, sorry, then I didn't remember correctly. I don't remember where it started or who started it. But there is a kind of mess with grammars, there is English Grammar, English Grammar 2, English in Use, and one stub grammar for beginners. Some likely want to create some intermediate level grammar, but there is a mess with names, and also when a book is not called grammar, it is not very clear whether it is grammar. But whatever, I would eventually be satisfied with the things the way they are, when I don't edit that English in Use any more ;) [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 07:27, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Naming identifiers ====
C++'s restriction about the names of '''''[[w:identifiers|identifiers]]''''' and [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords|its '''''keywords''''']] have already been covered, on the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code|Code Section]]. They leave a lot of freedom in naming, one could use specific prefixes or suffixes, start names with an initial upper or lower case letter, keep all the letters in a single case or, with compound words, use a word separator character like &quot;_&quot; or flip the case of the first letter of each component word. 

{{NOTE|It is also important to remember to avoid collisions with the OS's APIs (depending on the portability requirements) or other standards. For instance POSIX's keywords terminate in &quot;_t&quot;.}}

===== Hungarian notation =====
Hungarian notation, now also referred to as Apps Hungarian, was invented by Charles Simonyi (a programmer who worked at Xerox PARC circa 1972-1981, and who later became Chief Architect at Microsoft); and has been until recently the preeminent naming convention used in most Microsoft code. It uses prefixes (like &quot;m_&quot; to indicate member variables and &quot;p&quot; to indicate pointers), while the rest of the identifier is normally written out using some form of mixed capitals. We mention this convention because you will very probably find it in use, even more probable if you do any programming in Windows, if you are interested on learning more you can check [[w:Hungarian notation|Wikipedia's entry on this notation]].

This notation is considered outdated, since it is highly prone to errors and requires some effort to maintain without any real benefit in today's IDEs. Today refactoring is an everyday task, the IDEs have evolved to provide help with identifier pop-ups and the use of color schemes. All these informational aids reduce the need for this notation.

===== Leading underscores =====
In most contexts, leading underscores are better avoided. They are reserved for the compiler or internal variables of a library, and can make your code less portable and more difficult to maintain. Those variables can also be stripped from a library (i.e. the variable is not accessible anymore, it is hidden from external world) so unless you want to override an internal variable of a library, do not do it.

===== Reusing existing names =====
Do not use the names of standard library functions and objects for your identifiers as these names are considered reserved words and programs may become difficult to understand when used in unexpected ways.

===== Sensible names =====
Always use good, unabbreviated, correctly-spelled meaningful names.

Prefer the English language (since C++ and most libraries already use English) and avoid short cryptic names. This will make it easier to read and to type a name without having to look it up.

{{NOTE|It is acceptable to ignore this rule for loop variables and variables used within a small scope (~20 lines), they may be given short names to save space if the purpose of that variable is obvious enough. Historically the most commonly used variable name in this cases is &quot;i&quot;.

&lt;small&gt;The &quot;i&quot; may derive from the word &quot;increment&quot; or &quot;index&quot;. The &quot;i&quot; is very commonly found in {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} loops that does fit nicely the specification for the use of such variable names.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;In early Fortran compilers (upto F77), variables beginning with the letters i through n implicitly represented integers - and by convention the first few (i, j, k) were often used as loop counters.&lt;/small&gt;}}

===== Names indicate purpose =====
An identifier should indicate the function of the variable/function/etc. that it represents, e.g. &lt;code&gt;foobar&lt;/code&gt; is probably not a good name for a variable storing the age of a person. 

Identifier names should also be descriptive. &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; might not be a good name for a global variable representing the number of employees. However, a good medium between long names and lots of typing has to be found. Therefore, this rule can be relaxed for variables that are used in a [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|small scope or context]]. Many programmers prefer short variables (such as i) as loop iterators.

===== Capitalization =====
Conventionally, variable names start with a lower case character. In identifiers which contain more than one natural language words, either underscores or capitalization is used to delimit the words, e.g. &lt;code&gt;num_chars&lt;/code&gt; (K&amp;R style) or &lt;code&gt;numChars&lt;/code&gt; (Java style). It is recommended that you pick one notation and do not mix them within one project.

===== Constants =====
When naming #defines, constant variables, {{C++ Programming/kw|enum}} constants. and macros put in all uppercase using '_' separators; this makes it very clear that the value is not alterable and in the case of macros, makes it clear that you are using a construct that requires care.

{{NOTE|There is a large school of thought that names LIKE_THIS should be used &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for macros, so that the name space used for macros (which do not respect C++ scopes) does not overlap with the name space used for other identifiers.  As is usual in C++ naming conventions, there is not a single universally agreed standard.  The most important thing is usually to be consistent.}}

===== Functions and member functions =====
The name given to functions and member functions should be descriptive and make it clear what it does. Since usually functions and member functions perform actions, the best name choices typically contain a mix of verbs and nouns in them such as CheckForErrors() instead of ErrorCheck() and dump_data_to_file() instead of data_file(). Clear and descriptive names for functions and member functions can sometimes make guessing correctly what functions and member functions do easier, aiding in making code more self documenting. By following this and other naming conventions programs can be read more naturally.

People seem to have very different intuitions when using names containing abbreviations. It is best to settle on one strategy so the names are absolutely predictable. Take for example NetworkABCKey. Notice how the C from ABC and K from key are confused. Some people do not mind this and others just hate it so you'll find different policies in different code so you never know what to call something.

Prefixes and suffixes are sometimes useful:
*'''Min'''   - to mean the minimum value something can have.
*'''Max'''   - to mean the maximum value something can have.
*'''Cnt'''   - the current count of something.
*'''Count''' - the current count of something.
*'''Num'''   - the current number of something.
*'''Key'''   - key value.
*'''Hash'''  - hash value.
*'''Size'''  - the current size of something.
*'''Len'''   - the current length of something.
*'''Pos'''   - the current position of something.
*'''Limit''' - the current limit of something.
*'''Is'''  - asking if something is true.
*'''Not''' - asking if something is not true.
*'''Has''' - asking if something has a specific value, attribute or property.
*'''Can''' - asking if something can be done.
*'''Get''' - get a value.
*'''Set''' - set a value.

===== Examples =====
In most contexts, leading underscores are also better avoided. For example, these are valid identifiers:

* &lt;code&gt;'''i'''&lt;/code&gt; ''loop value''
* &lt;code&gt;'''numberOfCharacters'''&lt;/code&gt; ''number of characters''
* &lt;code&gt;'''number_of_chars'''&lt;/code&gt; ''number of characters''
* &lt;code&gt;'''num_chars'''&lt;/code&gt; ''number of characters''
* &lt;code&gt;'''get_number_of_characters()'''&lt;/code&gt; ''get the number of characters''
* &lt;code&gt;'''get_number_of_chars()'''&lt;/code&gt; ''get the number of characters''
* &lt;code&gt;'''is_character_limit()'''&lt;/code&gt; ''is this the character limit?''
* &lt;code&gt;'''is_char_limit()'''&lt;/code&gt; ''is this the character limit?''
* &lt;code&gt;'''character_max()'''&lt;/code&gt; ''maximum number of a character''
* &lt;code&gt;'''charMax()'''&lt;/code&gt; ''maximum number of a character''
* &lt;code&gt;'''CharMin()'''&lt;/code&gt; ''minimum number of a character''

These are also valid identifiers but can you tell what they mean?:
* &lt;code&gt;'''num1'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''do_this()'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''g()'''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''hxq'''&lt;/code&gt;

The following are valid identifiers but better avoided:
* &lt;code&gt;'''_num'''&lt;/code&gt; as it could be used by the compiler/system headers
* &lt;code&gt;'''num__chars'''&lt;/code&gt; ''as it could be used by the compiler/system headers''
* &lt;code&gt;'''main'''&lt;/code&gt; ''as there is potential for confusion''
* &lt;code&gt;'''cout'''&lt;/code&gt; ''as there is potential for confusion''

The following are not valid identifiers:
* &lt;code&gt;'''if'''&lt;/code&gt; ''as it is a keyword''
* &lt;code&gt;'''4nums'''&lt;/code&gt; ''as it starts with a digit''
* &lt;code&gt;'''number of characters'''&lt;/code&gt; ''as spaces are not allowed within an identifier''

Hi. Have a seat. This page is a lounge.

Would you like a cup o coffee?

There is more about me in my user page in Wikiversidade (portuguese). I am a tutor on two courses there: Introduction to Beekeeping, and, Introduction to Artistic Practices. I also contribute in Wikipedia English, and Portuguese.

My main goal in English Wikibooks is to learn Dutch. As I learn from zero, meanwhile I will try to collaborate with two projects: the Dutch language wikibook, and to Introduction to the Dutch language, in Wikiversity.

A little about me; I lived in Germany for 11 years, and spoke fluent German, but now I live in Canada, and my English surpasses my German.
I hope to contribute to [[German]], and I'll see how much of it I remember.

Notes on [[German]]

[[German/About]]

==Comments==
I really like the way http://www.mangolanguages.com/ introduces you to the languages, showing you common phrases, telling you what they mean, then telling you the words they're constructed from, then translating them individually. (what I don't like about mangolanguages are the prices $160 FOR 3 MONTHS are you serious??)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For example, there's a debate, should we use ''Mein Name ist'' or ''Ich heiße''. I would gladly display both and say:
*&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Mein&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;ist&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;My&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Ich&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;heiße&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;I'm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;called&lt;/span&gt;
(note, the colours are actually what ML used, or maybe it was highlighting? w/e) The downside is making this look alright is difficult, and another is the formatting:
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;My&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
a whole line for 3 words of printed dialog. Not efficient.&lt;br&gt;
:Hmm, may I comment here? My thoughts on &quot;Mein Name ist ...&quot;: it's correct German, you will be understood, but hardly any German ever talks this way. Thus, if you learn &quot;Mein Name ist ...&quot; and you speak to Germans in German you will sound funny and you won't understand what the Germans are saying (because they are going to use &quot;Ich heiße ...&quot;). Thus, for actually learning to talk and understand German you should learn &quot;heißen&quot;. Teaching &quot;Mein Name ist ...&quot; makes things more complicated than they are by pretending that there is a choice where there in reality isn't. (When language students are given this type of choice they always ask, when to use which? And do I have to learn both? The answer here is very clear: you always use &quot;heißen&quot;; you don't have to learn &quot;Mein Name ist ...&quot;.) But there are arguments in favor of &quot;Mein Name ist ...&quot;: it is easier to understand and remember for English speakers and you learn quite a few very important words (&quot;mein&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;ist&quot;). But these advantages are lost when you try to teach both alternatives. Thus, I would stick to &quot;Ich heiße ....&quot;

:I think a blue font color indicates a hyperlink and a red font color indicates a broken hyperlink. That's the standard and it might be a good idea to stick to it. Thus, I would rather prefer to use italics, bold type, underlining, or a different background color to mark different parts of language. For beginners it's often good to have a word-by-word translation. The best format for that might be to put the translation below each word in a table (see for example: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_newbie_lesson_A0001#Dialogue_with_Translation]) .--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 12:13, 22 January 2011 (UTC)

I don't exactly plan on changing anything drastic because this book is already stuck in development hell (7 years of activity, and we're halfway done? srsly guys?), so might as well help the place finish, as is. Maybe my notes can help [[BLL German]], or some shmuck who wishes to change the book from the ground up, then leave it hanging halfway through. It's not like I blame you guys, you aren't being paid, but maybe sometimes people overestimate the power of the crowd.

:I think the problem is rather that people underestimate the time that is needed to write books (or even just to &quot;finish&quot; them). :) Good luck! --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 12:13, 22 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Coordinate axes ==
Hallo, and thanks for your suggestions. I've changed the page [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Understanding Coordinates|Understanding Coordinates]], I hope it is better now. I think that all 3D programs use a right handed system, only the name for the views are different. 


If you like to contribute to the book you can do that in a lot of different ways. I've just begun to write here, I've noticed that many tutorials are incomplete or outdated. So I will begin at the beginning and work my way through the book (with a small focus at the particle system and softbodys, because I have written several German tutorials on the topics that I will translate). --[[User:SoylentGreen|SoylentGreen]] ([[User talk:SoylentGreen|talk]]) 20:57, 8 March 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Wikibooks.

Please sign up for a  free account so that we can still reach you when your IP address changes.

Also, please note that we are writing textbooks on this site; as such, your repeated answering of the study questions in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter|the Muggles' Guide]] is counter-productive. Study questions are there for the eventual users of these texts, specifically to aid their understanding of the text. Additionally, we are making an effort to not put spoilers in the text, so as to allow someone who is reading the text for the first time to be able to use the Guide in parallel with his reading.

Contributions are always welcomed, but we would prefer that they enhance the text's usability, rather than hinder it. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:00, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

== Changes to Muggles' Guide / Order of the Phoenix / Chapter 38 ==

I have to say, once more, that it would be a lot easier to discuss changes with you if you had an actual user name, as IP addresses are likely to change and I have no idea if I'm talking to the same editor as the one who actually made the changes in question. Additionally, with only an IP you won't reliably get notices of changes on your talk page. Finally, it seems you only visit very occasionally, once a month or so based on your edit log, which makes it very difficult to continue a conversation.

Your comment on your change to OotP:38, that it is not wishful thinking, is basically what the text said that you removed. &quot;While this '''may seem like''' wishful thinking...&quot; with the implication that it is not, in fact, anything of the sort. I have tentatively accepted the changes, but feel that they weaken the feel overall and am not ruling out reverting them at a later date.
